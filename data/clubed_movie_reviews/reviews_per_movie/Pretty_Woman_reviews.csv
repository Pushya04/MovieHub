Pure escapism.,"Edward Lewis needs a prostitute to accompany him to a few business meetings, he employs Vivian Ward, but unexpectedly he falls in love with her.It's nonsense, I get that, but some of the reviewers are taking it all too seriously, and way too literally, it's just an enjoyable fantasy romance drama, headed up by two glorious, beautiful people.I get the whole, if Disney made prostitutes, it would be Vivian thing, but come on, it's a little bit of escapism, and who wouldn't have wanted to be wined and dined by Edward.The iconic scene is the moment in the clothes shop, it's a scene I think that many of us can relate to, who among us hasn't gone into a store feeling a little out of sorts, maybe a little scruffy and felt awkward by a superior being.Still my favourite Julia Roberts film, she looks spellbinding, and is just wonderful as Vivian. As for Here, no words.I'd watch this over a bit of Marvel nonsense any day of the week, and that soundtrack is spot on.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"88"" of therapy!!","""the bad stuff is easier to believe. you ever notice that?"" - vivianok, so pretty woman is a romantic movie, its cliched, its corny, its sappy. but hey, beyond all that is a special movie with some very special performances. julia roberts as vivian ward is absolutely adorable, one of the most lovable characters of alltime. and those long legs help - like she says - "" 88"" of therapy for the bargain price of $3000""the movie has many memorable lines and if you fall in love with the movie you will go back to it again and again. this is easily the best romantic comedy movie of the 90s. though many movies have hence tried to recreate its charm, nothing has quite succeeded to replace this movie as the pinnacle of the genre.and this ofcourse is high praise from someone who hates the genre. the story ofcourse is very predictable and cinderella like. however this is beautifully told and the on-screen chemistry between the very dashing richard gere and julia roberts is simply sensational. an absolute must for fans of romance, comedy, any kind of light hearted movies or for those who are big fans of julia or richard. watch this movie.an enjoyable 8!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Still one of the best rom coms ever,"The combination of appealing leads, killer chemistry, and a banging soundtrack makes Pretty Woman a highly enjoyable film.

The Last Gasp for 1980s Style Flair.,"Pure Hollywood fluff story that is so smart and sports such a dynamite cast that it becomes one of the more wonderful films of the period. ""Pretty Woman"" is pop culture at its finest as Julia Roberts (in an Oscar-nominated, icon-making role) is a prostitute on the mean streets of Los Angeles who gets a big financial break one night when she meets up with cold, but lonely business guru Richard Gere. They immediately create a bond and have a night of passion which soon becomes a week-long partnership with Gere and Roberts posing as love interests (and of course $3000 is involved as well). Could it be possible that Roberts, a lady with a heart of gold in spite of her background, is just the thing Gere has been needing in his life? A trumped-up adult-oriented version of ""Cinderella"" is probably the best way to describe ""Pretty Woman"". The old Hollywood story gets a glossy new look thanks to director Garry Marshall (doing arguably his finest film-making work). Gere and Roberts make for one of the more attractive pairs the cinema has ever seen. They just shine beacons of light on one another it seems. The fact that both are very good performers definitely enhance their appearances though. A smashing soundtrack and that vivid 1980s style (even though this was released in 1990) make ""Pretty Woman"" one of the big winners of the last few years. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Romance
Redemption in Rodeo Drive,"Look where we were in 1990. No wonder we are were we are in 2017. The movie is charming enough with a splendid Julia Roberts becoming a huge movie star but, I have to say, watching it now gave me shivers. This is not Pygmalion, no, there is no insight, it's all superficial to a cringing degree. She finds redemption through her shopping and his credit cards. Isn't that lovely? It feels so insane that maybe that means we're evolving. - I saw Pretty Woman last night with a group who had never seen it before. Funny thing the young conservative, Christian women loved it - They didn't seem to mind the message of sex and money. The young Liberal women found it absurd, offensive and the charm of the film, dangerously misleading. They left long before the happy ending. Movies become historical documents, don't they.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just has that special something....,"What is it about this movie that made it such an instant mega smash when it was released? I'm not sure if it's The incredible chemistry between Gear and Roberts, the smart dialog, the storyline-combination of all of the above-etc etc. But I do think These days, so few GREAT romantic comedies get made. Pretty woman is great. I enjoyed every moment of this and have seen it many times.I haven't read any IMDb reviews of this yet, I wanted to comment first. This is a lovely story of hope and the true purity of falling madly in love-there are so many movies that try to be romantic and inevitably come across looking forced and contrived. The story and acting in Pretty woman, while very obviously being ""Hollywood"" to a tee, are so natural and free flowing, that it's just a joy to watch this. It's also great to see(in what's not usually the case) a romantic comedy that gets it right, in every area from casting to dialog to pretty much everything from start to finish. Great movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hector Elizondo is the star,"Romantic film, nice music, interesting plot, fine beautiful actress, (Mrs. Roberts) and handsome actor, (Mr. Gere) in prime roles, a success story from the very beginning. But, although I am enjoying movies like that, I would never rate this one as 9. The difference (and the extra points) is made by the secondary role actor Mr. Elizondo! I saw him, for the first time, in a rather extreme and rather stupid drama/comedy ""Young doctors in love"" (1982) and I was impressed by his acting performance. In ""Pretty woman"" he is the absolute star. The script supported his role, of course, but the talent is indisputable.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Julia Does Hollywood (And Richard Gere),"The movie that made Julia Roberts a star and brought hope to hookers everywhere.Many condemned this movie as an irresponsible and inappropriate Cinderella fantasy, only proving how stupid they were to take a movie like this seriously enough to protest in the first place.Hell, if hookers actually looked like Julia Roberts, I might be tempted to dabble in the flesh trade myself. Unfortunatelty, most of them look more like Jason Alexander.Entertaining, harmless and mostly forgettable.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hugely entertaining film.,"Pretty Woman is a very entertaining film indeed. However, for me, it isn't completely perfect, there were times when the script could have been developed a LITTLE more, and the film itself is a bit on the long side. But overall, you have a charming and entertaining movie. Richard Gere is a charming lead, and I do find him charming in everything he's in. Julia Roberts is wonderful also as Vivienne Ward, a beautiful but down on her luck sort of woman. I will confess I am not a Julia Roberts fan, but she put a lot into this film, and it showed. I was also really impressed with the supporting performances from Jason Alexander, Ralph Bellamy and Hector Elizondo. The film also has some excellent camera-work and well-intentioned direction, with a very lovely scene in the opera house, showing La Traviata, one of the world's saddest operas. The script, while a little frothy and contrived at times, still had a lot of humour and heart. Overall, I really liked this film, it made me feel good, like it promised. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Only In Hollywood Movies Do Hookers Look Like This,"This was the ultimate example of Hollywood glorifying prostitutes and showing them to be gorgeous (and basically good-hearted) women. I do NOT speak from experience but from number of real-life cop-friends I can tell you this: you average hooker looks the OPPOSITE of Julia Roberts (or Melanie Griffth or Elizabeth Shue and all the rest of the hooker-hotties Hollywood throws at us.)Hokey? Definitely, but it's still a fun movie which has entertained most people who have watched it the past 15 years. Roberts and Richard Gere certainly make a handsome couple. Hector Elizondo almost steals the show with his minor role as ""Barney,"" the hotel manager. He is definitely the most humorous character in the film.It's a funny, charming and romantic film that was a big hit. Just don't believe it when Hollywood continues to glamorize the worst aspects of society, something it always does.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Anyone else watchin in 2022?,"So it was a cute movie. I can not Say i was impressed. Jullia Roberts a real beauty i might Say, but At the end i understood why they do not kiss, coz they do not have the talent for a romantic kiss haha. But the Story was cute, she was ok, the transition to Being educated was too quick though, i Felt that her change was too abrupt, maybe should have been more Smooth. I Also think it would have been nice to have a bit of back Story on Both of them. It was a bit too focus on their interaction as a couple not on individual as well.

"Different ratings,then and now","I saw this film in the theater,Spring of 1990. I was eighteen at the time(do the math!),and so that may've affected how I felt about the movie then,because asked then how I would've rated it,I probably would've given it a ten. Nine at the lowest.Mostly,I was in love with Julia Roberts at the time,and why not? She was a rising young star at the time,effervescent and able to absolutely run with this film the way Barry Sanders or Emmitt Smith(American footballers for those of you reading not from the US or don't follow the NFL or sports in general)could run with the pigskin.Also,I loved how the Cinderella story was played with not too much sentiment(up until the last fifteen minutes,of course)and a lot of humor. Richard Gere seemed to make a good,sober counterbalance to Miss Roberts' earthy,relaxed persona,as well.Looking back on it now and having re-watched it a number of times,the film loses points with me on two levels. One,I've become increasingly annoyed with director Garry Marshall's style,which seems to be intent on making the world believe that fairy tales are everywhere and love is the natural storybook end to EVERY relationship. Second,I think this story is SO Hollywood sanitized that what it lacks in a particularly plausible storyline in tries to make up for in attractive,glossed up casting(I betting it's pretty tough to find a hooker ANYWHERE who looks as good as a young Julia Roberts!)and a sugary sweet ending.It was good enough for me back when I was young and hadn't seen as many films,not so good now.Not to mention making a capable comic foil actor such as Jason Alexander so one-dimensional that it makes you wonder how he scored the ""Seinfeld"" gig!Still,I find it to be charming and reasonably(albeit shamelessly) entertaining enough to watch it again,which I have since I actually own a copy of the film.Keep in mind,that,too,was something I got as a gift,when(you guessed it)I was eighteen.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Very funny, heart-warming, romantic film with star-studded performances","Wow! Richard Gere and Julia Roberts give magical performances as a shrewd businessman and a lovely prostitute. I was really moved by the blend of humor and romance. The romance was what really moved me. I thought that Edward (Richard Gere) and Vivian (Julia Roberts) looked good in the attire they wore to the opera in San Francisco. Oh, boy, if you ask me, Julia Roberts did, indeed, look like a pretty woman in this movie. PRETTY WOMAN really tugged at my heart and soul and made me laugh at times. Don't say I have a twisted sense of humor, but I laughed really hard when Edward yelled at Stuckey (Jason Alexander) to get out of his hotel room. If I ever travel to Beverly Hills, I'm going to stay at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, that is, if I can afford it. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I think Richard Gere and Julia Roberts each deserved an Academy Award for their performances. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this star-studded hit to anyone who's a fan of Richard Gere or Julia Roberts. You'll laugh, you might cry, you'll be touched, and you'll want to see this box-office smash over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty Woman,"""Lewis"" (Richard Gere) is a ruthless merger merchant who loves nothing better than a lucrative deal that will line his pockets regardless of the impact on anyone else. He arrives in town and has a one-night stand with call girl ""Vivian"" (Julia Roberts). He likes her, she likes him - so he decides that she can stay on. Maybe help him out with a few formally social occasions where she can smile and stay schtum? To that end, he gives her a credit card so she can go shop to look the part, and that's when we discover that this girl is no pushover. Despite his rigidity, ""Lewis"" starts to realise that he's beginning to fall for her, despite her unsavoury provenance but what happens next? The story is simply constructed and fairly predictable, but there is loads of chemistry on display between a more relaxed and natural looking Gere and an on-form Roberts. Hector Elizondo also chips in well as the hotel manager who also begins to fall for her charms and who can ever forget the saleswoman (Dey Young) who judges a book by it's cover and loses out on some mega-commission. The writing is sparing, but funny and observational of a society that judges relentlessly without ever really taking any time to get to know the people it is harshest to. Roberts offers us a cheekily endearing and spirited character that just belongs in that stretched limousine. Good fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Wonderful Cinderella / Pygmalion tale, hooker style","What can I say that hasn't been said? This immensely popular, modern fairy tale romance is a fantastic 'feel good' must see. I can't resist watching it every single time it comes on TV. To tempt you if you haven't seen it...it's the story of a feisty, good hearted hooker named Vivian Ward, who is hired for a week by a wealthy businessman, Edward Lewis, to serve as his escort at a number of business related social functions. Needless to say, the relationship doesn't stay 'just business' for long.Rather than the plot itself, the beautiful Julia Roberts makes this movie...and not simply because of her 88 inches of leg! Always endearing in her roles, she is at her absolute MOST endearing portraying Vivian in this picture. She brings a real vulnerability to the role, showing us that just like everyone else, prostitutes do indeed floss their teeth! Richard Gere pulls off quite convincingly the role of Edward, the ruthless, calculating millionaire businessman, who takes over companies only to sell them off piece by piece, quite unmindful of the interests of any people involved. To give Gere credit, I was quite impressed that he actually plays the piano in one of the movie's scenes.Naturally, given Vivian's membership in the 'oldest profession', there is sex early on...though I, old fashioned and strict as I am, wouldn't hesitate to let my young teen see this movie. (There's worse in TV commercials today!) Oddly, the most truly intimate moment in this film is not during the more explicit sex but rather, simply a kiss.Ohhhh, lots of romantic scenes, from a picnic in the park to jetting off in a private plane for a Big Night on the Town. And etiquette lessons...Vivian displays charming, amusing, curious innocence when she experiences with Edward her first opera (all the while looking knock out gorgeous in a stunning red gown), her first polo match, and her introduction to escargots. As the movie progresses, she is transformed Pygmalion style, from the street smart hooker provocatively dressed in tall black boots and mini skirt, to a sophisticated looking, elegantly gowned and coiffed young lady. But it's merely appearance...Vivian's heart of gold and her vulnerability both remain unchanged.The status conscious snobbery of Beverly Hills dress shops and ritzy hotels, judging people by wealth and class, is well depicted here. When Vivian goes shopping for a 'more appropriate' wardrobe at some exclusive Rodeo Drive boutiques, she is not 'well received' by the sales ladies, who like all too many of us, are overly inclined to judge by appearance. You'll want these snobs to get their comeuppance. Actually, perhaps the most touching relationship in this entire film is the one between Vivian and Barney, the quite proper but kind desk manager at the high class hotel (where she is sharing a penthouse suite with Edward), who is able to see beyond appearance. He develops a genuine fondness and even more importantly, respect for her.Other characters of interest...Kit is Vivian's appealing and sympathetic room-mate, also a hooker (Vivian's a loyal friend), and Stuckey is Edward's sleazy and despicable business colleague, portrayed by Seinfeld's Jason Alexander, a TV show which I must confess is not my favourite.As events unfold during the film, it becomes clear that, while Edward might not understand too clearly the meaning of 'prostitution', Vivian clearly does. And, it's another shining film illustration of that pearl of wisdom from Eliza Doolittle (of My Fair Lady) who enlightened us, 'The difference between a flower girl and a lady is not how she behaves, but how she is treated.' Or, in Vivian's own words, 'People put you down enough, you start to believe it'.Great Cinderella movie...don't miss it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A great love story,"Sometimes you have a romantic comedy that is remembered for a long time. Movies with Audrey Hepburn, 'When Harry Met Sally...', little parts from other Meg Ryan-movies and... 'Pretty Woman'. Of course we have the famous song and the real launch of the Julia Roberts career that help a little but it just is one sweet and very funny movie.Julia Roberts is great in romantic comedies and especially with this movie (and 'Notting Hill') she proves this. With Richard Gere she has a perfect chemistry and in the end that is all we want to see. That Roberts is a prostitute and Gere a very rich man, living in a penthouse, make things only more interesting, joke-wise. One of the better romantic comedies made in the past and definitely one to watch again. And again. And may be again.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Who knew it was so much fun to be a hooker?   :-/,"I had to use that tag line as my summary because I only saw it printed in black and white just now, and I couldn't believe that anyone exists who has enough chutzpah to consider using it! That's Hollywood for you, I suppose... How to commit a marketing bungle in one simple step.Anyway, that hideous misjudgement is one of the only things that ""Pretty Woman"" gets wrong. It knows it's a fairytale and perfectly casts its own princess and Prince Charming to tell it. Most would agree that there's such a genuine innocence and sweetness about Julia Roberts when she smiles that it's easy to overlook how she's worlds away from the typical mold of a streetwalker.Don't worry though, not everyone in this story is so gosh-darn wholesome. Sarcastic best friend Kit and snivelling little worm Stuckey are on hand to ground proceedings in reality at least a little bit. Kit in particular is a memorable confidante for our heroine, and makes me reflect that it's a hearty shame Laura San Giacomo never became a bigger star.It's so gladdening to find a film that knows its characters so well that it can make us see past their profession and appreciate them as people. I have a feeling that the personalities involved hold the secret to the delightful charm it possesses, too.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ridiculous,"Anyone who has ever seen women working the streets in person, or even in a documentary on TV, should find this film to be ridiculous. They are living a wretched existence, usually to support a drug habit or an abusive pimp or both.

And, yeah, right, a multi-millionaire venture capitalist is going to bed down with a street walker.

"Such a dream, just you DO NOT think","Obviously similar to Shaw's ""Pygmalion"", but updated, more modern.A lovely dream, one very old: rescuing a prostitute from the street. (Not in Woody Allen's sickish-moody way.)However, if you wish to dream this one, be sure you do NOT start to think very logically . . . She is healthy, not on drugs, not on alcohol, not even a smoker; no syphilis, no gonorrhea, no AIDS wounds on her legs, nothing, she is just perfectly absolutely healthy. Body and mind. She is not a criminal, not inclined to steal anything, she even values love and dignity more than money. Oh, she has no pimp, who would be the other man (other than Richard Gere) in her life; nobody to protect her from smart types who walk off without paying; the pimp would explode the whole romance instantly. (Instead, a girl friend.)She has a golden soul, full of goodness, and loves art, and feels for art. High-society types around them appear silly, artificial, stuffy. (Different forks.) She is natural. She even was a good student (!) and . . . might be again? She loves to bathe, and half the time we see her happy in the bath tub (which is a powerful signal and symbol for CLEAN, CLEAN; she even sings so super-ultra-charmingly in the bath; she wants to wash off the foolishness of her previous few months of street.

A lot better than I expected,"Pretty Woman is one of those films that I've always known about since my childhood but never actually watched. I expected something boring but still wanted to see it just because I've known the iconic poster image so long. I'm also aware that there's some controversy around this movie, so I was quite curious to actually see what's the fuss all about.All right, I must say that the movie was better than I expect in every possible sense. The comedy was funny, the romantic side was nice, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts both which aren't my favorites make pretty good performances here and there is great chemistry between them. Also many of the minor characters like the hotel employees are funny and memorable.The accusations that this film makes prostitution look like a cool thing... I don't know about that. Any way you look at this movie it's a fantasy, a fairy tale. No one in their right mind should think that this film portrays real life. No more than, say, Home Alone is realistic. If anything, I think, Pretty Woman glorifies rich upper class lifestyle. But that's okay because that's what you want to see - - characters with a lot of money can afford to be sharp dressed and cool.I like how the characters evolve along the way. Nothing super deep but it's enough to make an enjoyable movie experience. Romantic comedies are a genre that somehow in the very core is a bit dumb...but if you're ok with that, I think this is a pretty (how many times can I say pretty?) fun movie. For some reason I'm completely ok with watching ridiculously stupid action movies but find it a bit hard to admit that I also like romantic comedies sometimes. But it's good to some have variety in stupid movies, and this is not even the stupidest. I like it!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cinderella Working The Streets,"Julia Roberts got her first Best Actress nomination for Pretty Woman where she plays a working girl who has a chance meeting with an Eighties economic entrepreneur played elegantly by Richard Gere. When you think about the film, it's an absolutely unreal fantasy, but carried off brilliantly by the charm of its leads.It's one of those chance meetings as Roberts is looking to pay her's and roommate Laura San Giacomo's rent. Gere gets himself lost in Hollywood on the way to Beverly Hills and stops and asks Roberts for directions. Those kind of instructions she doesn't normally give, but incredibly enough they hit it off and Gere brings her back to his penthouse suite at the Regent Beverly Hotel. I'm not sure there is such a place in real life.Turns out he needs her for a business date as he's negotiating with Ralph Bellamy and Alex Hyde-White for their company. Gere essentially does what Danny DeVito does in Other People's Money, but with a little more class. But with lube or not, Bellamy and Hyde-White aren't taking this one without a fight.Julia's character is part Pygmalion, part Cinderella and who would think she would find as a fairy godfather Hector Elizondo, manager of the Regent Beverly. Normally his job would be to throw working girls out of the place, but Elizondo is charmed by her as everyone else.Pretty Woman marked the farewell appearance of Ralph Bellamy who made his film debut in 1931. Unlike so many of his contemporaries, Bellamy kept going right up to the end when a lot of them were forcibly retired due to the collapse of the studio system. Bellamy to his credit also never did garbage strictly for a paycheck as some others did.One other interesting character of note is Jason Alexander known to most as George Costanza of Seinfeld. Costanza's a pretty smarmy character in his own right, but Alexander who plays Gere's lawyer makes Costanza look like an Eagle Scout.In Pretty Woman, both Roberts and Gere learn some valuable life lessons from each other. And the audience will learn a couple also if they get to view Pretty Woman.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great Fun,"Pretty Woman (1990)*** 1/2 (out of 4)A billionaire (Richard Gere) gets lost on his way to Beverly Hills and asks a prostitute (Julia Roberts) for directions. They spend the night together and then the hooker gets a business offer: spend the week with him for $3,000. While the deal starts off simply as a business one it slowly starts to change when they begin to have feelings for one another. This film will always have a nostalgic place in my heart as it was one of the first movies I watched by myself at the theater. I must have been somewhere over ten-years-old and I think I ended up watching this thing five times. It's been at least a decade since I last watched it and I'm happy that the film really lived up to my fond memories of it. It's somewhat strange watching the movie today knowing that Roberts turned into a major star because there was something special seeing her character back when it was just a character being played by a rather unknown actress. She certainly has the charm and smile that makes this film work so well. Another key is that the movie, even though it deals with hookers, is very innocent in nature. The film has an innocent charm running through it where it comes off like a fairy tale more than anything else. The film has a very good soundtrack, which is another plus as is Marshall's direction, which manages to handle the comedy and some of the more dramatic moments very well. The real key though are the performances by Gere and Roberts. The two have wonderful charm together and you can't help but believe them in both of their roles. Gere was certainly made to play a role like this as he certainly has the looks that women want but he also has the charm. The charm he brings to his character is what really stands out. Roberts also has that charm and seeing the two of them work together certainly is magic. It's also nice seeing Ralph Bellamy in his few scenes. I think the final act could have been trimmed by several minutes since we know what's going to happen but other than that this is a highly entertaining and charming film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good romantic comedy that seems to me to have been undermined by some prejudice against the oldest profession in the world.,"Vivan is a street prostitute. We know almost nothing of her life, nor the reasons why she has taken the path of prostitution, but she is notoriously beautiful and stands out among the other girls who, along with her, wait for anyone who wants them. By chance, his path intersects with that of Edward Lewis, a millionaire who made a fortune buying and dismantling failed companies. We are not sure why he decides to hire her, it seems like a decision made at the moment ... but the fact is that he changes her life in a way that reminds me of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" ...This romantic comedy departs from rather unrealistic assumptions. Even millionaires who hire prostitutes do not usually go to the streets to look for or relate to them. On the other hand, a street prostitute would never look as clean and immaculate as Julia Roberts in this movie. Here are some flaws in realism that can compromise history, depending on how important each one gives them. But ultimately, it's a dream movie. ""What's your dream? Everyone in Los Angeles has a dream."" That's what a man on the streets says during the movie, and that can almost be the moral of the story: there are dreams that, with a touch of luck, can come true.I loved Julia Roberts's performance ... this movie helped the actress jump to stardom, which was pretty fair. She has talent and presence, as we will see in later films (Notting Hill, Erin Brockovich, etc.). Richard Gere makes a good romantic pair with her and is credible in the role of a millionaire who has failed in love and seems in need of female attention. Both dominate the movie and bring the best moments to life, ranging from romantic and moving scenes to the hilarious ones we can see. Next to them, a capable but discreet secondary cast, where Hector Elizondo stands in the role of a rigid and professional hotel manager.I think this movie has always been a risky gamble, if only because of the strong prejudice society still holds towards prostitution. And I believe some have written harsh criticism of this movie just for involving a prostitute in the story. But prostitutes are not vile, polluted and sick creatures who must live on the fringes of society. Often its women (and men) who have had no luck in life, or made the wrong choices, or immigrants who have been deceived and are trying to make money without harming anyone, often under the cruel dictatorship of pimps who only think about profits. Glamorizing prostitution is a mistake, but diabolizing is even worse. It is a sign of a small mind and lack of Christian values and empathy for those who have been less fortunate than us. Worse than living off making money with one's own body is killing or stealing, and there is no shortage of films that glamorize theft and murder without anyone caring about it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another illusory movie,"Well, I'm a woman, and legend has it that every woman wants one day meet her millionaire prince charming, because then she will be happy forever. I disagree vehemently with that belief and that's why I hated Pretty Woman. First of all, why not portray the life of a street prostitute like for real? I don't see problems in show a friendly, playful and hardworking prostitute. But why hide the routine of aggression and constant violence that these woman suffer? Pretty Woman ignores these important and essential aspects completely. And then we enter the most serious part, the old lie ""The Man saves the woman of the streets."" Why not show the reality, that is: in the life of a real prostitute, the men overwhelmingly are the PROBLEM, not the salvation.I'm not criticizing love. There are many prostitutes fall in love in real life. But why the guy she loves needs to be a millionaire? The good guy of the film could be an average man, but who loved her and had good intentions. But no, of course not! After all Hollywood need to perpetuate the lie that a person can only find true happiness when becoming a MILLIONAIRE or marrying a MILLIONAIRE. Moreover, the movie show a very conservative and confortable plot, where Vivian Ward, a prostitute, be seen sleeping exclusively with Edward Lewis, it's literally a monogamous relationship, she don't have sex with any other guy, she doesn't use drugs, she has no past trauma. Oh Really? She didn't have a pimp, too. Of course, another man in the area would ruin the Hollywood romantic dream. This movie is too unreal, pass messages too materialists to the public, and think it's an insult to all women who prostitute themselves in the streets and peripheries.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beauty always trumps the top Human Ideals,"PRETTYWOMANas poor thesis for humanity As long as we are talking about women, beauty, etc., I thought I would bring up my singular position as actually having HATED the movie ""Pretty Woman"" as opposed to everyone else I talk to. The movie ""Pretty Woman"" appears to do injustice to the realistic expectations of our youth in the sense that this movie preyed upon the sensual powers of attraction that physical beauty has over the intellect and other non-physical attributes which, on the other hand, truly are the foundations for the ideal man and woman relationships. When it was said, ""It must be difficult leaving something so beautiful"" (this being a $250,000 necklace as a concrete representation of a beautiful woman) such placement of beauty on a pedestal lends to the difficulty of maintaining one's grasp of the conventional ideal that a well-educated person, amongst other ideals, is to be placed on the pinnacle of desirability. After all, beauty of the human being does not take outstanding craftsmanship as needed to create such a necklace....nor does a naturally beautiful person require any major toil and effort on the part of many to obtain the raw materials for these craftsmen. Rather, quite simply, this beautiful woman symbolizes the antithesis of all requisite efforts that must come together to create and produce wealth of mankind. In short, random luck provides a particular human being with an attractive appearance that trumps all other ideals that we hold as more important. The powerful, intellectual, and educated man's (Richard Gere's character) choice for this woman (Julia Robert's character) primarily on beauty alone, tends to denigrate all of the human effort to rise above our baseline naivete and ignorance. With all of his character's accomplishment, why does he not seek out a woman who has climbed Mt Kilimanjaro, collected high level degrees, and started her own successful company, etc.? This film captures the dilemma for man---that, in spite of our ideal of becoming honest in the sense of Ayn Rand's thesis (""An honest man (or woman) is one who does not consume more than he produces or creates"") and productive through the development of our minds, he still cannot resist basic God-given beauty. By the popularity of this movie, I think it points out this phenomenon, and furthermore tends to promote beauty over the other ideals. In fact, there are masses of achievers and educated individuals who successfully ward off the temptations of beauty and choose the attractiveness of a well-developed mind and on-going accomplishment. To me, this movie seems to help perpetuate the sophomoric and juvenile concept that beauty, romantic relationships, and self-directed pleasure rather than development of God-given potential are all that life is about. One might say that this movie gives the beautiful person (as well as the person who perceives oneself as such) a mistaken notion, or at least a temptation, to rely solely on that beauty and to ultimately cash in on it and as a result live a superficial meaningless life, without ever achieving one's God-given potential.

Lots of audience-pleasing elements... but it works!,"One of the great classics of romantic cinema from the end of the last century, boasts that its labels were well earned.His most precious resource is performances. Julia Roberts stands out as the crown jewel in a script that's good looking, albeit with a couple of weak internal gears. During the second act, the conflict takes time to arrive and when it does it is something forced and without much sense. Luckily the charm of Roberts and the gallantry of Richard Gere come to the fore to cover those small holes that saved an elegant ship from shipwreck.The rest of the technical aspects are correct, without highlighting much.Overall, it's an entertaining film, with plenty of audience-pleasing elements, and it doesn't disappoint in standing up as a good Valentine's Day option.Recommended for lovers of celluloid and utopian romances.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

His Fair Lady,"Hired by a rich businessman to be his date for a week, a prostitute has to work out if the businessman is serious about his romantic advances towards her in this romantic comedy that propelled Julia Roberts to fame. A popular movie when first released, 'Pretty Woman' has received some backlash over the years for its lack of realism and indeed one has to suspend disbelief at how kind-hearted both protagonists are. There is enough snappy dialogue though to keep things moving along; ""we both screw people for money"" Richard Gere comments at one point, while his observation that ""stores are never nice to people... they're nice to credit cards"" offers some unexpected social commentary for a lighthearted film like this is. The other big plus is the talented supporting cast. Hector Elizondo is delightful in a Golden Globe nominated role as a prim and proper hotel proprietor who gradually warms towards Roberts while Jason Alexander is a lot of fun as Gere's cunning lawyer. Realism aside, the biggest issue with the film is how little Roberts changes over the course of the film. This is no 'Pygmalion' or 'My Fair Lady' tale in which we see a noticeable difference in the protagonist as a result of her experiences. Still, it is a pleasant enough movie with some really funny moments (Roberts commenting on an opera) in between the clichés.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

An entertaining modern-update of a classic fairy tale,"""Pretty Woman"" was the film that made Julia Roberts a star and a major player in Hollywood (for a while she held the record for being the highest-paid actress in Hollywood).""Pretty Woman"" is one of her better films. She plays a prostitute who's ""employed"" by a rich playboy (Richard Gere) to pose as her girlfriend for a little while. He tries to culture her and instill good taste, manners and general class; meanwhile others raise a suspicious eyebrow when she embarrasses herself in public, clearly not belonging in the upper-class group.The film follows a standard fairy-tale-style formula of an abused girl falling in love and being rescued from her old lifestyle. The movie spins this into a modern update with more relevant themes - mainly prostitution.Ironically this is one of Roberts' first movies and the only one in which she has ever revealed any nudity. Sometimes actors deliver their finest performances before they develop egos and clauses in their contracts. She dares to go out on a limb here more so than she usually does - and the movie succeeds.The direction is suitable, the soundtrack and stylings of the film are oh-so-eighties... overall it's just an entertaining, well-done romantic comedy that doesn't try to be anything it isn't.

He has all the money he needs to do whatever he wants as it regard this young woman. Of course, she is a bit coarse, but she is a little hard to believe. There seems to be no regret or disdain for where she comes from. She also seems to be an independent contractor.

One of the exceptionally few romantic comedies that are worth watching,"This is one of the very few romantic comedies that work; first of all, it has likable, non-stereotypical characters. Second, the theme and basic idea is pretty good, original and interesting. Third, the humor rarely seems forced, but rather comes naturally. The basic idea that the film is based on is a prostitute meeting a business man, and them discovering how much they actually have in common, and how easy and obvious choice it is to be together, despite their differences, mainly in career choices. That theme is pretty original, and it works great in the film. The actors have great on-screen chemistry, and are, for the most part, well casted. The plot is good, and has a pretty good pace; you're rarely bored, even on when re-watching the movie for the fourth and fifth time. The acting is good. Roberts and Gere obviously understand their characters; Roberts perfectly captures the hooker ""mentality"", and Gere portrays his character believably. I also found various of the supporting characters to be very credible, well-acted and interesting. I actually would have liked if Laura San Giacomo's character, Kit De Luca, would have had more screen-time than she did, as I found her to be one of the better and more interesting members of the supporting cast. The film, of course, has its share of romance, and ""romantic"" scenes and such, but don't let this discourage you, the male viewer who could care less about romance in movies, from watching it; the film has more comedy and humor than it has romance, and the comedy is usually entertaining. The humor is pretty good, though I guess the whole ""main character experiences a totally new world for him/her"" scenario is kind of worn out, by now. It doesn't feel too ""been there, done that"" here, though. The film made it sufficiently interesting and entertaining to watch Roberts experience how it is to be rich, or, at least, be with someone who is rich. Not much else to say... the soundtrack is pretty good too. All in all, a quite entertaining and worthwhile romantic comedy, that is worth watching, even for people who usually loathe romance in movies(like me). I recommend it to pretty much anyone who enjoys romantic comedies, comedies in general and fans of any of the actors. This is probably also a good movie to get for guys whose girlfriends demand to see a romantic comedy, and they want to be able to sit through it too. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

This movie tells the story of Vivian, a prostitute with a heart of gold, and Edward, a wealthy businessman. Their worlds collide in the most unexpected way, and what follows is an unforgettable love story. The music in ""Pretty Woman"" is amazing. Roy Orbison's song ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" is perfect for the film, and the rest of the soundtrack really adds to the mood. Every song fits just right with what's happening on screen, making the whole experience more enjoyable. The visuals in this movie are stunning. From the busy streets of Hollywood to the fancy hotels and shops, everything looks great. The cinematography really helps show the difference between Vivian's and Edward's lives, but also how they start to blend together. The way Los Angeles is shown makes it almost like another character in the story. The script is fantastic. It's funny, romantic, and touching all at the same time.

Maybe the most sickening lie ever told.,"Ken Russel made 'Whore' as a reaction on this movie.All in all, it is a movie which was done because someone found out that there was money to make on injured women, making them feel 'good' and 'experienced' over the sexual abuse they had been lured into by their vanity. You could also see the film as a commercial for prostitution. Cynically, you might agree that it's preferable to get money for the abuse instead of giving it away, but that is not the point that the movie makes, unfortunately. It's basically a Cinderella-story but 'Cinderella' in this case is a thoroughly used one and the prince is a moron. If all rich people were like him, then there would be no rich people.

The Whore With the Heart of Gold,"""Pretty Woman"" was a movie with the most screwed up morals and message in Hollywood history and that covers a lot of history and movies.

That is, unless you decide to try to fit into her life style. One way or another, there have to changes as in every coming together of two lives with two separate loads of baggage.Why do women in porn often marry men in porn?

"No, this movie does not glorify Prostitution","It seems to be in more recent years that Pretty Woman has been labeled as a film that has ""not aged well."" Who would've thought that such a loveable, lighthearted rom-com would end up being so controversial?I really enjoy Pretty Woman, you might consider it to be a guilty pleasure of mine. It's a movie where every time I rewatch it, I can't help but be charmed by it. How can you not be? I mean Julia Roberts in her prime, lord have mercy, what a gorgeous woman, but superficialities aside, she gives a wonderful performance in this movie. The chemistry she shares with Richard Gere feels so genuine and heartfelt that I can't help but smile the whole time I see them on screen together.I don't think Pretty Woman gets enough credit when it comes to how well-written the screenplay is. An example of this is when Julia Roberts's character has the rule of never kissing on the mouth. In her profession, if you kiss a client on the mouth, you risk the possibility of developing genuine feelings for them and that is not ideal for a prostitute. So throughout the movie, both Gere and Roberts are shown being physically intimate but they never kiss. Instead, the movie takes its time to build up the romance between the two characters. It's not until about an hour and thirty minutes into the movie do we get the first kiss, and because of the film's build-up, when we do get to that first kiss, the impact it makes is just sensational. It's truly one of the most romantic moments I've ever seen in a movie.One of the many criticisms that people give Pretty Woman is that the premise is too unrealistic. Well, whoever said Pretty Woman was trying to be realistic? It's essentially a modern-day fairy tale and if you go into this movie with that in mind you should be able to suspend your disbelief. The premise itself doesn't need to be realistic but the characters and the romance they share do, and that's where Pretty Woman excels.Another criticism is that this movie supposedly glorifies prostitution. Another critique that I just find to be absurd. Would any of these people say that Oceans Eleven glorifies professional heists? Or that Batman glorifies vigilantism, or would they simply say that those films are just entertaining popcorn movies? I don't understand why Pretty Woman has to be held to such a ridiculous standard when at the end of the day it's just a fun and entertaining escapist film.There are two things that a romantic comedy has to have in order for it to work. And it's right there in the title. It has to be romantic and it has to be funny. Now granted this movie is not exactly laugh-out-loud funny but it does have enough funny moments in it to put a smile on your face. Where this movie really exceeds is with its romance. The premise may not be realistic but the chemistry between Gere and Roberts very much is and that's what makes Pretty Woman such a delightful and feel-good viewing experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It Must Have Been Love,"In the mid-1980s, Vestron Video had bought a dark, gloomy script entitled ""3000"". The story concerns a young, drug-addicted Hollywood prostitute, hired by an unscrupulous businessman. The studio envisioned a low-budget movie with the completely unknown 21-year-old Julia Roberts in the lead. Unfortunately, the entire production collapsed when Vestron Video suddenly went bankrupt.Enter Touchstone Pictures, the division at Walt Disney that specializes in ""mature"" material. Director Garry Marshall liked the basic premise but decided to re-conceive it as a romantic comedy. He was inspired by the musical ""My Fair Lady"" - a story about a wealthy man who takes a poor woman from the streets of London and transforms her into a skilled, sophisticated lady. But first Marshall changed the title to ""Pretty Woman"" (he thought ""3000"" sounded like a sci-fi movie).In the film, Richard Gere plays a tough corporate mogul. On a business trip to Los Angeles, he hires a carefree hooker (Julie Roberts) to pose as his girlfriend for a week. The question is: will the couple fall in love?The management at Walt Disney was initially doubtful whether Julia Roberts was a big enough box office attraction to carry the film. However, since first Meg Ryan and then Molly Ringwald turned down the role, they decided to take a chance with the young actress. But first they had to promise Roberts that a body double would be hired for her most intimate bedroom scenes with Richard Gere.""Pretty Woman"" became one of the most unexpected blockbusters of the 1990s. It was Richard Gere's first smash hit since ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" seven years earlier, and it turned Julia Roberts into a Hollywood superstar.

"Everything, except the actors, is mediocre","I do not like romantic movies. It is just a matter of personal preference. That does not mean that there aren't some great ones (""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"" first comes to mind). But ""Pretty woman"" is not one of them.
Cinematography is nothing special, dialog is typical, occasionaly funny, character development is mostly done through characters talking about themselves... Everything screams mediocrity.
The premise is typical 90s daydreaming. A rich guy and a dream girl have sex and fall in love. He provides for her and protects her and she in turn makes him a better person. All in a week. In other words: a fairytale (even the starts mentioning fairytales near the end). It is all very cheesy and unrealistic.
Julia Roberts character is a prostitute, mostly so that the movie has some conflict (which is poorly handled). She is a good actress but she is too classy for this role. And yes the movie makes a point of that fact but it is poorly done (she cries after her FIRST opera). But the chemistry between her and Richard Geere is rather good and the best thing about this film, even though their relationship makes little sense. For example he starts to care for people instead of using them but it feels unnatural and sudden because she did not do anything to make him do so.
In the end the leading actors saved this movie from an unfavourable grade. Not good, not bad,somewhere in between. 6/10 from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
I give up! I wonder about some of the reviewers....,"This is a crowd-pleasing movie. This is an ""R"" rated film, but with a couple of changes it would certainly qualify as a PG-13. You have a smart script, film technicals, while not breathtaking, certainly are up to snuff and a likeable cast that moves to adept comedic direction.More on the script. No - it doesn't break any grounds on the material, but that's not the point of the movie. It's to tell an unusual Cinderella story. It doesn't need the reality that Roberts is a hooker. You don't deal with a real hooker's life -> if you did: 1) it wouldn't be a Cinderella story 2) It wouldn't have been as charming as it was and 3) it wouldn't have made a dime.The Julia Roberts/Richard Gere match up makes this movie. I can't even imagine any other people in these roles, nor can I imagine this movie being made without the two. Marshall's direction just puts more whipped cream on the cake and provides perfect timing for the cast.This is a perfect popcorn/coke film.

It still sucks.As a love story this sucks. As having Julia portray a street hooker, this is repulsive. To me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. She had no tough shell to her. She wasn't tortured, anguished, enraged, starving or anything else. Her ""HOOKER"" character was so flawed, like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond. The two simply don't fit, no matter what they look like.The ONLY cast I felt was worth watching was the 2 bitchy saleswomen, whom were excellently cast. They did such a fine job that I hated them for the few seconds that they were on screen. They had real definition, for the minor roles. OK, so the movie wasn't entirely trash...the two ignorant saleswomen saved the film.Aside from those two women sales people, the rest of the cast...including the big names was just crap. Either everybody was an ass-kisser or had absolutely no reason to fill any dialog in the movie aside from just complimenting Julia Roberts or kissing ass to Richard Gere.This was a movie about how when you walk around in high-heels and a tight skirt in Beverly Hills, people leer at you and guys who work in hotels gawk as if they just had a baseball bat struck to their face.While in reality, the women who are dressed to the nines in Beverly Hills are hookers and prostitutes to a higher degree, but since they aren't wearing the gaudy Madonna looking jewelry or the patent boots, they can look down on the others who do.The hotel cast was sickeningly sad to watch, and anybody who had any real character had less than a minute of screen time.This is an insult to romantic movies, comedies, dramas and even to prostitutes who face wealthy customers on a daily basis with hopes of having their lives work out perfect.The story is about Julia Roberts being PIMPED (yes PIMPED) by a multimillionaire in a business suit and limousine.She is still owned, still told how to act, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. He is more controlling than a street pimp, but the folks at Disney/buena vista butter it up to make it easier to swallow.Had Richard Gere been a black man with a gold tooth and an AK-47 at his side instead of an attaché case, this movie would be about how a woman has to struggle to get away from the harshness of prostitution. Same story, different characters will make a very different outlook.Oh yeah, change the white man for a black man or Asian or Spanish, have the land business deal be changed to a deal of weapons or narcotics and the entire concept of romantic comedy is thrown away.As far as I'm concerned, Pretty Woman is still trash, dressed with ribbons and bows.I didn't like it 15 years ago, when I didn't understand it and was led by the Hollywood hype. I hate it now that i can see past the pretty decorations that is called ""love"".This movie is NOT a romantic comedy. It's a story on how to control a woman as long as you have the means and income to do so.This is an insult to strong women, weak women and women in general, as well as to my television screen.Do I hate it? Yes. Does it suck? Yes Would I recommend it to you? NO...well maybe if I really hated you.Will this review get posted? We'll see.Anywayz, that's all for now.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tale of Two Whores,"Find your town's skid row and look for the whores. Don't hire any of them, just examine them. Do any of them look glamorous or in possession of a ""heart of gold"" or anything other than pathetic? You know where I'm going with this, don't you?Pretty Woman is the ultimate Hollywood story of a streetwalker (Julia Roberts) who just happens to be sweet and pretty and wholesome (except that she's a hooker) and how she gets hired to service a whorish corporate raider who is pretty and has a heart of gold (Richard Gere).I don't need to go into any more detail than that. Suffice it to say that somewhere after she goes down on him and he buys her a really big closetful of clothes, they fall in the sort of love that makes the girls reach for their tissues and the guys reach in their pockets, hoping that stroking their ignition keys will make the stupid and morally reprehensible movie go away.Pretty Woman is skid row gutter trash and, unfortunately, it makes the gutter in Hollywood look glamorous.",,Anonymous,Romance

Generation differences,"This movie and many others that are being praised as must watched older movies would never be allowed to be released in this time and age due to being politically correct and the fact that everyone now is super sensitive.

The Sizzling Chemistry of Gere and Roberts does the trick,"Pretty Woman is a Romantic Comedy movie directed by Garry Marshall and stars Richard Gere, Julia Roberts, Late Ralph Bellamy, Jason Alexander, Hector Elizondo and Laura San Giacomo.With a pretty predictable plot and anticipated plot the movie still manages to win your heart and will have a sweet smile on your face with bursting laughter in between almost through out the movie and the credit should be given to the sizzling chemistry between the lead pair.The acting by the lead pair is just superb and i would rate Julia Roberts a little more than Richard Gere in performance although Gere was also as impressive as Roberts but given the type of characters to play Roberts certainly has the edge.Acting by the support cast was also impressive and special mention for Hector Elizondo who plays the role of strict, dignified but kind hearted hotel manager. Screenplay is nice and will keep you engaged to the story-line with some funny and feel-good scenes, plot and climax are predictable but entertains and could be a feel-good feeling for typical love story lovers and followers.to sum up with.

This has been my favorite movie since the first time I saw it in July 1990 and will forever remain close to my heart,"Prince Charming Comes Back was the title for one of the best reviews I read for Pretty Woman back when I was only fifteen years of age. I was forbidden to see the film, my mother thinking I would instantly be standing on street corners looking for Lotuses, but I saw it anyway. Three times. When it came on video I watched it until the tape died and I needed to buy another, and another. Then, I bought a DVD player JUST for it. I've gotten into many heated discussions about how this movie degrades women and gives young girls the wrong ideas about things. But that is NOT how I look at it at all.My favorite scene in the movie is when Vivian and Edward are in bed, talking and Vivian goes on about how she ended up in Los Angeles to begin with by following a ""bum"" that her mother called her a ""bum magnet"" ""If there was a bum within a fifty mile radius I was completely attracted to him."" But the line that stuck with me the most was ""When people put you down enough you start to believe it"" and Edward replies ""I think you are a very charming, very beautiful woman"" Vivian's reply is full of emotion when she replies ""The bad stuff is easier to believe...have you ever noticed that?"" Which is true.Maybe it's just me, but I think that this movie is just a fairytale, and fairytales are there to make you believe in something that is totally unbelievable. This movie gives you hope, shows you that even if your life is miserable, that even if you are a bum magnet; if you don't give up hope a millionaire in a Lotus might be just around the corner.""Welcome to Hollywood, what's your dream? Some dreams come true, some don't, but this is Hollywood, always time for dreams so keep on dreaming"" Words that ring so true.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A modern version of Pygmalion,"""Pretty woman"" is a modern fairy tail evidently based on the story of Pygmalion (1913, George Bernard Shaw) c.q. The film ""My fair lady"" (1964, George Cukor) in which a civilezed man falls for a not so civilized woman and tries to ""cultivate"" her.In ""Pretty woman"" the civilized man is businessman Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere. The not so civilized woman is Vivian Ward played by Julia Roberts. On first sight ""Pretty woman"" is a bit more spicy because the girl from the street is in this instance a prostitute. In reality the film is real innocent nevertheless. A smart adaptation is to include a visit to the opera ""La Traviata"" (also about a client falling for a courtisane) in the educational program.Much of the charm of the Pygmalion story lies in the mutual influence of refined gentleman and woman of the street. In the first half of ""Pretty woman"" the influence seems rather one sided, nemely from gentleman to streetwalker. The reverse influence only gets going in the second half of the film.Businessman Edward Lewis plans to acquire a family business and subsequently stripping it. He would thereby destroy the lifework of the founding father of that company. Under the influence of Vivian he still wants to buy the company but gives up stripping it.The film thanks much of its success to the chemistry between arrivé Richard Gere and rising star Julia Roberts. Ten years earlier it was Richard Gere who played the gigolo in ""American Gigolo"" (1980, Paul Schrader). At the time that it really mattered , he had less luck with his client.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A winning romantic comedy.,"Garry Marshall may not be the most interesting director working in Hollywood, but his movies are definitely entertaining, and in that sense he is successful. Perhaps his two greatest films, which also are the ones he'll most likely be remembered for, are ""Beaches"" and ""Pretty Woman"". One of the most commercially successful (almost $500m worldwide!!) romantic comedies of all time,""Pretty Woman"" is a charming modern day fairy tale that works largely in part to the phenomenal on-screen chemistry between its two stars  Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. In an Academy Award nominated performance as Vivian Ward, Julia Roberts truly shines. Her screen presence is nothing short of radiating, not to mention she's a highly skilled comedic actress. The film also owes a lot to its equally strong supporting performances from Jason Alexander, Laura San Giacomo and Hector Elizondo. All clichés aside, it's highly enjoyable and stands up superbly even after repeated viewings, a definite 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A slick advertisement for prostitution that lies and lies.,"In ""Pretty Woman"" Richard Gere plays an executive attempting to acquire a shipyard so that he can tear the company into small pieces and sell it off for scrap. While he is about this dirty business, he hires a street-walking hooker played by Julia Roberts for companionship. All of this is believable until the purely-for-hire relationship with the whore turns into a warm intimate relationship that seems to change the businessman's character so much for the better that he reverses his decision to decimate the company he is preying upon and even proposes marriage to the hooker.The makers of this film would like us to forget everything we have ever learned about prostitution  that it takes place in an environment of corruption and is itself a cause of corruption, misery and disease  in favor of the absurd notion that sex for hire is a convenient, appealing and pleasurable way for couples to meet and establish a love relationship.The producers were very clever in hiring deadpan actor Richard Gere to present their false point of view to innocent viewers, because everything else about the movie smirks at the jades in the audience, not too subtly concealing its lewd in-jokes and boorish innuendo beneath a paper thin veneer of polish and elegance. Worst of all, it openly and chivalrously takes the part of prostitutes against those who may disapprove of them.""Pretty Woman"" is the type of manipulative movie that does everything it can to sell the audience on its values, without making an effort to distinguish between itself and real life. For suggestible viewers, it presents a danger that they may imitate what they see on screen, and then find out too late that real life is not anywhere near so pleasant or easy when it comes to dealing with low life criminals or the vulgar and licentious rich.I once heard a very successful and well regarded professor of screen writing remark that ""it's much better to be rich than to be poor."" Not if it means flaunting a love of vice in this disgusting manner.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

how star power can create something from nothing,Pretty woman is a romantic comedy movie released in the dawn of the 90s directed by garry marshall starring Richard gere and Julia Roberts.The film is about a highly successful rich man falling in love with a prostitute I know a lot of people should think this is just another movie about rich man poor girl romances and I am not going to deny that but if its executed well you can really enjoy it. So what is supposed to be done so we don't get a cheap cringy movie. A couple of things first a very good writing so the relationship develops well not too fast not too slow and in the same time feels real second the star power and what I mean by that is the acting we have that in the most successful sex symbol Richard gere and the academy award winner four time nominee Julia Roberts and both these two things are checked in this case Julia had a great performance which results in her second Oscar nomination first as a leading role what made her a romcom star that majorly helped in the popularity of romantic comedy movies. So why she deserves all this praise she played a prostitute who doesn't look like she want stop this work and in the same time want be someone meaningful someone who matters. And she goes and lives with a rich man and learn how to be elegant and in the same time not overlooking her real her and her old self plus she is funny and she is trying to surpress it cause its inappropriate forget the fact that despite that you still laugh anyway well the credit goes for the writer who wrote this character but the actress performed all of that without it even looking hard. So I can put more admiration to the writing we forget the fact that this story which cant be happening in real life feels real especially in the middle we see it affect not only the social life of the main character(Richard gere) but affect his career and his perspective on achievement of course this movie is far then perfect it's a little predictable through the course of it. It feels real most of the movie until it doesn't in the end.As a conclusion if you are looking for a movie that is supposedly one of the greatest of all time. That blows your mind then this isn't the one this a great light feel good movie that makes your day sweeter in bad days.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance

How to ...,"A 90s classic, that I just saw the other day. And I have to admit, it was better than expected. The romance thing worked out as expected and there are not many surprises here (nothing explicit), though you have Julia Roberts performing quite a few lewd acts. Just not visible to us, but more than hinted at.Having said that, some of the jokes are quite stiff - you know it's hard ... to do just good jokes. Now you may have gotten the innuendos and you either like them or think they are weak. But that is one of the examples of things you get from the movie. Which I probably would have rated a 7, if it weren't for the chemistry of the two leads. Don't ask too many questions, about how this may go on after the credits roll and how this will work in general.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

why pretty woman is so stupid,"This movie is really stupid because most hookers live really horrible lives & if a millionaire ever picked them up he probably just call them a slut & drop them off without paying or something.

PLus if any hooker actually looked like Julia 'claims' to look, they wouldn't bother being a hooker, they'd just go model somewhere. Basically its the worst romantic claptrap to come out of Hollywood for a long time & the only people who really go for it are latent homosexuals & depressed wives. plus no millionaire on earth is actually ever going to ask a hooker to marry him unless he is about 90 and its Anna Nicole smith. plus this crap movie doesn't work on the basis of suspension of disbelief because everyone who says its great secretly wants it to be real and to happen to them.",,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful love story 7/10,"""Pretty Woman"" is a love letter to all people out there who seek their ""fairy tale"". Just like Vivian (Roberts), everyone has his/her love story that reminds a bit of Cinderella. And so this movie is a love letter to all those people out there. It is a great, funny and fabulous movie staring Richard Gere who is good as always and Julia Roberts who is stunning and gorgeous. You also get to see Costanza in the film - I mean Jason Alexander. Sorry, reflex. I really like the difference between both characters of Gere and Roberts. How one of them is from a high class society and how the other is a smart person from a low class society. Two very different characters that fall in love with each other just like in the fairy tales. The movie has a great soundtrack that fits its tone of a romance movie in which I appreciate. Finally I think this is a great classic movie that all people with love tales should watch and have fun with, not only it was a hit back in the day but even today it's strong message can affect the viewers.

Great Movie,I've watched the movie Pretty Woman many times and must say it's a pretty good movie. Richard Gere gives a good performance as a business man named Edward Lewis who hires a prostitute named Vivian Ward to stay the week with him at his hotel for the week while he's on business. Julia Roberts I thought gave an excellent performance as Vivian and I don't think any other actress could of done it better. The rest of the cast gave good performances I thought such as Jason Alexander playing Edward's lawyer Phil and Hector Elizondo did an excellent job playing the hotel manager Barney Thompson. I also thought that the late Ralph Bellamy gave a good performance as the role of James Morse who is the owner of the company who Edward is trying to buy. The film also has very funny scenes and jokes in it one of my favorites being when Vivian's friend Kit De Luca played by Laura San Giacomo makes a comment to an old couple in the hotel. All in all the film is a great comedy fairy tale that'll be one the whole world will enjoy again and again. 10 out of 10.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An inferior Notting hill,"When looking at the filmography of Julia Roberts, two classics inevitably pop up at the top, They are two films which are very similar in plot, but vastly different in style and execution. Roberts' first massive hit was of course Pretty woman, a tremendous success at the box office and beloved by audiences then. But by far and away my favourite Julia Roberts film is 1999s Notting hill, which I feel is a better, improved version of the more workmanlike Pretty Woman. Pretty Woman's flaws are that it lacks the classic, wry, self deprecating British humour which permeates Notting Hill. It is a very formulaic, predictable Cinderella story of a prostitute and a billionaire. Such a concept may be intriguing on first sight, but the film shows it becomes predictable very quickly. There is a sort of meet cute between Edward and Vivian, Vivian struggles to adapt to the high society Edward inhabits, there is of course a contrived conflict separating the characters in the middle, and the central couple make up in the end- all pretty standard stuff. Honestly this is quite fine by me- Notting hill does too adhere to this romantic comedy formula. But the issue with Pretty woman is that it is not well written. It's screenplay is not particularly witty, and there are sections of banal dialogue which plague certain parts. The film is also not very funny, in that the situations it's characters get into are unimaginative and frankly quite boring. The movie also lacks an oft undiscussed aspect of film criticism- atmosphere. Notting hill has a magical, yet earnest atmosphere courtesy of its beautiful cinematography. Thomas Crown(another film featuring a billionaire) is splendidly slick and suave. But Pretty woman has a dated, gritty 90s aesthetic which is too dark, and not very pretty to look at. Beyond its flaws however, it is still important to recognise this as Roberts' big break. Roberts is excellent in pretty woman- she is wonderful as the strong willed, uncouth, yet gorgeous prostitute who is perfect for Edward. Richard Gerre also plays Edward well with a Harrison Ford-esque straight laced charm, though i would have preferred more comedy in his performance. Overall, I did enjoy pretty woman, but it is a dated film which is formulaic, only sometimes funny, sometimes charming, with a good Julia Roberts performance. In comparison, I found Notting Hill to be a formulaic film that holds up splendidly well today, is hilarious, and to be a film which exudes enormous charm, with an outstanding Julia Roberts performance. The problem with pretty woman then is this- that it is not Notting Hill- once you have watched Notting Hill, this films flaws becomes ever more salient.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful simplicity,"It's amazing how enjoyable this movie is when you consider that on paper it doesn't offer an original concept and it's easy to predict the end. But the journey is certainly worth it. I've been putting off watching this movie for years, because I'm not really into romantic films and I thought it would be boring. Today, more than 30 years after the release, I just started watching it and I liked every second of it. Before I knew it, the movie was finished and I was left with the feeling, ""wow, that's how a love story is told!""Part of the magic of the film is how they managed to create situations that gave us a window into how she felt and showed us what it's like to be a true gentleman and that being a real lady has nothing to do with money. The hotel manager also had an important and heartwarming role in the story. There isn't much comedy in this but there certainly are funny moments. And in any case, I think this fairs better than so many self titled romantic comedies out there. So glad I'll now be able to understand the references to ""pretty woman"" and had a great time in the process. This is one of those rare movies that doesn't just help pass time, but has the potential to help us grow as humans while being entertaining.By the way, if you like Pretty Woman and are into action like me, I would also recommend Kiss of the Dragon, one of my favourite Jet Li movies and just top of my best action films in general.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Adult fairy-tale that somewhat work,"Okay, so this movie is suppose to be a romantic classic and one of Julia Roberts trademark movie. So I decided to see it, this is a sappy movie and is pretty predictable most of the way through but for some reason it's kinda engaging. Maybe it's because of some good lines in the movie, as corny as it maybe sometimes though. So the premise is this, a rich guy picks up a hooker for some reason and likes her enough to the point he is willing to pay her 3 grand to stay with him for a week as an escort to events he needs or wants to attend. And one thing leads to another and so on. Now the chemistry doesn't really develop to the point you can understand why they like each other besides the superficial, materialistic or sex getting in the way. So in another words most of the comes off superficial and pretentious. The premise of a rich guy and a poor girl has been done so many times, but in this it just didn't seem all that developed. Even the parts about building a conscious isn't very believable either. But that being said it did a alright job of putting everything together in less than 2 hours. While in most Asian dramas that have a similar premise takes up 16 to 20 episodes and usually tends to drag. This movie will inspire other dramas to come that share the same or similar elements. In a way this is sort of like the 90's ""The Notebook"". Anyways overall this is a shallow and predictable flick with some sentimental stuff in it and to some degree it's entertaining.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Small classic rom-com,"""Pretty Woman"" has what seems like such a cookie cutter Hollywood plot that it is a surprise to see that it works and is a small classic of its type.Romantic comedies are, perhaps, necessarily formulaic. People don't want to be challenged when they watch one of those. If ""Pretty Woman"" has any challenges they are in Julia Roberts' performance, which is really what makes the movie work.Richard Gere, on the other hand, is kind of a dull actor, and I thought the movie was a bit overlong.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

We both screw people for money.,"Julia Roberts got a Golden Globe along with an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of a prostitute in an updated version of My Fair Lady.As ridiculous as the story is, one has to admit that it was just plain funny.No prostitutes I have ever seen on the news that actually work the streets look like Julia Roberts; not even like her pal Laura San Giacomo - most are just ugly. It is not a pretty business and I think it a flaw of the film to glamorize it.But, it was so funny! Yes, seeing Julia in a position that was uncomfortable was funny, but why couldn't she have just been a flower seller? Maybe the speech-writer for a current presidential candidate wrote this script. I can see Vivian and Kit yelling, ""Yes, We Can!"" Come on, it was funny! OK, Julia's slapstick was a little over the top, but Hector Elizondo was amazing funny as the Manager and doesn't get enough credit for his understated performance.It was funny and that makes it worth revisiting.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Fairytale Romance Of A Streetwalker And A Millionaire,"The first time I saw 'Pretty Woman' was about 10 years ago and I hated it. Now i got the DVD as a present and decided to give it another chance and I must say that perhaps I was being too harsh the first time. It's not a terrible film but not my favourite of this genre either. 'Pretty Woman' is extremely sugarcoated so do not expect anything other than...well, in the pretty woman's own words, fairy tale. That's what this is. It is another adaptation of 'Pygmalion' and bears a lot of resemblance to the wonderful 'My Fair Lady'. Julia Roberts plays Viviane, the cleanest prostitute. Don't analyze but Viviane is intelligent, not a junkie, very clean, healthy, prefers money over love...alright stop there and just remember that it's a fairy tale. The strength of the movie is of course The Richard Gere - Julia Roberts chemistry. On his own, Gere doesn't manage to make much of an impression. He's just okay but when sharing the screen with Roberts, he does well. Julia Roberts is the pretty woman and she carries it off eloquently. Laura San Giacomo is likable as Kit and Hector Elizondo is awesome. Garry Marshal's direction is alright although the film does drag in some parts. The soundtrack fits well with the movie and who could forget the title song? In a nutshell, one shouldn't expect anything other than a fairy tale or else chances are there will be disappointment.",,Anonymous,Romance

Chick flick or date movie staple,"After breaking up with his girlfriend Edward, an extremely wealthy corporate lawyer, takes up with a prostitute called Vivian, taking her back to his extensive suite at a five star hotel. In the morning Edward ends up asking her to spend the week with him primarily at the hotel, but also at various social events. In return Vivian will be paid $3000.As Vivian (Julia Roberts) struggles to fit in, albeit temporarily, into Edward's (Richard Gere) world, as the week progresses a real relationship develops between the two. If only their pasts and old friends of each could let them get on with things themselves...A wonderful date movie, possibly more 'chick flick', Pretty Woman is of course pure fantasy but the two leads pull you from an incredulous opening through this lovely Cinderella story. The humour is also welcome and interspersed throughout the movie. A nice fish out of water comedy but the slant is definitely towards the romantic story line.Things to look out for: shop keeper snobbery, wonderful hotel manager by Hector Elizondo, horrid and excellent performance by Jason Alexander as Edwards business partner, revenge on the snooty shop keepers, nice to see Ralph Bellamy just a year before he passed away (his final film performance), rose clenched final sceneRating: chick flick or date movie staple of the last twenty years, recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

No one hates this film more than me,"I have just given a 10 for Thieves Highway, I mention this for two reasons one to prove I'm not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night.We all know pretty Woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all, they'll eventually get you. Pretty Woman for me does two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a street walker Prostitute we're talking about here, has a great life, she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. My feeling is this 'happy Hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? If I make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place? By bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really lame.Secondly, 'Pretty Woman' insults romance itself, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady' that is without his plastic friend, yep don't leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another, even when he first meets her it's the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where's the charm? where's the charisma, don't mention that attempt at the piano please.Girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most. Guys who like this film will not even have realized that old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, as they probably don't either so it wont have registered. More importantly anyone who likes this film will hate 'Thieves Highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject.I'll finish on a song:Pretty woman hangin round the street Pretty woman, the kind I like to treat Pretty woman, I don't believe you You're not the truth No one could spend as much as you MercyPretty woman, wont you pardon me Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see Pretty woman, and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like mePretty woman, shop a while Pretty woman, talk a while Pretty woman, sell your smile to me Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah Pretty woman, look my way Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me..and I'll pay you..I'll treat you right",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Give Me A Break!,,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable fluff,"Overall this is a cute film but in many ways it's highly questionable. I remember when it was released a lot a people felt the film's flamboyant portrayal of prostitution sent a wrong kind of message. In many ways I agree with those people.But putting the harsh realities of the real world aside, Pretty Woman is a fun little film. Never expecting to gross a lot of money, this was a completely unexpected hit in 1990. Keep in mind that Gere's career was going down the toilet and Roberts was still a relative unknown, despite her Oscar nominated performance in Steel Magnolias (and it was Gere who was chosen because of his looks and Roberts because of her charm and talent).Gere and Roberts play extremely well off each other and they're chemistry is what makes the film a success. Roberts isn't believable as a prostitute for a minute but she's so charming you can't really hold that against her. Ditto for Laura San Giacomo, not always a likable performer but here she's a riot as Roberts's best friend. Hector Elizondo proves to be a real scene stealer, as always. Gere is really good as the lonely and somewhat cold business man, he's very low-key and he seems to realize that it's best to let Roberts chew the scenery with him supporting her (and he's a damn fine piano player to boot).This is pure Hollywood fluff all the way and as such it's enjoyable. The upbeat music is fantastic (and has aged surprisingly well) and there are enough heartwarming scenes to ensure that a few hankies are in order for sentimental viewers.Trivia note; I'll be damned if that romantic instrumental tune (credited to James Newton Howard) isn't a complete rip off of Bruce Springsteen's piano intro to ""Racing in the Street"" from his 1978 album Darkness on the Edge of Town. A useless trivia but I just had to mention it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Julia & Gere Burned Up the Screen,"Never got a chance to see this film from beginning to end and I must say, Julia Roberts,(Vivian Ward),""Closer"",'04 played the role of a hooker and put her complete heart and soul into this role.

Richard Gere,(Edward Lewis),""Shall We Dance"",'64, decides to pick up Vivian Ward on Hollywood Blvd., and takes her to the best Hotel in town and the both of them get very much involved with each other. The big scene is when he finally kisses her on the lips and the steamy heat blows up on the screen. Ralph Bellamy,(James Morse),""Rosemary's Baby"",'68, played a business man in this picture and made this his final film, going to the big screen in the Sky. Ralph Bellamy was a veteran actor from the early 20's, 30's & 40's. If you missed this film, make sure to see it the next time it is on TV.

Nice script with very good direction,"I have not watched too much Hollywood movies and probably this was the first of Richard Gere for me, but his acting has truly impressed me. He lived role of a sound, calm headed businessman who also have some vulnerable traits perfectly. The script was tightly written and kudos to director to draw it in the same way on the screen. Every character was perfectly defined and artists did full justice to their role. Julia appeared as over reacting some times but over all that was a great show by the director.

"Still holds up, despite its lack of originality","Being a guy, I'm pretty sure that this movie isn't really meant for me. No matter how the film-makers dress it up, it's your basic 'rom com.' However, just because nothing about it is original, doesn't mean that it's not at least 'watchable' (and 'watchable' is about the highest praise I can ever give a romantic comedy, based on the fact that most of my DVD collection involves car chases and alien armies being thwarted by superheros in an epic New York battle).Yes, I hate to admit it, but 'Pretty Woman' is actually very funny. No, it's definitely not original. It follows the tired old genre trope of: boy meets girl, boy loses girl and boy gets girl back again. But, if the characters are interesting and we care about them, plus they make us laugh along the way, who cares?In case you're the one person who doesn't actually know the plot of this film, Richard Gere plays a high-powered businessman in Los Angeles who befriends a down-on-her-luck 'working girl' (Julia Roberts). At first he pays her for her company during business events. Soon there's a flicker between them that something more may happen.So, you'd probably have to have never watched a romantic comedy film before not to be able to know what happens next. But it's not a film that's supposed to 'subvert your expectations' or with a 'twist' at the end. Everything flows from A to B nicely and along the way there are many memorable funny moments that you may since have seen lampooned in various popular culture outlets.I know women tend to like this film more, but I have to say that - if you're like me, i.e. a guy who isn't really into the genre - and you find yourself having to watch only ONE romantic comedy, this could be the one for you. It certainly goes quickly and the two leads are just so charming that you can't help but root for them. Also, special mention to Hector Elizondo who adds just that extra little bit of heart and charm to an already heart-filled and charming film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Hey, I've got a great idea...","Let's glamorize prostitution and market it to kids!!! Oh wait, this movie already did that.Had they stuck to the original script, this could have been a great movie. Richard Gere was supposed to pick up the hooker, use her for the time he was in town and then dump her. That would have been perhaps realistic. Although if you're going to use hookers, why would you want the same one for more than one night?Add to that that Julia Roberts is simply devoid of acting ability, and is not exactly what the title of the movie promises, and you have a film with no heart, no soul, and no reason to exist.If you're going to adapt Pygmalion, then look to My Fair Lady or even Educating Rita for your cues on how to do it right. A cheap and tawdry movie marketed to young girls with the message that it's a good idea to become a hooker, as your Prince Charming will find you after only a few months and you will never be beaten/raped in that time.

Did I See the Right Movie?!,"If it weren't for Julia Roberts' lead role in this film, I would have been SURE I was watching some awful spoof of the *classic* romantic comedy ""Pretty Woman.""  Now, I consider myself a very open-minded fella, I try not to prejudice myself against chick-flicks and I'm one guy that actually likes a true romantic film.  But this one is just plain overrated SCHMALTZ the whole way through.  Why is it that EVERY leading man in these corny modern movies has to look exactly the same?  As a movie fan, I have trouble rooting for a tall, handsome pretty-boy with an overflowing bank account who could have any woman he wants.  But I guess this film wasn't made for us ""unenlightened men who don't go to movies and have no need for romance in our lives.""  If you believe THAT, you'll believe this movie.  And as in every Disney film made in the last fifty years, you have the token evil guy who also happens to be short, bald, and unattractive (Jason Alexander). Isn't this a bit of a childish cop-out, casting the short, bald semetic man as the ""bad guy""?  What is this, a German propoganda film?!  Sorry if I'm getting a bit preachy, I just really hate the message that these films project onto a generation of lovelorn women.  The whole fairy tale of the handsome knight rescuing the damsel in distress from a life of loneliness is just that; a fairy tale.  The truth is, there's no such thing as the perfect man, or ""Mr. Right"" just like there's no perfect woman, so please stop creating this standard for perfection that doesn't exist, and stop trying to brainwash movie audiences into thinking that wealth and beauty makes a good human being.  Just hope you find a kind, sensitive, and wonderful man who loves you for you!  Trust me, that's as good as it gets on this warped planet.  If you'd like to see a really BEAUTIFUL romance on film, check out ""Picnic"", ""Casablanca"", or ""Now, Voyager!""

"Pretty Woman, Pretty Special!","I won't recapitulate the plot: you should know it, unless you've been living in a hermitage for 33 years!I give Pretty Woman a 10 artistically but subtract a mark for lionising the trappings of wealth and romanticising prostitution; half a mark for some sentimental choices in adjuncts like the soundtrack; half a mark for struggling with the ending; and one mark for vulgarity. But here's the catch: no vulgarity, no Pretty Woman. Vulgarity provides a key to the human heart that Pretty Woman uses to unlock its secrets. Flowing alongside our pure and noble need to love are concomitant lusts for fame, sex and riches. Exclude either stream and the human scene remains incomplete and unrealised.Pretty Woman in its consummate professionalism instinctively encapsulates these truths while Julia Roberts gives the defining performance of her generation. Nevertheless, this film is compromised by its conflicting desires to give us what we want and yet to show us that people make bad decisions and suffer accordingly.This matters because this film has artistic integrity, convincing us that its story is inevitable, its protagonists' actions unavoidable. Pretty Woman abounds in moments that are moving and artistically true. To choose just one set out of so many, consider its treatment of lovemaking. It seamlessly depicts the shifting of the lovers' congress from impersonal exchange to true intimacy with such dazzling delicacy that it is easy to miss its delineation of the real from the ersatz in sexual love. We are convinced that the lovers move from emotional manipulation to the stripping naked of being in the act of true love because we feel that they grow organically and spontaneously.Despite its brash and profane veneer, Pretty Woman is not an innovative film; indeed, it's positively old fashioned, embracing both the traditions of the Hollywood romcom and the archetypes of every folk myth from Cinderella to the Lady of the Camellias to Rapunzel. It tries to deflect our attention by flaunting its self-awareness of its sources, but ultimately it repays its debts by breathing new life into old cliches. Take its deployment of the trope of the all-important first kiss. By contrasting the characters' reservations about it and underlining their hesitation to do it, the film invests it with a symbolic power that makes us feel that these must be the first characters to have ever kissed on screen.In this, Pretty Woman draws its strands together with such consummate grace, dramatic inevitability and emotional power that the impact of the lovers' first true act of lovemaking is almost overwhelming. We feel the irony of Vivian's opening prophetic declaration, that this is their fate - vital, unrepeatable and irresistible.But therein lies a dilemma, for this is the film's climax: all that follows is a coda. This coda may be substantial and suspenseful, the drama of the lovers' struggle to control the forces they have unleashed, but still there seems something artificial about their final reconciliation. But by then it doesn't matter, we're committed to their cause. Our reward is the epilogue in which the movie's anonymous commentator universalises the experience of the lovers as we bid them farewell.This film is underpinned by Richard Gere's unselfish performance, by its flawless supporting cast, assured scripting and adroit direction and staging. But its immortality rests upon Julia Robert's incandescent performance. She enhances our sense of life's moral possibilities and incarnates a mysterious vitality which intensifies as her performance unfolds. She embodies Pretty Woman's flaws but also its hopefulness - the refinement of a vulgar heart as it opens to the infinite possibilities of love.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
If I ever make a Top 10 of my favorite movies this would be in it,"This is a movie I can watch over and over and over again right until the day I die. Immortal classic this is.And no, nostalgia doesn't have anything to do with it because the first time I watched it I was about eight or nine years old and couldn't possibly understand it the way the adult does. The last time was when I was about 18, I had yet to find love in this life so that doesn't count either. But tonight, after all these years I can safely stand by my sentence.This may seem like an old Cinderella story to most people or just another rags to riches kind of tale but to me it's so much more than that. It's tender, charming, sweet and all that thanks to Richard Gere and Julia Roberts who have created something beyond your usual love story and their chemistry together is palpable in every single scene. The whole cast was terrific, to be honest, starting with a little prick-ish Jason Alexander to gorgeous Hector Elizondo to legendary Ralph Bellamy in his final movie role, every actor has done an incredible job in delivering the laughs, tears, anger, and any other human emotions to the viewer.The soundtrack is so good I had it on replay ever since I've got internet back in 2006 (Oh Pretty woman was one of the first songs I memorized the lyrics to and sang, but not quite as good as Roy Orbison did).

Not bad for a romantic comedy.,"This is a romantic comedy starring Richard Gere as hardcore businessman (Edward Lewis) who hires prostitute Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) to be his escort at social events.Gere and Roberts make a charming couple as Edward and Vivian and had great on-screen chemistry. What results is some fun entertainment in seeing how Edward turns Vivian from a street-smart hooker to a beautiful and classy lady. It is also entertaining to see how Edward's hectic business life unravels as the story unfolds and how it results in an unusual bonding between him and Vivian.The plot goes at a steady pace, but does tend to drag toward some parts in the middle of the movie. The acting was mostly spot-on, with Julia Roberts stealing the show in my opinion. But, also great was Hector Elizondo hotel manager Barney Thompson, who showed indifference but care into his character, and inserted a little bit of wisdom in the movie where appropriate. Gere was OK in his role, though, I thought he was a bit too emotionless at times.Overall, it's not a bad romantic comedy, which does not overdo on the sexual references and, instead, concentrate on the special relationship between Vivian and Edward and the rags-to-riches subplot.

I might be biased since I'm not knowing as much drug prostitutes, perhaps Aleksander knows more I dunno.Still, this movie is a VERY light romance comedy.

This is far from a perfect movie and a big step down from being a class but is still worth watching,"Pretty Woman (1990) is a movie my wife and I recently rewatched together on Tubi. The storyline follows a business man too busy and successful to slow down and enjoy life. One night while asking for directions from a prostitute he meets a woman that may change his outlook on life forever. This movie is directed by Garry Marshall (Frankie and Johnny) and stars Julia Roberts (Thelma & Louise), Richard Gere (Jackal), Jason Alexander (Seinfeld), Laura San Giacomo (The Stand) and Hector Elizondo (Beverly Hills Cop). The storyline for this movie, while far fetched, is fun to watch unfold. Gere and Roberts deliver amazing performances, even if Roberts is annoying at times. The Beverly Hills backdrop was great as was the soundtrack. The attire is also entertaining as was the hotel the majority of the movie takes place in. The movie has a satisfying ending that is triumphant and feels good. Overall this is far from a perfect movie and a big step down from being a class but is still worth watching. I'd score this a 6.5-7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shallow and morally corrupt fluff,"On one level, I enjoy ""Pretty Woman"". While I'm not particularly a big fan of Richard Gere or [the very overrated] Julia Roberts, their chemistry in the film is great, and the film works as a decent romantic comedy on a superficial level.But I just can't get beyond how morrally bankrupt this film is. Characteristic of Hollywood, the much more cynical original incarnation of the script (titled ""3000"") attempted to really look into the our seedy values behind money and prostitution. The fact that director Garry Marshall would take such material and twist it into hollywood shlock is therefore quite depressing. The worst part is that you can still see small remnants of the films roots (especially the beginning) which has been bleached out as much as possible.What is this film really saying? It seems like greed, not love is the real answer (the scene where Roberts gets the gift of the Credit Card makes me want to vomit).In summary, there are a lot of appealing elements on the surface of ""Pretty Woman"", but the underlying subject matter is disturbing and contradictory to the film's message. While I personally think this film deserves a 1, I'll give it a 5 in a nod to all you people out there who care only about how ""cute"" Richard and Julia look together in this movie.For a real romantic comedy from this period, see ""Sleepless in Seattle"" instead.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Perhaps a bit predictable by today's standards, but still a nice movie","I guess you could describe ""Pretty Woman"" as the role model for all romantic comedies. It's probably one of the first in the genre (I can't think of an older one right now) and is therefor alone already worth a watch.Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) is the prototype of the rich business man. He has plenty of money, he's good looking and has no big problems even though his girlfriend is leaving him right now. He is specialized in taking over companies in need, dividing them in separate parts and selling those parts for a big profit. Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) is some kind of business woman too. She's a prostitute working on Hollywood Boulevard, selling her body for big money, when she meets Edward who has hired her for the night. He is overwhelmed by her because she's the only one who has been able to surprise him in a long time. He offers her money to stay with him the entire week and to join him on several social events. At first she doesn't fit in, but she learns quickly and soon she grabs the chance he gives her to change her life...Even though this movie is pretty predictable by today's standards, this still is a nice movie. The combination of Richard Gere with Julia Roberts really works well and both actors did a very good job by making their characters believable. The movie offers plenty of humor and that's all I ask from a comedy. That's why I reward it with a 7/10, perhaps even a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great classic but in hindsight it really did harm many young women's perception of prostitution,"No doubt Pretty Woman revolutionized the genre of romantic comedies. The music, the acting, the humor in those immortal scenes... They all function perfectly.I only recently learned that the original ending was a sad one, and some last minute decision on set was what turned it into a fairy tale of sorts.Back in its day, I remember people lamenting that the narrative was pushing into young women's subconscious a twisted idea of prostitution, mostly due to that finale.Having seen this almost every 4 years, mostly on TV, and now having enough first hand observation on various stuff, I finally agree.Yep, there really are those who dive into a highly damaging and extremely risky way of making a living as they cling to a one-in-a-million chance of meeting their prince charming in the course of such an unlikely encounter.This is how cinema functions on the level of mass manipulation.We cannot put the blame on movies whenever people take them more seriously than they should, and no, I don't think the intentions of the filmmakers were evil or calculated.Alas, Pretty Woman is really some high fructose corn syrup that people have been consuming for over 30 years.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good touching film,"Good touching film. But, apart from her clothes, Vivian has nothing about her to suggest a life of prostitution. At no point in the movie is anything said to suggest her past sexual activity. There is no pimp, no past john returning for another go. She doesn't even get cat-called like the other anonymous hookers seen on the street in the film's opening. No, instead we get a conveniently monogamous atmosphere between Vivian and Edward, where we don't even see any sexual contact between them until they've fallen properly ""in love"". But there was sexual contact; that's important to remember. It's important to remember that when he says ""I never treated you like a prostitute,"" that he has, in fact, been paying her for sex. I have to wonder what qualifies as treating a woman like a prostitute in his twisted mind. Not just because it whitewashes the vulnerable woman actually suffering on the streets with a cute Cinderella story, but it's also unfair to the legitimate, independent, professional escorts, who are being represented by a doe-eyed sugar-daddy-seeker who thinks she's driving a hard bargain by charging a multimillionaire $300 a night.Being a prostitute is the least relevant part of Vivian's character, because she conveniently solves Edward's every problem: from giving him directions, to showing him how to drive a stick-shift (insert innuendo here), to helping him tie a tie (yes, the man who has been wealthy his whole life and spends all his time in high-powered business meetings doesn't know how to tie a tie). Edward treats Vivian as an asset, and doesn't show any real emotion throughout the movie. Vivian likes money, and she conveniently falls for the guy who provides that money and attends to her every need.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tolerable at best,"Some of the dialogue is funny, some of the actors are great but for the most part this is some egregious stuff.  The Cinderella theme seems a little out of date in a hooker/john movie.  Of course she is entitled to dream but I don't think the movie has the slightest idea what a hooker actually has to endure.  I am not saying I do either, but then again I am not making a movie.There is almost no realism in the movie and you are told Viv is a hooker but there is no other evidence of that onscreen.  You do not believe for a second she falls in love with Gere - why would you, there is nothing going on between them as far as screen chemistry goes.  All of the drama is forced and immature.  No one acts like this in the real world. I don't know any millionaires or hookers, but come on, the audience does not have to in order to judge these people.I can easily recommend Laura San Giacomo's portrayal of Kit, Roberts's roommate, and naturally since this is a Garry Marshall movie, Hector Elizondo is in it and he is very enjoyable too.Boy, someone up there liked Julia the day she was nominated for Best Actress along side Kathy Bates, Joanne Woodward, Angelica Huston and Meryl Streep. If you look at that list, you have to ask yourself that age old question - ""what is wrong with this picture?"" At least she didn't win, thank God, thanks to Kathy Bates' unforgettable ""Misery"".  Any of the choices that year were preferable to Julia's mugging, pouting and blindingly phony smile.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
this movie must die,"Having just seen this film again i cannot help but feel that it is the worst movie of all time. Script, story, acting and direction all suck. It operates in the kind of moral neverland that makes the outside world pity normal Americans, and needs to be a constant source of shame for all involved.Garry Marshall brought us all a sickly sweet re-presentation of the '50s with Happy Days and should have been put out to pasture after that, not allowed to continue pumping out this dreck. Roberts and Gere prove that they are cinema stars rather than actors, and the director does nothing to dissuade us with a steady stream of saccharine button pressing which could only be described as cynical.

"well-rounded, simple and entertaining.","""Pretty Woman"" is an interesting fairy-tale-romance film. Although some elements seem just too unlikely, the film manages to capture the viewer and entertains greatly. Whilst the film has no real substance-not really any message- it never fails to achieve its purpose, and that is to entertain. Julia Roberts gives a decent performance as the innocent hooker who by luck transforms into an elegant woman. Perhaps the film shows that even the most sharp of thorns, a prostitute, can indeed change for the better. Unfortunately, as with most ""rom-coms"", the film is riddled with clichés, but always a certain uniqueness is present. Most elements are perfectly sound, acting and directing challenges are well met, however the film never excels in any particular way, which perhaps has led to its' success- a well-rounded simple film that almost any person can watch, and, however mildly, enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Badly cast but good movie,"I just wish they had discovered Rosie Perez by then who would have been more believable than Julia Roberts. That would have been a great movie. Julia Roberts is too much of a model type who just cannot carry it off even though her acting is always excellent.The whole movie does give a sense of the decadence of the 1980s, which dates it wonderfully. Obviously, this project was on the cards and in production before the crash of the 90s. It's incredible people really thought it wouldn't end.I'm not sure I could live a life where everyone around me just sees dollar signs and I think that someone who does would be shallower than Richard Gere's hard but soft man, which comes across as a little artificial.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cute Movie,"I remember when PRETTY WOMAN first came out in the summer of 1990. I did not go see it then but remember how people made a big fuss about the movie. All these years, I had not watched the movie except for bits and pieces of it. At any rate, I took the time to rent it and actually found it to be a cute movie. In fact, it was better than I expected. Did I find the movie to be realistic at all? Absolutely not. However, it IS a fairytale and by viewing it from that perspective, I enjoyed it. The basic premise is that Julia Roberts plays a prostitute named Vivian who, despite her profession, is basically a good person. One night, Richard Gere (Edward) picks her up and decides he wants to use her for a night. He ends up using her for the week. During that time, he shows her a side to life that she has never been exposed to before such as attending the opera. The week goes by and they both find that they really like each other but they realize they need to part ways. Of course, this being a fairytale, he finds her and they go off to live happily ever after.Again, if I were to judge the movie on how realistic I felt it was, I would say completely unrealistic. However, judging the movie for what it is, it showed that here were two people who, despite their both being totally different on the surface were actually quite similar. I.E. Julia Roberts's character Vivian is a hooker and Richard Gere's character Edward is a businessman who makes a living through mergers and acquisitions. My point is that that both characters basically use people to make money. Also, it showed how Vivian who was street-smart kind of softened Edward up a little and at the same time, Edward showed Vivian a life outside of prostitution. If there is one thing I want to say about PRETTY WOMAN, I want to say that I found the message to be that it is never to late to follow one's dreams.As for this movie, I understand there were several script versions for it. At one point, Al Pacino was considered for the Richard Gere role. Personally, I imagine this would have been a darker movie had Al Pacino starred in it. Also, I understand there was a version where Vivian was on cocaine and her roommate Kit died of a drug over-dose. Had that version been made, the film would have been more realistic. However, as I stated above, this is basically a Cinderella story.I want to mention a few things about PRETTY WOMAN. Probably one of my favorite scenes in the movie is where Vivian (Julia Roberts) walks along Rodeo Drive wearing her tall black hooker boots and her mini-skirt. Here she is completely out of place and when she goes into the fancy shops in an attempt to buy ""more appropriate"" clothing, the merchants refuse to help her. Then the next day, after a nice lady helped her, she goes to the merchants who would not help her and said ""Do you remember me? You wouldn't help me. Do you work on commission? Big Mistake!"" I liked that scene because as is so often the case, people tend to judge others only on the surface or think ""this person has no money. He's not well dressed."" When watching the DVD of PRETTY WOMAN, I also took the time to watch the movie with the narration by Garry Marshall, the director. That is very interesting as he explains how the different scenes were shot and why they turned out the way they did. It is also worth mentioning that this is the very last movie that Ralph Bellamy made as he passed away a year or so after the film was released. In conclusion, I want to say PRETTY WOMAN is worth watching some time when you just want to relax and not deal with reality.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rom-Com Classic,"When millionaire businessman Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) goes to Beverly Hills to work on a corporate takeover, he hires prostitute Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) to keep him company for the week. Vivian is impressed by the money, the freedom, and the lifestyle. Edward exposes her to social and art events frequented by the upper crust, and she likes it. Though theirs is a business relationship, feelings start to creep in, complicating things.This is one of the best rom-coms of all time. Gere and Roberts have great chemistry and the script, a variation on the Cinderella story, is full of endearing moments and comedy (as well as moments of drama). The rest of the cast is excellent, including Jason Alexander as a businessman with questionable values, Laura San Giacomo as Vivian's best friend, Ralph Bellamy as Edward's business adversary, and Hector Elizondo who steals scenes as a lovable hotel employee.Like many best films, this is one you can watch and rewatch endlessly.

The Benchmark of Classic Romance,"A tale of an unlikely romance, that raises eyebrows, melts hearts and proves all the doubters wrong.Edward, a rich entrepreneur, hires Vivian, a prostitute, to accompany him to a few social events. Trouble ensues when he falls in love with her and they try to bridge the gap between their worlds.The film is a romantic classic, embodying the true meaning of life and the true power of love. Richard Gere plays second in many ways to the flawless Julia Roberts, both of whom encapsulate their respective roles with care and passion. Ultimately, the two characters are contrasts of one another, while Vivian's outward, vibrant character idiom acting very much as a foil of Edward's organic, professional persona is the indication that a very naturally beautiful woman who albeit doesn't fit into the same upper class tier system, still appeals to the latter because of the emotional connection on a personal level.When 'Pretty Woman' was released in 1990, it was a massive kickstart to the decade, proving successful on its cinematic screening. Film lovers were immersed in the relationship on-screen that reminded so many of the hope of what love is and that love does not get categorised into a class system based on wealth.A picture-perfect script printed incredibly and convincingly with the work of Garry Marshall and J. F. Lawton coming together neatly.

Retard Gere (see what I did there) is a retard,"Let me start this review with a question (THAT'S RIGHT A QUESTION 'EMPIRE' MAGAZINE!) and one that I think might change the way that you view this film in the future. Let's just say that you're Richard Gere in this film, and you have so much money that you can do anything you want would you:A) Pay Julia Roberts, a women who I believe to be possessed by something similar to that slug monster from 'The Hidden' to be your escort for some business events, or:B) Use your wealth to have either Famke Janssen or Whoopi Goldberg cloned to act as your escort for some business events?The correct answer is B. why the hell would you pay Julia Roberts to act as an escort? For a start she's evil and secondly she's possessed by something unnatural that might jump out of her face at any moment. If you were meeting Bill Gates at a posh dinner party and an evil slug exploded out your 'girlfriends' face do you honestly think he'd do business with you? Duh No!But imagine turning up at a posh dinner party in an exclusive restaurant with Whoopi Goldberg? That'd be great! She'd be like all kooky and funny, making all the posh people look like morons.Lord Windford: 'I say, can you pass the baked beans please Ms Goldberg.'Whoopi Goldberg: 'With a name like Windford, I think you've had enough beans already!'HA! Take THAT the British class system! But I bet you'd expect that the whole place would be all stuffy with dull classical music playing and the clinking of cutlery. WRONG! Because wherever Whoopi goes she gets all the people together and shows them that what they're doing can be fun. 'C'mon! We can really rock this place!' she'll shout as she cranks up the sound system with some kickin' tunes (probably Level 42).Empire magazine apparently isn't taking on any new film reviewers right now, or so they tell me. I bet if Steven Spielberg or Quentin Tarantino wrote to them asking to be film reviewers they'd employ them in a flash. Actually if Dr Stephen Hawking wrote in and asked to be on their staff they'd trample over each other to get him to sign a contract. Did they do that with me? No. Just be honest Empire, you can't handle my cutting edge film reviews and you know I'd make the rest of you're staff look like dullards, even with Dr Stephen Hawking and his theory about science.And if they employed me they wouldn't have to put any ramps for wheel chairs in their buildings because I don't use a wheel chair like Hawking does. Quick question: Has Dr Stephen Hawking had any of his film reviews published by IMDb? Answer: No, he hasn't and I've had loads (except for the 'Erotic Witch Project 2: Book of Seduction' one)! In your face Hawking!Now bearing in mind I've already pointed out this film's MAJOR flaw (that it stars Julia Roberts rather than Famke or Whoopi) I expect you're thinking; 'well, there's really no point in me watching this film' and you'd be right. Don't watch it.",,Anonymous,Romance
New spin on an old theme,"Pretty Woman is a popular and very familiar movie meant for a popular audience, the main attraction being the charisma of its two box-office buffos, Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.I always feel a certain sense of interest when anticipating a Richard Gere film. I know that in some way he will be slick and sleazy (e.g., Breathless (1983), Internal Affairs (1990), etc.) and I can get involved in his contrary nature. In other words, he won't bore me with a one-dimensional persona. Here however he is thoughtful, kind, considerate, intelligent--a non-sleazy, gray-suited business man with a wise and fatherly manner. Perhaps this is Gere's persona for his middle years...In the case of Julia Roberts, not only is she nice to look at, she is interesting to look at. It is no accident that her face is one of the silver screen's dominate images from the nineties. She has a powerfully expression nature and can assume a role as easily as one puts on a coat. She is striking physically, the huge mouth, the delicate nose, the long limbs... She is also the quintessence of a woman who can appear ordinary or beautiful according to circumstances. I have seen her in two PBS productions of Nature. (Yes, she is a Hollywood star with compassion, or at least one who loves animals.) In one she is in Borneo with orangutans, and in the other in Mongolia with the descendants of Genghis Khan and the wild horses. In both cases she throws herself into the dirt and discomfort like a trooper without a hint of the glamour she left thousands of miles behind. She charms both the children of the nomads and the orangutans. In fact, one randy orangutan becomes so smitten with her that he starts to put the moves on, and has to be restrained! In other words she has an equalitarian, democratic, down-to-earth nature which sits well with a popular audience. She has made so many movies lately (hurriedly as her youth is expiring: she is now over thirty, the age of death for most Hollywood actresses) that I cannot keep up with them, so many that her ranking among the great stars of the screen is still up for grabs as we evaluate her many performances.Will her role in Pretty Woman help? Although I found it difficult to swallow her fake bad grammar, the phony lack of sophistication, and the predictability of her golden heart, I thought it marginally plausible that such a striking woman COULD in some strange parallel universe be reduced to hooking in Hollywood. And I thought she did a creditable job by bringing some originality to a well-worn role. Certainly I believed in Julia Roberts, the whore, as much as I did in Elisabeth Shue, the whore (from Leaving Las Vegas (1995)). Had Roberts been portrayed as a drug addict--which of course Hollywood made a stringent point of NOT doing, since they needed Middle America to identify with her in order to sell tickets--I might have bought it. Most American prostitutes are drug addicts. That's how most of them they got enslaved into the business in the first place.So what we have here is a variation on an old Hollywood fantasy: poor, underclass girl, through her natural beauty, lovable nature and good common sense wins the heart of a man of considerable means, thus upgrading her social and economic status, etc. In others words, this is a woman's fantasy-fulfillment movie all the way. The real question to be asked, though, is how did the chemistry between the two stars work? Do Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn or Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have anything to be jealous about? I think not, but judging from the box office success and the fact that they were paired again in Runaway Bride (1999), I am probably wrong. But see it and judge for yourself. Despite the cliché situation, this is more than a confectioner's diversion because of what it implies, and what we can learn, about the American psyche, circa 1990.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

The story isn't that original, being a variation on the `love on the wrong side of the tracks' theme.  However, it is full of charming and funny moments and Roberts' audacious effervescence is the perfect contrast to Gere's impassive macho persona.  The film had enormous popular appeal and surprised everyone, grossing $178 million in the U.S. and $463 million worldwide, establishing Roberts as one of the most bankable stars in a generation.At only 21, Roberts was a fresh talent with sexy girl-next-door looks who showed she could light up the screen with her acting.  With the guidance of veteran sitcom director Garry Marshall (`The Odd Couple', `Happy Days', `Mork and Mindy', `Murphy Brown'), she was transformed from a tall and pretty model type into a delightful romantic figure with an extraordinary sense of comic timing who earned a best actress nomination for her performance.The new DVD includes a good deal of footage that was left out of the theatrical release, and the commentary by Garry Marshall is rich in interesting trivia about the production.  For instance, he tells how Julia Roberts was so nervous about her first nude scene with Richard Gere that she broke out in hives, and they spent the entire day applying calamine lotion and makeup all over her to hide the blotches.  Also, the now famous scene where Gere snaps the lid of the jewelry case on her fingers was not intended to be in the film.  Marshall instigated a prank because Julia was dragging and he wanted to wake her up.  So, he told Gere to impishly snap the lid when she went to touch the necklace, and her reaction was so delightful that they kept it.This is a fun film that is worth seeing again now that it has been released on DVD.  I rated it an 8/10.  Though it is ridiculously implausible, it is enchanting and amusing throughout.  It is also an excellent look at Julia Roberts' early work, when she only earned $300,000 rather than $20 Million per film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The whole movie is sad, but the separate scenes are great.","Unfortunately this movie suffers from quite a weak story line. I think the alternative (mentioned in the trivia) would probably be much more interesting. However, many scenes in this movie are a delight to watch, and I would probably watch the movie again just to see these.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A classic romance delightfully updated in modern form.,"From start to finish, you can't wait to see Julia Roberts temptingly delightful until the fun is over. If you're dead serious about her but only want to watch one of her greats, then PRETTY WOMAN is it, THE quintessential Julia Roberts film that updates PYGMALION in tasteful contemporary flavor. This has to be a remarkable performance from a young 21-year old who could pull off an older woman's role so well. Practical and funny at times, it clearly defines the 90s ""chick flick"" comedy that saw a rising trend. Almost everything about it has Roberts' name written all over it, but let's not forget Richard Gere who quickly gets hooked with her in a wig. In fact, he's the perfect example for all male stereotypes to find and cherish love in surprising, affectionate, but sometimes hurtful ways. Boasting an excellent pop soundtrack, this is a true modern classic, except for one thing: the way Roberts dresses like a ""street junkie"" makes it a little too vague for an all-too-good movie that has plentiful moments. One thing's perfectly clear, though. Anyone who never saw a romantic comedy before will have desperately wished they've seen PRETTY WOMAN!

Hollywood's dumb fascination for misleading title ! ! !,"Films about hookers and their patrons are a common feature of all national cinemas.According to a rough estimate,films about hookers have always been a good box office proposition.This might be because of people's belief that they are objects of reverence.This is the reason why Hollywood is not at all an exception as far as films about women of easy virtue are concerned.The only thing which differs American/ Hollywood films from those of other countries is their narrative structure.Hollywood cinema relies more on the external appearance of hookers whereas world cinema focuses more on internal quest of hookers for achieving a state of security,safety,prosperity and happiness. Pretty Woman fails to deliver because it is not at all serious cinema. It can neither be termed as a prototype of fun cinema as it lacks credibility which is evident in Leaving Las Vegas.As Hollywood film industry has its own peculiar way of portraying hookers viewers have little or no choice of rejecting such flicks.There are plenty of gaping holes in Pretty Woman.It is being labeled as a fairy tale of a hooker with golden heart.This is absurd as viewers are not in a position to figure out whether it is due to severe distress or a young girl's desire to lead a lavish life.Pretty Woman is a dismal failure as in real life people deal harshly with hookers making their lives miserable.Pretty Woman is a historic blunder too as it degrades women.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

The story is more than just a love story; it's about friendship, shortcomings, overcoming the boundaries we set for ourselves, and transformation.

I liked this film,"""Pretty Woman"" is not the usual romantic movie that some will like and some won't.

A Really Enjoyable Romantic-Comedy,"This film begins with a wealthy businessman named ""Edward Lewis"" (Richard Lewis) deciding to leave a party hosted by his lawyer ""Philip Stuckey"" (Jason Alexander) and finding that his limousine is blocked in by several other cars. So, to remedy that problem, he borrows the keys for Stuckey's brand, new Lotus and drives off. Not being familiar to the area, he accidentally gets lost and ends up in Hollywood. The scene then shifts to a young prostitute named ""Vivian Ward"" (Julia Roberts) having an argument with her roommate ""Kit De Luca"" (Laura San Giacomo) about some money that was supposedly put aside to pay the rent. Admitting that she spent it to pay another bill, Kit graciously allows Vivian the opportunity to proposition a potential client who has just pulled over in a brand, new Lotus. To her surprise, rather than wanting company, the man simply asks for directions to Beverly Hills instead. Being rather desperate for money, she offers to drive him there--for a small price. Along the way, he introduces himself and, having just broken up with his girlfriend, Edward eventually asks her to become his escort for a week in order to attend some social gatherings. Needless to say, considering the amount of money he is offering to pay, she immediately accepts without any hesitation. What neither of them realize at the time, however, is that--despite their differences in social status--the agreement they have just reached will soon change their lives forever. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this is one of the best romantic-comedies I have ever seen with both Richard Gere and Julia Roberts putting in excellent performances in their respective roles. Likewise, I also enjoyed the performances of both Laura San Giacomo and Hector Elizondo (as the hotel manager named ""Barney Thompson"") as well. Admittedly, it has a late-80's or early-90's quality which, to a certain degree, might make it seem a bit dated to some viewers. But even so, I found it quite enjoyable, and I have rated it accordingly.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Trains that will change your life.,"Pretty Woman. Trains that will change your life. A modern adult fairy tale about Cinderella, about how lucky a good girl can get an equally good guy and what will happen next... Everything depends on the princess and her prince. Julia Roberts is the real treasure of this film. Her character is truly funny, beautiful and very sweet. The character of Richard Gere, on the contrary, is very restrained for almost the entire film and his face occasionally shows only a slight smile, but as director Garry Marshall assures, this is how his hero should be. And Héctor Elizondo is, as always, a small but important highlight of the film. ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" will forever be a hit for the ages.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Remarkably assured in its own skin,"This Pygmalion inspired rom-com fantasy in which prostitute Julia Roberts is hired by filthy rich businessman Richard Gere to be his escort for a week is a dreamy throwback to Golden Age studio filmmaking. There's a sense of nostalgia running through almost every scene and the picture isn't ashamed of its heritage - it's remarkably assured in its own skin. The carefree confidence gives the film the required allure and makes you root for Vivian and her transformation, regardless of whatever stigmas it may or may not entail. You want her to get back at whomever has treated her badly, you want her to change Edward with her paradoxical virtue, and of course you want love to prevail. It's the same old story, but it has a fresh angle, is expertly produced and boasts warm, attractive performances from its two stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cinderella goes to LA,"Isn't it funny that some movies you need to watch a number of times before the plot and the action burn themselves into your mind, while others you need only watch once and you are cursed for the rest of your life remembering the movie. This is the case with Pretty Woman. I watched it quite some time ago, and still remember that it is about a lonely business man on a trip to Los Angeles, picks up a prostitute on Hollywood Boulevard, and then falls in love with her.This is a typical Cinderella story in a sense. Okay Cinderella was imprisoned in her castle as a scullery maid by her ugly step sisters, but is rescued by her fairy godmother, given a wonderful night with Prince Charming, and then flees before midnight only to have Prince Charming track her down and marry her. This is not necessarily the plot of this film, but it is a story of a less than ordinary woman (she is a hooker) who is found by a wealthy individual who then falls in love with her. Thus while it is rags to riches, it is through marriage that the heroine goes from being a hooker to being a princess.This was a very popular movie, but it was not one of the great movies in that it came out, flew high, and then returned to obscurity. However it is one that sits on my mother's shelf, despite me cringing at the idea of creating a romantic movie round a prostitute. I can see that there would have been a lot of criticism regarding making a woman of the night the heroine, and raising her up to a new lifestyle. There are many that would cringe at that and claim that such a woman does not deserve a chance to succeed. She doesn't really succeed though, she is in the right place at the right time, and is picked up by the right man.I would not recommend that people go out and become prostitutes simply so that they might meet the man of their dreams, it simply does not happen. In some countries prostitution is legal (such as Germany and the Netherlands) however that is not the case in the US. It is still illegal and while those who hire the services may not necessarily be thugs, it is a culture that is permeated with drugs and violence.The final thing I wish to mention is the kissing. Throughout the movie we are told that prostitutes do not kiss and suggest that is because kissing brings about a more intimate relationship, which is not what prostitution is about. This is rubbish since sex in and of itself creates an intimate relationship. The best reason I found out about the reason behind the non-kissing rule is more to prevent the transmission of disease than about anything somewhat to do with intimate relationships.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Loved It ❤,"""The bad stuff is easier to believe. You ever notice that?"" - Vivian
Every story has two sides. Every coin has two Parts. Every Emotion has two ways. This movie was all about emotions, depth, love and most importantly giving back what you have taken.
If you have fallen in love with this movie, you will jump in it repeatedly.
I am a crazy fan of ROMCOMs and Julia Roberts is the queen, I guess. The chemistry between the handsome Richard and Vivian is simply marvellous.
Let's move on to characters.
Vivian: a hooker by force but lately by choice. From meeting Richard to their last kiss, she performed her character amazingly. Her dialogue delivery was just awesome. She is the girl dreaming of her prince to come to rescue her from the tower. OH MY GOD, the fantasy! When she completed the deal with Richard and went back to her apartment, I have seen the pain of leaving in her eyes. She was careless but took care of Kit De Luca. She was a hooker but fallen in love with Richard. She was a true example of falling in love madly. Vivian: The Perfect-Pretty-Woman.
Richard: Ah Richard! Richard!
You the Man! You have done a remarkable act. I just love the Scene in Opera when he said to Vivian ""People's reactions to opera the first time they see, it is very dramatic; they either love it or they hate it. If they love it, they will always love it. If they don't, they may learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of their soul.""
The person who treats you like Cinderella, the one who loves you like you are the ONE AND ONLY, the one who is willing to shower his each and every penny upon you, the one who gives you wings, the one who trusts you with everything, the one who is ready to fulfil your fairytales is the one. He is THE ONE.""Welcome to Hollywood! What's your dream? Everybody comes here; this is Hollywood, land of dreams. Some dreams come true, some don't; but keep on dreamin' - this is Hollywood.

And maybe even more so every time I watch it.Yes, there is some good acting going on. Yes, there are some beautiful actors who can deliver a line. It is commercial, it is smooth. The conversations are clever.But mostly: it touches so many different topics. From the obvious ones like this very romantic (and slightly unbelievable) love story about an incredibly rich business man who is out of touch with his emotional side and the smart and socially skilful prostitute. But it is also very much about respect and believing in yourself, with which you sometimes need a little hand. It is about prejudice, about being happy if you can do good things for other people, about setting boundaries.So it's a romantic comedy with a serious undertone and it makes me hopeful.

An uncomfortable attempt at fantasy,"Though I understand why so many people love this movie, I couldn't help but experience I creeping sense of unease when I saw it. The attempt to idealize what is really one of the most sordid, unappealing professions in America seems not only to undermine all the efforts to date to eradicate both the demand for prostitution and the seemingly Cinderella-esque appeal of prostitution, but to stroke our collective consciousness into a false sense of inculpability. Admittedly most of the people watching the movie do not directly relate to either of the two poles in the movie, the downtrodden Julia Roberts nor the fairy-tale prince Richard Gear. This means that the situation portrayed is more easily accepted as a fairy tale than real life, but for those more practically acquainted with the all-too-real world of prostitution, this movie is a slap in the face and a reminder that a story like Roberts' could never happen outside the fairy tale world.If Julia Roberts were living in the real world of prostitution, she would be a bleary-eyed smack addict unconnected and unconcerned about her clients. The only way she might make a real profit off Richard Gear would be if her pimp collected extortion from him and gave her a cut.Take it from someone who's been there.

I love this Movie!,"Certainly reminiscent of Shaw's ""Pygmalion,"" but with a contemporary twist.Imagine a beautiful dream, an age-old fantasy: the tale of rescuing a woman from the streets. However, this narrative is far removed from the dark, twisted portrayal seen in some works of fiction.In this dream, the woman in question is not plagued by the vices typically associated with street life. She is not beholden to drugs, alcohol, or any other destructive habits. Her body and mind are pristine, untouched by disease or addiction. There are no scars of illness or exploitation on her skin; she is simply healthy, inside and out. Moreover, she is not a criminal, nor does she harbor any inclination towards theft. Love and dignity hold greater value to her than material wealth. She is free from the clutches of a pimp, with only a supportive friend by her side.Her soul shines with a golden light, radiating goodness and compassion. Despite her circumstances, she possesses a deep appreciation for art and culture. The high-society figures that surround her seem shallow and artificial in comparison to her natural authenticity. She was once a diligent student and, perhaps, could be again in the future.Picture her in moments of bliss, soaking in a bath that symbolizes purity and renewal. The act of washing away the remnants of her time on the streets is both literal and metaphorical, a cleansing of body and spirit. And amidst the bubbles, she sings with a charm and grace that captivates all who hear her.But amidst these idyllic qualities, one may wonder: why would such a woman ever turn to prostitution? Yet, in this dream, logic takes a backseat to the beauty of the narrative. Instead of dwelling on the why, we simply embrace the enchanting possibility of redemption and transformation.So let us not analyze, but rather, let us dream. For in this dream, there is love, there is hope, and there is the promise of a brighter tomorrow.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Most movies are fantasy,I saw this as a teen and loved it! I wanted all of it. I am a dreamer! What is wrong with that. I go to a movie to be taken away to a different world. I have had a hard life and dont want to see it on screen. I have seen reviews which say it is demeaning to woman snd prostitutes. I am a recovering addict and have met many prostitutes. MANY of them were just as kind and loving as Vivien. It is insulting to say that all prostitutes are nasty and from horrible backgrounds. Many are but many are not. People nowadays are so serious. This was a fantasy love story. Let it be just that and not a serious movie or social commentary. Fun movie and most girls would love an endless supply of clothes. I dont care what anyone says.

The sweetness and laughter of the 90s,"A wonderful movie for romantic people at heart with great acting by the two stars as well as the superb supporting cast, super funny moments, smooth development and flow, ravishing scenes, lovely oh so fitting score and a microscopic cheesy ending which is sweetly dissolved in all the rosy love that most of us experience by then.By most of us, I mean romantic people with an honest open heart, but we magnanimously invite everyone to the party that Pretty Woman holds as sweet as pure honey.Screenplay/story: 8Development: 9.2Realism: 9.2Entertainment: 9.5Acting: 9.5Photography/filming: 9.5Visuals/special effects: 8.5Music/score: 9.5Depth: 8.5Logic: 8Flow: 9.5Comedy/drama: 9.5Ending: 9.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I just don't like this!,"I saw this film with my ex best friend and best man Dave.  I think he liked this film for Julia, and his eyes jumped right out of his head.  Julia did herself up for the male auidence; I wanted to go see Krate dude out for revenge 3 or some other mind numbing action film and old Dave or I guess back then new Dave wanted to see Julia.   I wish he ment her instead of well lets not go there; the acting is fine.  Richard and Roberts I never seen them act bad even with a bad story.  The story need something more to it like the Pizza movie Roberts was in before.  Acted well, just something missing in the story's execution.  The theme where people have hope, and can change is great, but the execution for the conclusion need's some juice. 5 out of 10.  Richard and Roberts should do more movie together there is a chemistry between them.  One can not help but see this in this film. Something tells me these actors are all right people.  I bet Julia, Richards and myself would argue on many issues, but their on screen warmth seem to be real.  I give credit for Julia's donation of money for 9/11 her tears where real.  Many other actor use event for their own purpose and never would give such a large amount of money.  Good for you Julie even if I don't agree with some of her views.PS  My wifes view is this film is opposite of mine she wrights a few of my review to give balance and found this story touching, warm and thinks Gear is a great actor.

It also invites us into the world of super rich in a stylized way that makes for a perfect fantasy.I'm also impressed with Richard Gere in looking so good in his role. He was stunningly good looking as Edward, and had almost a teenager like quality in his looks.

The Irresistible Charm of Pretty Woman,"""Pretty Woman"" is a classic romantic comedy that combines chemistry, charisma, and smart dialogue to create an unforgettable experience. Despite the somewhat implausible premise of a romance between a wealthy businessman and a prostitute, the film captivates audiences with its special magic.One of the most notable aspects is the chemistry between Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, who play Vivian Ward and Edward Lewis, respectively. Their relationship evolves naturally, and their interactions are captivating. Though the story has a ""Cinderella"" vibe, it flows smoothly, keeping the audience engaged and entertained.The script is filled with memorable moments and clever dialogue, like the iconic scene in the clothing store where Vivian is rejected for her appearance, then returns to prove her worth. As the story unfolds, the characters grow and develop, adding depth to the romantic comedy.""Pretty Woman"" offers an escape from reality, a modern fairy tale with a touch of luxury and romance. The music also plays a significant role, enhancing the film's atmosphere and adding a nostalgic element. Even those who aren't typically fans of the genre can enjoy the light-heartedness and charm of this movie.In summary, ""Pretty Woman"" has that ""special something."" With standout performances, an engaging story, and a fantastic soundtrack, it remains one of the best romantic comedies of all time. Perfect for a laid-back movie night, this film is an option that never goes out of style.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Money isn't everything,"Pretty Woman is a great love film, one that could easily be one of my favourites. I'm ignoring all the controversy here, apparently people hate this film because it hasn't aged well?Edward Lewis is a wealthy businessman and there is nothing more important to him than screwing over companies and making money in the process. Vivian Ward is a Hollywood prostitute making $100 an hour, trying to live off this for a living. They're two completely different people but they couldn't be more perfect for each other, they do the same job but in different contexts. This one similarity is enough to make both of them better people, no matter how much money is in-front of them.Overall the technicalities of the film were good. The cinematography didn't do anything special to remember but wasn't bad. I wish music was used a bit more, for example the use of ""It Must Have Been Love"" was perfect and I think there were some missed opportunities earlier in the film. Editing was clean, scenes being held for a correct amount of time for emotion. I think emotion is the most important aspect in this genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The song was the best part of this movie,"I like Julia Roberts but this was such a step backward for women. Come on seriously how could anyone think of this as a romance??

Hey Mom how did you and Dad meet? Oh I was hooking down on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and your Dad gave me $100 to spend the night with him. Isn't that sooo romantic. Blech! Imagine every time they get into an argument and he tells her she is just hooker anyway and should be happy with what she's got. Although, this film was made in the 90's it must have been written in the 50's back when men had some crazy control issues and wished they could just keep women down...oh wait a minute how much has really changed since then?

Originally posted by Darkfalz,"---------------------------------------begin quote Date: 15 March 2002 Summary: Abominable and far from romanticSo many people fail to see the true meaning of this film. It's not a comedy, or a romance, or a romantic comedy. It's a statement on the unfortunate fact women's love can be bought, and sometimes that's the only (or best) way to get it.Julia Roberts starts off in this movie as a prostitute, and she ends up as... a prostitute. The only difference is she found someone rich and handsome enough to pay for her love, rather than just sex.It's no surprise that on the voting scales, women consistently voted this higher than men. Men know the Richard Gere character deserves someone far better than some lowlife hooker, even if she is the overrated (I happen to think she's ugly) Julia Roberts.But with women, it's the whole fairy tale they all desperately want to believe, that no matter how little they have to offer, no matter how low their standing in life, that their Prince Charming, their Mr. Perfect, their Knight in Shining Armour, or as in this movie, their Handsome Millionaire is waiting to sweep them off their feet.Many women die lonely and bitter because of the myth this movie and others like it helps to perpetuate. But considering what they are expecting, it's hard to feel sorry for them... since they would have rejected and broken the hearts of many good, decent men while waiting for their dream.I only wish I could vote 0 for this utterly vile piece of filth.---------------------------------------end quoteAll this is true, and despite it I couldn't wipe the stupid grin off my face.

Hey Let's Move To LA!,"No one will ever be able to replace Julia Roberts. Reading the trivia here, and if it's to be believed, mulling on who was considered for her role... There is no way any of the others would have worked as well as she does. She even makes some scenes in Runaway Bride work just on her personality alone.Back home, according to recent surveys, she's the #1 woman men dream of sleeping with. She doesn't impress me this way, but looking back on this movie one sees class and a fantastic actress.Everyone is good here - Gere too actually, and Hector is priceless. It's very well made and extremely well acted.The only drawback - two points on the ten star scale - is that this movie resulted in such an influx of US midwest girls all intent on coming to LA and hooking on the streets and meeting their own Richard Gere.It's reminiscent of how people were reputed to accost Larry Hagman on the street and rip him apart for being such a bastard, unable to distinguish between Larry the actor and JR Ewing the scum bag.And that's something a lot of people will never understand. And in the case of this movie, with all the 'chicken hawks' working the area, it was a real tragedy.

Well put together romance...,"1st watched 8/17/2010 -- 8 out of 10 (Dir-Garry Marshall): Well put together romance is one of the better ones in this genre, in my opinion. The story is about a rich man, played by Richard Gere, who's personal life is falling apart and picks up a hooker, played by Julia Roberts, on Hollywood Boulevard initially just to get directions but then ends up keeping her around for a week and of course pays for it. He's the type of person who is married to his job and does it well, and Julia's character works a job where love is out of the question with her clients(no kissing on the lips, basically). They are both hard nuts to crack in different ways but each helps the other to overcome their issues. Although the story is somewhat like a prince rescuing a princess story, it varies in that both parties are really rescuing each other. Garry Marshall, the director, does a good job of telling the story without adding too much cliché-driven jokes or side stories but instead just lets the story happen. Gere and Roberts bring their natural charms to the roles and they are a perfect fit for their characters. I usually don't like sappy endings but this one was really well written and it lifted the movie up to classic status, in my opinion. Bravo to Marshall and the gang for making this movie tasteful yet still for adults.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Definitely a great starring vehicle for Gere, it's one of his more memorable films. And Julia, it was her breakout role.Hector Elizondo costars, as he does in many of Marshall's films, and he is quite the character actor and added comic relief. Jason Alexander has a small part in the film as well, playing a friend of Richard Gere's character who turns out to be a jerk.It's a great film with many sights set around Beverly Hills, California; including the famous Rodeo Drive.

"Pretty woman, walking on the streets, pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet","This is from Roy Orbinson 1964's hit song that reached its cinematic posterity 26 years later, with Garry Marshall's film of the same name. Oddly enough, when taken in the context of the film, the lyrics take a totally different significance since the titular 'pretty woman' doesn't quite walk on the streets for pleasure.Of course, the song is used for the film's trademark sequence when Vivian tries new clothes from prestigious French sounding shops, fulfilling every little girl's fantasy. But there's something genuinely appealing in Julia Robert's performance, a sort of child-like eagerness to embrace a one-week dream and do whatever she wants because she got woman's most cherished accessory, not a handbag, not a lipstick or a mirror, but a credit card. Don't take that statement as patronizing and misogynistic please, ""Sex and the City"" convey the same message, and bluntly assumes it. What differentiates Vivian from the other feminist icons though relies on the roots of her constant enthusiasm, forever incarnated by Robert's unique smile  and irresistible giggles.Indeed, no matter how much fun she has while seizing her luxurious days, we know that she's happy, more than anything, because she's in love. And the man might be rich, handsome and powerful, like a modernization of the 'Charming Prince' figure, there's something that oddly rings true in that peculiar love story. And this is a credit to two fine performances from Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and a clever screenplay that doesn't take its premise for granted, starting from the obligatory meeting, which is the hit-or-miss of romantic comedies. Gere is Edward Lewis, he can't drive a friend's car and find his way to the hotel, he meets a prostitute named Vivian, she's not only attractive, but she's smart. She knows about car and end up driving him to the hotel. So, when he invites for just one night, that will turns into one week, plot-wise, the machine is working.""I want the fairy tale"" she admits later, with an innocence that sweeps off all the dirt that has tarnished her life since she started walking on the streets. Never in the film, had she felt more sincere and more naively appealing. All little girls want the fairy tale, and that quote, if one thing, highlights the fact there still is that 'little girl' sparkle in Vivian's eyes, and her profession is only a logical consequence to unfortunate circumstances. But the film doesn't fall in the patronizing trap either, Vivian needs Edwards, but so does he. There's a clever parallel established by these two people's jobs, Edward buys out companies facing economic difficulties, to sell parts of them and make more profits. As she says, both screw people for money, and Edward is no more honorable than Vivian.Both hearts reflect the other's truth, that's the mark of true love and that's exactly what happens to Edward and Vivian. There's a nice subplot involving one company Edward doesn't want to buy because he likes its chairman, who's a sort of fatherly figure, wonderfully played by Ralph Bellamy, and it's only after his experience with Vivian that he realizes he doesn't enjoy his job as she did and might have chosen the wrong path for some obscure Oedipal reasons. Vivian, didn't embrace her career with more passion either, but maybe she kept on hoping of a real love, one that would be incarnated by the only thing she couldn't give her customers: a kiss. And the pay-off comes when she tenderly kisses a sleeping Edward in the mouth, at that point, we know she loves him.""Pretty Woman"" doesn't overplay the whole Pygmalion-theme, that one is handled by Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager who, from despising Vivian, grows fond on her and teaches her how to properly behave. But the film doesn't use their archetypes for the sake of cheap laughs, it doesn't need to, Roberts is hilarious because she stays natural in a world she doesn't belong to, and never condescending either, Edward is inspired by her spontaneity, something that cruelly lacks in his work of sophistication and cynical materialism, incarnated by his friend and lawyer, played by Joe Constanza. Constanza, as the only true antagonist of the film, is responsible of one of the film's saddest parts, after Gere comforted him that Vivian wasn't a spy. After being approached like a cheap prostitute, you could feel she was truly hurt by Edward's betrayal.And this is what the film is about, two persons who don't want to be reduced to condescending label, one in the highest, and another in the lowest extreme. Being treated like a prostitute is the ultimate insult for Vivian because it totally negates her struggle to let her personality finally bloom, as Edward knows he's not that rich prick who only thinks in green bills. It's all about becoming yourself. I don't intend to make the film sound like an existential journey; it's still a heart-warming comedy but more intelligent and subtle than any comedy made today. And I'm sure in retrospect; many critics who despised the films would feel guilty for having labeled ""Pretty Woman"" too straightforwardly as a banal and commercial romantic comedy.Rom-com, chick-flick, Cinderella story, feel-good story  cinematic jargon is rich of epithets to describe Garry Marshall's ""Pretty Woman"". Yet these words are too convenient and tend to veil the true poignancy and endearing chemistry between the two leads. Yes, we have the rich workaholic businessman with a disastrous sentimental life, meeting the streetwise hooker, with a heart of gold, but when played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts whose shining smile illuminates the screen like a lamppost in Hollywood Boulevard, the film turns out to far better than some cynical minds might expect.At the end, I was left wondering: aren't the so-called stereotypes the names we give to obligatory plot devices when they're wrongly handled?",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Repetitive and Downright Offensive Movie,"Pretty Woman is about a street prostitute who one day meets a rich man driving in a Lotus. Originally the man plans to use the woman but as the story progresses they fall in love.When the street prostitute goes into nice hotels, her clothes, her behavior, etc is out of place. The two cultures collide. What I found repetitive about the movie is how it goes on and on about these differences. She doesn't know how to tip, she doesn't know how to dress, and so on. I got the message early on, but the movie had to keep giving me more and more examples of how she was different.Not only was the ending of this movie predictable but it also made me cringe because what the man did was so embarrassing. You'll have to see it for yourself, but the ending is just so Hollywood.All in all, this movie is a encyclopedia of stereotypes, a movie that glamorizes the patriarchal world-view that rich men in fast cars will make any woman's problems disappear with the signing of a marriage certificate just like the idea in the old sexist days that knights in shining armor will sweep the princess of her feet.

Stardom for Julia,"My review was written in March 1990 after a Times Square screening.Julia Roberts delivers a star-making performance in Disney's crowd-pleasing romantic comedy ""Pretty Woman"". Despite its obvious flaws, Garry Marshall's sentimental pic hits the right emotional targets to shape up as a monster hit.J. F. Lawton's formula screenplay owes plenty to ""Pygmalion"", "":Cinderella"" and ""The Owl and the Pussycat"" in limning a fairy tale of a prostitute with a heart of gold who mellows a stuffy businessman.Pi's first two reels are weak, as corporate raider RIchard Ger is unconvincingly thrown together with streetwalker Julia Roberts when he seeks directions to Beverly Hills while driving a sports car borrowed from his lawyer, Jason Alexander.Roberts shows him how to drive the Cobra and soon inveigles her way into his penthouse hotel suite. Seducing this reluctant john, she's improbably hired by Gere to spend the week with him as escort since he's split up with his girlfriend and has big dinner on tap with shipbuilder Ralph Bellamy, his takeover target. Her price tag is $3,000; film's cryptic shooting title was ""3000"".Fortunately for Marshall and the viewer, the film blossoms along with Robert at around the 30-minute mark, when she doffs her unflattering Carol Channing blonde wig to get natural and embark on a massively entertaining (and class conscious) shopping adventure on Rodeo Drive.Roberts handles the transition from coarse and gawky to glamorous with aplomb, aided by Marilyn Vance-straker's appropriate costuming. Pic climaxes somewhat unconvincingly with previously unscrupulous Gere suddenly turning into Mr. Nice Guy and deciding to team up with Bellamy ""to build boats together"" instead of stealing his company. Industryites will note the cute parallel to Disney's own salvation and expansion following a Texan white knight's intervention six years ago. Act III is a bit corny as the inevitable parting leads to a predictable fairy tale ending for Roberts.Pic's casting is astute with Gere undeplaying like a sturdy ballet star who hoists the ballerina Robers on his shoulders. Underlying tastelessness of the material is diffused by placing the sex scenes mainly off-screen, keeping nudity to a bare minimum and contriving that Gere is the sex object on screen, notably in a bathtub scene together.Sexiest routine is almost identical with a ""Fabulous Baker Boys"" vignette: Gere playing solo jazz piano late at night in the hotel ballroom and joined for a tryst by Roberts.Supporting cast is outstanding. Hector Elizondo, a regular in all of Marshall's features takes the Alan Mowbray-style hotel manager role to understatedly set up (and steal) a dozen scenes with precise comedy timing Laura San Giacomo is perfect as Roberts' roommate and voice of prostitute experience. Larry Miller is hilarious improvising comebacks when Gere takes Roberts shopping in his store, and Patrick Richwood does terrific takes as the elevator operator who sees all.Lavish production is glossy and properly unrealistic. Roy Orbison's title hit song is played twice to good effect.",,Anonymous,Romance
Here is my rather odd observation?,"Richard Gere's character is rich, powerful, successful. So he is used to ordering people around, his lawyer, everybody. He buys companies, strips them for the assets, sells ruthlessly.There is a background story which is only hinted at as he meets a chick, and... How does someone like that form a meaningful relationship? I guess it happens all the time with rich and successful people, the partner (male or female) has to accept, and cope with all that the other one is. The main person has somehow, to maybe come down a peg or three and adjust to the wants and needs and attitudes and ambitions of the other person.We do see a bit of this conundrum in Pretty Woman, but it is a thought that should, or could, be developed a lot more.The special parts of PW is the obvious enjoyment that Gere and Roberts show each other. They must have really enjoyed the whole process. I did too. And I loved the few scenes with Laura San Giacomo... "" Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch.""",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Way Overrated and Stud Millionaires Don't Fall for Hookers,"Calling this movie a romance is pretty much a disgrace. Let's not forget something. The heroine is a hooker! The hooker with the heart of gold! Please! I don't buy at all that Richard Gere, as a millionaire or even a $40,000 a year salesman, would fall in love with the hooker, Julia Roberts. First of all, Julia Roberts isn't all that hot. It's hard to even call her ""pretty"", the first word in the tittle of the movie. She's not ugly, but she's just a little above average, bordering on pretty. That aside, stud millionaires do not fall in love with hookers. They might pay one from time to time, but they don't fall in love them. The whole premise of this movie is idiotic, so the movie is unsuccessful to me as a whole. All that aside, Gere was very good in the film, and Roberts acting was also very good. The movie had outstanding production value and certain characters, like the one played by Jason Alexander, were interesting. So, as a total score, I give Pretty Woman a five.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Non-Romantic Film,"Firstly I heard many people keeps saying that it's the best romantic comedy film and Julia got an award for the best actress. Well, people are probably right about Julia's acting but her role seems doesn't fit her and the film is not romantic, it's a kind of relationship drama. (I didn't realise the type of Vivian's character even I never read a description of this film)I've watched it for the first time after 30 years since it was released. It's a simple story about when a rich guy(Edward) meets a poor lady(Vivian) then they're started to talking and kissing each other.I don't understand one big thing, how can they didn't realise that they are in love at the near end of film after alot of kissed and slept on the same bed? There is no display of strong love affection between Vivian and Edward. In real life, love is powerful and there are so many meaning if people understand what it does mean when they're interact each other before turn into a relationship. I hardly accept if he wants her for a part of his life because he should better know about her partly life. (you may know that this film was supposed to be darker but the script has been changed).The story isn't interesting and it's not quite enjoyable film. There are few funny spoken lines, Julia looks so lovely but her type of character is wrong and Richard seems sensible but the connection between them doesn't work, a director/producer should pick someone else.",,Anonymous,Romance

What a gem!,"Seriously, people are gonna tell you it never happens in real life but I think the script has more meaning to it. It portrays that every prostitute don't dream to be a prostitute but life and circumstances might force them to do so. Julia Roberts does an amazing job in bringing Vivian's character to life, both as a prostitute and a ""conservative"" pretty woman. It's like in Titanic where Leonardo goes to Dinner with the highballers but does so smoothly that no one notices he doesn't belong there. Richard Gere was great in his role, but being a billionaire, what are the chances that he would take home a prostitute from the street and listens to her advice on multi-billion business deals? Quite unlikely, but his acting, the soft tone, zero emotional reactions, harsh while being romantic at times made it so much real. Although this is the ""Cinderella"" kind of movie, you won't regret watching it! It's a feel good, really good movie!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Every Cliché and then some--a film about film clichés,"I saw this last evening in Oakland's Paramount. I see maybe five movies in the course of a year. It's not my favorite artistic medium. And this film is one of the reasons why--more hype than substance.The movie soon took on an appearance of director Garry Marshall attempting to spoof past romance movies by creating sly allusions to those films in this movie. For a bit--the viewer would think that was a 5 foot 10 Audrey Hepburn walking down Rodeo Drive. The film clips of Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in ""Affair to Remember"". Julia as Vivian screaming out loud at the polo match--Audrey Hepburn--""Move your bloomin arse..."" at the Ascot. And even in the end--Richard Gere walking up the fire escape with an umbrella--""Mary Poppins""--another movie about transformation--transformation from self-centered parents to parents interested in their growing children.The movie is not really about falling in love with a prostitute. It is about transformation of a prostitute into a lady; transformation from perceiving a woman as a prostitute to seeing the woman as a wife.Transformation is a perdurable theme from Hollywood. ""A Star is Born."" ""My Fair Lady""--itself a literal takeoff on George Bernard Shaw's ""Pygmalion"". ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". ""An Affair to Remember."" The theme is a Hollywood staple and has been done with excellence by each of those cited movies. But the theme is not just a film trope, it is a trope of reality for each of these stars. The individual--Julia Roberts--transformed into mega-actress (movie star). Frances Ethel Gumm transformed into Judy Garland; Archy Leach transformed into Cary Grant; Marion Mitchell Morrison transformed into John Wayne; Benjamin Kubelsky to Jack Benny--and so on. (And for so many Hollywood types, disaster is prevented with a stroke of good judgment and discernment. Not just discernment for good movie roles but good judgment to stay away from self-destructive behavior. In the original film concept--Vivian is a cocaine user; and we all know what that is potential for.It seemed that every cliché was used in this movie--and then some. Like I say--I see maybe five movies a year; I'm glad I passed this one by in 1990. I just saw (1995) ""French Kiss"" with Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline--now that was a romantic comedy.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
not a bad role for Julia Roberts,"Julia Roberts is irritating at the best of times, but in 'Pretty Woman' she is even watchable, as is Richard Gere.  It isn't a great film, perhaps not even a good one, but it is enjoyable fluff - empty-headed plot, silly twist on the Cinderella story - which uses two assets (Roy Orbison's title song, and 30s star Ralph Bellamy as the guy who runs the firm Gere is after) very well indeed.  My favourite bit though is when Roberts goes shopping and turns from tarty hooker to high-class escort lady.  And of course, as this is a fairy tale we can guess the ending pretty early on, no paying attention required!",,Anonymous,Romance
pretty Julia,"Makes you laugh, makes you cry. Julia at her very best. When Edward is showing the beautiful necklace to Vivian and slams it shut just as she is reaching for it is an ad lib by Gere and made everyone who watched this movie roar with laughter. I never realized how much good music adds to a film as it did to this classic Roberts film. The hotel manager (mr Thompson) played his part to the hilt. In the scene where he questions Vivian and she says she is the niece of Edward, Vivian's eyes do all the acting getting small and beady eyed. The great ones have it (Bullock, Roberts) the ability to do such great acting with simply changing a facial feature. I have watched this movie twenty times and will watch it another twenty times.

A Very Good Romantic Comedy,"I have seen this movie many times and enjoyed it thoroughly. Julia Roberts gives a compelling performance as a hooker and Richard Gere as always is superb.What I enjoyed most about this movie was that here were two people that were not proud of what they had become but because of their need to be loved for the persons they really were deep inside, helped each other find themselves.I looked deeper into this movie and saw that it was not just a comedy but a story that people can change for the better when treated with tenderness, love and understanding something these two characters had not been shown for a very long time, mostly from their own bad choices, but not totally. How this movie goes about showing that, using the comedy touch is what moved me so much about this film.My favorite scene in this movie is when Edward (Gere) takes Vivian (Roberts) to an elegant restaurant for a business dinner. I think this scene is the funniest as well as the most touching scene in the movie.This movie shows that you shouldn't take people at face value and to look deeper into their character to find the real person.Sure this movie is a fairytale but it has deeper meaning as well, I rate this movie 9 out of 10. I have also seen Runaway Bride, which I think was actually a better romantic comedy because the characters were more believable and shows what I meant about not taking people at face value. I admit I prefer a deeper love story rather than a romantic comedy.If you are like me and like a deep love story and like Richard Gere than you must watch Sommersby, one of the best and most moving love stories I have ever seen and one of Richard Gere's best performances ever, if not his best.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

They don't make them like this anymore (thank the stars...),"Usually, I am in two minds when I view any film. I want to be entertained, but I want to be entertained in a fashion that doesn't completely disrespect reality or my intelligence. Unfortunately, films like Pretty Woman, and pretty much everything Julia Roberts has ever been in, do both.Granted, I have been prejudiced against fairy tales for a long time, but that was only through learning that they were, in actuality, religious stories from ancient, more respectable cultures that the Christian menace had stolen, rewritten, and basically stripped of all their significance. Unfortunately, Pretty Woman takes this even further by taking a modern ""fairy tale"" and stripping it of even the most vague connection with reality.Every adolescent boy has a fantasy about meeting the proverbial ""hooker with a heart of gold"", but those who have experienced it in real life will always tell you that it always ends in tears. Anyone who thinks that a woman can work the streets for as long as is implied in the character while retaining the youthful appearance of Roberts and remaining disease-free needs help. Seriously.So is there a redeeming feature to this turkey? Well, Laura San Giacomo puts in a reasonable performance with the limited time she has, but she has appeared in much better films both before and since. Aside from that, it's just another example of Julia Roberts phoning in her performance with an expression on her face that conjures up mental images of a brain-dead chipmunk. And yet they decided to give her the Oscar in 2000 rather than Connie Nielsen. I think the rumours that the entire Academy just picks a winner at random and never watches films at all are actually true.",,Anonymous,Romance
They are human after all..,"This is a beautiful film, and definitely worth a watch for all of the romantics out there...It's important to remember that Vivian and Edward are individuals, and not dismiss the film as unrealistic merely because, ""No, that would never happen between a prostitute and a rich guy"". Both of them aren't the typical stereotypes. They are individuals, and what began as fondness grew to something a little deeper. Edward is swept away by Vivian, who leads him away from a life that had revolved around work for years (with the unheard of day-off, walking around with bare feet), and Vivian is swept away by her ""Prince"" (with the money to shopshopshop, the trip to the opera). The story is beautiful yet plausible because they are who they are, despite their faults, and they can see through each other's occupations to the person underneath.Okay, in the real world this won't happen to everybody, and whether it will last or not is another story...

Can a prostitute fall in love?,"This movie is not about prostitution. Rather it's about a prostitute who actually grows as a person. That's plausible. It can happen. In this movie it does happen. And that is the rub. The movie is on thin ice here because the audience has to accept the premise that a prostitute can actually learn to care about her john, which is asking a lot from the audience. If the audience does not buy into the character Vivian, then the whole movie becomes unwatchable. However, Julia Roberts does such a great job as Vivian that the movie works. She was the right choice for the role; she makes the character believable. Another actress may have played the role differently with different, less satisfying results.Can a prostitute fall in love? In this movie it happens. What's the problem with that? Street hookers are people too and in this movie the street hooker changes. She wants and demands money; acts out; angles for that extra buck, but eases up when she realizes that the john who is willing to pay top dollar is also a good guy who is willing to treat her like a person, not an object. This scenario is entirely plausible. Total strangers meet under the most improbable circumstances and fall in love. This formula is classic Hollywood and in this movie the actors make it work. The man treats the woman decently and she responds. That makes for a good story. The audience wants the relationship to work.This is a wonderful, upbeat movie, about two people who actually learn to care about each other. The man is a rich, cynical business man; the woman is a prostitute. What starts out as a business proposition evolves into something special, as the two characters evolve and reveal aspects of themselves that are endearing and engaging. At the start of the movie, both characters have contempt for the opposite sex. The man is in the middle of getting a divorce; for the woman, men are mere customers, nothing more. But when they meet, the chemistry is instantaneous. These two people transcend their personal biases to let down their defenses and learn to sincerely care for each other, which changes their behavior and enhances their self-esteem, thereby making them better people. For this reason this movie is worth watching.Recently I had the opportunity to watch this movie again on a cable network. What a great movie! Talk about opportunity knocking! Ms. Julia Roberts was something like the fourth or fifth actress to be considered for the title role, and she is great in that role. The role was meant for her. She is the center of the movie. Ms. Roberts' performance is magnificent. She is THE star. Richard Gere is good, but Julia Roberts is the one who makes this movie great.

A street credible Pygmallion?,"Edward Lewis is a very rich man, but money, as everyone knows, does not buy everything, and as yet another failed relationship falls by the wayside, Edward faces up to the prospect of a hectic social week on his own. Enter a meeting with ebullient hooker Vivian Ward, who upon impressing Edward with her happy go lucky values, gets herself hired to be his escort for the week ahead, it's a week that both of them are unlikely to ever forget.It almost became the in thing to stomp all over the respective work of both Richard Gere (Edward) and Julia Roberts (Vivian), adding fuel to the fire of those with an aversion to both actors is that the crowd pleasing Pretty Woman hails from that dreaded genre known as 1980s Rom-Com. Seemingly many can now not see just what made Pretty Woman so popular back in 1990. Gary Marshall's film was the fourth highest box office taker in 1990, grossing a domestic $178,406,268, and at the same time made the date movie hip again, so basically all you Pretty Woman haters can take both those facts to the bank!As the opening credits emerge, Peter Cox (lead singer of pop band Go West) starts warbling about ""The King Of Wishful Thinking"", and never was a more appropriate song used to open such a genre piece before or since, and this is the key issue with Pretty Woman. Yes, the whole structure and plot devices are all fanciful splendour, I mean does anyone seriously think that hookers look and act like Julia Roberts? But really if you are entering this picture expecting anything other than a modern ""My Fair Lady"" like fairytale then the blinkers need to be well and truly taken off. It's also a point of worth to say that Pretty Woman has something to say outside of the main intention to lift hearts and make one smile, Marshall, aided by his screenwriter J.F. Lawton, tie in smartly the fact that Edward is as much a hustler as Vivian is, only difference being that Edward is incredibly wealthy and has therefore grown in public stature.Both Roberts and Gere have brilliant chemistry, so it was no surprise to see they would work together again in 1999 on ""Runaway Bride"", and both actors are helped immeasurably by splendid support from Hector Elizondo as the hotel manager, Barney Thompson. The picture is laced with joyous moments that hark back to the golden days of screwy comedies laced with unlikely romances, and this was something that clearly struck a chord with cinema goers back on the film's original release. Yes it's a touch over sweet at times, and yes the ending is never really in doubt, but if you are prepared to invest some fluffy chilled out time with Pretty Woman then you can see and feel just why it was the big hit it was back at the start of the 90s. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The premise is absurd, but the movie's irresistible","Let's face it, the subject matter in ""Pretty Woman"" is iffy, and it makes for an unlikely fairy tale (although, between you and me, Disney could use more movies with prostitutes in its catalog). And the movie's charms might not work at all depending on how you approach this.But I don't think Julia Roberts has ever been more likable than she is here, and that quality runs throughout the cast (except for Jason Alexander, going for maximum douchebag). It's fascinating reading about some of the edits made during production as this could've been a much darker movie. But it came out more than alright.All of the pieces fall into place nicely here, and with Roberts and Gere, it's no wonder this was such a big hit. Is it reality?

Sweet,"It's a bad message to send to young girls that if you become an prostitute and meet a nice rich man to call for your services, he'll fall in love with you despite you disease-potential background.

She had to be to carry the movie and for you to fee bad for her when people told her what she was. It was funny and charming and all of that mushy stuff. Some nice choice of music as well. Still, as hardened as she was, Viv seemed to know very little about being a prostitute. I know she was new, but come on. I imagine they catch on quick, if not something quick. Edward was just lost when he met her and remained that way for most of the movie until he decides that 6 days with her is enough to love her and sweep her off her feet. I don't buy movies like that, but hey, it's Hollywood. And the guy in the beginning and end does point out, ""What's your dream?"" Jason Alexander was a sleaze and a good one.

"Pretty Woman, Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!","Welcome to Hollywood! What's your dream? Everyone has a dream. Without doubt Pretty Woman is a product of the Hollywood dream factory where you can imagine yourself being Cinderella, or anyone else in the world for that matter, for two hours plus pop corn. Having said that, unless you take Hollywood fantasies soooo seriously you're ready to throw something at the screen, Pretty Woman is one of the sweetest, most enchanting movies imaginable, a drama about sex (very little shown) and over-the-top consumption that, after 25 years, has taken on iconic, if not classic status and is now the highest grossing romantic comedy of all time.The terrific performances of Julia Roberts (nominated for an Oscar), Richard Gere, and Jason Alexander is the main factor that makes the film so special, but it also contains memorable lines, a relationship with believable chemistry, and a satiric portrait of the excesses of consumer spending and elitism. It is after all, a comedy and the film does not attempt to explore the dark corners of Hollywood, though there is talk that originally the ending was much different. While there is talk of a crack addict being pulled out of the dumpster and drug dealers hounding Vivian (Roberts), we never really find out what in Vivian's background led her to the choice she made or really learn what turned Edward (Richard Gere) into a cold and calculating money grubber.The characters that we do see, however, are authentic. They are fragile individuals who have the ability to see possibilities beyond their self-defeating cynicism. Those who think that Pretty Woman glamorizes a sordid profession are quiet when it comes to the high-priced call girls in Breakfast at Tiffany's and Verdi's La Traviata (an opera the film pays homage to), or to Don Giovanni which depicts a compulsive seducer who cannot see past his own sense of entitlement. It is no revelation to say that Pretty Woman is unrealistic and lacks character depth but, in its own way, it is a celebration of the resiliency of the human spirit and its capacity for transformation.

But I couldn't buy much of what I saw to the point of distraction. For instance: Vivian was a prostitute who couldn't pay her rent and was intimidated by a couple of sales clerks then in the course of a few days we are suppose to believe her outlook had changed so much that she would turn down Edward's offer to 'keep' her without a second thought. Then we are suppose to believe in the same amount of time Edward goes from buying Viv's companionship to wanting to set her up in an apartment to overcoming his fear of heights in order to impress her. Also this story probably could have been told better as a drama without having to lose any of it's comic moments.,4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty Good,"A romantic comedy that made squillions at box offices around the world, 'Pretty Woman' was of the most popular films of the 90's - and deservedly so.With Richard Gere and Julia Roberts (who's chemistry could blow up a science lab) playing the leads, it was almost surely a hit. Roberts plays a street hooker, who is picked up by Gere, who was actually only asking for directions.He offers her $3000.00 to be his partner for a week, but things didn't work out as planned. Julia finds that she doesn't really fit in with the prim-and-proper expectations of swanky Beverly Hills. But no matter, the pair end up falling in love, and for all those soppy romantics, the final scene will no doubt make you happy.Laura San Giacomo (Just Shoot Me) plays Julia's hooker-friend, and with some pretty groovy music, 'Pretty Woman' is a winner.",,Anonymous,Romance

"""Mistress into maid"" of the late twentieth century","About this movie enough to say one thing: ""It's standard"", in the broadest sense of the word. The standard of the love of melodrama. Sample of the lyric comedy. The standard of harmonious combination of literary text and visual image. The measure of a whole generation of movies of the 1990s: Indecent proposal, Sleepless in Seattle, French kiss, You've got mail, Notting Hill, etc.After receiving the baton from the cinema of the 1980s, in which the romantic side of the relationship was imbued with a hint of nostalgic sadness, film made by Garry Marshall sets a new vector in understanding when and from which arises the situation of attraction between a man and a woman.The fact of how at first the Director had planned to remove social drama (millionaire + prostitute addicted to drugs), and then was forced to switch to lyric comedy, is well known. Thanks to this fact approach to the conflict between a man and a woman remained as a real drama. For example. The film is saturated with a large number of contrasts: a pessimistic smart hero and an optimistic beautiful heroine, a world of pure luxury and a dark place of depravity, a large planned business and a small random freelance. There are a lot of different details in the cultural area of the film. Every detail is like a little story. It has its place, its important phrase, its directorial promise.Prostitution is not the easiest way of getting money. We know it from the first minute of the film, when Vivian sees the body of her friend-hooker in the street. To further this thought is repeated in different ways. There are many similar details in the life of the heroine and in the fate of ""Ladies with camellias"". Basically, a comedy is an easy movie. The audience laughs when they see the problems of the hero. But when we see the Vivian's problems, we want to help her.The vulnerability and optimism of the heroine is strong parts of her image. Vivian appears before Edward as the cute baby and as the fury, as the plain man and as the posh woman, as the nerdy and as the neophyte. Russian writer Ivan Bogdanovich said: ""My Darling! You are very beautiful in any clothes"". The phrase reflects the Vivian's attractiveness. For me, she is not Cinderella (A lot of people think so). For me, she is a sort of ""mistress into maid"". She is beautiful, playful, assertive and wise every day.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
fantastic film about powerful boy meets marginalised but pretty girl,"If you are a romantic, you will love this film. Not only is he rich, powerful and from a very good background, she has been exposed to the bad and consequently has had a not so fortunate life. However he comes on the scene......romantic, cute, adorable even cynics with see cuteness in this couple who exude such chemistry you wonder why they never got it together in real life...Julia Roberts as Viv is pretty as usual, innocent in a weird way considering the character she is playing, gauche and unsure of how to be herself in front of Richard Gere who plays Edward. Edward on the other hand is the opposite, sure to the point of arrogance but a kind of arrogance that is utterly sexy...Go watch it, its fantastic",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the TOP TEN MAKEOVER movies...,"Pretty Woman is one of the ""Beast Makeover Movies"" of our times. BTW, I am a huge fan of makeover films. I love watching ""before and after"" type stuff in movies, TV shows...just about anything. In fact, I am kinda addicted to that stuff and seek it out. I even love shows like The Swan and Dr. 90210. My friends and I love Kim Kardashian (and NEVER miss KUWTK) because of how beautiful she is (even if she has never really actually done anything in movies). But she looks like what most of us aspire to, but don't...which BTW, DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE ARE UNHAPPY AT ALL. We just appreciate beautiful looking people like some others appreciate beautiful art or beautiful scenery.With that in mind, my friends and I have compiled a list of ""10 BEST MAKEOVER MOVIES"" of recent times (after 1995).And here they are: (in random order) 1) CLUELESS 2) PRETTY WOMAN 3) THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA 4) JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE 5) MAID IN MANHATTAN 6) MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING 7) SHE'S ALL THAT 8) MISS CONGENIALITY 9) MEAN GIRLS 10) AMERICANIZING SHELLEY.Although, personally...CLUELESS is #1 and all the others are #2.I am also putting together a different list of ""10 BEST MAKEOVER MOVIES"" of all times (prioe to 1995). Please do post me a message voting for your ""10 BEST MAKEOVER MOVIES"" prior to 1995.

Hooker fairytale,"Pretty Women is an absolute American film classic. There are some Americans out there that haven't seen it but I know they must have at the very least heard of it. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere star as the films romantic leads. Julia is a prostitute in Hollywood who gets in this very rich man's car one night to give him directions in exchange for money. This man is of course Richard Gere. They go to his fancy hotel and talk and hang out and eventually get to sex before the night is over. I enjoyed the dialogue in the film very much, Roberts and Gere have some really good writing in the scenes they share together. And Roberts is just perfect in the role, I don't think anyone else could've played her character nearly as well as she did. And the same thing goes for Richard Gere, very professional actor, very calm demeanor, and I think that worked for his character in this movie. Another actor that I loved in the movie was hector elizondo, I don't particularly know why but I just loved seeing him interact with Roberts and kind of be her guiding hand with some things she had to learn. It was sweet and charming. The romantic chemistry is very natural and it flows nicely throughout between the two. I liked the sex scenes, I thought they were beautifully done, very well filmed and romantic. All in all I suggest this 1990 romantic comedy-drama because it is just charming and features great performances. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best casting jobs ever,"If there was ever a movie that deserved an Academy Award for casting, this is it. Every role is impeccably filled, from Richard Gere and Julia Robers in the leads, all the way to Abdul Salaam El Razzac as the Happy Man (""Welcome to Hollywood, what's your dream?""). Yes, the story is catchy and the screenplay is wonderful, but what makes this movie so compelling is the way absolutely every role contributes to the overall tapestry, a tribute to Garry Marshall's attention to detail. Laura San Giacomo, Jason Alexander and Hector Elizondo are at their best in supporting roles, and even the bit parts - Elinor Donohue as Bridget the saleswoman, James Patrick Steward as the bellboy, R. Darrell Hunter as Daryl the limo driver, and so many others (the patronizing salesman, the snobs at the polo match, everyone) - are perfectly cast. It is this, I think, more than any other characteristic, than has prevented a Pretty Woman sequel - and Hollywood has been clamoring for one for nearly 20 years. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to duplicate the ensemble synergy here. Besides, who needs a sequel when the original just gets better every time you watch?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Opposites attract, and make each other better for it.","It can be argued, and I will make that argument, that this movie was the kick-start to the great career Julia Roberts has had. Yes, I enjoyed her in the 1988 ""Mystic Pizza"", but here she became a star.Richard Gere is Edward Lewis, wealthy high-powered businessman, in town for a deal. His company doesn't produce anything, they take things apart. He buys struggling companies then breaks them into pieces to sell off, making money in the process. ""Sort of like stealing cars then sending them to a chop shop"", Vivian muses. Except legal. For him it is strictly business, he doesn't care what becomes of the companies or the people who work for them.Quite by accident he meets Julia Roberts as Vivian Ward, when he is out in his lawyer's car and asks directions of her. She is the opposite of Edward, she is a high school dropout, she followed a boyfriend to Los Angeles, after they broke up she worked wherever she could, like parking cars, to pay rent and eat. But she couldn't survive so she became a hooker.At first Edward just wants to hire her for the night, just for the company. Then, finding out he needs a date later, hires her for the week, to be his employee for $3000. Being a Garry Marshall movie, what transpires becomes Vivian influencing Edward to change, to care more about the impact of his deals. At the same time Vivian changes, learning how to be a bit more normal and aspiring to go back to school to complete high school.It is all a modern fairy tale, it even has fairy tale references where she says she used to dream of a Knight climbing a tower to rescue her. It is all a highly unlikely story but we enjoy it for the sweetness, and of course the two stars.I found it streaming today on Peacock, I had watched it before but a long time ago. Gere was about 30 and Roberts about 22 during filming. Gere is a musician, he even plays a piano piece that he composed.",,Anonymous,Romance

STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...The movie that made Julia Roberts a star. ""Pretty Woman"" was an instant classic - a 'fairy tale' for a modern age. And I absolutely love it, even after all these years.""Welcome to Hollywood!"" - When Edward Lewis loses his girlfriend on the eve of one of his biggest corporate deals, he finds himself driving his lawyer's Lotus Esprit and lost on Hollywood Boulevard where he finds a prostitute named Vivian Ward. He picks her up and she shows him back to where he is staying - the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Taken with her, he offers for her to stay the night and she accepts. The next morning, he offers to pay her to be his 'beck and call girl' for the entire week, and again she accepts. As they get to know each other, they become close until Vivian finds herself falling in love with Edward, and Edward becomes less bitter and finds a new lease on life.I remember seeing this the year it came out and falling in love with it. The chemistry between Richard Gere and Julia Roberts was perfect. I cannot imagine anybody else playing their roles and pulling it off nearly as well. Julia Roberts took the world by storm in this role and immediately became a household name and hasn't looked back since.This comes at the highest recommend possible. All the side characters are lovable, the story engaging, the music is memorable, and the fantasy elements are enticing. It's charming, touching, funny, and at times sad and poignant. This is the blueprint for romantic comedies. It really doesn't get any better than this - and it is still just as good and entertaining today as it was in 1990.

Absolutely incredible!,"I am in love with this movie. Definitely in my top 5. I have watched it not less than 15 times at least, and sometimes even back to back. The actors have portrayed their roles really well, the scenes are a lovely reminder of late 1980's, and the songs blend in really well. Julia Roberts was perfect, she's independent, happy, and portrays a positive role for women, because it's not that she was rescued by a millionaire and transformed from being a prostitute, but her dedication to change to the betterment for herself. She wanted to do well in life, and she saw this opportunity to improve. I give this movie a 10/10 as not many movies have me watching them so often, and making me genuinely feel a part of them.

Roberts is terrific in this fun variation on PYGMALION,"In the film that made her an international superstar overnight, Julia Roberts is funny, charming, gorgeous, lovable, poised, and tons of other terrific adjectives. Just like Katharine Hepburn in the forties and Barbra Streisand in seventies, Roberts managed to take her own weaknesses (in her case, her large mouth, pointy eyes, huge teeth, and clumsy demeanor) and turn them into assets. In PRETTY WOMAN, Roberts made being good-naturedly gawky look chic and sexy. Anyone who still wonders why this woman became the top box office star of the nineties needs to re-watch this film again.As for the film's story, it's basically yet another variation on PYGMALION/MY FAIR LADY, but it is totally energized by Robert's fresh and incandescent presence. Richard Gere is fine but a little on the stoic side as Roberts' modern-day Henry Higgins (I couldn't help but wish he would have displayed some more of his trademark intensity), but Laura San Giacomo and Hector Elizondo shine in memorable supporting roles. Best of all is veteran screen star Ralph Bellamy (THE AWFUL TRUTH, HIS GIRL Friday) who (at age 86) is funny and touching as Gere's business nemesis/father figure. Deftly directed by audience-pleaser Garry Marshal, PRETTY WOMAN is a must for individuals who like the romance emphasized in their romantic comedies.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Classic Fairytale,"Julia Roberts gives an expertise performance in this CLASSIC 1990 movie 'Pretty woman' although many people claim this film as offencive, but i see it a GREAT film which catapulted Julia into Hollywood maybe without this starter film for Julia she may not be where she is today. Personialy Julia Roberts is my Favourite actress she maintains an outstanding quality to her performances with her BIG EYES and MEGA-WOT SMILE. The film was excellent it is also similar to her 1999 NOTTING HILL which the story-line is the opposite instead of Julia 'VIVAN WARD' being brought from 'Rags to Riches' in NOTTING HILL she is the millionaire and brings William Thacker (Hugh Grant) to his Rags to Riches. Pretty Woman a funny romantic great film which should not be taken seriously. It's an amazing tale of a prostitute who is discovered one night by a rich millionaire businessman he takes her to his Penthouse he pays her $3000 dollars for the week and expect it to be the end...but on the cover and the plot it says fairytale so you know it is going to be a happy ending and of course it is it's a 10/10 film which is know more than a bitter-sweet comedy of which can be taken with a pinch of salt it's one of the best films of 1990 and is still loved WELL DONE JULIA YOU WERE THE STAR OF THE FILM",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Near The Top Of Its Type,"Does Pretty Woman fall victim to some of the inherent faults of its genre? Probably so. But I would say that taken all for all it steers clear of those tropes, like being too sappy or corny; at least to a point where it seriously harms the film. The formula that it sets is a simple one and maybe it shouldn't really work, but somehow it seems to.There's not much in the way of a plot and nearly every turn in the story can be seen a mile away, which basically leaves the entire thing resting on Richard Gere and Julia Roberts and the chemistry between them. And judging by the success of this film I think the result is obvious. The picture grossed over 400 million, as well as giving Gere a resurgence to his career and launching Roberts'. Her vibrant performance garnering her an Oscar nomination(which she might have won if Kathy Bates and Misery weren't around) and catapulted her to star status overnight.Pretty Woman is far from being an even close to perfect film, but with the right actors and some strong writing and directing it surpasses what it very well could have been and sits near the top of its type.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

I have nothing but good things to say about this movie,"I can't remember the first time that I saw it but whenever it was I was hooked. It's a classic fairytale of course with the hooker twist. When I was in college we had to look at this movie for a Advertising and Society class and analyze it. We touched on the begging scenes with the street person saying `Hollywood the land of dreams' and of course at the end when Vivian's dreams came true. I think that is hands down the best performance that I've ever seen from both Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. She played Vivian with such heart and it was so cool to see Richard break down her walls. One of the topics that we covered in my class was continuity. I know that I'm not the only one who noticed that during the scene when they eat breakfast for the first time we see her eating a pancake and when it cuts back to her she's eating a croissant. I laugh every time.Pretty Woman is a love story that stands the test of time. 14 years later, I still watch it when it's on HBO. I watched it again about 2 weeks ago. It's so cool to see what was considered fashionable back thenpokadots!?!?!? Those were the good old days.

One of the best romantic comedies ever made,"I remember watching this film when it first came out. Even as someone who at the time did not care for romantic comedies, I actually liked it. I mean, it was not another Eisenstein or Kubrick, but for what it was, it worked for me. That was some quarter of a century ago.Then, recently I started watching all those romantic comedies that I avoided over the years, and this one came up. Why not - let's see how I feel about it now.And I must admit, I was stunned, in the most positive way! Again, this is not Citizen Kane or City Lights. It is a fair tale set in the modern times, but what I loved about it, now that I have a few more years of experience under my belt, was that it was crafted with incredible attention to detail.Everything, and I mean EVERY little thing was done impeccably: the smooth setup at the beginning, gentle and interesting enough that we are never bothered by how unrealistic it is. The dialogues which are never forced. Scenery, which obviously being set in Beverly Hills could not be better. And finally, the ending which works so well.I generally don't believe in films created by a committee. Pretty Woman went through so many re-writes and test screenings that one cannot recognize the original idea in the final result. The original was supposed to be a gritty story about a hooker, and while more realistic, it could never achieve what the fairy tale story about a nice hooker with a big heart could achieve - that great feeling that there is still love in the world that maybe, just maybe, things could turn out really well for anyone. Yes, call me delusional or romantic, but all that really works in this film.They say that there was a lot of improvisation in the scenes, and they were shot many different ways. I have also seen other films by Gary Marshall and was not impressed at all. This is the only one I liked. I am tempted to believe that the director was helped by the editor or someone like that to polish out what must have started as diamond in the rough.Again, if you have not seen this film yet (highly unlikely), don't expect some ""haute cinema""; but do expect some great fun, and a decent romance mixed together. One must admire the fact that such a fairy tale was made in modern times and that it manages to keep one believing in it. Never was I reminded that I was just watching a film - that's how well put together it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A classic, ""Pretty Woman"" is, on a small scale, American commercial cinema at its best, for being able to transform any gray reality into an unforgettable good dream","Discreetly directed by Garry Marshall, the feature features a light and relaxed narrative, full of humorous moments, such as the important business dinner between Edward and the ""Morse"", in which Vivian tries not to embarrass herself, or when Vivian says that "" I would have stayed for two thousand"" and Edward replies that he would ""pay up to four"". But despite the discretion, Marshall shows competence especially in driving the actors, extracting great performances from his romantic partner. The director also demonstrates sensitivity in several moments, such as when the two kiss for the first time, composing a subtle shot that illustrates, through the bed rail, that they were now attached to each other. Marshall is also subtle when indicating sex when the two are alone at the piano, moving the camera slowly away and darkening the screen, as if leaving the place to make the couple more comfortable. In another moment, after presenting a close-up of the various cutlery in Vivian's training, Marshall uses a zoom out to illustrate how intimidated she felt in that situation. And even the most obvious shots work well, like the one in which Vivian is on the hotel balcony remembering the story of the princess trapped in the tower or in the character's introduction sequence, which first shows the body parts, then the clothing accessories and then Vivian's face, highlighting the requirements of that profession in order of importance.But despite the clear social differences that separate Edward and Vivian, the two have many similarities, something illustrated with good humor by the millionaire when he says that ""we are both similar, we f*** people for money"". But both suffered from emotional deprivation for different reasons. Edward was unable to establish a relationship, probably because he gave himself too much to the profession and offered little time to his companions, while Vivian had difficulty in never believing that a client could actually like her, which is understandable, considering that the vast majority of clients behaves similarly to Phillip (Jason Alexander), seeing her only as an object of desire and nothing more. Together they learn from each other. Vivian discovers a lifestyle she never imagined she would have access to, but above all, she meets a man capable of treating her with dignity, seeing beyond the curves of her body, which motivates her to leave prostitution (""I'm going to go back to school"", says to colleague Kit). Edwards, on the other hand, learns to enjoy life's little pleasures, something illustrated through little things like putting his foot on the grass, which is certainly something he would never do before meeting Vivian.Separated twice (from his wife and his mistress), Edward is a professionally successful man, but who clearly faces problems relating to someone, as is evident in his conversation with an ex-girlfriend at the opening party. Richard Gere does very well in the role, demonstrating how Edwards is a centered, restrained and even antisocial man. The actor accurately illustrates the slow change in the character through the way he relates to Vivian, subtly indicating that he is falling in love with the girl, for example, when he feels jealous when he sees her talking to David Morse (Alex Hyde-White) or when his face of satisfaction and surprise at seeing Vivian without the wig indicates that he was beginning to see a natural beauty that had not existed in that young woman until then. Finally, Gere also stands out when Edward explodes against Phillip, showing firmness in defending Vivian.Obviously, the couple's chemistry is very important to win over the audience, and it only exists because Julia Roberts also has an excellent performance. Quite loose in the role, as we can see on her arrival at the hotel, when she catches everyone's attention with her exaggerated and unconventional way while being dazzled by the grandeur of the place, the actress convinces like a prostitute who finds a golden chance to earn a lot of money, but that ends up breaking the number one rule of the ""profession"", by getting emotionally involved with your client. Notice how she composes the character very well through small gestures, like the way she adjusts her skirt or the happy way she sings in the bathtub. Her gait also draws attention, which makes Edward constantly ask her to ""don't move so much"". And just like Gere, Julia also does well in dramatic moments, such as when Phillip discovers that she is a prostitute and says a cruel sentence, hurting Vivian deeply - and Roberts illustrates the character's sadness very well. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast does not maintain the same level of performance and, to make matters worse, we still have Phillip, a detestable character, totally one-dimensional, who certainly undermines Jason Alexander's performance.The change applies to both. Vivian would have to learn in a few hours to become a lady, walk more elegantly and dress more discreetly. The famous scene set to the film's theme song, ""Pretty Woman"", became one of the most remembered in cinema, being satirized in some other films. Edward, little by little, realizes that he lives only for work without caring about the feelings of others. He realizes that that young woman is different from the others with whom he related and that she was only looking for status and social position next to him. She really had values indifferent to her world of millionaires. It is possible to see that at every moment, they are falling in love. Sex is different every day and what used to be purely physical is giving way to feelings and passion. This factor was very well explored by director Garry Marshall. The scenes are very expressive and the protagonists are responsible for making them memorable. The opera scene, the moment when Edward puts an expensive jewel around Vivian's neck, symbolizes her transformation and represents how valuable that woman is. The play ""La Traviata"" is a summary of the film's story - the prostitute who falls in love with the rich man.From time to time, certain critics want to place ""Pretty Woman"" surrounded by feminist polemics raised by the heightened sensitivity of the present day. So, did the film age badly? Some elements gained more kitsch contours, such as the dream of being a rescued princess on a white horse and the elements of Richard Gere's character to show her social status. There are also other points, such as the fact that there are no black characters in relevant roles in the film. Nonsense from those who don't understand that films are reflections of their times and from those who always want to impose and shove their ideologies down their throats in artistic works and in society as a whole, wanting to dictate what is right or wrong. And what's more, Vivian's construction, for now, stands the test of time. There is an interesting ambiguity, even today, of her selling her body, but never selling herself or feeling cheap. Already in 1990, the character already warned: ""I can do whatever I want"". Nowadays?The predictable happy ending, with Edward arriving to fetch his princess opera and all, is quite unrealistic, admittedly, but it's well within the lighthearted purpose of the narrative. Perhaps a coherent ending, with each one going their own way, would make ""Pretty Woman"" a more mature and touching film, but it would certainly be completely out of the tone adopted until then. And it is precisely for delivering what it proposes without any major pretensions that the feature film directed by Garry Marshall and starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere pleases. Marshall had the notion that his film was light enough to go through strong themes such as prostitution without shocking or alienating the public, and for this reason he did not skimp on the stylization of life on the streets, managing to romanticize even the moments when he films the environments.Frequented by Vivian in her profession, or when she highlights the girl revealing Edward about her sad past. Nothing there is capable of repelling, only bringing the spectator closer, as if he were in fact in a world where everything is beautiful, even what is not. In this modern fairy tale, Marshall ended up going far beyond what anyone could have imagined, putting Roberts on the map and resurrecting Gere's career. Whether it's silly or not, overrated or not, it doesn't matter anymore - ""Pretty Woman"" is, on a small scale, American commercial cinema at its best, for being able to transform any gray reality into an unforgettable good dream.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best movies,"""Pretty Woman"" it has a great concept about it....and that's what I love about it. One man's dream of finding the perfect one to spend the rest of his life growing old with. Never realized he would find what he was looking for in the most unusual place. Everyone pushed her away, not understanding or knowing the reason behind the choices she made about her life. People treated her the way she was presented in the beginning but with a little love, change, and persistence, two men took a chance. One made the decision to help her when no one else would, for his own reasoning, enhancing her potential. The other one unconditionally loved her when he realized she was different. When she realized he wasn't like the others; she let her guards down around the one thing she protected the most ""her heart"". He defended and fought for her and bought the best out of her. She made heads turned because of her demeanor regardless of how she dressed. One man took a chance and his decision became the best thing that ever happened to him....",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too Bad.......To Be True,If a movie is shown many times every year on Australian Commercial T.V. ...you can be certain ITS BAD. Pretty Woman IS bad.......VERY BAD. It is Hollywood at its most defective. The script is ---awful----Julia Roberts is terrible (jusy a huge mouth with lots of teeth)..and Richard Gere should have known better. The story is about as original as a Waldorf Salad. Why do the programmers in T.V. Australia think there viewers will like this crap ?? over & over year after year. Do they think they are Idiots ?? Well maybe there right. I would rather be sitting in a dentist chair-----listening to the wonderful noise of the drill as it burrows into my enamel....and I feel nauseous--------than watching Pretty Woman. A seriously inadequate movie.,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Finally, I watched it!","First of all, I have to admit I had never watched that movie, even though I knew that it was a very well-known movie and it was considered as one of the best romantic movies ever made. Eventually, I decided to watch it and I'm so glad that I did it, because I enjoyed it, a lot. The movie synopsis was interesting and probably it was kinda innovative because there weren't any movies similar to this one in the 90's. The storyline was very well-written, well-explained and easy to understand. The two main characters (Vivian and Edward) were both very interesting, well-developed and likeable. Also, the casting choices were nice and their performances were great. In my opinion, it was a very funny movie and there were too many iconic scenes during the movie. Moreover, the romance was very well portrayed in the movie. The ending scene was predictable, but it was very lovely and I enjoyed it. Overall, ""Pretty Woman"" was an enjoyable feel-good romantic film, funny and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romantic Dream Come True!!!!,"From leather to fur, from costume jewelry to fine jewelry, from LA streets to high class parties, and from prostitute to princess, Julia Roberts lights up the screen as Vivian Ward in the beautiful and romantic comedy,""Pretty Woman.""

Julia plays the prostitute Vivian and Richard is the successful businessman Edward who does nothing but work. The two of them meet by coincidence and Edward hires Vivian for business meetings. But they realize that they fit really well together, and their relationship develops throughout the film. We all know the classic scene from shopping on Rodeo Drive - that is my favorite scene in the film. I owe the directer's cut version of the film, and I find that even more superb than the original version. It has more details in it, more scenes about Vivian's life and the street and the environment she lives in. I can watch it over and over again, and I'm not really into sobbing/romantic films, but this film has a nice mix of romance and humour. A A-class film!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unbelievable fairytale still enjoyable,"This film has been criticized as being unrealistic and fake.  When you think about it, a real-life fairytale is just that, unrealistic, not true to life. If you are jaded you understand that this story of happiness cannot happen within the constraints of our society but we all want something to believe in that, while unattainable, is still grossly appealing and totally distracting from our every day life.  This is what this film is, a pleasant diversion.  If you see this and recognise it, then you can deal with it and move on.  This film is a great piece of fluff, easy to watch time and time again.  We all want it even though we cannot have it.  Thus we live vicariously through the too beautiful Julia Roberts and have an excellently unreal goodtime.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Horrible,"Okay ladies, repeat after me:  THE WOMAN IS A PROSTITUTE...I remember when this movie came out.  I was in the fifth grade and not allowed to see it because it was about a PROSTITUTE.  So, I don't know, I think about two years ago I saw a copy of it in my parents video cabinet and popped it in to the VCR - and was so disgusted that I turned it off about a third of the way through (and trust me, I wanted to turn it off earlier). It embarrasses me to know that this is what is known as a ""chick flick""... I mean, I like romance when it's not utter tripe and it's not about PROSTITUTES...  I just had a hard time caring for any of these characters. If Gere had maybe paid her to spend time with his and then not have his way with her whenever he felt like, maybe I could have enjoyed and respected this film.  Walt Disney must have turned in his cryogenic chamber when this film came into his company's hands.  This movie was worse than Dirty Dancing!...  and WHY was it worse, ladies???Because THE WOMAN IS A PROSTITUTE!!!What a waste.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Exactly as it should be,"This is a great movie, because it succeeded in what set out to do.It sets out to create a fairy tale and place it in a modern setting. Thecharacters know that this film isn't realistic, the audience knows itand the movie makers knew it. Anyone who critiques this film fornot being realistic enough is missing the film's point. It is a mythas old as human psychology and I see no harm in updating it for amodern audience. The true test of the film is the chemistry of the lead actors andthe effectiveness of touching the core of the human longing forsomething better. I found Gere, who is often painful to watch, to bequite well matched with Roberts and I felt the story, althoughsometimes trite, to be very effective in communicating the undyingCinderella fantasy.

If you liked the video you will LOVE the DVD!,"Pretty Woman has always been one of my favorite movies - a more mature role for Richard Gere than Officer and a Gentleman and the breakout movie for Julia Roberts, who shares my home town of Smyrna, GA.Now that I have a complete DVD home theater setup, the 10th anniversary DVD is a must have.  Garry Marshall's run through of the entire movie with commentary is fabulous and chock full of new information to me. He points out where in the movie his son, daughter, Penny's daughter and he himself briefly appear.

Just a good story...,"rather light. Julia Roberts in her defining role, she and Gere never looked better.The story is not complicated; Hector Elizondo as the hotel manager, tries to help Vivian/Julia Roberts acclimate to her sudden lifestyle change- she is Gere's escort for a week; the story could not have been a comedy if it was presented in a more realistic or darker vein.Notable performance by Laura San Giacomo as Viv's roommate; some unnecessary references to crack and street life on Hollywood Boulevard. Also a few scenes with Jason Alexander (""Seinfeld"" George Costanza) as the typically odious, greedy attorney.Ralph Bellamy is very good as a business tycoon; Gere as corporate raider who develops a conscience after establishing more than a business/sex relationship with Roberts. He begins to appreciate the less material side of life, even to enjoy spending time with Vivian/Roberts.Overall a decent film with some good scenes; no real surprises, but good if you need something uplifting. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hank Azaria gets his first speaking role in a questionable look at LA's underbelly,"Garry Marshall probably isn't the most recognizable name in entertainment. He created ""Happy Days"" (and cast his sister Penny in a supporting role) before turning to directing. After directing a few movies, he made a splash with ""Pretty Woman"", released 25 years ago this month. Considering that it focuses on a streetwise hooker who changes the life of a Gordon Gekko type, you'd think that it's something cool, right?If only. In reality, prostitutes face severe hardships, and it's unlikely that a corporate raider would change this easily (we're talking about the sorts of people who carried out hostile takeovers in the '80s). It has to be one of the most predictable movies ever. It probably wants to see itself as an indictment of rich snobs, as the Beverly Hills crowd refuses to acknowledge the hooker.As for the cast. Everyone knows Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. Garry Marshall often casts Héctor Elizondo. Ralph Bellamy played one of the Duke brothers in ""Trading Places"" (a more realistic look at big business). Judith Baldwin replaced Tina Louise in the ""Gilligan's Island"" movies. You might recognize Larry Miller from Christopher Guest's movies. Lesser known is that the movie features Hank Azaria - who had recently started providing voices on ""The Simpsons"" - in his first speaking role (Garry Marshall later appeared as a guest voice on ""The Simpsons"").All in all, it's not an impressive movie. The prostitute with a heart of gold is the oldest cliché in the book. They should have stuck with the darker screenplay that they had planned early in production. Julia Roberts starred in too many romantic comedies before she appeared in ""Erin Brockovich"". I'd like to see a mash-up of ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Army of Darkness"".",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Modern-day Cinderella story that made Julia Roberts a superstar.,"I remember back in 1990 how this film captured many peoples hearts, but the story is so hard to believe. This situation is uncommon in life. Richard Gere as businessman Edward Lewis who meets by accident a beautiful and carefree hooker played brilliant by Julia Roberts. Both teach each other about love and life. Different as light and dark with Edward being serious and Vivian always on the edge this shows love is possible for any person. That's why many like Pretty Woman so well because it is that they always hope for the rags-to-riches romance. I remember this best for the big superstar status it gave Julia Roberts.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Take care of you!""","A very entertaining film. It has its flaws, but you really don't care about them. Richard Gere re-animated a somewhat moribund career with this film by playing against type. His character is low-key, modest, quiet, and even a bit shy. And of course Julia Roberts in the title role really hit the big time with this one. She has such charm, such compelling charisma on-screen, that one doesn't notice her limited acting range. (Noticeably expanded by now, I'm speaking of her 1990 range.) For those who disparage Miss Roberts' looks, they seem immune to the spell she casts on me. True, her features are somewhat irregular, and she's a bit too thin, but that megawatt smile of hers covers every possible flaw. Laura San Giacomo did some of her best work here in a part that was regrettably much too small. Ditto for Hector Elizondo. Both came close to stealing the show, and would have definitely done so with a larger part, and a lesser performance by Roberts.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Beautiful Movie,"I found Pretty Woman to be a very touching movie. It took the darker side of life(prostitution)and made it meet with the brighter side of life(business) and created a combo that rarely takes place in this world. It made a statement that no matter who you are and where you come from, your dreams can come true.It's a fantastic thought out movie. The director should be thanked. Not by applauding for them but by shaking their hand.Rarely do you see such a movie where the high chains and low chains of life collide. The movie showed how life on the streets was horrible and how being a business person can relay so much stress into your life. But most of all it fore played how well a dreamer on the streets succeed in playing the most important role in a business man's life.Julia Roberts acted the part of Vivian the hooker to the greatest extreme. She played the part of a hooker who wanted more out of life than just a few bucks from the guys she hooked up with. Julia made the role a success therefore, leading the movie to a non stop success.Richard Gere acted as the business man who wasn't ready for a new love, especially a hooker as a lover. It was amazing though how he found it in his heart to love one that didn't come from the same side of town as he did. Very sweet and touching if you ask me.Both Roberts and Gere made a creative pair in the movie. They made the movie seem so believable. With out them two in the movie, the movie would have flopped at the box office. Their acting skills was what made Pretty Woman so touching, tender, funny, and real. Props to them all the way!Summing up, Pretty Woman gets a 10 from me. It made me believe that anything is possible.

Roberts had the exact role ten years later (Erin Borkcobich) although in ""preety woman"" she wasn't a mother (you can also say that the only thing that is alike between the characters is the sassy personality that crushes into the high society, but ill say the likeness of Erin's and Vivians's walk is stunning, and of course the language and voice. of course that the consistency of Borkovich's personality is better but this is the only difference except the maturity but in this case that how it should be). 8 out of ten.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Excellent actors starred in the film: a young and very charming Julia Roberts and a young and fantastically handsome Richard Gere. They looks great and play unbelievable. Richard Gere plays a successful businessman, he is real «prince on a white horse». Richard's character is very talented, educated, polite and just an rare man with ""an open mind».

Well-Formulated Rom-Com Encapsulates Materialistically Flashy 80s LA,"Encapsulating materialistically flashy LA in the 80s, Pretty Woman is a good showcase of well-formulated and well-executed rom-com which has always served as a mass-appealing vehicle to convey a social weather of one region in one era, usually in a superficial way, as Breakfast at Tiffany's does for the New York upper class bohemian scene in the 50s. While the combination of middle-aged lawyer Richard Gere and young hooker Julia Roberts is boring, it may be more worthy to pay attention to the details.

A Fun Romantic Comedy,"When it comes to romantic comedies, in my opinion, Pretty Woman is the standard. Every other romantic comedy since then has tried to match the magic formula that made this film so much fun.So, what is that formula? Well, first, I have to be honest: I like adventure movies. I like movies with a plot, with something to figure out, with a bad guy to beat and an exciting road to conclusion. That being said, here is why I like Pretty Woman and why I think it's the best of its genre: It's got a clever story, great actors and a director that brought them together.This is the role that defined Julia Roberts' career and she performed it perfectly. Vivian is smart, but not too clever, funny, but not a clown and charming, but not stuffy. You can't help but love this character, and that's a true testament to the actress that portrays her.Edward (Richard Gere) is the complete opposite. He is stuffy, aloof and overly serious. The fact that Vivian changes that in him is the charm of this film. She goes from a pauper to a princess and he goes from a prince to a person. That's the magic!Gary Marshall brings the characters and story to life in such a way that you can't help but enjoy this movie. Even if romantic comedies aren't your thing, Pretty Woman is for everyone. Just as the Excorcist defines horror and Star Wars defines sci-fi, Pretty Woman defines the romantic comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Entertaining - but make sure still not to take it as a fable,"Rags to riches story, of a young woman's ascent from the streets, to being the lover of a wealthy handsome businessman.Julia Roberts, in her breakout role, is charming and funny. Gere will make women and gay guys, alternately swoon and swear. Ok.Yes, it's a comedy-romance flick mainly, so we're not looking too much for in depth drama analysis on one. But, the film arguably still makes light a bit too much of the dangers and depression often associated with sex work. And frankly, does not set good examples: for assuming male protagonists as either having to always be one of either: a wealthy, smooth lothario; or an obnoxious, grabby creep. For women, they can just instantly expect and be made comfortable by a rescuer overnight, without any graft.I can't imagine it would then be made today in the same way. But as long as you understand its limitations, it has some good moments here and there. And Roberts' considerable talent shines through still, more than 30 years on.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

The best romantic film of all time,"In ""Pretty Woman,"" Julia Roberts and Richard Gere shine on screen in what is quite arguably the greatest romantic film of all time.While I wouldn't classify the film as a ""romantic comedy"" necessarily, I don't think it can really be called a drama either. I would say it's closer to the former than the latter, and in this category it stands alone, with an edge over Rob Reiner's ""When Harry Met Sally..."" courtesy of Roberts' and Gere's chemistry and the fact that I'd rather spend a couple hours watching a young Julia Roberts fall in love with a brooding Richard Gere than a too young Meg Ryan and a sardonic Billy Crystal.I also enjoy living vicariously through this movie.

"Predictable, Improbable, and Fun","This is by no means a perfect movie. OK, so what are the chances that a prostitute on Hollywood Boulevard would be this appealing?

Not that I think any girl is going to watch this movie and then go out and take up prostitution in hopes of meeting Mr. Right, but the question bears asking.There are some very memorable lines and scenes (""the bad stuff is easier to believe"" still resonates with me, even though I'm no longer the trod-upon unpopular ""ugly girl"" I once was).  The supporting cast is definitely worth watching as well; I have an especially warm spot in my heart for Hector Elizondo because of his role as Mr. Thompson, and my husband was interested to see Elinor Donahue of ""Father Knows Best"", his childhood crush, in a bit part.

A Hollywood Fairytale,I have seen this film too many times to mention and I have never tired of this charming fairytale. The plot is very simple. A young prostitute is picked up by a wealthy businessman and after spending the night with him she is offered an exorbitant sum of money to spend an entire week living in his hotel suite. She of course accepts and the rest is history.Julia Roberts launched an incredible career from this film and her sweet and vulnerable portrayal of Vivian Ward makes you warm to her almost from the very beginning. Richard Gere is suitably debonair as the cynical businessman Edward Lewis who is captivated by Vivian's charms. The chemistry here is amazing and was not to be repeated in the disastrous Runaway Bride. This films ending is possibly one of the most memorable in romantic comedy history.The important thing that critics of this film should bear in mind is that it is not meant to be taken too seriously. It is just a modern fairytale that girls everywhere can relate to on some level. Real prostitutes do not have Vivian's naivety or bubbly nature and of course in reality she would be expected to be much more jaded by her experiences. This film does glamorise the world of prostitution but this is not a serious enough film for this to warrant any real concern. Young girls will not watch this film and yearn to work the streets. They will see through to the real moral of the story which is that a persons life can change for the better no matter how bad things get. This surely cannot be a bad thing for them to learn.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Excellent Cinderella-style romantic comedy,"It's a Cinderella-style romantic comedy set in Hollywood, California, one week in the late 1980s. It follows an uneducated street sex worker, Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts), who meets wealthy corporate raider Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) when he gets lost in Hollywood's red light district. He's intrigued by her bubbly personality and invites her to the penthouse of his exclusive hotel.""Pretty Woman,"" which uses Roy Orbison's hit song, follows their relationship as Lewis plans to raid and dismantle Morse Industries, owned by Jim Morse (Ralph Bellamy), at a bargain price with the help of his tight-ass lawyer, Philip Stuckey (Jason Alexander). The other significant character is the hotel manager, Barney Thompson (Héctor Elizondo), who first challenges Vivian's presence but becomes her advocate.After not seeing ""Pretty Woman"" for years, I was surprised how well it still worked. The chemistry between Richard Gere (40-ish) and Julia Roberts (23) is excellent. Héctor Elizondo is a scene-stealer. Jason Alexander is not funny (he's a villain), but some of his verbal characteristics surface often in ""Seinfeld."" The storyline and pacing of the editing are excellent, with many memorable scenes.

Basic cable entertainment and little else,"Garry Marshall's Pretty Woman is the kind of film that etches itself in the zeitgeist and the contemporary facet of acclaimed romantic comedies for reasons that almost entirely allude me. This is a film that tries to capture the essence of human interest by focusing on a character in an uglier situation than most of her colleagues, who all seemed to get peppier, cuter romantic comedies with more uplifting narratives and occupations. Pretty Woman is a film that is tries to capture a brewing romance in a more difficult situation, but it's too busy searching for the next wickedly transformative, convenient circumstance for its characters and attempting to tie such a difficult situation together so sentimentally to really function as a compelling or original story.It isn't, however, without any merit. Thankfully, despite a rather lackluster narrative that is predictable to a fault, we do get some lively performances that remind us why romantic comedies can occasionally be charming. The most commendable and involved performance of the hour is from Julia Roberts, who plays Vivian Ward, a Hollywood hooker who works the streets with her close friend, rounding up clients and avoiding mistreatment from ruthless pimps in order to try and make whatever money she can in the moment. While she's working late one night, Edward Lewis (Richard Gere), a wealthy businessman, is driving around town lost and in search of Beverly Hills. A simple stop for directions from Vivian turns into him picking her up and having her spend the night at his beautiful apartment suite, where he, in turn, expresses disillusionment over his current place in life following a divorce. With that, we also learn Vivian's rough-go of life and how her existence is now predicated on self-reliance and the resistance to trust anyone.This is a match made in film Heaven; it's questionable if this kind of circumstance would occur on the streets of Hollywood, or anywhere in the United States, but per the rules and logic of Hollywood romantic comedies, plausibility doesn't need to be a contributing factor to the story. This film exists for those who have never lived a day in the life of Vivian to claim how difficult being a stripper must be, and to regard Vivian and Edward's relationship as one that, despite the likelihood of it being doomed in real life, inspires grins and laughs along their way of trying to remain loyal and emotionally honest to one another.As stated, Roberts commands most of her scenes in this film, not only because she is knockout beautiful in both a loud, red dress or more conservative duds, but also because of her ability to be comedic, sarcastic, dramatic, and emotionally convincing, sometimes throughout one whole scene. Gere is a more plain presence, largely because his character is more bent on squarish principles rather than making a splash, as Roberts' Vivian does with many of her scenes. Their chemistry is about as believable as this unbelievable setup could allow for, and thanks to screenwriter J. F. Lawton's recognition of this story's dark roots, turning it into a darker version of Cinderella in some sense, there's at least an added layer of human interest in the film.While Pretty Woman is certainly harmless and easily classifiable as a feel-good movie, it's a film with little merit outside of its leading female performance and a few solid one-liners. The premise, despite being largely predicated off of foreseeable moments of wit, heartbreak, misunderstandings, and miscommunications, feels the need to extend itself shortly past the two hour mark. For a film that doesn't feature enough scenes involving raw emotions being exchanged between Vivian and Edward, nor any real kind of conversations that predicate themselves upon traditional conversation patterns, it sure feels the need to exhaust its plot in a way that alludes to the idea that it does. This is fine, basic-cable entertainment, something it has turned into over the last decade, but simply little more than that.Starring: Richard Gere and Julia Roberts.

Too good to be true,"This movie is too good to be true, but I still fall in love with it. Maybe because the chemistry between Richard Gere and Julia Roberts sizzles, or, may be I still live in fairy land :). The settings are wonderful and Richard Gere seems to be really rich.

My wife calls this film a nice romance; a dream,"My ex best friend and best man Dave went too see this film.  Dave's eyes popped out at Julia, I guess they dressed her up for the male audience; Myself wanted to see Karate Dude revenge or some other mind numbing movie. I found the acting done well, Gere and Roberts have never acted bad in a film I have seen.  They have a chemistry together and should do more films. Gere ages well like a wine.  Roberts sometimes, she is a real love her or hate  type of actress. She surprises me by doing some great movies.  I probably disagree with Gere and Roberts on many issues, but the warmth they show on screen I do believe is real.  Not many people would cry and donate the money Julia did for 9/11.  Good for you Julia,  a real person who isn't a caring phoney.  The story bothered me I found the execution  of it just lacking, for the conclusion where there is hope for the 2 main characters, and their power to change and  to become better people.

Seriously?,"I never saw this movie before because quite frankly I wasn't interested in seeing a movie about a prostitute but I decided to see for myself why this movie got so many rave reviews....

How about working a real job like the rest of us? I know the answer ... because screwing men for money is much more fun 🙄

"""It Must Have Been Love!""","Pretty Woman (1990) -A modern fairytale, but definitely a fairytale, it was very hard to believe.Although it is still revered as many women's favourite romance, it was not very modern in its treatment of the ""Pretty Woman"". It still seemed to be very old fashioned in the way that Richard Gere as the shining knight came to the rescue of the feckless Julia Roberts, who did look like Carol Channing in that blonde wig.The concept of her as a prostitute was obviously more modern than that of the usual Princess in the tower to be rescued and essentially to start with she rescued him, but it still felt like he was the one in charge and leading things. It felt very much like it was set in a man's world and in some ways there might have been an element of Stockholm Syndrome about their relationship, as much as a business arrangement that surely wouldn't last once it came to an end and she became the next girl to be left at home while he continued to work. Not to mention when his ""Friends"" found out what she used to do for a living.As for the rest of the cast, I have never been a fan of Jason Alexander in anything that he's done, he's always such a snivelling toad and gets right under my skin, so I guess that he was perfect in this role.The film as a whole, was at least inoffensive, but I didn't see what the fuss was all about. There are much better films out there, with not only a better story, but also a better cast and higher quality production values too.If you don't take it too seriously though, like I obviously did, then it's a simple romance and cute in some ways.I actually think that it has similarities to 'Disney's Enchanted' (2007), which was at least meant to be more traditional in its standards and maybe it took some direction from this film, but I'll stick with 'Enchanted'.I'm not sure that 'Pretty Woman' is a film that should still be celebrated, because it's attitudes are already quite dated. I say already, but it has actually been over 30 years. It's nice to feel that we have at least moved on in some ways during that time. Moved on to films about female empowerment like 'Erin Brokovich' (2000) for instance. I wonder if Julia looks back and regrets that she didn't push for a stronger character back in 1990 when she made 'Pretty Woman' or whether she realised that it was an opportunity for her to realise what she was capable of doing and how she could change things for the better in later outings?When Julia asks Mr Gere what he wants her to do to please him sexually, I was desperate for him to say something about gerbils, but alas I don't think that story was in the public forum at the time. I definitely think that someone should do an edit of that on TikTok or something.Enjoy the film for it's simplicity or for a break from the more serious and depressing films that we are confronted by more and more these days, but don't expect too much if you're coming to it new in the 21st century.465.03/1000.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Light fare in a much darker context than you'd expect,"'Pretty Woman' is kind of a blend of 'Cinderella' on the one hand and 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' on the other, albeit without any sort of family dynamic or any pretense to honesty about the dark side of human nature. What's left doesn't amount to anything more than a yuppie fantasy, a time-wasting crowd pleaser memorable only for finally rocketing the career of Julia Roberts into orbit. At best, the glamorous and unrealistic portrayal of prostitution enraged feminists, whose own angry demeanor has put them off to men and whose worthless Women's Studies degrees have rendered them barely unemployable, thus putting them one step away from the streets themselves.At worst, 'Pretty Woman' marks the start of the entry of softcore for women - previously confined to bodice-ripper novels read in dank closets - into the respectable mainstream. Throughout the next couple of decades it was followed up by any number of equally bland clones (notably by Richard Curtis), paralleled at the lower level by ""Trash TV"" and at the higher level by 'Outlander,' the trend culminating of course in the '50 Shades of Grey' sensation in 2011.'Pretty Woman' is a hot mess, an important relic of Hollywood and pop-culture history and part of the puzzle to understanding how the entertainment industry has helped metamorphose the mother (chiefly) of the family from guardian of manners and traditional mores into defender of gay rights and champion of perpetual childhood (the ""coddled millennials"" we're always hearing about trying to ""find themselves""). Ironically, while this is the sort of tripe serious film buffs would have scuffed at upon its initial release, it's difficult now to see how it could be of interest to anyone but a serious student of cinema and pop culture. However, I would keep it as far away from my own family as possible.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Decent comedy-romance that lacks anything special,"Pretty Woman is a comedy-romance that uses a basic plot and tries to make it interesting. It tells the story of Vivian Ward, a hooker that gets more than she bargained for when she persuades a rich business man to take her in for the night. The man, Edward Lewis, enjoys her company and offers her payment for the whole week if she stays. Then the typical romantic relationship slowly develops, with a predictable outcome. The plot tries nothing new and is too simple to garner much interest. The balance between business and love could have been good but is underplayed.The acting delivers mixed results. Generally, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts do fine as the main couple. Unfortunately, a few scenes are genuinely unconvincing. The side actors are not bad, but put up forgettable performances. The music fits well, and the ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" sticks out perfectly. The camera work and effects are average for the genre.The movie was not bad, but also not one that I would readily watch again. It was too shallow and didn't have anything to bring me back. It has no depth or hidden messages, just the straight story. Pass it up unless your a romance fan.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meretricious,"Roberts isn't the only pretty thing here, the lead actor has to be pretty, too, for this to work. The Cinderella/Prince mirage is stretched thin, considering Gere did his own famous turn as a prostitute.This is all about Marshall's camera being 'at the beck and call' of the stars -- what else can you expect from a TV director? -- every shot is aimed at flattery. This aspect really couldn't be more venal.Thematically, this is ""My Fair Lady"", without the wager. It adds to the illusion of 'happenstance'. The subplot of the business deal tends toward ""Local Hero"" with the ironic last minute change of heart.There was a huge opportunity to make something self-referentially rich out of this -- 'part of the soul' if you believe the writer's airy proclamations -- within the performance of Verdi's ""La Traviata"".

Pretty Average....,"I remember this hitting home video about six months after its whirlwind run in theaters. $100 million bucks, the return of Gere, the juggernaut of Roberts. And not even halfway into the film I had a surprising reaction....people fell in love with this? Such a slight, unaffecting little story involving a ""hooker with a heart of gold!"" (as she was dubbed in the trailers) and a near-comatose businessman who seemed like he was on quaaludes. It's a pretty safe bet that the financial returns of this film were driven by young girls yearning for that White Knight and couples choosing a movie as a first date. Guys were probably bored crapless, and women swooned at Gere's money-spraying nice guy.But even with that a major component, the film's vignettes are not that spectacular. Polo match, opera night, fancy restaurant dinner. Not exactly jets to Paris and moved into a mansion (a majority of the film takes place in a hotel room!). I guess the gals had reason to coo over Roberts' wardrobe fiesta, with the various dress-up sessions and flashy gowns she parades around in. And for the guys? Well, there is that polo match.Not to say the film is totally worthless. Roberts obviously conveys a charm that appealed to both sexes, she wouldn't have become a superstar without it. Gere is a decent enough guy, so subdued that he doesn't pose any sort of threat. And the age difference (19 years!!) shockingly has no hampering effect on their chemistry together. Others supporting them such as Elizondo and Larry Miller's infamous suck-up salesman provide a few grins.But the ""comedy"" side of the script is so light and harmless (""I nearly peed my pants""; mishandling of shellfish) you're nearly lulled into oblivion by the excessive breezniness of the story.

Hector Elizondo was, uh, sweet. Jason Alexander bugged me for quite some time. Laura San Giacomo was average.The plot's decent, the writing's a little dull, and the the film seems to be three hours long or so. It did get very slow after a while.'Pretty Woman' is okay.

Queen of fairy tales,"I'm all for romance but a fairy tale is another thing altogether. Romance in the form of 'Notting Hill' is easy to swallow and even enjoyable but a prostitute who lives happily ever after (or so it seems) is just laughable. Julia Roberts didn't even act that well so her Oscar nomination was just a lottery win but then again, the Oscars are just a platform for movie stars trying to prove they can act. Richard Gere didn't look and act much different than he did in his other roles. Hector Elizondo, by far, was the life of the movie as the kindly hotel manager who swoops down to Julia Roberts' aid when she comes in crying at being humiliated in a chic boutique. If the point of this movie was to give the prostitutes some credibility, it failed terribly. Just that annoying scene in the movie proved it - we women need a credit card and a man in our hand to rescue us from certain sacrifice in the hands of an upmarket store. Possibly, a decently dressed woman who couldn't afford the clothes wouldn't receive such treatment but she did because she was a whore and looked like one. Yes, even people in such professions deserve to be happy but this movie is testing it a bit. They could do with a more original and believable story line.This is fun date movie but don't overrate it too much. It doesn't deserve it.",,Anonymous,Romance

Charm Without Depth,"I think love stories work most effectively when the viewer can easily project themselves into one of the two romantic leads. If the film doesn't do this, the audience gets bored. What makes it easy to empathize with these characters is that it is a unique situation.I like it when a film fully commits itself. It makes it easier to enjoy. I think it also makes the film more vulnerable to criticism. Marshall took quite a risk making such a light-hearted romance, but it paid off in the end. This film was very popular and it isn't hard to understand why.It was probably the shallow tenderness of the romance that made the film such a success, even though it is supported by a strong plot and all the elements of a conventional screenplay.

Rusalka's eleventh film review: I want the fairy tale,"This is one of the best romantic films of all time (in my opinion).  Julia Roberts gave an Academy Award-nominated performance (she lost to Kathy Bates in Misery) as carefree prostitute Vivian Ward to Richard Gere's iconic portrayal of business executive Edward Lewis.Everything about this film, from the smallest detail, is just priceless. The script has more memorable one-liners and classic moments than the entire nine season run of the Golden Girls.  For instance, can anyone that's seen this film ever forget Vivian's shopping excursion (with Edward in tow), the day at the Beverly Hills Polo Grounds or especially the night at the opera?This is a true classic of a film for anyone who's a hopeless romantic.My rating: 4 stars",,Anonymous,Romance

Pretty woman is very well acted and the script was great too, with these two factors you have a winner for sure.

Check out the soundtrack too, Roxette, Go West, Peter Cetera, very 80's even though this film came out at the start of the very dull and boring 90's (musicwise).  It's great to look back on these classics all these years later and remember how great Hollywood movies used to be.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Pretty Woman, walking down the street; Pretty Woman, the kind I like to meet....","Whenever I listen to the song ""Pretty Woman"" by Roy Orbison, it always reminds me of Richard Gere, mostly when he is dealing with pretty young women regardless of what film he is in. It looked like Julia Roberts wanted to admire Gere once and for all. This movie was so fresh and clear. I liked the sharp appearances of these two lovers. Richard Gere is like the best man for all of these pretty women.Suppose Richard Gere has a son in real life (which I think he does not), and when the time comes for his son to get married, Richard Gere would really admire his pretty young daughter-in-law. Or, if Richard Gere was my father (which he really is not, but I am just reasoning, no disrespect), he would be super happy if I got a sharp young girlfriend and/or wife and if I still become active to my studies. I would appreciate his quote and support and he would make me feel very special. He would let me deal with as many young ladies as I want to. He would really enjoy watching me as I am being surrounded by them. You know what I mean? Because probably in real life, Richard Gere likes women a lot, and because Richard Gere is one of the ladies men. He still looks so young and pleasing.",,Anonymous,Romance

Instead, Billboard magazine comments that he mailed in his performance.  He didn't - he stood out of the way, and let the limelight shine alone on Julia Roberts.  Perhaps a later generation will acknowledge Richard Gere's extraordinary generosity.As for the film itself, there are masterful performances all around, from Mr Gere to Miss Roberts, from Hector Elizondo to the master overseeing it all, Gerry Marshall.

You KNOW You Can't Deny The Power Of Roberts and Gere....,"Man, my mommy and I get together for our monthly viewings of Pretty Woman and Top Gun, her favorite films of all time, and every single time, I take pleasure out of spending time with my mom and watching these two movies. Pretty Woman is a charming, witty, dream like movie that no matter what you say or think, will end up brightening your day because of its lovable characters and outrageous story.Yes, you all know the story now, mongrel Edward Lewis picks up free spirited Vivian to be his ""escourt"" for a week and during that week, they mesh and fall in love. No matter how many times I watch this movie, I always enjoy myself, thanks to Julia Robert's beautiful smile and cute little quirks at trying to make herself fit in Edward's world. It's the most evident at the dinner scene where Edward calmly states he is going to buy a company and sell it bit by bit. All the while Vivian is just sitting there with her lack of any etiquette, making the audience fall in love with her even more.Gere and Roberts have such chemistry and presence on screen, they just click from the get go, and look like two people having a great time at work. Gere has never looked more handsome, and I love how Edward changes his views on his business life after one week of time with Vivian. And I love how Vivian slowly lets Edward into her life, her feelings, and who she is as a person. I'm so glad Roberts was nominated for an Oscar for this role. It is what cemented her on Hollywood's A list.Yes, Pretty Woman has an outrageous story, and in real life can probably happen once in a blue moon. But hey! That's what those famous lines that bookend the movie are for: ""Welcome to Hollywood! What's your dream?"" Pretty Woman will have a special place in my heart always, me sitting on the couch with mommy, having a great time at the movies.",,Anonymous,Romance
Stop complaining!,"Some people find this film highly provocative and even morally depraving, but these people need to loosen up and stop taking things so seriously. It's just a movie! And a very good one at that. So stop complaining and enjoy it! It's the Cinderella story, and maybe, instead of young women thinking that if they become prostitutes they will be rescued by Richard Gere, they might think that ""well, if she could get a man like that so can I, I'm not even a prostitute"".",,Anonymous,Romance
A true romance,Pretty Woman is just an all around feel good movie. It makes you believe in real love and that anyone can find love. The movie is a modern romance Cinderella story with some great humor. It shows you that love is not about material things. You can leave this movie feeling great about yourself. Without Julia Roberts and Richard Gere paired together this movie would be half as good. They are a perfect match and do a superb job in playing there role. Anyone who says this movie is bad has to not believe  in finding love and that there is such a thing as a soulmate. The movie shows that love happens when you least expect it.,,Anonymous,Romance
smart,"a smart movie. that is its secret and the source of seduction. a film about a meeting and a love story who remains fresh decade by decade for the courage to be natural. and, sure, for the chemistry between the actors. a film new at all who respect the old recipes. a good example of grace for use delicate subject and a magnificent manner for Julia Roberts to explore her character's nuances. a film like a trip who gives interesting definition to romanticism. and a story who remains in the memory of viewer for a long, long time. short, a smart script. and good actors. the result is far to be a surprise. because the film reflects the energy, the spirit and the force of a new period and impose the rhythm of it.",,Anonymous,Romance
loved it so much!!!!,"When I need a movie to remind me of real or fantasy romance, I turn to ""Pretty women""...this movie has surprisingly touched me and others in a way I can't think of, Gere was charming and sexy while Roberts was fun, loving and really relative in some aspects...the chemistry was so clear that it exuded a sort of predictable ending which only made me cry...I've like seen this movie 10 times and watch it regularly...This is truly a first class comedy romance and was worth every critics' praise... definitely 10/10.Richard Gere is so sexy and sophisticated he is almost a fantasy of mine...and Julia Roberts is a women who I respect and adore in all her work.",,Anonymous,Romance
Traditional fairy tale in a modern world,"Pretty Woman is the ultimate fairy story in a modern world. Instead of a prince and princess, we have a self-concerned businessman and a young Hollywood Boulevard hooker. The film would have fared a lot worse had Dennis Hopper been allowed to play the role Richard Gere eventually landed. He and Roberts have this on-screen chemistry that makes the whole film light up. Admittedly, the story isn't all that realistic but it doesn't bother you until after the film has ended. You watch and let it wash all over you. Both characters turn out better people because of their meet-up: Gere realises that there is more to the world than making money and Roberts learns that there is more to sex than just getting high. Watch it and love it. If you don't love Gere and Roberts by the time you get to the piano scene, turn it off, find your soul, and then try again.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Absolute pants, but....","This film has to go in my worst films list, it's awful.Julia Roberts is (IMO) very average looking and has no sex appeal at all, but I suppose that's irrelevant as this film is directed purely at women.The whole idea is basically the same as almost every cliche 'Hollywood Romance'.  Get some hunky actor who falls for this woman, they have a bust up and then in the end after some soul searching the man sweeps her of her feet. (see Officer & a Gentleman, Dirty Dancing, etc).Obviously the idea of this story has no basis in reality, which is a shame because it would have been a great movie if it dealt with a real relationship between a prostitute and a Billionaire.But...and this is the but, it's only a movie (how can I say that) and really a pantomime story like cinderella.  The shopping scene is, of course, every woman's dream.Overall, for me and probably most men it's rubbish and a waste of film, but for a lot a women a very enjoyable fairytale.",,Anonymous,Romance
DVD extras a special treat,"I liked this movie enough to buy it on DVD even though I already owned the video. I'm really glad I did - the extras on DVD, especially Gary Marshall's interesting commentary and the extra scenes cut from the original release make the DVD a real treat for anyone who loves this movie.",,Anonymous,Romance
What's your dream?,"There are movies that are perfect, the technique, the performances, the directing, everything... other movies are horrible, we can find a lot of defects everywhere. However, some movies are beyond this whole thing, we simply don't care about the details, they are more than perfect, they are wonderful. ""Pretty Woman"" is one of those.Who loves this movie can't say why. It's some kind of feeling we've got after watching it, we just want to see it over and over again and we want to supply our desires and dreams. Life becomes tasty, great, marvellous.I know that a critic would find a lot of reasons why this movie shouldn't be so over rated, but when it comes to art, I don't think it should be rated by the technique but by the feeling of the public.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Good Movie!,"Edward Lewis is a rich, businessman who travels to Los Angeles for a business meeting. After meeting prostitute, Vivian Ward, Edward invites her to come and stay at his hotel for a week, so they can pretend there together in front of Edward's associates, etc. Vivian agrees. This starts of the beginning of a new friendship and a new relationship for both of them.Julia Roberts gives a great performance as Vivian here. Richard Gere is okay, but a little annoying at times as Edward. Jason Alexander also gives a great performance Edward's friend Phil.Pretty Woman is a pretty good romantic comedy with a cool cast involved. If you like the romantic, comedy movies like this and the leads here then Pretty Woman is for you.",,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful,"Wonderful movie when it came out and still is to this day. I like this movie very much, but not as much as my mother who watches it every single time it comes on TV. I do say it is better than Runaway Bride. That movie was not one of my favorites or likeable ones. I give this movie 10/10.",,Anonymous,Romance
