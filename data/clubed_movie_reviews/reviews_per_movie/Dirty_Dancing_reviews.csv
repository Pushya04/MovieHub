Nobody gives Baby a low rating,"Dirty Dancing is a classic film that is so memorable that it is hard to say anything negative about it.It has a reasonable plot but is accompanied by an immortal soundtrack and moments that make this film remarkable. Herein lies it's value as it can be revisited for positive memories and a soundtrack second to none. While many will argue Schindler's list or 12 Years A Slave is a superior film not many will agree you can revisit or watch it over again. The songs featured in this classic will be included on our iPod's and play on the radios for years to come. We will never forget when Patrick Swayze hoisted Jennifer Grey up for the dance sequence at the end, timeless moments that keep this film alive and memorable.Dirty Dancing in its essence is a film about letting go of strict societal norms and letting the music embrace you. You dance and feel the beat as opposed to observing rules and steps, the music dictates the rhythm and mood. Perhaps this iconic film was significant in the departure from traditional dancing as fewer people know dancing. Dancing as we see in modern movies or real life is people moving to the music without any defined steps, perhaps started by this iconic film.This film is a must see and should be on your bucket list. It is easy to understand and easy to get lost in this great soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Forbidden Dance,"Is the movie predictable? Does it ooze with Cliches? Might it annoy you with its romantic/soft tones? Well the latter question is one only you can answer ... the other ones are quite easy to answer. No matter if you like the movie or not ... but it is beloved for many reasons. One that is not mentioned enough is the soundtrack! Just great songs all the way through.The other obvious reasons are the main actors/characters. You have Patrick Swayze - the hot rebel ... hard on the inside, soft as cotton on the inside. So frail that some men may have quite a few issues with him. But this is not aimed at any macho loving public - this is aimed at women! And their fantasy - most of them that is, because as with men you can't say they are all the same.The fact that this man, who seems so full of confidence has no idea ... makes him more than attractive to women ... and some men of course. Let's not forget about them as well. So while you can dissect this really easy ... you can also just enjoy the romp - and maybe carry a watermelon ... although you probably are more likely to get excited about the nobody puts baby in the corner line ... if you don't get goosebumps towards the end ... well it is an indication that you probably won't like the movie as much.A clash of rich and poor ... of sex through dance ... those motions ... those hip movements ... there was a time where this was not only dirty dancing, but also illegal dancing ... good thing we do not live in a time like that, right? That aside, the movie really is quite the experience ... in a really good sense.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Perfection,"One word sums up this film ""Perfection"". That's it really!! I saw this film in 1987 when it was released and was completely blown away and like Baby I fell in love with Johnny and Patrick Swayze. It has such classic lines as ""I carried a watermelon"" and ""Nobody puts Baby in the corner"" and too many others to mention. I loved the story, the characters, the setting, the dancing, and well  the music was phenomenal not one bad song in the whole soundtrack. It just shows that you don't have to spend a fortune to make a great film. Thank you to the cast and crew for making such a wonderful film which makes me smile like a Cheshire cat whenever I watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Awesome Kick ass Dancing Techniques,"You cant get any better then this, Mr Jeffries!!  Patrick Swayze is hot and Jen Grey portrays the role of Baby nicely....the dancing rocks and the music is slamming GO Baby GO!!!",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The appeal is undeniable,"I really didn't understand ""Dirty Dancing"" on that first viewing, I freely come clean on that. I tended to get hung up on the more ""fanciful"" elements and really missed the point. Baby's is a coming-of-age story, and it's one that has some real heart. And then the father-daughter subplot kicks in and it's got me; I'm a sucker for that. Also for Hungry Eyes, apparently (best song on the soundtrack, ya ask me).Speaking of which, the music in this movie is incredible. And considering the soundtrack dominated the airwaves for a good deal of 1987, it's readily apparent how this film was a cultural force. I was too young to appreciate that, but I'm not anymore.Swayze and Grey are electric, and the story goes that their working relationship was fraught with fiction. Knowing this, I can absolutely appreciate the work they put into this and the results speak for themselves.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Some kind of wonderful,"I don't really know what it is about Dirty Dancing.. there is some sort of absolute magic in this movie.. I cannot possibly recount the hundreds (yes, hundreds)of times I've watched it, beginning to end... but every time I do come upon it on TV, I am entranced and mystified and sit myself down and there I am, for two hours, loving the movie as if I'm watching it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey absolutely hated each other throughout the making of this film, they possess a beautiful chemistry on the set.. it makes the viewer enjoy it that much more, to see this passion and commitment.. and I can't help tearing up a tiny bit at the end, when Patrick comes up to the Houseman family and tells her dad, ""Nobody puts Baby in a corner"". (classic moment) For all those people who believe this movie is corny and sappy, maybe in a way it is, but it was the penicle of the 80's films, and put Patrick Swayze right on the map; his performance was immaculate.Three Cheers for Dirty Dancing !!Ps- The soundtrack is fantastic, an absolute masterpiece",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
dirty dancing,"Dirty dancing is one iconic musical dance based film of 80s and defienetly one of most regonasable films of all time,and how it wont be when it is full of great iconic songs and great dance moving and chereography,swayze is incredible to look at in this film since he was convincing in every dance moment,dirty dancing is one of best films of this type only revealed by footloose at least for me,chemisty between leads was glowing and it can be felt over the screen,my flaw is only that our leads fall in love to fast that could be solved by longer runtime but then some moments would dragged,dirty dancing is a romantic type of film that is worthy watching it with your date or alone you will still be satisfayed after end",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Original 'Feel good"" dance epic -- often imitated Never Duplicated","This is one of those rare rare films that needs a 30 year break between the time of production and the time of the review in order to appreciate it.Since 1987 I have seen this film 7 or 8 times. Each time it just gets better. As a Prolific Review here on the IMDb, I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of films that improve with age like that.This is literally the original ""feel good"" dance film -- which spawned dozens if not hundreds of imitations. The script is perfect. The acting is perfect. The casting is perfect. The direction is perfect. And the music score is to die for.Nobody puts Baby in a corner? Well, nobody should ignore this film either! Also has an odd note of the ""one hit wonder"" label about it, which in my view only makes it more of a treat than it already is.Swayze's career was unfortunately cut short. Jennifer Grey, who practically made this role a part of her DNA, had a nose job and (the cynics say) lost a lot of later roles because the casting directors were afraid no one would recognize her. And the brilliant writer/Producer Elenor Bergstein for whom this was a labor of love (there was a documentary on this) also seemed to hang up her spurs when production wrapped.The IMDb rating is a joke. This is no less a classic in its genre than Maltese Falcon or the Matrix.See it, rent it, buy it. But don't forget it.((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

Very Over-Rated,"This is not a good film by an standards.  It is very poorly written and the acting is just a little above par (some performances are well below par, but Swayze and Grey do a very good job with little to work with).What was good:The dance sequences were choreographed very well and, as stated above, Swayze and Grey were high points.What was bad:The script.  The ""bad"" guys were simply too evil to be believable.  The best villains are the ones who aren't so obviously evil.  These guys (the owner's nephew, the waiter who impregnates the girl) do and say NOTHING that would leave me to believe they could be real people (perhaps there are guys like them, but I sure don't want to see a movie about it).Another scene, the first where Grey and Swayze meet when the employees at the resort are ""dancing"".  Swayze and Grey dance together and seem to enjoy themselves.  The next time they meet, Swayze is hostile towards her.  Why? What happened in between to make him dislike her so when they danced well together?And some of those lines, I mean COME ON (I cringed at the end when Swayze muttered the line ""Nobody puts baby in the corner"".  How did he EVER do that with a straight face.)Another thing wrong, the setting of the 1960's.  Everyone looked and dressed like the 1980's!  Who was in charge of the costumes and hairstyles?The music (original music for the film) was laughable (with the exception of ""I Had the Time of My Life"" which was a good song).Not the worst film I've ever seen, but DEFINITELY the most over-rated",3.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
She's Like the Wind,"This movie has stood the test of time. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze make movie magic with the sultry dance moves. The choreography and the music make this a ride you will not want to get off of. Now considered a cult classic, it has spawned a television series, Broadway production and most recently a remake (that was horrific). Fantastic piece of celluloid history that ought to be revisited every now and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Swoony-eyed boy-girl stuff, aided by the musical uplift...","Although set in 1963, the popular, music-driven ""Dirty Dancing"" is betrayed by its false sense of nostalgia; rarely have I seen a movie which looked so unlike what it was allegedly about. However, anachronisms aside, the casting of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey pays off: these two definitely have the charisma the story requires, and their union is nearly credible. Plot has a gawky young woman vacationing in the Catskills with her parents, learning to loosen up with help from a slightly-older man who works as a professional dancer. Two silly subplots, one about an unwanted pregnancy and the other involving a stolen wallet, just about render the melodramatics inherent in the scenario utterly superfluous. Who cares about some guy's wallet? It just chews up time until the inevitable finale--an enthusiastic, celebratory climax--and that's where the picture cannot go wrong. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Even as a very masculine male I find this film very entertaining. It represents a time when films could be based completely on dancing and music without the modern day clichés.

"""I don't believe you Baby""!","This timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated. I can't even count how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing. This is one movie that I could probably watch every few weeks and still love.There is something timeless about this movie. I have loved other ""blockbuster love story movies"" like Pretty Woman and when Harry met Sally. I think their up there but there is something about Dirty Dancing that just makes it absolutely perfect. The characters, the chemistry between Swaze and Grey, the movie's direction, the INCREDIBLE dancing, the warm summery atmosphere, everything about dirty dancing is absolutely perfect. It is an instant classic and I've never really seen a movie like it either before or since.I don't think there is one particular element that makes this movie so loved but many things, a lot of which are mentioned by numerous reviewers. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, languid, summery mood, realistic characters, a relateable honest message coupled with incredible music and dancing, and the one of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us.This movie is always on TV and I will continue to watch it as long as they show it. But I WILL mention I have no interest in seeing ""Havanna Nights"", this one they should have left alone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
an all-time 80s feel-good classic by anyone's standards,"This is the film that catapulted Patrick Swayze to be an international super-star and household name, and rightly so. He was awesome as Johnny Castle, dance teacher and entertainer in an American Holiday camp frequented by a doctor and his family; wife and two girls. One of the girls, Francis ""Baby"" Houseman, gets caught up with some of the entertainers at the camp and ends up learning to dance at the hands of Swayze. Of course he becomes her first love.Many of the scenes in the film are so iconic now, as is the music. The film produced two great soundtrack albums, and has been greatly imitated. Baby Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, found it hard to learn the dance moves, to comic effect. The film is laugh out loud in places by mainly gentle humour, heart, warmth and is about love, loyalty and friendship and with comment on society's differences in class and how you can't judge books by their cover. It's a lovely film, but despite the wonderful dance scenes and great performances by Swayze, Grey and Cynthia Rhodes - a fantastic dancer - but there is also some rather cheesy acting and it's not a perfect film, and hasn't aged that well (also considering that it's set in the early 60s) from the 80s. Despite the flaws, it's a fantastic, entertaining and uplifting film but definitely one for (predominantly) the ladies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"A wonderful, moving, touching and poignant classic","I viewed this movie for the first time last night and I enjoyed every aspect of it the dancing, the acting, the dialogue, the plot, the script and the whole atmosphere that this movie created. I would highly recommend it.Jennifer Grey gives an absolutely wonderful and first class performance in her role as Frances (Baby) Houseman. She has a natural ability and flair for dancing and she is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor. But what is wonderful about Baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension to her character. This is not simply a movie about dancing but the scriptwriters have also given us a chance to see Baby deal with the various emotions and feelings that she is experiencing throughout the movie and to allow us an insight into how her interaction with others at the camp changes her life. Grey portrays her character with such realism and poignancy that you end up feeling deeply for Baby as she experiences all she does in this movie.Patrick Swayze is magnificent in his role as Johnny and truly succeeds in making his character come alive. He gives his character a comprehensive personality, strong appeal and great depth. The chemistry between Swayze and Grey is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this movieCynthia Rhodes is great in her role of Penny and her portrayal of the ordeal that she experiences is truly powerful and contributes a frightening dimension to the film. The other members of the supporting cast Jerry Orbach and the late Mark Cantor deserve a special mention here-also give wonderful and imaginative performances that gives this movie an additional dimension of high quality acting and believability that is wonderful to experience. The dancing is magnificent and first class on the part of all involved.The script and interaction between all the major characters is intriguing and engages the viewer in a powerful fashion. The plot, although exceedingly predictable, is given more than enough life and vitality to make this movie successful.Furthermore the wonderful selection of music contained in this movie creates a truly magical atmosphere and very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all the various scenes.`Dirty Dancing' is a truly powerful, magnificent and very appealing movie that leaves you deeply touched and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance. I highly recommend it",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Lock up your daughters...,"Aside from its obviously problematic central relationship (yikes), there isn't really anything particularly 'wrong' with 'Dirty Dancing (1987)'. Having said that, it's never more than 'fine'. Though its plot is more impactful and consistent than the plots of similar work such as 'Flashdance (1983)' and 'Footloose (1984)', the picture doesn't really make the most out of its underlying themes and focal relationship. It's not bad, just somewhat unremarkable. It's never exciting or affecting, for example. It's engaging enough, though, and will probably appeal more to big fans of 80s dance movies than it does to me. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Maybe a predictable story of girl gets man of her dreams but this film is still brilliant!!!!,"I have been waiting to see this film for ages and I finally have! As soon as I heard the title I knew that this film would be my favourite film ever and when I saw it believe me I wasn't disappointed!This film had everything dance, love and Patrick Swayze! There was so much in it and it dealt with important issues, (that were at the time, 1960's) , such as abortion.The dancing in this film was fantastic, just like the acting was! Swayze was brilliant just like Grey was too!Although this film was absolutely fantastic you cannot say that you have seen it if you haven't seen the last scene. It really does take your breath away as the whole choreography of the last dance was done brilliantly, it had you dancing at the end of the film and it really wouldn't surprise me if it influenced people to take up dancing!Overall Dirty Dancing is a film NOT to be missed and even if half the actors are in the: ""Where are they now?"" period the actors will always have this superb film in their career!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Not a fan,"The only way I can put it, is that I have been forced to watch this many, many times in the last few years - mainly because it's one of my mum's favourites, by no means does that mean it is anywhere close to being one of mine. I hate it more each time I have to sit through it.I understand why some people love it; it's a look into the past, it can be quite nostalgic to certain people, the romance is kind of cute (in a weird way), it's cheesy and some people find that to be a good thing. However, personally I though it was apsolutle rubbish and I feel as if I might claw out my eyes if I have to see it one more time - my plan is to boycott it until I die.

I'm a straight MALE and i love this film! This film oozes with Energy!,"I'm Male-and yes i am straight! but this doesn't stop making this film one of my all time favourite films!I'm also convinced i'm not alone! I know for a fact there are blokes out there that either admittedly or secretly enjoy watching and love this classic film! (Not just English/British men-but men world wide!) and rightly so...nearly 18 years on, and this film is STILL watched and enjoyed- world wide, and people are still able to relate to it.I know all the words i've seen it that many times!Most of my dance moves i use for work-are taken from this film!There's so much energy.In fact it is my firm belief, if people were brought up thinking watching these types of films are deemed as 'cool' and OK to watch the world would be a slightly better place to live.An enjoyable film that doesn't make you want to go out into the world and cause havoc and heartache-do drugs or get into gun crime (coz its classed as being 'cool')this films makes you want to find a girl-that you can love and feel that special feeling felt in this film.It also makes you want to go out and enjoy yourself by simply Dancing!It's free,Legal and makes you feel good-while keeping you fit and healthy-not forgetting FUN! In my opinion, the films main two themes are 'LOVE', the true love story between Baby and Johnny (Jennifer Gray and Mr Swayze) (compared to Baby's sister's relationship-where she was just used for sex) plus classic Music. Yes music! The type you can really dance to! Every song on the soundtrack is fantastic! In true cheesy Dj style, i still play all the old classics from the soundtrack (especially 'Time of my life')and is still goes down a treat every single time! You just can't stop yourself! Anyway-everyone has wrote hundreds of reviews, and has pretty much summed up this film and explained the story...all thats left to say is....If you haven't seen this film yet...go treat yourself, buy the DVD (you can get if for an average of £5 or less (British pounds) Roughly 9 American Dollars (i think!)It's well worth it, and highly recommended.If, you enjoy the film-please go out and buy one of the 'Dirty Dancing' soundtracks- especially the Ultimate Dirty Dancing (released in the UK 2004 in celebration of the films anniversary- as it contains all of the songs and is digitally remastered. (I got my second personal copy from the British supermarket 'Tescos' for an amazing £6! (For anyone 'Up North' try 'Music Zone' as its only £6 in there too!Anyway-cheers for taking the time to read this-i'm sorry i went on a bit! If your planning on seeing this film for the first time...enjoy! And as everyone else has said-very cheesily! Try and have THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE!I will go as far to say 10/10.

You Don't Have To Like Dancing to Enjoy This Film,"This movie is worth a watch, as romantic comedies go it's pretty solid and as movies about dancing go this is in the top ten for sure. The two leads have great chemistry and the whole cast is a load of fun, this film isn't some great intellectual work of art but it's a fun watch and worth seeing at least once, and as some one who has no interest in dancing I feel like even if you don't like to dance or don't find it that interesting to watch you can still get something from this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
My favorite film,"This is the best movie ever, but that is my opinion. Some say it's cheesy but I think it is truly a beautiful film. The chemistry between Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze it's like no other I have ever seen, and that is what makes the film so perfect. I always wonder what would have been of this film if these two actors never existed, because not just one them did it for me, they both did. If you have never seen this film, when you do you will understand what I mean. Dirty Dancing looks like it was done from the heart and it feels so real for some reason, like magic- and the soundtrack LOVE IT. Besides the 2 lead actors the soundtrack makes the film the beauty that it is. As you can tell I am in love with this film, and I know you will be too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Light Hearted Dance Romance,"I like ""Dirty Dancing."" The plot is stereotypical but I think it's got some great music and a touching social class type romance that keeps you invested in certain characters, rooting for them. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey are great dancers and have some good chemistry on screen. There are a lot of characters in this movie that I absolutely hated, which I guess is good because it had me rooting for Swayze's character, Johnny, all the more. Standout scenes for me include the dance party with all the resort staff at the beginning of the film, the finale, and also the touching conversation between Grey's character, Baby, and her father, Jack (Jerry Orbach).Overall this is a classic 80s movie that you should definitely see at least once; it was very popular in its day and still continues to hold influence on the romance and musical genres of film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Dirty Dancing Coming to Broadway for it's 20th anniversary!,"There was talk on the E! Hollywood Special about the Making of Dirty Dancing which still is considered by many women including a dear friend of mine in her fifties to be one of her favorite all time movies. Maybe the music, the dancing, or the melodrama around the plot of Baby Frances becoming a dancing sensation with Johnny Castle. Of course, this film established Jennifer Grey whose biggest role to date was the resentful sister in Ferris Beuller's Day Off. Patrick Swayze is perfectly cast as the heart throb leading man who sweeps baby away literally. Dirty Dancing has it all to become a Broadway or West End smash hit. It has the love story, the music, and most of all lots of dancing. Jennifer and Patrick could revive their roles easily. it is nice to see Jerry Orbach play a doctor instead of a police officer and Kelly Bishop as the mother. It all took place in the Catskills in the sixties where many Jewish families vacationed in the area during their summer vacations. At the end of the film, it is sad to see the hotel owner, Kellerman, be baffled by the next generation. It happened anyway! Most people prefer cruises and traveling through Europe than spending the summer in the Catskills. Those old grand hotels are becoming Indian gaming casinos. Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive and well. After all, they could do it for Footloose and Saturday Night Fever, this should be a no brainer! I know that this film is one of the favorites that you don't get tired of after watching 800 times. There are people that have probably seen this film-a 1,000 times by now. Somehow watching the making and the story behind Dirty Dancing made me long for my childhood days as a thirteen year old. Dirty Dancing may not be the greatest film ever made in the history but its universal appeal still draws crowds and repeated watchers like the 800 club whose members have watched it so many times. I watch it fondly now with all the awkwardness of Baby's first days and her first true love with Patrick Swayze as heart throb, Johnny Castle. Nobody could have imagined this little film as a big hit then with the sixties music, two soundtracks, and even a tour in the late eighties. I hope they bring it to Broadway in a musical. It would work for the audience to be part of a film. No wonder it still attracts kids and even adults particularly women of all ages to watch it over and over again. Well, Australia and London both have had productions of Dirty Dancing. It looks like it will come to Broadway in 2007 just in time for it's 20th anniversary.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Memorable Retro (No Spoilers),"The dance scenes in this film have always been pretty memorable -- probably the Swayze factor imo. The constant reminder of the social divide between ""the guests"" and ""the help"" pushed throughout the film (no spoilers) was a major topic back in the '80s as women were really working hard to break through the glass ceiling both socially and professionally. The film seems to be making a comeback now as the opening film to an DVD double-feature with ""The Help"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
All of You are Just Sick!!!!!,"I just read a number of user reviews, and all I have to say is that ""You're all sick!!!""This lamebrained, terribly scripted, terribly constructed, terribly acted movie is your ""Favorite Movie of All Time?""This is the movie that made me avoid ""Ghost"" for over a year (definitely a mistake), because after seeing this, I incorrectly assumed that anything with Patrick Swayze in it was just going to be BAD.The story's been told before (repeatedly, I might add).  Even if the story hadn't been told before, every aspect of the movie is completely predictable.  Most of the dialogue is more laughable than most spoofs of ""Star Trek"" (at least when those people are spoofing Shatner as Kirk, they're ""trying"" to be funny).  And the acting--ugh, even if the dialogue wasn't so bad, most of the principals are so wooden you could use them as surfboards.The dancing scenes--okay, they were pretty good.

"Dance, she said.","By now, it seems that no one debates that ""Dirty Dancing"" is probably the best dance-related movie ever. The plot of course has pampered Jewish teenager Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) feeling unfulfilled with the Catskill resort where her family stays in summer, 1963, and falling in love with dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). The movie is good in many respects: aside from the ultra-cool soundtrack, it shows the disgusting-ness inherent in the resort, and the unpleasant - if not dorky - people who stay there.All in all, this is a movie not to be missed.

"Very Good Film, Just Not My Cup Of Tea","I'll start by saying that there is very little wrong with this film; it has a great cast, a charming story, strong dialogue and some excellent characters; not to mention a good soundtrack.I did enjoy this movie and i can understand why so many people hold it in such high regard, it's a fine film; the only thing that lets it down for me is the subject matter, dancing isn't really my thing. So my score of 6/10 is a testimony to how good a film this really is, for a film of this type to entertain me, even just a little surprised me completely. There is simply nothing to hate here, as it tells the story of a girls journey into womanhood, and the dancing is simply the catalyst for the change.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Corny and phony.,"There are a few positive things I can say about ""Dirty Dancing"": some of the dance sequences are indeed impressive, a few even have an undeniable erotic tension. The actors are generally convincing, the production values good and the film moves along at an agreeably fast pace - you're never bored. Still, this film is mostly AWFUL. There isn't ONE character that doesn't behave like a complete stereotype, there isn't ONE plot development that you can't predict about ten minutes before it appears onscreen. According to this film's naive, extremely corny vision, people can change and learn all the basic human values (and how to dance like professionals) within a few days. At the end, after the obligatory apologies, explanations and confessions, everybody is happy and everything is solved. Stuck with a predictable, by-the-numbers script, the director makes a watchable, even entertaining at times film, and Swayze with Grey have a genuine chemistry together, and the music is great, but this film is so sappy that only the most undemanding viewers can possibly like it. Really corny.",4.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Swayze,"This movie contains one of the BEST love scenes ever filmed. You have to have veins of ice if the cabana/dance/love scene between Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray doesn't make your heart race a little. The only other movie I can think of right now with a scene that can move me as much is maybe the elevator kiss scene in Drive. Both just beautifully filmed, staged, choreographed, put to music and delivered.And yes, while this movie is somewhat 'cheesy' in places, there is no denying that is played a huge part in American cinema. The Penny story line, the young love, the family situation, all hot topics the year this was filmed.Lastly, the soundtrack is amazing. Not ONE of these songs feels out of place or superfluous.

I'm looking at you Baby and the Lefties who wrote this.Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Grey) visits a holiday camp with her family, before embarking to college to study Economics of developing countries to make sure all is where everywhere. But unfortunately, not everything is well at the camp either. A female dancer Penny (Rhodes) becomes pregnant and ironically has no money to get an abortion, so Baby helps her out by loaning her a lot of money. Meanwhile, someone has to take Penny's place as a dancer in a nearby hotel, and Baby volunteers for the job. But she can't dance. Only if there was someone to teach her...And of course, that's what Patrick Swayze is therefore and plenty of scenes with the shirtless hunk ensue and sparks of love fire at every direction. But for the dismay of Swayze, Jennifer Gray can not act which flattens the experience from a great movie to a good movie. Naturally, the incredibly naive leftist ideology that penetrates the film thematically only help to achieve campy silliness, but the kind that isn't sweet or innocent enough to be charming.But really, Dirty Dancing is about dancing and and wearing skin-tight clothing and there is nothing bad about that. To the contrary, dancing has never seemed so passionate and innocent at the same time, and I would assume that is quite an achievement.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Great dancing, but strangely anti-semitic undercurrent","The film is justly renowned for its electrifying dance sequences, soundtrack and chemistry between Swayze and Grey, but it's strange every Jewish male is either a morose stick-in-the-mud (her father), a bean-counting nooge (the Kellermans), or a complete philandering scumball (Robby). Baby yearns for the arms of the hot earnest gentile since her own culture is filled with wash-outs. Sure, as a middle-aged, lonely Jew I pretty much agree with the estimation but why rub it in?",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Movie of the season that will definitely bring you into a romantic mood ready for love!,"Wow, what a movie this is! A timeless classic that has influenced many other movies beyond it.This film is set under the backdrop of the US in 1961. It is about a young girl coming-of-age, affectionately known as Baby (Jennifer Grey) spending her summer holidays with her proper well-to-do family at a wealthy resort. Curious, kind and compassionate, she gazes at a hired staff member in-charge of entertainment, Johnny (Patrick Swayze), a tall and handsome man and instantly falls in love with him. Needless to say, certain events ensue as she learns to dance with him.The film deals with many themes including love and attraction, dancing and the emotions it evokes, and courting women through the various stages of romantic relationships. It examines complications arising from relationships out of wedlock and consequences from that. It also deals with social classes e.g. Wealthy vs. Not so well-off people and how people treat one another of different social standings. It explores the ideas of honor and dishonor, protecting one another and standing up for yourself and what you believe in in-spite of what others may think of you. This film also has some very saucy moments that are quite arousing yet very tasteful which will definitely get you in the mood for love.Why do I like this film? I liked how girls want to be romanced, courted and loved as they prepare and present themselves to men that they desire. I was swayed by those flirting gazes of the initial moments of attraction. I liked how Johnny takes a masculine role in taking the lead in his romantic encounters with women both on and off the dance floor. We see how people have natural sexual desires as they long for, look for and desire to be with a mate. The movie plays on an extended metaphor of finding a dance partner, someone whom you can really vibe with and dance with as akin to finding a life partner. We see how people can see the good in others and shine this light and reflect it to them. It is a way of building people up and lifting their spirits especially for those who cannot see this goodness within themselves.Finally, the ending of this movie is something magical, iconic and spectacular to behold, I was left feeling moved and overjoyed with positive feelings for those involved. I wholeheartedly recommend this as a perfect romantic movie to watch on any romantic occasion with your loved ones. It is not just about dancing. It is about love and relationships, courage and kindness with those you love. Top notch film and highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Very Memorable Film, Timeless","In the 1960s, during a family summer getaway, Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) meets dancer Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) and falls hard for him... with his bad reputation and her father (Jerry Orbach) being a reputable doctor, what will become of this relationship?""Dirty Dancing"" is one of the quintessential films of the 1980s.

"A rather milquetoast, yet sweet summer diversion (+ 'Newman' is in it)","This was kind of the typical Hollywood trainwreck movie. Put it another way: I know of a childhood neighbor-friend who would love it - his tastes in TV and movies being different than mine. Many of the scenarios in the movie seem either implausible or outright morally wrong. Any father I know from the 1960's would NEVER let their daughter run around amongst a bunch of adults!! This movie takes place at a summer retreat for wealthy families, and 'baby' (Jennifer Grey) is a rich doctor's daughter. She becomes infatuated with one of the dance instructors / entertainers at this retreat, despite some objections from her family. Patrick Swayze's acting is terrible. Dittos to Jennifer Grey. In addition to conning her father to get abortion money for one of the dancers, her doctor-father (Jerry Orbach) seems very progressive in his attitudes for the 1960's. Another disappointment is that there simply isn't a whole lot of dancing.",4.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Repeated viewings reveal a well crafted story,"When this film was released I dismissed as being lightweight pop nonsense. That was a mistake.After repeated viewings and seeing a documentary of the making of DIRTY DANCING, discovering the depth of this film certainly increases its appeal.DIRTY DANCING is a film about change.  The evolving nature of relationships within the family, the changes in one's view of the world during their coming of age, etc.  The story takes place during August of 1963, the final weeks of the last summer of innocence for the American people.  The many personal changes experienced by the characters reflect the many changes in American society that would be marked by the Kennedy assassinations and Vietnam.Female movie go'ers adored this film and repeated trips to the movie houses made it the world's most successful dance movie.  As a male I find the romantic pairing of ultimate stud Patrick Swayze with very plain Jennifer Grey very hard to accept.  This would be fatal for most romantic dramas, and it also may have create the intense dislike expressed by most male reviewers.The film's soundtrack found #1 status before the release of the movie.  To this day it is nearly impossible to attend a wedding reception without hearing a DIRTY DANCING song.Near the midpoint of the film Baby's mother wakes up and asks Baby's father, ""Is anything wrong?""Baby's father, the anti-change family member, attempts to keep all that is happening a secret.  He tells his wife to go back to sleep.  However, resist as one can, change is unstopable.

Whirling Sex,"The ultimate dance flick is still a timeless gem from the 1980s. It may lack polish or even sensibility, but the charm is unrelenting. Fronted by the heavenly pairing of Jennifer Grey as the timid town girl Frances 'Baby' Houseman with a need to exhale and the unforgettable Patrick Swayze as booty shaking dance instructor Johnny Castle. Sets in 1953, it centres around a simple case of mésalliance, when up-town teenager on holiday in Catskills resort falls for the crass, but empathic dancer. Aptly named Baby she is the apple of her father's eye, perfect and untainted. But growing up brings about urges and changes - idyllic family relationships are bound to either adapt or fall apart.""Dirty Dancing"" delivers a deeply felt promise of naive youthful romance with unbelievable chemistry between the two main protagonists. The story may be simple (albeit brings in a pretty touchy issue of abortion), but filled with magic which inexplicably refuses to die away with age or repeated watching. Even now, as an adult I seem still somewhat embarrassingly enticed by the simplistic allure, albeit notice the inherent flaws, stereotypical characters or shortcomings of the entire story. What is probably still the most successful in this movie is its terrific score with what could possibly be the best pop musical score in movie history.Probably the highlight of Patrick Swayze's career (although ""Ghost"" probably would give it some competition), ""Dirty Dancing"" turned out to be just 15 minutes of fame for Jennifer Grey, who self-mutilated her career by plastic surgery, which dispossessed her of a peculiarly enticing Roman nose, replacing it with something more generic and changing her beyond recognition.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"If You've Grown Up, Skip This Movie","This reminded me of many of the 1970s sleazy films with tons of unlikeable characters with low morals and being portrayed by the sick scriptwriters as ""good people."" This movie was a favorite of of many, especially teenage girls who saw a real poor role model in Jennifer Grey's ""Frances 'Baby' Houseman."" Grey was extremely irritating to watch to listen to, a big pain in the butt. I laugh at some of these reviews that cite her ""depth"" and ""dimension."" Give me a break: she's a slimeball. Only a likewise immature bimbo would enjoy this movie.As bad as Grey's character is in here, Patrick Swayze's ""Johnny Castle"" isn't a whole lot better. He's a guy trying to seduce a teenager via his dancing prowess. That's all we need to see in that age of child sex molesters on the web and who knows where else. At least she was 17 so I guess the filmmakers felt that was old enough.From the sex-obsessed leads, to abortions, to the father changing his mind and giving approval to this male scum, this script offers nothing redeemable. ""Baby"" has no clue about anything and is one of the dumbest characters ever seen on film.I am not surprised to read about so many reviewers who thought this was ""cool"" when they were young and stupid, but now that they are a lot more mature, look at this film again almost in shock at how bad it looks to them now.

I felt no emotional attachment to any of the characters because throughout the entire thing they were bland and shallow. As for the relationship between Johnny and Baby, I found it to be equally as tasteless. The older man, coupled with the forbidden love just gives me a headache. The least they could do was make it only slightly better. As you can see I don't have a very positive view of the movie.

I'm really only writing this as a note to myself on what I thought of this,"This isn't my ""normal genre"" of movies. I'm not into dancing movies, or RomComs that much. Most of the movie was just meh/okay. Some parts were dumb, and not even halfway through I was kind of bored. I was laughing at the fight scene, which is probably not what was supposed to happen. It just seemed to fake. The way some of the ""serious"" or ""romantic"" lines are delivered also made me laugh. It seemed way to dramatic or toned weirdly. This would be a fun movie to watch with someone and shout random things at the TV. I was going to rate it 6, because it wasn't bad, just bland/average, but I have to admit the end was really cute. It gave me High School Musical 2 vibes, so that movie was probably inspired a bit by this. While they were dancing on stage he looked at her with a little half smile and that was a really cute moment between them.

It matters not that they are so different. Different is what makes the connections so comfortable. It is a complete pleasure viewing Dirty Dancer and looking forward to watching Top Gun.

"Relies on cliché, platitudes, easy sentiment and a great soundtrack but it sets out its stall, knows its audience and delivers well","It was the summer of 1963 when the Houseman's went to Kellerman's resort, where the wealthy enjoy dancing and light entertainment. The dancing is very safe and the Kellerman's youngest daughter ""Baby"" is more taken in by the more upbeat and wild dancing that takes place over in the staff quarters (much to the disapproval of Mr Kellerman). When one of the dancers gets ""in trouble"", Baby tries to help even though the dancers (particularly Johnny) distrust her motives and dislike her spoilt background. As she learns to dance with Johnny though, Baby wins them over while also growing up in several ways during the summer.A recent Orange ""don't let a phone ruin your movie"" skit at UGC featuring Patrick Swayze reminded me that I had never actually gotten round to seeing this film. Strange as it sounds I could tell you the plot and knew it from the music videos and general cultural knowledge but I'd not actually sat and watched it. Well, anyway, I did recently and found a basic but effective film that did just what I expected along fairly predictable lines. For those who hate sentiment this will be a big problem and they should not even bother but for viewers that love this sort of thing or can get caught up in it then it is pretty much spot on. The ""learning to dance"" device asks you to accept a bit of a stretch in credibility but generally it is well used to follow Baby as she goes from a teenager into a young woman. It isn't the deepest of affairs and is built on cliché and platitudes at times but generally it has the heart to make it work.Ardolino milks this sense of passion pretty well and delivers the film pretty straight. The cast don't have a lot of depth to work with but they do generally have what it takes to make this sort of material work. Grey was surprisingly subtle with her character and I was quite taken by her deepening  it is not her fault that the script asks her to do a lot quickly. Swayze has a more obvious character but he is sexy and convincing in his character's strengths as well as his weaknesses. Below them nobody is actually that good (although Orbach is a solid presence) but this doesn't matter too much as the central chemistry is what carries the story.Overall then a fairly obvious but effective film that will easily win over fans of the genre. It relies on cliché, platitudes, easy sentiment and a great soundtrack to do this, which does prevent it being deep and realistic enough to win over the sceptics but it sets out its stall, knows its audience and delivers well.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A pop culture staple and iconic movie of the 1980s that is... set in the 1960s?,"The Time Of My Life and Hungry Eyes are timeless Pop Hits, allowing them to transcend time to be the soundtrack to the summer of 1961 for a Reagan-like resort with a very horny staff. The age gap between the leads (Swayze and Grey) ages poorly, but their chemistry is undeniable.Time setting aside, this is an eighties' movie to its core with all the decade-defining tropes: training montage, surface-level class commentary and surprise somber subplots. Kenny Ortega brings some serious choreography heat to this film that likely serves as an inspiration for his later masterpiece, High School Musical 2. Dirty Dancing's 80's brand of corny charm has just increased with time as nostalgia for the decade continues to grow; this charm combined with iconic musical scenes makes it easy to see why it became the cult classic it is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"The dancing makes this movie the fabulous classic that it is. I could watch a million times, and still be in love with it","It could be the summer atmosphere, or the time frame of simpler days, or maybe it's the forbidden love between the ultimate bad boy and daddy's little girl, and the music that perfectly sets the mood for each scene; but what I think what makes the movie, Dirty Dancing, so intriguing is simply the dancing itself. We've all seen those movies where we leave the theater thinking we can sing any song, or move to any beat that comes our way, and this is one of those movies. The dancing is different from any other movie, because although it takes place in the sixties, the dancing is so much more risqué than anything movie watchers were accustomed to seeing at that point in time. While using older songs combined with young, sensual dancing the movie is able to reach out to an audience with a variety of ages.The movie introduces its unique dancing early on, automatically intriguing the viewers to question things like ""Did people really dance like that?"" and ""Could I learn how?"" The movie is able to reach out to these common people by having the main character, Baby Houseman, witness the dancing for the very first time and shows her utter shock, but also her desire to know more. As the plot continues and the characters become more developed the dancing becomes not only a sight to see, but also it leaves a window for inferences to be made. As Baby is trained to dance by bad-boy Johnny the viewers begin to wonder if their sensual dancing will ever lead to something more? This movie is able to take the typical idea of ""boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love"" and completely make it new, unique, and fascinating all through the use of dance.As Baby and Johnny get to know each other better throughout their training process, the movement of their dancing goes from simply following the motions, and transitions to actually feeling the music and even expressing their inner feelings for one another. As their love affair grows so does the viewers love and desire to see more and more dancing. The movie does a great job creating the idea that the characters are their truest selves in dancing scenes more than any other.I think so many people enjoy the movie because it doesn't just tell a love story, but shows one. It is able to show a love story not by the characters words but by their choreography. Before Baby or Johnny even declares their feelings for one another it is seen in the way their dancing morphs over time, from impersonal to all consuming. To the characters in the movie, their raunchy dancing is a way to rebel against the expectations of the generations above them, and through this the movie gives the audience a sense of defiance and the idea that they should be proud to do what they love, no matter what society may think.Over all it is so difficult to pin-point what makes Dirty Dancing the wonderful, cliché classic that it is, but the dancing aspect I feel is what ties the intriguing plot, the charismatic characters, the music, and the beautiful setting all together to create something more than a romantic drama. Dirty Dancing is one of those movies I could watch time after time and only grow more in love with it. It has the perfect amount of drama, romance, conflict, and cheesy monologues to satisfy all my desires when watching a movie. Because of this movie the song Time of My Life will always strike a chord in my heart and dancing will never be quite as great unless it's Dirty Dancing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Pack up the Car, follow Route 17 to Kellerman's","!963 The height of the Borscht Belt, the Catskills . A mountain range in upstate New York when Hotels, motels and bungalow colonies sprung up up like dandy lions in an abandoned field. Some say the Idea or origins of the Catskills region was the location and natural setting just a couple of hours away from New York and Philadelphia areas where Jewish families could relax for a couple of weeks at affordable prices. In the 1930's and 40's Jews were denied vacancies in other hotels do to anti antisemitism. Jewish oriented luxury hotels, Motels, Bungalow colonies and Sleep-away camps of every description accommodated Jewish clientele in every price range. This made for a quick fix to rejuvenate the senses before the fall season/ school commences. Enough with the History lesson. On with the review. It's 1963 The Kennedy's lived in the White House and Rock and Roll filled the air waves with the sounds of WABC and Bruce Morrow at the mic, known as a DJ (Disc Jockey), who talked between songs . Song artists the likes of Jan & Dean, The Four Seasons, The Beach Boys and Lesley Gore performing as the teenage multitude tried to master the latest dance steps such as the FREDDIE or the FRUG or maybe the MASH POTATO or the SHIMMY? This brings us full circle to our story of loyalty, trust and for a lack of a better word, judgement. Dr. Houseman (Jerry Orhbach) and his Family arrive at Kellerman's resort in the heart of the Catskill Mountains . Along with Mrs. Houseman (Kelly Bishop) and their two Teenage daughters Lisa (Jane Brucker) and our centerpiece of this story Frances ,AKA,"" Baby"" Houseman. The family settles in on this country setting at Kellerman's Resort run by the chubby, lispy Max Kellerman played by character actor deluxe Jack Weston. Max Boasts about his Danish being pure protein as he assembles the patrons for the daily routine of dancing lessons during the day light hours. The help or dance instructors are basically teenagers or of college years. One stand out is the tall auburn haired, beady eyed Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Baby is curious about the crowd beyond the main bungalows and is taken by Johnny Castle. Although Johnny comes from a humble background Baby is taken by his charm and elegance as Johnny regular partner Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) is pregnant and to complicate things further has an abortion. that renders her bed ridden and infected. Baby takes her place and practices as Johnny and Baby become a dance team working side performances at competing Hotels unbeknownst to her doting Father. Johnny and Baby are trying to master the famous swan catch. Diversions of infidelity and false accusations thicken as Dr. Houseman and Max Kellerman accuse Johnny of wrong doing. Fine performances by the obnoxious full of himself Neil Kellerman (Lonny Price),the Bosses son and the insidious, philandering Robbie the bus boy, (Max Cantor) add to this piece of Borscht Belt nostalgia. This Movie strikes a distant cord with me as I fall into a trance of past experiences going to the mountains with my parents. Homowack Lodge and Davos ski resort bring back a ton of wonderful memories. Just a bygone era captured on film. The success of this film is how the story captures the atmosphere of bungalow life. Moreover,what it was like to experience a day in the.: as my BUBY would say: ""Day in the mountains!""

Dirty Dancing,"Add this to the file of films I didn't think I would like nearly as much as I did. Wow, I couldn't have been more wrong Dirty Dancing. Emile Ardolino directed the 1987 classic starring Jennifer Grey and the late Patrick Swayze. The film centered around a sheltered daughter and the life-changing summer her family spends at the Catskills resort in 1963. What I had written off as ""just another '80's romance"" was actually a wonderful coming-of-age story of a girl discovering how the world exists outside of her privileged upbringing.Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) a daddy's girl from a privileged family has already surprised her family by announcing that she is to join the Peace Corps at the end of the summer. She had been expected to go college and marry a doctor, the same profession as her father and establish a financially secure life for herself. One night, however, a chance meeting changes her destiny. All baby thought she was doing was carrying a watermelon to a staff dance party when she first lays eyes on Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) the chiseled dance instructor of the resort. Johny knows no privilege, and unlike Baby, has had to struggle his whole life. His life is nearing a downward spiral since his dance partner has become pregnant and unable to get the money or the healthcare access to an abortion. Wanting to help a distressed woman and find a way into Johnny's heart, Baby lies to her father about the purpose and is given the money Johnny's dance partner uses to obtain her abortion. She then fills in as Johnny's dance partner in order to save his spot on the roster. As the two spend more and more hours together they fall in love and Baby is stuck between her family's expectations and her own romantic interests. As her father begins to find out what Baby has been up to and how he has been used in the scheme, her relationships with everyone are tested and she must decide how to mend them, and which to attempt to save first.Dirty Dancing begins with an opening narration, and I am an absolute sucker for a well-executed narration. The narration was used well and effective in providing a bit of background info into the background Baby had enjoyed all of her life. Throughout the film, it felt a bit like I was watching Double Indemnity with all the Baby's, so I only wish Baby had earned a different nickname; although, I suppose the iconic line ""Nobody puts sweetie in a corner"" would have had the same effect. The dancing was engaging, and not as annoying of a storyline as I presumed it would be. I thought it was going to be a tired ""spends a lot of time together so they fall in love"" kind of romances, but the added layers of the upbringing struggles was an engaging aspect. Patrick Swayze's performance was riveting, I haven't seen much, if any, of his acting roles so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised with both his acting and dancing skills. Jennifer Grey nailed the dancing angle but came off a bit wooden throughout her non-dancing scenes. The supporting cast was wonderful, as well; I mean, has Jerry Orbach ever been less than stellar in a role he has taken on? Dirty Dancing proved my expectation of ""just another 80's romance"" wrong, I can assure you of that as I stand in line at Target waiting to buy a copy of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Just OK,"Dirty Dancing is a movie that I literally did not watch until yesterday, many many years after I was born and many many years after it was first released.I always promised myself that I would never sit down and watch it because I knew what people said about it and the ""best parts"" to me all sounded pretty stupid, like the famous dance scene and ""nobody puts baby in the corner""...But it turned out to be OK. The music is pretty stupid now but I have to admit as a child of the eighties who heard the soundtrack on the radios and when friends played it on -- GASP -- cassette tapes at each other's houses and at school, so of them were good songs. At least songs you can listen to without puking.Patrick Swayze looks so young in this and he's really good in his part, and so is Jennifer Gray. Not sure why she got surgery to change her nose, she looks great in this and Ferris Bueller. A very pretty girl who is good in this and could also do comedy.Have to say though the whole age difference thing is pretty creepy, what is she in this like 16? And he's in his thirties? Ewwwwwww!

Everything building up to it is necessary and, consequently, moving . . . but that scene leaves me breathless and goosebumped to this day.Do not avoid this movie because it is seemingly a superficial teenage romance.

"""Nobody puts Baby in a corner.""","I had never actually seen this film and I was 40 years old. Then I saw it on the big screen with my wife and I really enjoyed it.

There she meets Johnny Castle (really well played by Patrick Swayze and really put him on the map) who is a dance instructor at the resort. Dancing and love soon follow. The things that really grabbed me were the dancing (Swayze really was a good dancer) and a really awesome soundtrack including new songs at the time such as 'Hungry Eyes' by Eric Carmen, 'I've Had the Time of My Life' by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes and Swayze's own single 'She's Like the Wind'.

The cheesyness level...,"If we're talking about cheesy romantic movies, Dirty Dancing has to be in the mix. It's one of the films for which teenagers in the 80's and 90's sighed and dreamed of an idealized love until they couldn't bear it. But let's leave the cultural impact out and focus on what is displayed on the screen.We see an unambitious script that takes few risks, playing it safe with a simple and melodramatic story. The target audience is portrayed in the main protagonist, who meets a gallant dancer, responsible for several sighs and moans in her female followers. The performances are right on the border between acceptable and exaggerated, because like a good romantic drama, there have to be accents and nuances that know how to play with emotions.All technical aspects are austere. They comply, but they don't stand out. Even some, like the sound editing, are with the needle closer to the negative side, but everything manages to remain firm, compact and concise.If you don't like romantic movies, this clearly won't be your favorite movie of the week.

Celluloid bubblegum,"This is possibly one of those films that will remain popular with women who were teenagers when it first came out, but quickly become forgotten when, in another 40-50 years or so, those said women start falling off their perches. My 30-something partner barely moved for its duration, whisked back by its cheesy tunes and Patrick Swayze's finely toned body to her mid-teens for a couple of hours. Afterwards, she admitted that it's pretty stupid, but films that take us back to our youth usually are.The film briefly made a star of Swayze, and it's not difficult to see why he got the part of the beefcake dancing instructor who uses his looks and movements to seduce the wealthy wives who frequent the summer resort where he works (even though he was probably 10 years too old for the part). But it's Jennifer Grey as Baby who gives the performance of the film for my money, injecting an energetic enthusiasm into the scenes between those in which she is a nervous waif or put-upon younger sister. She's a pretty thing, but her looks are unconventional, and not designed for long-lasting stardom.The story is pure candy-floss, and not intended to be taken seriously, and there's little attempt at recapturing the fifties era in which the story takes place, but it all looks very handsome and the director captures some moments that even today, nearly a quarter of a century after it was made, remain in the collective movie-going consciousness.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Nostalgia, the soundtrack and a strong lead balance out a weak movie","""Dirty Dancing"" is a quintessential '80s movie, yet it takes place in the early 1960s during the waning years of the age of idealism, just before taking family trips to a resort in the Catskill Mountains was out of fashion. That imbues this summer romance movie with two layers of nostalgia, especially 30 years after its release, and it's nostalgia that by and large carries this film for those who love it, with one exception.The film follows 17-year-old Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) on her family trip to Kellerman's resort in the summer of 1963. Presumably no longer entertained by line dancing and the full array of family activities, Baby noses into what the resort staff are up to, which is where she sees Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) a dance performer and instructor. Since Johnny and the other dancers have to be on their best behavior and cater to the guests all day, at night they express themselves by having steamy, sensual dance parties. Baby, as proper a good girl as she may be, is helplessly drawn into their world (and Johnny's arms).That's the story  the plot is that Baby discovers Johnny's dance partner, Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) is pregnant after hooking up with a waiter at the resort and Baby helps her get money for a (then very illegal) abortion, the timing of which would leave Johnny in need of a dance partner, an opening Baby volunteers to fill.So there's a reason most people forget what actually happens in ""Dirty Dancing,"" which was scandalous for 1987 let alone 1963. The reason they can so easily forget is because it's really a movie about Baby. Her awakening from ideal daughter of a well-to-do family about to go to college and join the peace corps to a risk-taker and rule-defier who in the span of a week falls for a sensitive hunk is a classic fantasy. Baby is not your typical damsel in distress protagonist. She's got a good head on her shoulders. But she's curious. She's never let herself go. A lot of people can identify with that, or remember summer nights when they too wanted to indulge that fantasy.Baby being a character who so many people can see themselves as is the one strength of ""Dirty Dancing"" that isn't the choreography, director Emile Ardolino's sensual approach or the amazing soundtrack. The other characters and the scenarios are half-baked, awkward or laughable. That said, tearing into a film as beloved as this one has no real value.There does, however, feel like a missed opportunity. Writer Eleanor Bergstein undoubtedly drew from her own experience in telling this story, which is why the nostalgia factor is so effective. The premise alone evokes all those summer vacation emotions, meaning the right story would really connect. The problem is she doesn't capitalize. There's absolutely no logic at the basis of anything that happens or the way Baby and Johnny's relationship develops. You could argue that summer flings happen in this magical, ephemeral sort of way, but Bergstein undercooks all the scenes and Ardolino takes a largely serious approach. All the movie's best moments are when the characters let loose and act a little silly, when the script fades away to moments between Baby and Johnny in which Grey and Swayze just get to focus on chemistry.Other than repeating what ""Footloose"" already told '80s audiences about everyone needing to just ""cut loose,"" ""Dirty Dancing"" doesn't have anything to say. It opts to keep a rosy romantic bubble all the way to the credits and serve as a reminder of a certain time in American history; Mr. Kellerman's line at the end about the Catskill resort culture disappearing reveals Bergstein's true goal of simply remembering it. The truth is ""Dirty Dancing"" is about the 1960s, but it has the spirit and soul of an '80s movie; it's not a period piece but a recollection of one time period from the perspective of another.Trying to be as objective as possible, ""Dirty Dancing"" is a stupid movie, but one steeped in nostalgia with a respectable main character and an alluring style. Somehow, against anyone's better judgment, these components manage to create moments of resonance at a universal, multi-generational level, to the point that you can't simply write it off.~Steven CThanks for reading!

A minor classic.,"Dirty Dancing (1987)'Nobody puts baby in the corner.'Dirty Dancing has been a cult classic, and I can see why; it is an inspiring, iconic, musically superb story about dancing and love amongst breathtaking locations.The film, which explores the progressing relationship between a wealthy but kind girl nicknamed Baby (Jennifer Gray) and a dance instructor(Patrick Swayze), develops in a luxurious holiday resort in America in 1963.The film above all has excellent moments of music (including the Oscar winning song 'Time of My Life') and dance (various iconic moments).While the film never delves deep, it has dramatic elements, most notably revolving around class divisions which is a barrier between Grey and Swayze's characters (Baby's father is not accepting of the dance instructor).Never dramatically intense, however the film manages to strike a few powerful and even emotional moments, which elevates it to a 7/10.Falls short of a masterpiece, but a minor classic.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Truly excellent with jaw-dropping dance routines.,"Dirty Dancing is an excellent movie. No, it isn't perfect, but it is solid entertainment for those into dancing. There are two flaws with the film. The script is not the best script in the world, to be honest, there are some clichés. Also, as much as Cynthia Rhodes puts a lot of energy into the dance routines, her acting isn't as good unfortunately.However, putting those minor discrepancies aside, the highlights are the jaw-dropping if rather erotic dance routines and the ever-popular soundtrack. The famous lift in the best dance of the film is very hard to do properly, and as far as I'm aware, it was very well-done. The soundtrack isn't like Charlie's Angels or anything similar to that, where the songs get too much. If anything, they capture the feel-good nature of the film perfectly.Now for the performances. I have already mentioned Cynthia Rhodes, but I thought that Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey gave the roles of their careers in Dirty Dancing. Their partnership was like Torvill and Dean on ice, unquestionably brilliant. Jerry Orbach gives a wonderful performance also as the earnest Jake Housemann.In conclusion, with a couple of minor flaws, Dirty Dancing is a treat, for those into dancing.8/10.

Good Energy Despite Formulaic Screenplay,"I've seen Dirty Dancing (1987) a few times over the years, and finally getting around to reviewing....rewatched recently. The movie , written by Eleanor Bergstein and directed by Emile Ardolino is a fun watch with some dramatic flare but at times formulaic cliched. One of the problems of the movie is the director's choice of anachronistic music that doersn't reflect the picture's timeframe and setting. This isn't a deal-breaker but its distracting. The strengths of the movie are the well-done chemistry between leads Jennifer Grey and th late Patrick Swayze; there are some great dance-learning scenes that Ardolino takes the time to focus on interesting details like timing, balance, and presentation. These are important to understanding the effort and time needed to become good performers and some specifics of dancing. Anyway, the socio-economic class struggles are bit cookie-cutter unfortunately and.blase. It seems fairly perfunctory including dialog reflecting 'daddy's little girl' and 'rich vs poor'. Still focusing on Swayze's outstanding dancing and Grey's smile and charm help lift the movie to good footing. One of Swayze's biggest hits and most memorable roles, and certainly Grey's, overlooking its smaller flaws, Dirty Dancing still shows a pulse and performance energy that make it entertaining. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A cult milestone with substantial dance sequences elevating carefully delivered formula,"After the decline of ballrooms as a popular night out, partner dance enjoyed a revival with the rise of mambo and various forms of salsa in the USA. The eighties also saw an upsurge of partner dance in Britain with the development of 'modern jive', a simple dance that anyone could learn. Tapping into this enthusiasm comes Dirty Dancing (1987), a well-constructed if cheesy love story that has partner dance at its core. Fronted by the charismatic Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, it also contains a note of rebelliousness that appeals to its teenage target audience.The opening credits (in luminous pink) set the tone with sepia shots of sexy dance routines, slowed down to emphasise sensuousness. The 60s Ronettes' song, Be My Baby, hearkens back to an era before the Beatles, before the death of Kennedy.'Baby' - the insultingly diminutive name for the heroine (played by Jennifer Grey) is a young girl ahead of her time. She can't wait to join the peace core. But for now, she is being whisked off to summer camp with her protective parents and her superficial sister, Lisa. ""Baby's going to change the world,"" quips her father, whereas Lisa's going to decorate it.At the camp, glamorous female dance teacher Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) has the job of making staid dances (like line-dancing) look appealing to the masses. Baby however, chances upon the dance staff's private party, where a much raunchier dance is practiced. Johnny Castle (Swayze) is a downtrodden dance instructor from the streets. In contrast to the Harvard and Yale educated (and outwardly respectable) youngsters, he is labelled with an unfairly bad reputation, and with strict instructions not to flirt with guests. As Castle and Baby follow their hearts, each striving towards a moral high ground forsaken by society, they are drawn inevitably together.Why such a formulaic and much-copied movie has held such fascination is sometimes a mystery. Its strengths are the tightness of its construction and the first rate dancing abilities. With the gradual demise of mass of studio-based song-and-dance films associated with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, came a shortage of stars who could both dance well and act. Swayze not only had considerable acting experience but was born into a dance family and trained with the prestigious Joffrey Ballet School. As is evident from the companion (dance instruction) video, Swayze Dancing, he toned down his abilities as a dancer to play Johnny Castle, but still looks riveting.Mambo - which can be performed in a very erotic and sensual manner - is sometimes called 'diabolo' - the devil's dance. Unlike many dance-romance movies that followed, this film features many actual dance sequences, augmented by a spontaneous style of acting, but with the dancing obviously performed 'for real' rather than produced as a result of extensive fast editing cuts - as was the case, for instance, in films like Chicago (2002).The dirty dancing in the film is ultimately a mix of styles, principally mambo and showcase, and provided momentum for many of the popular dance schools of the time and in the years that followed. The film is part of the wave of 80s indie films that convinced the big studios to diversify and join forces with independents to capture teen audiences. Its sexiness, combines with a James Dean style defiance, appeals to male fantasies The sugary love, of strong girl nevertheless rescued-by-dashing-handsome-man, woos young women. While Dirty Dancing lacks greatness, its enduring strengths are too easily overlooked. If nothing else, it provided a template for dozens of lacklustre movies that emulated its song and storyline formula without emulating its strengths.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The 80's produced some excellent movies,"This is one of those films you should have seen at least once in your life, but I realised part way in that I haven't actually seen this. Though of course this ultimate 'chick flick' is so very known, it's difficult not to feel you've seen it.I was surprised to see it set in the 60's, I presume it was a present day and was rather disappointed by what felt like a lack of recreation of the era, it just didn't feel very 60's. It's not really necessary to detail the plot, other than it really is boy meets girl. The story is quite standard, yet it's done quite nicely and even delves into darker territory with abortion and the perils of promiscuity being sub plots.The leads Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze work well together, with Swayze a handsome lead and amazing to think he was 36 when he made this. Grey is nice as the innocent discovering herself, but I did find her a little too plain. The film's main element for me were the dance scenes an there's plenty of dancing to be had. The leads are excellent dancers and the choreography and camera work are very good; there is also a good soundtrack.The film has legions of massive fans and it is perhaps easy to see, it's quite a classic story and over the years has spawned a bad sequel and a plethora of wannabe films as well as many skits, parodies and references; one of the films most massive lines, indeed moments is when at the hotel's end of season show, Johnny comes to get Frances and says 'Nobody puts Baby in a corner', but I was quite taken aback at the delivery of this, it seemed really abrupt and almost done so quickly that if you weren't paying attention you may have missed it. Still the ending is quite rousing by the time everyone is up and dancing and ultimately there's a lot of fun and a lot to enjoy in this light romantic drama.More of review at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
One of my favorite movies ever!!,I go absolutely bonkers off the walls for this movie it is the pinnacle of youth and summertime and unforgettable experiences it is so pretty and good. Ifyou do not overanalyze the questionable but legal age difference it is fine lmao 😥🙏 . But the soundtrack is absolutely all star and the casting and writing is delicious and the set is very pretty and the ending makes me bawl and go absolutely berserk it is so lovely.

So this is where pretty little liars got the idea for Ezria?,"How does everyone just ignore the obvious grooming in this movie? She was 16 or maybe 17 I don't even remember and she was being seduced and groomed by a man is his late twenties, her father had every right to react as he did if you think about it his reaction wasn't big enough, the worst part is that the movie makes their relationship seem as though it is the ultimate goal for love completely ignoring that little girls are gonna watch this and be completely infatuated with this disgusting depiction of ""love"" and are possibly going to find themselves in a similar situation but the difference is in real life 9/10 a man in his late twenties dating a teenager is a predator and it won't end as happily as it did, when I first watched this movie I didn't think it was inappropriate as I'm sure a lot of young girls did and the worst part is that was only a few years ago (I was eight maybe) and when I realized how awful they really are I told my father and he too had never thought of it the way it really is which shows how truly harmful this movie is and people need to realize that and stop talking about this horrid film as if it were a masterpiece.",1.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Iconic movie with awesome soundtrack and electrifying chemistry,"The film stars Jennifer Grey as Baby Houseman, a young woman who finds herself at a summer resort with her family.

"Entertaining hit with lush Appalachian locations, but the writing doesn't respect the intelligence of the viewer","RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Emile Ardolino, ""Dirty Dancing"" stars Patrick Swayze as Johnny Castle, a working-class dance instructor at a mountain resort in the Catskills in 1963. Jennifer Grey costars as ""Baby,"" the 17-year-old daughter of an affluent Jewish doctor vacationing at the resort. She takes the place of Johnny's dance partner after his partner gets pregnant, albeit not by Johnny. Baby naturally develops a crush.This was the hit romantic drama of 1987, but it actually didn't make as much at the domestic box office compared to the other two dance flicks of the 80s: ""Flashdance"" (1983) made $95 million and ""Footloose"" (1984) $80 million while ""Dirty Dancing"" brought it $64 million. The two main cast members are a highlight. Swayze was in his prime and Jennifer Grey cute & nimble, like a fawn. In reality Grey was 26 years-old during filming, although she passes for late teens pretty well. Swayze, however, was 34 and looked it, albeit trim and fit.The lush Appalachian locations are outstanding and the story keeps your attention but you'll roll your eyes at the idiotic misunderstanding where Baby's father assumes Johnny's the one who got his partner pregnant and, for some strange reason, no one sets him straight. Not to mention, the characters always say the wrong thing at the wrong time, which perpetuates the misunderstanding. Also, the sexual union of Johnny & Baby is both premature and unbelievable in light of the time period, Baby's age (17 years-old) and her upbringing. Frankie Avalon was once asked about his early 60's ""Beach"" movies if the male-female relationships were as ""squeaky clean"" as portrayed and he answered (paraphrasing): ""As a teen back then 'going all the way' wasn't even considered an option."" The obvious exception would be disreputable kids from the ""other side of the tracks.""Moreover, the fact that Johnny is having sex with the doctor's daughter, a minor at that, can't win any points in his favor. Hence, even without the misunderstanding there's little reason for the father to warm up to Johnny. So why does the doctor show respect for Johnny at the end, a dude who's fornicating with his under-aged daughter and is clearly much older than her as well, although it could be argued that he's naïve and doesn't necessarily know they're having sex already. Flaws like these smack of lazy writing and are offensive to anyone with an ounce of intelligence.If you can look past these problems, however, the film is entertaining. The dance sequences shown in the staff area are akin to vertical sex with clothes on. I guess that's why it's called ""Dirty Dancing,"" huh? Yet this is another flaw of the movie: these scenes are so amped-up and choreographed they shout to the viewer via megaphone: ""This is A MOVIE; it's NOT REAL."" Nonetheless, Grey's a cutie, Swayze's The Man and the beautiful Appalachian locations are a highlight, filmed at Mountain Lake Resort, Pembroke, Virginia, and Lake Lure, NC.THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 45 minutes.

Compare Dirty Dancing with Girls Just Want to Have Fun,"I have always loved the movie Dirty Dancing but just recently I saw the movie Girls Just Want to Have Fun and I see a lot of similarities. I looked up the release dates on IMDb and it turns out that Girls Just Want to Have Fun came out in 1985 while Dirty Dancing didn't come out till 1987. Does anyone else see the similarities? Both movies have: young people dancing, the main couple have to over come their problems and learning to get a long, the father of the main female character is overbearing and doesn't like what she is doing until the final dance, practicing the overhead lift, winning the hearts of everyone, the girls are stepping out, taking chances, and breaking the rules.

Great fun!,"This movie isn't deep nor is there anything that stands out as being technically astounding, but this movie is a fantastic, fast-paced feel-good movie.  The mid 80's has some great films that have cult status today and this is one of them!It is the simple story of how Baby (Jennifer Grey - looking as great as ever)and her family vacation in the Catskills where the ultra-cool dance instructor's partner gets pregnant and he needs a new partner.Of course, the instructor is Patrick Swayze and you know where the movie is headed but it is such a joy to watch the story develop and the end is perfectly fitting for the film.  Not to mention an excellent score that is a combination of 60s and 80s songs.And almost every character is memorable: Lisa - the skanky sister, Neil - the nerdy grandson, Tito Suarez who has the funniest look on his face when asked about sheet music, etc. Virtually every scene is memorable too, especially the 'Do You Love Me' scene, the log/water scene, and the final dance number.  Perhaps my favorite moment is when Patrick Swayze bashes the car window and it is only raining on half of the screen when he picks up the post.The point is this: Watch this movie - alone, in a group, on a rainy day, on a Sunday afternoon.  It is along with Ferris Bueller's Day Off, one of the best movies of the 80's!",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

There is also the slimy nephew of the holiday camp owner with his constant veiled threats against the camp staff.

Another iconic movie of the 80s.,"Dirty Dancing is one of the most iconic movies of the 1980s, a story where Frances Houseman (Jennifer Grey) falls in love with dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) while spending the summer at a holiday camp with her family.This is one of those movies I saw once when I was a kid. While I don't remember much of it, I do recall finding the chemistry between Frances and Johnny very endearing - one of the most cinematic couples in movie history. The dance scenes between the couple are well-choreographed and awe-inspiring, helped by a catchy soundtrack and breathtaking songs, including ""Hungry Eyes"" and ""Time of your Life."" Actor Jerry Orbach was one of the better supporting actors in the movie, doing a great job in playing the calm and stern, yet kind father to Frances. The script to the film isn't bad; found it quite entertaining. It is just a little sappy at times and the pacing is kind of slow in certain parts.Overall, it's a nice piece of romantic drama with memorable songs.Grade B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

A classic,"The Houseman family arrived at a Catskills resort in 1963: the dad, a doctor (Jerry Orbach), mom( Jane Brucker) and Frances, called Baby (Jennifer Grey).Though from a totally opposite background, Baby becomes fascinated with Johnny (Patrick Swayze), the resort choreographer/dance instructor. When his partner (Cynthia Rhodes) needs money for an abortion, Baby gets money from her dad by lying to him. Baby is able to fill in as Johnny's dance partner, and they fall in love.Unfortunately, the abortion is botched and since Baby's dad is a doctor, he needs to be brought in to help. He assumes Johnny got her pregnant and is livid that he inadvertently paid for an illegal abortion. He forbids Baby to associate with Johnny or the dancers again.Baby doesn't listen, and as a result, Johnny's job is in jeopardy.Wonderful movie with great dancing, music, and lively characters. Cynthia Rhodes demonstrates her great dancing ability, and Jerry Orbach as Baby's dad shows his caring and concern.Patrick Swayze is handsome and charismatic as Johnny, and he and Grey have great chemistry.Directed by Emile Ardolino, Dirty Dancing is energetic film that deservedly became a mega hit.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"A good, entertaining romantic drama that even today someone can enjoy","Dirty Dancing is a movie that was made before my time, and seeing that i am going to the Broadway soon i figured, why not check out the original film first. This was a romantic drama that was actually pretty good, for someone who didn't grow up dreaming about Patrick Swayze i thought this was still a pretty entertaining film. Now the overall plot isn't the most original thing because everyone knows what is going to happen in these movies but it does enough to surprise you and keep you interested. The main way they do this is through the characters, the characters are all so different that right from the get go you know the type of character they are and can see them change over the course of the film. The character chemistry is also really well done especially between Swayze and Jennifer Grey. Their dialogue and the way their relationship evolves throughout the film really holds the film together. Some of the other characters aren't as well setup in the film and only show up when the plot needs them to but you forget about that as you realise they aren't the focus. They both play their respective roles really well and you are at all times convinced that their relationship could be very real.The dance sequences are also some of the highlights of the movie, they really bring a positive and uplifting feel to the film to counter some of the more emotional scenes. And what would be a dance sequence without some music, the soundtrack in this film was great, filled with classic songs that even i knew some of the words to and really get you in a good mood. Where i would say the film gets let down is with its pacing. The movie does move at a pretty steady pace but there are quite a few moments in the middle that kind of drag on a little too much, and although it is for the character development, some of the longer scenes could have been cut down. But in the end this was an enjoyable film, not the greatest romantic drama of its era but definitely a really good one to watch. - 7",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

A good love story is timeless,"Since ever the rich families sought to protect their children from marriages that could jeopardize their status and prestige. Baby Houseman is a girl whose parents expect a lot, but things go wrong when her family learns that she is in love with a dance instructor with humble origins and dubious life. Directed by Emile Ardolino and with a screenplay by Eleanor Bergstein, it has Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey in the lead roles.This is probably one of the most famous romantic movies of the eighties. Jennifer Grey was up to the challenge and did a good interpretation but, despite her talent and commitment, she ended up overshadowed by a huge Patrick Swayze. This film can be considered the best in the career of this actor that was, precisely, a dancer before beginning to play. It's undeniable that his taste for dancing and talent for gallant roles were essential to his performance, contributing a lot to make him a true ""male sex symbol"" at the time. The script itself doesn't bring anything new: rich girl meets poor boy and they fall in love, jealous people try to separate them, girl's family doesn't accept their love etc... We have seen this many times in film, theater or even in literature. Nevertheless, it's a story that works well and it's enriched by some interesting details that help to thicken the plot, as the situation around an illegal abortion that one of the characters has to do. In addition to the interpretation of Swayze, the most positive point of the film are the choreography's and an amazing and memorable soundtrack, marked by the songs ""She's Like the Wind"" and ""I've Had The Time Of My Life"". The latter can even be considered one of the most famous love songs of the eighties and won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for Best Original Song (1987).Despite the time that has passed since it's release in the cinema, and Swayze himself has passed away however, this film continues to mean a lot to many people and to be a landmark of romantic cinema.

Proto Type For 1980's Musical,"Jerry Orbach, Patrick Swayzee, & a few others do pretty well with this movie. The soundtrack is terrific especially digging out old gems like Big Girls Don't Cry by Frankie Valli & Wipe Out by the Safaris.The story itself is a typical 80's musical harmless plot. Can baby keep her virginity while learning to dance from the hot dirty dance teacher? The best part of this film is the fact it gives the viewer an early 60's feel for the suburbs outside of New York City. It is quite notable that it does this as this feel is what gets this film to a 7 in my analysis.Not a real serious film but a film which reflects the early 60's well. It has plenty going for it & is the best of a terrible decade of Musicals known as the 1980's. This looks like a masterpiece when you compare it to 1980's Popeye.

Cheesy Romance. . .It's Not Necessarily a Bad Thing,"Okay, so no one ever accused this film of being artistic and critically acclaimed.  But so what?  It's one of those guilty little pleasures.  It's the perfect slumber party flick whether you're 13 or 30.  I literally think that the phrase ""chic flick"" was coined with this movie in mind.  I don't expect guys to understand--unless said guys understand what it's like to be a pre (or just post) pubescent 14 year old girl enamored with the likes of Patrick Swayze, ready to swoon at the sight of him in a black tank top bumping and grinding his way across the floor.  Sure it's juvenile and the acting is not Oscar quality, but there's something in it for every girl who has had a secret crush on an older guy or the ""bad boy"".

Did any girl watch that movie and not fall in love with Johnny Castle? I doubt it.

Quite Possibly the Worst Movie Ever Made.,"This movie should never have been made. Yuck. If you like this movie, you're probably twelve and female and have no sense of what art and film is or should be, and probably shouldn't be watching movies in the first place. Flat story based on even flatter subject-matter. I don't know what is worse, that this film ever got made or that Hollywood continues to find reasons to make films about *dancing*. Let's just pretend that the story was good, the dialog anything other than flat, the direction and photography somehow original...it wouldn't matter. *Dancing* has to be the least-compelling base subject matter for any story or film. But don't worry, if if the whole idea of dancing doesn't make you want to vomit, the flat acting, directing, and dialog will, I assure you. Unless you are literally a twelve-year old girl, or just have yet to mentally mature beyond that, I think you'll agree.

Dancing in Handcuffs,"You have to really try hard to get me to not like a movie whose main theme is dancing (especially, learning to dance). You have to really try hard to get me to not like a film with Patrick Swayze.., and/or Jennifer Grey in it. I liked Swayze in Donnie Darko, Roadhouse and Ghost. I liked Grey in F.B's Day Off and Wind.This film was not just mediocre in its dialogue, production and yes, it's dancing: It was actually obnoxious: (the ever-present, glowering, rich Jew who was the owner of the Jewish summer camp for Jewish families. Everything was askew in this film: Grey's embarrassingly-conventional garb, in contrast to the people she associated with, was hard to watch.Swayze's and Greys dancing was stiff, rehearsed and inexpressive. It was as though they knew the moves, but did not know how to express their lives through the dance. (A little smiling would have helped).The abortion reference and inclusion in the plot did not sit well with me. I did not find this entertaining, and when the young man said, ""I could hear her screaming in the hall."", I pressed eject. What I find particularly appalling about this abortion content is one line, issued by the Jewish ""father"" of the child (the mother was gentile), in reference to the woman he impregnated: ""some people matter.., and some don't.""I could not help but think he may have meant gentiles (non-jews) in general. We see in Dirty Dancing how the other main gentile in the movie is cast as the ""bad boy"".What Dirty Dancing needed was a more dynamic character played by Jennifer Grey. She would have certainly been capable of it. If you are going to create tension: (a 30-something lady-killer with a younger woman), then bring it to a crescendo and ""burn down the house"". Complete the transformation of demure ""Baby"" (sic) to the defiant and autonomous Frances.Swayze needed to have a life outside of dancing, perhaps taking on the restrictive (and possibly elitist) management of the resort. We needed to see a ""barn-burner"" in Dirty Dancing with hotter, more expressive dancing and a much-greater development of the main characters' identities. Grey's character needed to complete and fulfill her transformation. Swayze needed to interact more forcefully and cleverly with his antagonists.Swayze's original partner, played by Cynthia Rhodes, may have been much-better played by fire-brand Demi Moore, his later beloved in Ghost. A professional salsa/meringue/ dancer may have been even better, because the acting was not especially difficult. Moore would have rectified this role.I object strongly to abortion being tossed into a picture to liven-up what is a still-dreary-and-now-morose film. It is cheap.., and it is disrespectful. I would have given a ""5"" to Dirty Dancing, appreciating some of the difficulties the couple went through and because of the fairly-good acting by Swayze and Grey, but the tactless inclusion of abortion (as excitement) caused me to detract one star. Choose life. Stand and fight.The full-fledged transformation we need from Dirty Dancing never happens, and we are left wondering who these people really are.

Nobody puts baby in a corner,"I didn't understand what that line meant... I do now. I didn't really want to see Dirty Dancing either. I'd rented it out but never watched it - and today I did. And I thought it was a really fun, great movie that makes you want to get up and dance. Alright, it was cheesy at times... but it's still a great movie. I can't believe Jennifer Grey was 27 in this movie - my friend and I thought she looked about 18 or 19 - 20 at the most. I guess this is attributed to her acting talent. And she did really look awkward at times. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can tell he is in his thirties and seems a bit old. Nevertheless, still very good.

"Not flawless, but when judged in the light of what is done today, ""Dirty Dancing"" is a definite classic ...","To some extents, and regarding its respectable classic status, ""Dirty Dancing"" plays like the third opus of an unofficial ""Summer 62-63"" trilogy, a trilogy rhyming with eulogy to the magical American parenthesis preceding a tumultuous decade that started with Kennedy's assassination, followed by the Vietnam War, the flower power and concluding with the disillusioning departure of Richard Nixon.The first two films were ""American Graffiti"" and ""Animal House"", and it's interesting how each one embraced the feel of its time. George Lucas' sleeper hit was a nostalgic ode to the 60's and its two youth-defining elements: rock'n'roll and cars. ""Animal House"" was zany and anarchic, fitting the rebellious spirit from which 70's artists fueled their inspiration. And ""Dirty Dancing"" (two-word titled too) tries to reconcile between both approaches through an improbable love story between a timid teenager with a bourgeois background and a free- spirited punk who works in the same summer resort she spends her vacation with her rich family. The guy is an expert dancer, especially dances that consists on explicitly erotic moves but no matter how 'dirty' they feel, the film handles its material with less subversion you might expect, ending up being the most (unintentionally?) innocent of the three.But is that a criticism? In fact, ""Dirty Dancing"" is tailor-made for the 80's and the so-called dirty dancing needed to be sugar-coated for ratings reason, as it didn't try to be a musical version of ""9½ Weeks"". So logically, such a nostalgic immersion into a two-decade old era at a time where high-budgeted action-driven blockbusters were the norm could only increase the chances to catch the viewers' eyes (and ears). And for all the pretension it ever had, the film's magic worked, since it ended up being one of the highest-grossing of the year, much more, it reached an iconic status forever immortalized by the timid Frances 'Baby' Levy finally jumping in Johnny Castle's arms. She's your typical not-so ugly duckling, he's the perfect mix of James Dean and John Travolta and it's the typical underdog / impossible romance / coming- to-age story, but when enjoying the immortal ""I've Had the Time of My Life"" finale, these considerations hardly matter.Still, I'm not denying there's no room for criticism: reading Roger Ebert's analysis, there's not one statement that doesn't ring true, and it's quite a delight to read how ""Dirty Dancing"" inspired a sort of delightfully sarcastic anger toward an overly formulaic plot. Do I need to list these overused devices? Yes, we know, the shy little girl will grow up and become a great dancer. We know that her father won't approve the romance. We know that some unfortunate misunderstanding will make him believe that Johnny is a bad guy, even if one bit of explanation would have cleared everything. And we know that they will finally dance together, the signal induced by the famous, or infamous line ""Nobody puts Baby in a corner"", uttered by Patrick Swayze, who by the way, hated that line. Indeed, some pieces of dialog were lacking and some others were too many. But no matter how irritating or predictable every single plot line was, in the context of the film, it didn't betray lousiness in the script but more of a naive straightforward way to get to its point.For instance, having struggled to learn the basic steps of rock and salsa before giving up, I couldn't believe Baby would learn that fast. But I assumed that the purpose of the dirty dancing is to let yourself (as a girl) be guided by your partner's luscious moves and maybe she just 'had it' inside her and had to have that little catalysis from falling in love with her partner. Sure the dirty dancers are obviously professionals, and the racial diversity in the dancing hall is not the most realistic touch of the film. Sure, the whole 'abortion' misunderstanding needed a more serious focus, that and the fact that Baby came from a Jewish background to insist on the family pressure element, à la ""West Side Story"". Sure, the dances were not quite exactly dirty (Ebert admitted himself he was misled) but I guess it referred less to the moves than their earlier perceptions from Levy's perspective.But can we blame the film for having a good and catchy title? I guess it handled with confidence a basic material, the flaws are those of average movies, but for some exceptional reasons, they didn't ruin the enjoyment of ""Dirty Dancing"" because the focus was on the two lead performances, which were good. The role of Johnny was perfect for Patrick Swayze, and Jennifer Grey is absolutely convincing and endearing as the indeed baby-faced Baby. Sometimes, that's all you need to make a good film if it has enough confidence and sincerity about its material. Sure, this isn't ""Grease"", or ""Saturday Night Fever"" but the chemistry works between Grey and Swayze, and we like them. Why being so intellectual?Paraphrasing the Oscar-winning song, ""I've had the time of life"" to watch movies and if I didn't see the ending coming, I wouldn't call myself a movie lover. But I guess that's what the expression ""guilty pleasure"" was made for. But I respect the achievement of a film that stood the test of time and became such a phenomenon, still considered one of the defining films of the 80's. I also respect it because it's the film that made Patrick Swayze a movie star. And it also gave a one-hit success for Jennifer Grey, the actress who infamously made that rhino-plastic surgery to sink irremediably in anonymity, while it's precisely her 'girl next door' features that touched the public's heart when they came to see ""Dirty Dancing"". Sometimes, an actor should learn lessons from his own characters.And if only for having inspired one of Rogert Ebert's most irresistible reviews, I'm glad the film was done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Good date movie,"I watched this movie after hearing about how good it was from a few friends, and I figured since it was such a famous movie I should see it. So I did. Now maybe it was because it was so hyped up for me, or maybe it was because I have no nostalgic connection to it, but I thought it was really overrated. The choreography was good, and it had some funny moments. But for a lot of it I couldn't get past the fact that she was supposed to be 17 and he was supposed to be 24, which is pretty gross to me. Also, I didn't see them together, they didn't seem like they were great for each other. I just think that the movie was really overrated, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that great. It was a pretty generic and predictable story. The only thing it had going for it was the dancing, and that was pretty good.

I *Still* Don't Get It...,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was still a pre-teen, because one of the girls I knew from school (an older teenager) was obsessed with it. I didn't get it back then.I saw this movie again in my late teens, and didn't get it then, either. Watched it again the other day, and I STILL don't get it!I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's unremarkable, boring, predictable, monotonous, and thoroughly mediocre. As if that wasn't enough, it also manages to be offensive to boot.The plot was disgustingly predictable and uninspiring; the dialogue - horrendous.There was ZERO chemistry between the lead actors. In fact, it was quite apparent that they can't stand each other.Speaking of characters, - they were all HIGHLY unlikeable.Johnny = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional a***hole.Baby = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional slag.And it's actually quite disgusting that Patrick Swayze, who seems to be in his mid-30s, is sleeping with a girl 15-20 years his junior. Granted, she was a slapper, but was this movie made to glamorize child molesters or underage hookers? Don't get me wrong, I did like ""Lolita"" (where the same was happening, but it's expected, and actually quite tastefully done), but this... was just creepy and disturbing.It's just my opinion, but I think one must be slightly retarded to refer to this utter disgrace as a ""masterpiece"".",2.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
One of the biggest films of the 80's!,"One rainy day, in the year 2000, 13 years after it's release, I sat and watched Dirty Dancing. I am upset that I didn't see it when it was in the cinema and in its popular run with the world. Baby's opening lines are a good place to start my review - ""It was the summer of 1963, when everybody called me Baby, and it didn't occur to me to mind. That was before President Kennedy was shot, before the Beatles came, when I couldn't wait to join the Peace Corps, and I thought I'd never find a guy as great as my dad. That was the summer we went to Kellerman's.""At a summer camp Baby meets Johnny Castle, who teaches interested vacationers how to dance, and in his off hours dirty dances with other dancers. When Johnny loses his regular dancing partner, Baby volunteers to learn his routine to help him out of a tight spot. As the summer winds down, the dancing pair must come to grips with responsibility, love and each others growing expectations.Undoubtedly, the greatest part of this film are the scenes where we get to see some great dancing. The very first scenes with it in my view where in some way erotic, yet had an infectious feel on me. The dancing is very intense and heavy. It is no wonder they call it 'dirty dancing'. It must have been hard to find the right dancers to perform in this movie, but I feel they did get it right. The main part of the cast must have been able to dance a little too, cause if they couldn't have it would have made the film very erratic, and nowhere near as good as it was. Plus the ending of the film is great, with the two main characters getting up and showing the audience what they do best.The cast of Dirty Dancing was pretty good. Patrick Swayze, who played Johnny proved to me how talented he really was. His on-air relations with Jennifer Grey, and his dancing parts of this film were great. His lead in this is also deserves much praise. Swayze has had an eventful career, starring in Ghost, one of the big films of the 90's, and Black Dog alongside music legend Meatloaf. However, Jennifer Grey is an actress who I had never heard of until this movie, yet I loved her role in this immensely. Her characters struggles in this film were well acted by her, yet by the end she really shows that she can dance too. I have recently seen one of her other films which i think the whole world liked, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and I must admit that wasn't a bad film. However, Grey did not cash in on her success as Baby in Dirty Dancing, because I believe the movie loving public did not get to see enough of her afterwards, which was very disappointing.The one thing I do remember vividly at the time this film was doing well was the main song on the soundtrack, 'I've had the time of my life'. When I heard this in the film itself last year, I really got into it. The musical version of it is great. Yet the soundtrack is full of other great hits like Hungry eyes,  She's Like the Wind (performed by Patrick Swayze) and Overload just to name a few. Everyone I talk to about this movie says ""Hey have you got the soundtrack to that?"" It is amazing what effect a movie's soundtrack can have on people and Dirty Dancing's is great soundtrack to have.Finally, the movie's story is what I would call a bit 'mushy', but don't let that distract you from what a great film this is. The brilliant dancing and soundtrack is what I will remember most from this movie. I also like this movie for the fact that it shows some great dancing, which makes me a little jealous, considering that dancing is not one of my strong points. Lastly, let me leave you with this thought. I heard last year that an new version of Dirty Dancing was to be made, with people such as Ricky Martin and Sarah Michelle Gellar in the lead roles. I believe that a newer version of this sort of film won't be the same, cause Dirty Dancing, the original, has a certain historical look, that no new film could ever capture the same.Rating: 4 Stars or 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Still one of my all-time favorite movies,"I remember watching ""Dirty Dancing"" for the first time when I was only 7 years old.

Mostly, I watched it for the music (""(I've Had) The Time of My Life"", ""Hungry Eyes"", and ""She's Like the Wind"" are my favorites). Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey are wonderful on screen together. The supporting cast is good too, especially Jerry Orbach as Grey's father and Cynthia Rhodes as Swayze's dance partner Penny.The reason I believe so many people enjoy ""Dirty Dancing"" so much is for its music and dancing, but also its story. A story that is about real people dealing with real life issues is what people can relate to. I hope this film gets made into a Broadway musical.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
You'll never love someone like you did when you were 17 years old,"It's the summer of 1963 and young Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) is attending a resort with her parents and her older sister. There she ends up hanging out with the staff of the resort and meeting an older dance instructor named Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Trials and tribulations ensue.A movie that most people have at least heard about. One of the most well-known movies of the 80s and still something of a classic with certain gender and age demographics. Personally, being an adult male, I don't belong in any of them, but I have to admit the movie was not half bad.And a lot of that is due to how earnest the film is. Sure, the plot is not overly complicated, the characters are kind of clichéd and the ending is insultingly predictable, but it has a lot of passion behind it. Both Grey and Swayze are giving it their all and that shows. They also have a surprising amount of chemistry, which is pretty much the selling point of these types of movies. I also like how progressive it is, especially for its time.You also can't forget the soundtrack, including a lot of songs that are still played today.Then again, the plot is so basic that it almost edges into a parody. The movie is also a bit tamer than I expected, given how people rave about it. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it's a thing to keep in mind. It's also a movie about equality and not dividing people into classes. But it's also one of the whitest movies I've seen in a while. Again, it's progressive for its time, but it's also over thirty years old.Still, I can see why people like it.

The story isn't that great, the acting is not the best, the music is good but I cannot put my finger on why it's my all time favorite movie. The one I've watched more times than I'd like to admit. Some people don't get it but I do. It's just a great movie and I will continue watching it periodically. Sorry, that's my story and I'm sticking to it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Dirty Dancing-A++++++++++++++,"I am soon to be 58 yrs.old. I can't recall when I first saw this movie, but I do know that until I purchased it on Video, I watched every time it came on TV. Which, TV does not do the film justice, because it has to edit too many scenes to make time for commercials. Getting the DVD Ultimate Edition was the best thing I did. I recommend everyone who loves this movie, like me, to get it. There is so much more insight into the movie, the characters, the making of the movie etc. I can't count the number of times I have watched the movie with the commentaries of the writer/producer Eleanor Bergstein all the way through; and then Kenny Ortega and the other assistant choreographer Miranda Garrison, and others who are listed in the commentary section. I love watching the music video section of ""She's Like the Wind"", 'I've Had the Time of My Life"" and ""Hungry Eyes"". It is a great way to enter a stress free time. I love this movie and I don't believe it would have been such a success with anyone else than Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey. Music is terrific, story line is exceptional, all actors are wonderful and believable. For such a limited budget, it outshines many high cost popular movies of today. It is a classic and I'll never get tired of watching it. I pop in ""Dirty Dancing"" whenever I just want to shut the world out and go back to the 'Summer of '63'. It is a better substitute for antidepressants.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Back then, who would have begun to imagine the magnitude!","Back when this came out, who would have believed there would be such a following, as it has now!?OK, back when this first came out, I was a kid in school(Elementary school, to be exact.), and my mom was a huge Swayze(RIP) fanatic already, but, I do have to admit, even though, I am an adult man(Now), I did envy his looks, and his abilities, and most of which, he brought to this movie. Also, cannot forget Jennifer Greys work, I admit it, when I first saw the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off, I had a crush on her, she was beautiful then(She is not ugly now, just different to me.), and the 2 of them made a spark, between them, that turned into a nuclear explosion, by the end of the movie, which is why they became a great actor/actress, because they put their heart and soul into their characters, not their characters into them! I would be appalled, if they were to try and remake this movie, there will NEVER be the same intense magic in it, as there was in this one! If someone were to ever try to repeat the magic through this movie, again, what they would come up with, would be an inkling compared to the magic of this version!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

It's a must have.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
This is truly my favorite movie of all time.,"Dirty Dancing is truly a one of a kind, in my opinion a classic. What makes this movie so special is that it's so true to life.

There is something very magical about a man that can dance, and Patrick Swayze is what made Dirty Dancing so fabulous. Even twelve years later when I watch the video,I am still captivated by it.

One of the Greatest Movies of all time,Dirty Dancing is a movie that will live on forever I still remember the first time I saw it when I was Six Years old when my sisters were watching it.  I thought Patrick Swayze was cute then and I think he is cute today. He's not what makes the movie though it's a story of two people who love each other and they are told to keep a part.

Play it again Sam,"I adored this movie.  Let's face it, Patrick Swayze is a hottie.  Jennifer Grey blossomed awesomely.  And the crickets on the summer evenings sounded real.  The only burst to my bubble of enjoyment was the scene in which Johnny and Baby balance on the log over the river.  Swayze's hair looked too perfect, and they both looked too fresh to have just finished a wild ride in the rain. Most likely they just stepped out of make up trailers.  BUT I digress -- Swayze's passionate monster moves and Grey's gutsy gracefulness made me swoon.  All the actors were well cast.  I'm glad they'll will be with me on celluloid for years to come.

Dorm room trauma,"One of the most horrible memories I have of college is that in our dorm they seemed to run this movie 24/7.  I would go down to the TV lounge to watch something and it would be filled with my peers pajama clad and munching on popcorn and clutching their box of kleenex.  It was a constant rotation of Pretty Woman, Dirty Dancing and Can't Buy Me Love. I have night terrors because of it. I hated the movie. I hate Patrick Swayze. I think it goes back to his promotion of the movie as having more substance than Footloose or Flashdance....like saying that cotton candy has more substance than marshmellows. I have to give this movie a 1 to counteract the average of a 5 on this film. I would normally had given it a 3, but the majority of you folks left me no choice.

The only reason I have seen this movie is because when I was young, there was only one T.V., so not much choice with an older sister and mother who love this movie.

A bane in nearly all aspects. Consider the luxurious private rooms of the staff. No resort staff ever knew such luxury.,"It would not have cost Eleanor Bergstein more money to make this film in the Catskills, rather than in the South. Had she, and the director actually BEEN in the Catskills, (and given the movie, I can't believe she ever went there as a child, or was too young to notice anything much), She also must never have bothered to see what crummy housing. I'm not sure whether the iconic movie, 'Sweet Lorraine', which is, in fact, set in the Catskills and has a truly romantic as well as accurate historical portrayal, was released before 'Dirty Dancing', or after it. I would hope that it was after that release, because there is no way that Bergstein could have passed this movie off as having anything whatsoever to do with true Catskill resort experience had that been the case.Why would 'Johnny' choose 'Baby' as a substitute partner when his fellow employees danced so expertly and sensuously. Viewers are given no reason. There was not even an attraction between them. All the acting is stiff and awkward, even that of the entertainment director of the resort who, obviously, had never made it to a Catskill resort either.The film is plodding. The 'star' of the film would have to be Cynthia Rhodes, as 'Penny'. Viewed in 1986, or in 2021, that's all she wrote, folks.",1.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
one of my favorite movies,"I too thought this would be a fluff movie with no substance, but was proved wrong. Many people call it a 'girl' movie, but I think there's several messages hidden in it, not to mention some wonderful dance scenes. The best part of it is that it doesn't come across as a 'message movie', so it can be enjoyed by both people who prefer 'message' movies, and by people who just want entertainment. I think Patrick Swayze plays a wonderful sort of Romeo/bad boy, and Jennifer Grey is great as an upper middle class girl who stands up for what she believes in. Another message brought home by the late Jerry Orbach is not to judge a book by it's cover, to use a tired old cliché. In the end, he has to be proud of his daughter (Grey) for sticking with Johnny (Swayze) when everyone brands him as a thief and an irresponsible womanizer. Both Swayze and Grey do a fantastic job with the dancing, which was rather a surprise to me. It's one of those movies to watch on a rainy afternoon, all by yourself with a box of Kleenex. I seem to find it every time it's on TV, and never tire of watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Not for me, but I can understand that people like it","I'm not really sure what to say about this movie. I can understand that it is a well liked classic, as I'm sure almost every part of it - from the music and dancing to the relationships in it - hits it target audience right where it should. The fact that I'm not a part of the target audience doesn't mean it's a bad movie.With movies like this, that doesn't really try (or need) to flesh out its character, it's always interesting to see how the characters hold up with time. How some of the characters are portrayed would maybe be considered mean if the movie was made today. Or maybe it's in those cases a realistic depiction of the time and setting it was set in? I don't know.The (acting) performances are not too impressive, and especially Swayze didn't always convince when showing emotions. The dancing is well done though, both when it is genuinely meant to be good, but also when the actors are supposed to be bad. I also really liked the setting itself, the naivë dance camp for rich families.So what can I say? I am not trying to be objective in my rating of this movie, but I feel I have to point out that much of what didn't impress me (the plot, the characters, the relationships) were done intentionally, and hits home with many.",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Silly, dumb, romantic fluff that I didn't find particularly compelling","Filled to the brim with silly romantic fluff that really isn't all that compelling. To be fair, it could have been much worse. Nothing is really done really poorly, except developing the relationship between Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray. Personally, I found their relationship quite shallow and not very interesting. I can see how it could be enjoyable in a cheesy kind of way. Acting, directing, editing, etc. is all very ""whatever"". None of it makes the film unwatchable, but none of it is particularly noteworthy either. The one thing I did enjoy was the soundtrack. I actually enjoyed it more than the movie itself. It's by no means good enough to warrant watching the movie, but it was admittedly nice to listen too.

The film that changed everything,"Well i have to tell you for starters, this is my favourite film of all time.  Yeah i know what you're thinking, how could some critically overlooked movie be regarded as something to regard in that way.Well all i know is , i have very fond memories of watching it,  i've watched it over 10 times and it still gets better. What makes it a great film for me is the felling and emotion that's there. These educated film critics don't see that.Sometimes i feel that i'm Johnny Castle and that the whole thing is based on my life. The girl that he loves in the film is also extraordinary in that she's so like the girl that i've always liked too for a long time.I know exactly how Johnny feels, feeling disaffected from mainstream society, i feel like that sometimes.Johnny was in his 30's when he met his dream girl , i'm 24 now so i hope my chance to be with someone like that won't be too far around the corner. Anyway back to the film, i also liked how innocent baby was and how she developed throughout the film from an innocent girl to a mature woman,  the soundtrack was just superb and the dancing first rate. I don't care what the critics say ,this film will one day be regarded as one of the all time great movies and i can say that i knew it was from the beginning.I would like to see a remake of the film with different actors to see how they fare.I haven't seen another film that has affected me so much since Dirty Dancing was first released. that's all i want to say.Believe me it's that good.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

A Small Gem,"Those who look down on this movie and deride its fans might pay closer attention to the the very small details which make this film work.

Every moment accomplishes what it's supposed to, the film's intelligence plays out in small gestures, movements, no film better illustrates the truism that film is a visual medium.  Or one can forget all that and enjoy the chemistry between the two stars.  Those who call this film a guilty pleasure, though, shouldn't be that guilty.  A silly story is pushed to a high level by excellent craftsmanship.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

It Rocks,"This movie is one of my favorite movies made. This movie might not have much in it for substantial love but it does have the romance that most like to see in movies.

WOW!! I did not know they made movies THIS good in the 80s,"I probably saw this movie when I was about 8, and I missed all of the sexual comments, and suggestions.  Watching it again, at a later age, I realize how well done this movie was made.  The stars are incredible together, and Patrick Swayze looks GOOD dancing.  You feel drawn into the movie, and you can't move your eyes from beginning til end. It's like watching a romantic movie, except with a beat to it. I'd recommend this movie to all the ppl who want to see a romantic movie w/o all the soppy pathetic stuff, but a bit of fun and dancing to it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"I adore this film,Patrick and Jennifer amazing","As a Patrick Swayze fan this is definitely one of my favourite movies of his,he was a phenomenal dancer and actor, I thought Patrick and Jennifer had amazing chemistry,when they danced they lit up the screen,it's a feel good film,brilliantly written and acted,it will always be a classic.it's a film you can watch over and over again and never get bored,Patrick was so good as Johnny and Jennifer did a brilliant job as baby.

Sensual and fun,"The vacation resort as adolescent life. The girl, the fairytale princess, has gone with her family. She finds a senile, airbrushed safety (games by the pool, dinner parties) that makes everything available, except for the real stuff that make the heart beat faster. It takes place in the early 60s with Vietnam a faint worry, but just as well speaks to its own time of all the pleasing comfort and diversion that money can buy.She enters his dancing space instead, tiptoeing one evening out of the family bungalow and across a path to the big house. She finds rhythm, bodies grinding, cessation of etiquette and empty chitchat and in their place passion and soul; sex of course, dance as discovery. He enters her dancing space and finds in her the same zest and soul, a desire to help others and get tangled up in their problems rather than coast through like the other vacationers.She a pure girl, shy but eager. He a movie hunk, tortured but good. Superficial strokes for the rest of the characters; smug Ivy League waiter, vacant sister. The sex is that soft movie sex where silhouettes are caressed against an orange bedroom glow. The fallacy of realism may keep some from enjoying it, but that would be a pity.What movie is real? It's all about the point-of-view, the point from which we view. Here it's the girl's on her journey to womanhood, the story of meeting someone like him, a movie hunk with a dancer's body who needs her nurturing, something she would dream about.Would the sex be more 'real' if we were shown a cold slapping of thighs? The recent Life of Adele comes to mind. It would be if sex was merely bodies writhing together. Of course it's a commercial decision to not show for example nudity, and to offer us simple dilemmas in the story. But it does also embrace what this girl covets; touch, intimacy.The princess can leave all this behind on her way to the safe life. Roman Holiday with dance.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"A nadir of originality, but entertaining","It's been several years since I last saw Dirty Dancing, and I can still remember the plot pretty well.  This is not because I read other reviews, or because it's one of my sister's favorite movies, nor is it because it's one of my girlfriend's favorite movies.  I remember the plot because it's the same basic plot the world has seen in countless other films like ""Cutting Edge"" or ""Strictly Ballroom"" or even ""The Karate Kid.""  Sure, there are some cosmetic differences, but scrape away the makeup and change a few locations and you've got the same flick, over and over and over again.Having said that, I will guiltily admit I enjoyed the film when I last saw it.  It entertained and held my interest in a way that I cared enough about the characters to want to see them succeed in the final dance competition. Of course, I was about sixteen.  You can draw your own conclusions from that last point.",3.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
One of the Best Love Stories and More,"It only took me close to 40 years to truly appreciate this gem.First, it's among the absolute best love stories out there.Second, it illustrates something I've never seen shown in any movie. How life, real life... the truth, our deepest desire, our fear, true joy, true love, true pain... takes place right next to a world of embarrassing pretence and foolishness. A world of lying. A world of confusion. A world where people do what they think they should be doing because the world tells them so.This is a story of rebels and conformists.It's a musical. Make no mistake about it. The music and dance sequences are essential.Intense and beautiful.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Classic,"I first saw this movie when I was seven. Ever since then I make it my duty to watch it at least once a month. Patrick Swayze is by far the most gorgeous actor and Jennifer Grey could not compliment him better. The most romantic line has to be when Johnny says, ""Nobody puts Baby in the corner."" Every time I see the movie I cry as Johnny leaves down the dirt road and comes back for the sake of true love. This movie gave me hope that anything is possible. Baby turns a rugged dance instructor into, ""the kind of person he wants to be."" This movie inspired me to be a better person and stand up for other people no matter what it costs. If you have not seen this movie yet, you are truly missing something wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Totally awesome...,"...need I say more?  This movie is my all-time favourite.  The actors were great (who could be a better leading man than Patrick Swayze?) and the story was perfect.  A girl that is usually just bored with life and doesn't know how to have fun goes to a resort for the summer and is introduced to a type of life she didn't even know existed!  The dancing is great, and not to mention, the music is really cool.  This movie will leave you with a good feeling and you may even wish it never ended.  I highly recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"A classic dance movie... and also, a good one","""Dirty Dancing"" has always been an exception for me when it comes to dance movies. This is because I am not a fan of dance movies, but this is not only classic, but also good.The writing is good too. The story is pretty well-structured with especially great dialogue.The direction is also very good. The direction by Emile Ardolino is very good and the acting is fantastic, especially the performance of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey. Speaking of performance, I have to mention the amazing dance choreographies, which the actors performed fantastically.In summary, a classic and pretty good dance film that is worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

The music is great, even though its from way-back-when, and the 80's its still makes you want to dance. The dances are so fun to watch, like the mambo. I wish I could do those dance. I certainly put it #1 on my list. I watch it like everyday!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

I have been watching since I was 5 and am glad i did it is truly brilliant.,I really adore Dirty Dancing i watch it at least 5 times a week and am glad that when I was small I creeped in on my Dad watching it and begged him yo let me see it all the way through.I think it has a marvellous storyline and it has made a great impression on my life. It taught me not to jump to conclusions like Jake does.So i have learnt alot from that film and you feel heartbroken at the end when Johnny leaves. The music is also brilliant I have both CD's 'Dirty Dancing' and 'More Dirty Dancing' it really is brilliant. It should be on T.V more.,10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
nobody puts Baby in the corner.,"Dirty Dancing is a brilliant film with brilliant music & brilliant cast. I couldn't name one person I know who won't agree that Patrick Swayzee absolutely stole there heart in this film as he plays the rebellious rogue dance instructor Johnnycake Castle who develops a sort of soft spot type crush on Baby. The film is so nicely done and is a real feel good movie that just wants to make you jump off the sofa and dance to all the catchy crazy songs my personal favourite songs from this film being she's like the wind & time of my life. Dirty Dancing is just fabulous to this day and will always be a memorable amazing film, I highly highly recommended that everyone off ages should watch this film it really is fun for all!

A Lovely Love Story,"I first saw ""Dirty Dancing"" in the theater during its first release. I remember the hype surrounding the film--a kind of cautionary intrigue (not unlike that surrounding the release of ""The Exorcist""). I waited with great anticipation and I remember how captivated I was by the opening credits, superimposed over the dramatic and nearly abstract images that resolved into couples dancing.Since then, I have seen the film many times. It is a wonderful love story about a young woman who stumbles upon a magical world of dance and sensuality and is drawn to it, and to a charismatic dancer from less fortunate circumstances.The theme of the film concerns appearances and preconceptions based upon class and social station.Jennifer Grey plays the part of Baby, the young woman who learns to dance and who falls in love with Johnny (Patrick Swayze). Set against the summer season of a Catskill Resort, the story is filled with music of the period (1963) and from other periods, recreating a time that was pivotal in the loss of America's ""innocence"" as well.This film deserves its huge following.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Great Summer Watch......,"The Bad= I mind as well start off with the Negatives since I don't seem to have very many of them. The first and the biggest has to be is that I found Baby Houseman's Older sister Lisa Houseman is....to put it in friendly terms since I obviously can't use those kind of words, is Not Nice and Mean towards Baby for seemingly no Reason. Aside from giving Baby an Obstacle to over come I think? Until the third act of the film. Which in my personal opinion wasn't necessary since Baby already has an Obstacle to try to get Past in the film. Then My next Complaint about the Film is that most of the Characters just feels like side characters compared to both Baby Housman and Johnny CastleThe Good= And Now that we got the Negatives out of the way let's get to the Positives, the First is. Is that I the Soundtrack Great all the way around both in the movie and as an actual Soundtrack, but that's not a big surprise considering it's a Musical. But also unlike most Musicals the songs fit in really well so Natural in fact, while most Musicals the Characters just Burst out in Song for No Reason aside from it being a Musical and that's what they do in Musicals, but with Dirty Dancing the Musical Numbers seems....as I have already said Natural. And that brings to my next point every single song of the Soundtrack is not only Iconic and Classics, but also with Certain songs rather I close my eyes or not. But I could easily Imagine a Couple having a Nice Relaxing Quit Romantic Get way to a Cabin in the Woods or something with out the kids on a Nice Saturday Night. So anyways moving on I just Love the song 'Kellerman's Anthem' as it always never fails to remind me that Summer is almost over and that we should enjoy what's left of it before the New School Year begins along with the ret of the year. Which is quit fitting as Summer is just one of Favorite Times of the Years the others are Halloween and of course Christmas, I call them my Year-Round Trinity. And Unless I'm Missing anything Else that should be it for the Positives.And for whatever the reason the last time that I listen to the song 'The Time Of My Life' I started getting Nostalgic and started Tearing up because of it. Anyways moving away from the songs, I think the Montage was Beautifully shoot. The Climax all the way to the End was really Great. Aside from the Character of Lisa I think Most of the Character was well Written. I also thought that the constant theme of Rich and Poor Clashing and only connecting through on what is considered an Illegal or Forbidden Dance just because how sexual it was back then through out the Film was a Really Great Concept. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey both have Such Great Chemistry with one another. That it comes off as so Natural would think that they have been working with each other for years by that point. I don't know if I'm going too far and over Exaggerating a little but that is what I'm going with. And I just Gotta say this, it's A Wonderful Love Story of a Movie. Also I feel the Emotions are just Spot on, I also just couldn't get over on how much of Feel Good Movie this is. And Unless I'm missing anything Else that should be it for the Negatives.Final Thoughts= I could see why this Film is a Classic and that I'm Glade that I not watch it countless of times, but also Own it on Blu-Ray and DVD Combo so that I can Continue on watching it each year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Legendary,"Dirty Dancing is a movie that effortlessly transports you to the vibrant spirit of the '80s every time you watch it. It's a classic that I'll never tire of revisiting... pure joy and one of my all-time favorites. The film is refreshingly simple yet endlessly captivating, filled with iconic moments that keep pulling me back in. Watching it feels like a nostalgic embrace, and it's a film that never loses its magic, no matter how many times I see it.Dancing is at the heart of this story, symbolizing so much more than movement, it's an act of defiance, of embracing individuality, and of living freely. The dance scenes convey the characters' drive to break free from societal norms, to be bold, and to express love in the most powerful way possible. I absolutely adore this theme; it gives the film a depth beyond romance, making it a celebration of self-expression and freedom.The chemistry between Baby and Johnny might not be the most intense of all the romance movies i've watched, but it's genuine and captivating in its own way. Their relationship captures the excitement of stepping outside one's comfort zone and finding joy in unexpected places. And the final scene? It's legendary. That final montage, with its iconic song, colors, and energy, is hands down one of the most unforgettable and exhilarating endings I've ever seen. Every element, the music, the choreography, the atmosphere it all comes together perfectly, creating a high that's hard to top.Dirty Dancing is a feel-good classic that I know I'll return to again and again. Its charm, its rebellious spirit, and its timeless vibe make it a true masterpiece of its genre. This isn't the last time I'll feel compelled to watch it, and every viewing leaves me bamboozled by how much I love it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Heartbeats of great emotions!,"This film is exceptional, in addition to having a wonderful soundtrack, it has a very intelligent and provocative story that strongly transmits many important messages. I don't like romance movies at all, due to the magic of the story combined with dance, music and drama. This story is much, much more than a simple romance!I guess that the bad reviews are because you don't like good music, dancing and 80's movies with valuable messages.All the actors are wonderful, as is the holiday atmosphere that makes you feel happy all the time. There is also humor and very interesting dialogues.Yes, it's maybe predictable in the end, so what? It continues to touch my soul very strongly today, without a doubt.

The best movie I have ever seen,"I have seen this movie over 5000 times and that is no lie. The first time that I seen it I was swept away with the dancing but most over all with the developing love of Johnny and Baby. The movie was amazing and now almost 20 years later I still make sure to have a Dirty Dancing Night once a week. The music fit the tone of the arrangement. I loved the Scene where Johnny says, I'll never be sorry. That is one of the most powerful scenes in the movie. The ending dance was probably one of my favorite parts. My only wish is that a movie was brought out to tell you what happened to Johnny and Baby. If anyone that wrote Dirty Dancing reads this. Please come out with something new.. Not like Havannah Nights.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Awesome movie!,"I must say I didn't watch Dirty Dancing until a few years ago. Everyone always raved on about it, but for some reason I just never watched it. When I finally did, i couldn't believe I had waited so long, and have since seen it about a dozen times!I had loved Patrick Swayze since I first saw Ghost, so knew he would be fantastic, but I had never seen Jennifer Grey in anything, and I admit when I first saw her I couldn't believe this plain Jane was going to steal Johnny's heart. But as the movie went on she grew on me, and by the end I was imagining the cute little babies they would make together.I read somewhere that the two leads hated each other all the way through filming, but I never would have guessed, their chemistry was great. Good girl falls for bad boy, always a story I can't tear myself away from. And the music, oh the music was what made the movie! I instantly went out and bought the soundtrack and had it on repeat in my car for about 2 years.Loved it! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A gem,"When I first saw Dirty Dancing years ago, I was stunned by how much of it I recognized from my past and how true it rang for me. Nobody except John Sayles (and later the authors of Good Will Hunting) had ever brought a time and a place so familiar to me so alive on the screen before. It was all there - the Ivy league protocol and manners (I went to Cornell, like Neil), the resort's silly entertainment, the lodge and cabins, the Houseman's table manners - everything was just as I remembered, INCLUDING the presence of other people that we werent really ""suppose"" to associate with as much. At least not invite them to dinner anyway, unless they were perhaps courageous bums like Jack Dawson in Titanic, or maybe....just maybe......handsome and talented dancers?Anyway, but thats just the set up. Author Eleanor Bergstein knew the era well and depicted it with stunning accuracy and brutal honesty. But the real story is about dancing and the sexual awakening of an innocent young girl, Baby Houseman. In that role, Jennifer Grey was perfect, and the transformation she undergoes throughout the film never strains credibility nor seems contrived or forced. Not an easy feat considering how much she was intent on growing up that summer.Other cast members contributed mightily to this classic. Baby's parents projected just the right mix of parental authority and love for their daughter, an essential ingredient throughout. Meanwhile, well educated Neil and Robbie were superb as the cocky nerd and womanizing cad, especially when contrasted with Johnny. And I especially loved Baby's relationship with Penny and how Penny ultimately came to respect her after treating her like trash in the beginning. Last but not least, Patrick Swayze was magnanimous - combining raw power and sexuality with vulnerability and a soft heart, I couldn't imagine the movie without him.Finally, the music and dance was absolutely essential to the success of this film. The dance needed to be sexualized as it was important to the plot, but it never crossed the line into bad taste or vulgarity. The musical choices were all superb, and the closing dance scene is one of Hollywoods most memorable. All in all, I never stop enjoying this movie, and expect to see it again and again periodically for the nostalia and memories it never fails to conjure up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
a classic,"I am surprised this has a relatively low vote... i absolutely love this movie, it is a classic and the music is fabulous. This movie is so sexy, but there are no actual sex scenes which is something i really like... the power of suggestion is so much sexier then documentary-style visuals!!Patrick Swayze is so sexy and sincere in this movie, this and Ghost are his absolute best and are both classics for me.Jennifer Grey is perfectly cast and I think she is beautiful. Such a pity she destroyed her lovely nose with surgery... it just goes to show that smaller is not necessarily better.If you're looking for a real teenage love story that captures the passion, confusion, love and lust of that age, this is the movie. It is also about class distinction in modern America - and pseudo-liberalized values.Add to that amazing and ridiculously sexy dancing and a fantastic soundtrack.Nobody puts Baby in a corner...

My favorite Movie,"This movie is not just a movie, but a lesson that can be taught to society. Many people say this movie is about the phenomenal dancing provided by Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze, but it isn't.

If you are looking for a movie with a lesson, fabulous soundtrack (""I've had the time of my life"", ""hungry eyes"", ""You don't own me"", and more), and an allstar cast, then this is the perfect movie.

Whatever it was (and is), Dirty Dancing captured my heart and I'm not alone.  Millions of people all over the world loved it. The same millions who watched it again and again, the same millions who bought the soundtrack and video, the same people who decided to pass up a trip to Europe out of curiosity to visit a summer vacation resort...

finding the song in our soul,"As an 7 or 8 year old, when this movie came out on video, I watched it every day with my next door neighbor (and best friend), literally.  I will always remember that, through all the bad times, getting together to watch Dirty Dancing.  Now that I'm a older, technically an ""adult"", I rented it to watch again, having forgotten the movie for the most part (except the dancing, me and my friend knew all the moves), even though I've seen it I don't know how many times.

About a guy who's had some lucky breaks but is afraid to leave the line drawn for him because he feels that it could be all lost in one single step.  About family relationships.  About coming of age.  About BEING WHO YOU REALLY ARE. Sometimes we disappoint people because we don't measure up to their expectations. This movie shows that its more important we follow our ""soul's song"".  It's about ""young love"", the kind of love you can throw away your life for.  And it's about making a stand. And it is DEFINITELY about terrific dancing.  Egads, I wish I could move like that.  This is definitely among my top ten favorite movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Still great movie,"I have rewatched the movie after a long time and it is still really great! Baby plays her role perfectly! This time I focused even more on the differences between the worlds. The poor and the rich are in the same place, but leading different lives, having different struggles, plans, and futures. I have never noticed how much important this aspect is. The fact that Baby stood up for Johnny is what made them fall in love and started their relationship. I perceived the movie from a different perspective as something similar just happened to me, and we actually watched the movie together!We really loved how Baby always looked confused about what is going on, yet she was confident. We liked to think about the changes. How people spend holidays these days, how the rich (or upper middle class) are much closer to the poor (lower middle class). The world has changed a lot, yet the Dirty Dancing movie remains to be a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

A summer to remember...,"When I first saw Dirty Dancing at the theater during the summmer of '87 I thought I was going to be asleep before the previews were even over. To my utter amazment though, I was caught up in the magic of the whole movie. From Baby's first look at ""dirty dancing"" to the incredible ending, this movie captures what everyone wishes their childhood could have been like.The locations they used for the Kellerman's resort were beautiful, and the soundtrack makes everyone want to get up and dance in the aisles.

He lookes younger.. Well all the actors makes a great impact on me. Even if the movie is 13 years old. It's a movie we all can relate to. Almost everyone though.

"Call me undemanding, but I liked this movie.","Sure, the plot is thin and you do know what is going to happen several minutes out but one thing remains constant throughout the movie, great music and some fun dance scenes. Sometimes you simply have to watch a movie and ENJOY it without having suspenseful and dramatic twists. This is a very straight forward girl meets boy and ""rescues"" him from his jaded existence. The music is good, the chemistry is very good and if you just want to watch a movie that is fun to watch, select this one. It is unfortunate that Jennifer Grey went on to have plastic surgery on her face (and nose), she is virtually unrecognizable now. She has turned into a Hollywood clone. We have probably seen her in other films but is so different that we do not recognize her.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

This Movie Is All About the Power of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey!,"Despite its massive popularity, I never thought that one day I would be watching Dirty Dancing. I try to stay away from these dance films because let's face it, it is not a fun genre. I knew the music behind the movie. Who doesn't know the songs ""(I've Had) The Time of Your Life"" and ""Hungry Eyes."" They are radio staples from the 1980's that still receive airplay nowadays...and are very good songs. I finally relented because of my goal to watch every movie on the Empire's Top 500 list, and you know what? I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, Eleanor Bergstein's screenplay is hit-or-miss as it far too predictable for my liking. At the end of the day, you cannot deny the power of Patrick Swayze's and Jennifer Grey's chemistry and powerful dance moves. Credit to where it belongs, but there is a surprising subplot involving abortion (and more towards the pro side) that you will hardly see in a film from this decade. If I am not mistaken, marketers backed out distributing the picture because Vestron Pictures refused to edit the movie. I always believed in something called ""power of the music,"" as this concept can be applicable to many music-based films. Even if the film is garbage and there is a powerful musical act to conclude the movie, all sins are forgiven because of that act's power. I know some people felt that away about this movie and although I was relatively enjoying the cheesy plot before the final act, I was truly swayed by the dance between Swayze and Grey and their off-the-charts chemistry.One of the producers had a quote that stuck with me. ""Burn the negative and collect the insurance."" No one who saw cuts of the movie liked what they saw. They were ready for a massive dud. Luckily, the film received not-all-that-bad reviews and a story that can be passed down generations. Bergstein draws on her own childhood experiences to create the screenplay. She is the youngest daughter of a Jewish doctor whose family took vacations to the Catskills where she personally got involved in these dirty dancing contests. Emile Ardolino, despite never having directed a film, was hired to direct the movie because of his immense passion. His direction is okay and fairly decent for a first-time director. But it is all about the performances and choreography. Kenny Ortega was placed in charge of the dance choreography. When he is involved in anything, you can be rest assured that you'll see something special musically. If you're trained by Gene Kelly, you definitely better! Need I say more about how Ortega affected the cast's dancing?It is 1963, and Baby Houseman (Jennifer Grey) is a sweet daddy's girl whose parents have sky high expectations of her. They expect her to follow in her father, Jake's (Jerry Orbach) footsteps by joining the Peace Corps and becoming a doctor herself. As what happens in life, unexpected moments arise when the family goes to this resort in the Catskills for vacation. She becomes infatuated with the resort's dancing instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Baby is able to get her father to unknowingly pay for an illegal abortion when Johnny's dancing partner, Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) falls pregnant. Baby is now filling in as Johnny's dance partner. Penny falls ill after the abortion, and that is when Jake finds out what his ""perfect"" daughter is up to. He does not allow her to hang out with these people. Using her newfound free will, Baby discovers a new talent...and possibly a new romance.The movie mostly works because of the chemistry between the two leads. Swayze and Grey previously worked with each other in 1984's Red Dawn and did not like each other. It took some convincing for Grey to work with Swayze again (and they continued to go at it during filming), but the screen test proves that this was a match made from heaven. They seemed so loose, so real together. The final dance sequence supports that statement. The film staves off mediocrity precisely because of these two. But there are still some fun supporting roles. Broadway star Jerry Orbach is a standout as Baby's father, the man who wants her to be perfect and follow in his footsteps.I had a fun time with Dirty Dancing. I honestly was not expecting much considering my distaste of the genre. There is always that one that manages to stick above the crowd. This is a true crowdpleaser. Great songs and the Swayze/Grey duo are why you need to give the film a chance. The melodramatic screenplay isn't all that fantastic, but it could have been worse. At least its bold tackling a subject that scared many producers, studios, and marketers away. If anything, the final dance set to Warnes/Medley radio smash is always worth the viewing.My Grade: B.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

phitt.,"being a 17 year old single girl, I FLIPPING LOVED IT. from the first few minutes, you are instantly introduced to the main character, and though she does not say very much about herself at all, its enough. the beautiful innocence that is Baby (grey) is suddenly shaken up when she meets Johnny (swayze), a wild, seemingly untamable dancer (working at the summer camp she and her family are staying at) with the most incredible dancing talent, an apparently stinking attitude, and one seriously hot bod. the film shows the changes and effects they have on each other, the troubles they and their friends go through, and though the film is packed with moving moments when baby battles with her father to show she has done nothing really wrong, there are also funny moments (such as the really geeky grandson of the camp owner, and Baby's unbearable sister singing), and some lines you really need to look out for. the end is incredible, and so is the sound track.this film is also a GOLD mine of sexy moments, bare-torsoes, bulging biceps and one very nice lake scene.... no straight girl can watch it without moaning or grunting at some point, no matter how many times you have seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Jennifer Grey(Joel's daughter) plays the naive Baby Houseman, who learns the ropes of dancing. These two main characters build a chemistry so hot, you wouldn't bother neutralizing the two elements. The musical soundtrack is really the bomb, several classics like Bruce Channel(Hey Baby!) I danced along to the song dozens of times. It's funny when Baby and Johnny keep splashing in the water when maintaining their balance. Solomon Burke's ""Cry to Me"" is memorable all the time. I always shudder when Johnny removed Baby's top in that scene. Gives me the rush every time. Not only does Swayze acts and dances, he sings. ""She's like the Wind"" blows your mind every time. At the dancing finale Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes ""I've Had The Time of My Life"" will leave everyone singing and dancing at the same time, and the lift is PERFECT!

The relationship between Baby and Johnny is in there for the women, who demand some romance in every film.

I grew up in this time, although the dancing that my friends and I did wasn't quite as ""dirty"" as what was depicted in this film. But it was still ""lewd"" according to the older generation.

I CAN'T STOP SINGING OR DANCING OR SMILING,"This is a purely romantic fantasy. A young girl meets young man. The music, the dancing, along with the overtones of the changes brought on in the mid sixties, all the ingrediants add up to a delightful movie that makes you want to laugh and cry, as well as sing and dance. The sixties were turbulent. but not the early sixties. People forget that there was a part of the sixties that was young and innocent. Dirty dancing shows us the end of that era. Before Viet Nam, the death of kennedy, and the riots and violence of the later years.A time when families, even those with older kids did do things together. I loved the movie. I watch it regularly with my children, ages six through thirteen. They ask me questions about the clothes, the cars, and even in the case of my older kids, the social ideals of the people involved. but mostly they love the dancing and the music.Their favorite travel music is the two soundtracks from the movie. Baby's parents are pretty typical of their social class of the era. Parents trusted their kids, and classes weren't supposed to cross over the lines that society had set up.There was still a very distinct two sides of ""the tracks"" attitude. So yes, in many ways Dirty Dancing is real. And the dreams of a young girl are always real to the young girl doing the dreaming. I loved the movie. I actually smile in awe at some of the scenes. the feelings seem to be so real that you forget you are watching a performance.I think that many people smile when they watch DIRTY DANCING.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Personally, I thought that was one of the best endings to a movie I have ever seen, and the fact that Baby's father actually goes up to Johnny and say's ""when I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong"" and then tells his daughter how wonderful she looked on stage was a great thing to see.

I just had the time of my life...,"One of the best movies of its time, Dirty Dancing is something that you would not want to miss.I waited almost a year to see this and I must say, it was worth it. A must see for someone in Love both with His/Her partner and dancing as well. Patrick Swazye and Jennifer Grey excel in their roles and just see them move along. Although I enjoyed the pairing of Patrick and Cynthiya Rhodes more, but then overall the film is a masterpiece. A film that lets you enjoy the true magic of Mambo, a film that teaches you how to love, a film that makes you remember that you can make a difference, and a film that makes you fall in love all over again. The songs are beautiful and the music is excellent. Some of the scenes just make you say, ""Wish I was there..."". A special treat for that someone special. Enjoy it with your loved one because its worth it. My vote 10 out of 10 and I wouldn't miss it for any other film. Go ahead and experience the magic of Love, Dance and Music.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A very exceptional movie!,"It's about breaking away from expectations and boundaries. It's about growing up and figuring out who you want to be. It's about the time in our lives that we've all experienced in which everything changes, and personalities and emotions clash, and the puzzle pieces finally begin to fit together! It's about taking chances and falling in love. It's about our last free summer after we graduate high school. The time when we begin to enter the real world and venture off into the next huge part in our lives.In my opinion, it's a wonderful movie. Very nice set design, excellent casting and choreography, great music, and very interesting cinematography. This is a movie I will own on DVD and treasure forever and have my children watch when they're old enough to appreciate it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Wicked film!,"This film is 100% Amazing! You can watch this film over and over and over again! Well i can! I am only a teenager and LOVE this film! Dirty Dancing appeals to anyone of all ages! The storyline is really good and there are some sad, funny and sweet scenes in the movie! The actors play excellent parts in the film! My favourite actor is Patrick Swayze who is very good to watch in this as he is very attractive and plays the part so well! I love the music in Dirty Dancing to, I have the soundtrack from it which is excellent! This film is one of my favourite films ever and i love watching it as it makes me laugh + cry on some bits!

The film is a must-see for every culture lover,"Dirty Dancing is an all-time classic. The film is known by both young and old generations. This is due to the many adaptations of the film as a musical.The film is therefore a must-see for every culture lover. It's about the love on a holiday paradise between a guest and the entertainment team. It clearly states the limits of dealing with guests and these limits are still the same to this day. In this way, it is a learning experience for all teenagers who run hopelessly in love after a member of the entertainment team abroad.The alternation between film and music is simply beautiful! You just have to see this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Johnnyyyyyyyy,"Dirty Dancing is the best movie I ever watched in my whole life! From the first minute till the last one....every second of the movie is great.....a great but simple story. I guess Johnny represent the tall,(somewhat)dark, handsome dream-boy and the whole love story between Johnny and Baby is probably every girls dream. I know it's mine....A good ""therapy"" after a hard day at work is to watch that movie......try it ...lol",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Wonderful,"A favorite movie, guaranteed always to make one feel good. The scene, a Jewish summer resort of the last generation, is very familiar to me as I played piano and directed musicals in just such resorts in the 1950s. Dirty Dancing has the feel of such resorts just right and without the Borscht Circuit shtick which can be very distancing for many people. The story is moving, the acting is just fine (my father was a doctor just like the Jerry Orbach character), and the dancing is great. I've seen the movie dozens of time and never tire of it.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Great Movie,"I just think it's a wonderful movie.The first time I saw it I was maybe 6 or 7 years old. and I loved it! today, being 22, (and after seeing it hundreds of times) I still do. And believe me, it doesn't has anything to do with Patrick Swayze being on it! I just think you can never get enough of this amazing dance scenes, those beautiful location and the best soundtrack ever. No matter how you are feeling, watching Dirty Dancing it's always a great experience. What I think it's so great about this movie is that you can see it whether in a superficial way ( like a classic love story) or in a deep way, and you will always love it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Well done evocation of 1960s Catskill Kitsch and the Class Gap,"I guess being old enough to remember the Catskills at their peak and the culture helps me write more favorably about the film. I think it captures the schlocky nature of much of the entertainment. I am talking about some of the lesser acts---of course there were some name entertainers at the top of the bill, but the fillers were on a par with the amateur talent show. My impressions of the Catskill ""borscht belt"" was from the 1950s, and this film represents the early 1960s, when as Max, the proprietor says, ""It all seems to be slipping away"". I didn't get a sense of the degree class snobbery (shown in the film) in the 1950s, but perhaps by the 1960s this factor was important. I worked as a waiter for a New Jersey hotel that was a sort of ""Catskills South"" and there was some condescension between wealthy guests and working stiff employees. The guests could be petty and demanding, and we were expected to cater to their every whim for low pay and no benefits.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The way it makes you feel...,"This is one of those movies that, no matter when of what time of year you watch it, always seems to make me feel warm, relaxed and happy. Reminds me of the summers I used to have with my friends, when we had no worries, no jobs, not a care in the world. Damn I miss feeling like that... but watching this movie always makes me feel better about things. From the cast, to the setting, to the soundtrack, Dirty Dancing is timeless. They sure don't make 'em like this anymore. One of the true classics.RIP Patrick Swayze, you were always one of my favourite actors and a great talent.

I loved that movie,"I absolutely adored that movie, when Patrick Swayze starred in that movie he was the sexiest man ever. . .at least his upper body was.  Even though he was 35 when that movie came out he was still sexy!!!  And his song ""She's Like the Wind"" was wonderful.  Actually, for a romance movie it ranks low, but it's a movie well worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Dirty Dancing,"For anyone with a heart - a soul - ""Dirty Dancing"" is a great film.Seeing the verve of the young people in the film - doing what they can to break from the conventional bonds of their parents - was stimulating. Not appearing to be ""bad"" in the traditional sense, they were merely trying to carve out their own place in the world.Patrick Swayze's acting - overshadowed only by superb dancing - was strong. Playing the ""bad guy"" with a misunderstood spirit was a fine example of casting.Jennifer Grey, as ""Baby"" Houseman, nearly stole the film. Her innocence - her overwhelming beauty - was exceedingly provocative. Her dancing, too, was wonderful. Watching her with Patrick Swayze was so sensuous, and watching them dance was a heart-warming experience.It is interesting to go to the IMDb site and check out the filmographies. Some actors who continued on in their careers - some who drifted into seeming oblivion.Every once in awhile, a film comes along that grabs us. For me, ""Dirty Dancing"" falls in line with other excellent films that are ""grabbers,"" like ""Six Days, Seven Nights,"" ""You've Got Mail,"" ""West Side Story,"" et al.I just finished watching ""Dirty Dancing"" for the umpteenth time, and NEVER tire of the story and the portrayal. Especially, the end-of-film dance at the end of season show.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
My favorite movie !!!,"I have watched this movie so many times that I can't count them. I went to Mountain Lake again a couple of weeks ago.And the original hotel is there !!I don't think another movie should be made unless Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze are the stars. I think it would ruin the original. I have collected the video,dvd, collector's sound track and other items connected to Dirty Dancing. I am a grandmother and this is still my favorite movie !",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Nothing Dirty About this Dancing ****,"A fabulous film capturing life in the Catskills for Jewish people years ago.Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey were perfectly cast as the lovers who meet by chance in the summer of 1963. Jennifer's doctor father, played to the hilt by Jerry Orbach, takes the family on a summer vacation and Grey is immediately attracted to dancer Swayze along with his group of dancers.Besides the terrific dancing and music, the acting is terrific. Yes, there is plenty of stereotyping but it's well worth it.Max, the owner of the hotel, played to perfection by Jack Weston, conveys the spirit that existed at these hotels in the 1950s and beyond.There are certainly exceptions to the usual stereotyping. The prospective doctor, who is a summer waiter, gets a girl into trouble and it is immediately assumed that the swinger Swayze is the father. Wait to you see who has committed all those robberies at the hotel. You'll laugh out loud.This is a rare gem of a film since it so beautifully captured the period of time as we discovered and evaluated our youth.You will want to dance up a storm when you see this one. Hard to believe that 20 years has gone by since the film was made. Jennifer Grey, daughter of Oscar winner Joel Grey, had such talent and potential What became of her?",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
To say the best it's got  very good dancing.,"Yes to say the best this does have very good dancing and John Travolta and Jennifer Gray make great lead characters in their roles too.Yes you must watch this film for yourself to see as well as feel how the romance,Music,and dancing can touch your heart too.I even recall very well how much that I'd really enjoyed this film once I had watch it on HBO many years ago.The only other that I can think of when I think of Jennifer Gray's others is Ferris Bueller's Day Off.Just like any role that John Travolta is in he does a great acting job.Truly,Stephen ""Steve"" G.

"Fun, entertaining movie","First, I don't care for 1980s or 1990s films, in general. There is way too emphasis on action, explosions, swearing, nudity, and violence for my liking. ""Dirty Dancing,"" though it is not completely ""innocent,"" is a lot better in these respects than most recent films. And it tells an old, old story very well. Watching Jennifer Grey's character development is a delight. Patrick Swayze's dancing doesn't hurt, either. From what I have observed, more so than with just about any other film I can recall, this is not a movie that men like. But my female friends just about all love it. This is not a great movie, but it IS a great experience.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Girl goes to camp, girl meets boy, girl learns to dance, complications ensue.","I adore this movie. When I was thirteen, I watched it an average of once a day, especially in the summer, because it's a very summer movie. It's also very simple, and almost infantile. For me, it's kind of a guilty pleasure. It's deeper than it looks, but it's still very idealistic, and although it's a '60s period piece, it's very '80s. The storyline is idealistic and kind of melodramatic, but the cast is brilliant. It's probably the raw acting ability that went into this movie that makes it a pretty good film, as opposed to forgettable crap. It's also extremely sexy. Laugh if you want, but it's one of the best movies for sweet romance that doesn't become sexless. It has a great soundtrack, and it actually examines social issues of the '60s and later very well. And the entire cast is brilliant, which is something I can't say enough. ""Dirty Dancing"" is so cheesy, but so joyous and heartfelt that you can't help but love it.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
one of my favorite romance movies,"I never watched it until my teens, and then feel in love with it. It made me want to get the 80s style of dance back, why don't people dance or fall in love like this anymore? I'm not usually prone to romance movies that much, but this one has since then been my favorite one yet. I really loved the romance between the two leads, how we saw them getting closer through dance, even though their practice didn't go so well at first. So yeah, even thought I'm USALLY an action/mystery guy, this movie made me question a lot of stuff. And I've now gone on a binge for 70s and 80s romance movies, thought no one matches this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The Time of My Life!!!,"This is a really little 8o's classic that got touched by a lot of people. I enjoyed every aspect and every moment of it. The dancing, the acting by Patrick and Jennifer were excellent and had some of the best chemistry, the dialogue, the plot, the script and the whole atmosphere that this movie created, Dirty Dancing is a truly powerful, magnificent and a very appealing movie that leaves you deeply touched and with a wonderful feeling in your heart, by all that means from the iconic soundtrack to the iconic last dance scene, Dirty Dancing becomes one of the best 80's movies, and one of the best Rom Coms that I have seen of the 1980's. I give "" Dirty Dancing "" an 8 out of 10 Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
I love this movie,"I loved this movie! I know it is not the most appropriate movie but I loved the dancing and the sound track. I have read a lot of reviews and most of them are poor. Most say they didn't like the way they handled love (i.e. sex) The point of the movie is that Baby breaks away from her father and follows her own path. The only thing I didn't like about this movie is they don't show them getting to know each other, as far as I can tell the only thing they know about each other is that Johnny is misunderstood and that Baby has a very positive outlook on life. This bothers me but it does not bother me enough to take away from the feeling I get every time I watch it.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

I get great pleasure from watching this film over and over again, but when Dirty Dancing, Havana Nights first came out i was disgusted to see that they were trying to replace the original with the second. This film does no justice at all to the original and i will not be taking time out to watch it again. Dirty Dancing to me will always remain the best well over any other film that i have seen. plus patrick swayze is mighty fine!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Though set in the 60's, this instant classic has an 80's sensibility and undeniable style....","DIRTY DANCING was the surprise smash hit of 1987 which told the story of an irresistible romance that develops between a nubile teenager and a dance instructor at a Catskills resort when the girl's family arrives at the resort for the summer. This deceptively simple plot provides the backdrop for one of the most innovative and ingratiating musicals to hit the screen in years with dance sequences that redefined movie choreography forever. Jennifer Grey (daughter of Oscar Winner Joel Grey) turns in a star-making performance as Baby Houseman, the young idealistic teen who finds her head turned one magical summer by the flashy Johnny Castle, played with swiveling-hip sincerity by Patrick Swayze, who made it cool for guys to dance in the movies again. It is the undeniable chemistry between these two relatively unknown actors and some dazzling dance sequences that make this movie worth watching over and over again. Swayze and Grey are magic together and mention should be made of an outstanding supporting performance from the late Jerry Orbach as Baby's father. The film won the Oscar that year for Best Song ""(I've Had)The Time of My Life"" which is used in the film's spectacular finale. The film is irresistible and once you've experienced it for the first time, multiple viewings will follow.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
What Most Other 1980s Films Wanted to Be.,"Very adult-oriented flick that found a younger audience when it was released and was a legitimate block-buster. ""Dirty Dancing"" is one of those odd over-achievers that works in spite of itself. Young Jennifer Grey falls in love with the slightly older Patrick Swayze during one summer in the early-1960s and they enter a dance contest together and make the screen sizzle. One of the biggest hits from the 1980s, the film's pop culture appeal is truly uncanny. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"The little film that could!  And boy, did it ever!!","Despite the obvious flaws, one can not deny there is a most definite magical quality in this film. Perhaps it is the nostalgic story line of innocent romance in an innocent time. Perhaps it is the feel good soundtrack and dancing. Whatever it is, it transcended many films of the genre and the decade. There is such a strong chemistry between and Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, it outshines some clichéd moments in the script. The music works so well in the film. Even the juxtapositioning of the modern day hits, with the time period songs works.The stars aligned for this film, it came out at the right time and just exploded and even after 20 years, it is one of the few movies that is still enjoyable to watch every time. And Patrick Swayze was right! Nobody puts Baby in a corner!",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Absolutely Amazing!!,"I first heard of this film from a friend. She loved it and always watched it. When she told me about it and said how old it was, I immediately decided that I wouldn't like it. I was so wrong. Dirty Dancing was such an amazing film! I love the music and the dancing. I bought the soundtrack and DVD immediately after watching it. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey were brilliant in it. They captured the emotions and feelings of the characters so well. They were both such good dancers. After watching the film I wished I could dance like them and I'm hopefully going to take up ballroom and Latin dancing soon. I've become a fan of that sort of dancing and am now hooked on all films and programs about it. Dirty Dancing revealed my passion for dancing and music. My favorite parts of the film are when Baby goes into the Staff's headquarters and sees them dancing and obviously the last scene where Baby and Johnny dance together in front of everyone. I believe that everyone must watch Dirty Dancing at least once in their lifetime. If they don't, it's their loss!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Goyim on the West Side,"Watching ""Ice Castles"" reminded me of this, so I revisited it.Two things: The first is the modern problem of how to incorporate dance in a story. In the 30s you could just pretend the movie was a stage show with the players doing their entertainment thing. Coming out of that was a long tradition of movies where the characters were in show business, so we'd have some usually trivial story wrapping the shows.Over time, the interplay between the inner show and the outer became important and nuanced. At one end is the play reflecting some larger insight into the ""real"" life that surrounds it. By merging the audience within with the audience in the movie theater, the story becomes more real.In modern times, the screenwriter's problem -- when they want to have dance -- is how to incorporate it into the story. It isn't easy at all, unless you turn it into a sports movie where the dance (or singing) sequences are part of some grand competition that is also a make it or break it life test. That's lazy. Just lazy.Dirty Dancing was a clever solution, since become something of a formula. Dancing is sex, pure and simple. Dance as a seduction, paired dancing that is. There is the slightest hint of a test here, where our little baby has to fill in for the regular partner. (She has to fill in because that partner is pregnant, as if we needed yet another reminder what it is all about.) But that event isn't so much a test as a gift, a gift of her body.All in all, seeing this again after 20 years, it doesn't seem all that dirty now even though the youth and plainness of our girl is still striking.The second interesting thing about this was remarked on when new. But it is so much more obvious when browsing the DVD extras. Baby is a Jew, as is her family and all the guests. The writer was trying to evoke her own memories of a lost era (the hotelier bemoans that loss at the end of the movie).The setting is a Jewish resort in the Catskills where the owner brings in the right kind of boys for waitstaff in order to screw the patron's daughters. There's a longstanding joke in the Jewish community about how tepid and joyless they are, and that's pinged often here.Meanwhile, some of the lower class staff, goyim, have a West Side Story sort of existence, endlessly rutting and dancing. Joy and whooping.Our Baby is the daughter of the doctor who saved the owner's life, so he has blessed her by providing his own blood to awaken her. This poor kid is played by someone who had a name for himself playing stereotypical Jews. Large noses play an embarrassing part here in identifying key characters and this kid has a comically prosthetic one.No surprise that she prefers the ""other"" class, and much is made of her father's disapproval. It is because he is not a Jew, like the boy designated for the other daughter (who dutifully plans her deflowering).No one doubts that Baby will never see Johnny again, will join the Peace corps, fix her nose (as Jennifer has) and be happy in some conventional future after having her two flings.Its a sad movie in many ways, but if you want an old dance movie, please choose this one over ""Flashdance"" and ""Saturday Night Fever.""

I wish I was Baby so I could dance with him! Oh, and I looked up Patrick Swayze's age. I can't believe he's 54. That's unreal. I want him to be the same age he was in Dirty Dancing and always look that great! He's really hot!Anyway, I watched it 2 more times in 24 hours. I'm obsessed but what can I say, I love it!

Good movie with some bad parts,"This classic movie was so popular when it came out and it still is. The acting is absolutely horrible, especially from Jennifer Grey, but what makes this movie great is the dancing and the music, which makes you forget all about the bad acting.The story line isn't that great, yet people (mostly women) loved it because it's the story where the girl who does not look like a model at all, manages to get the good looking guy who seems way out of her league. It represents the dream of many women of getting the unattainable guy and do some dirty dancing with him. It's easier for the average woman to identify with Baby. Speaking of Baby, I think they could find a much better nickname for her.The story appeals to the public, but the dancing also has a major part in attracting the audience. This movie may make you reconsider those dancing classes you gave up a long time ago. I say, forget the story, it's not that great, forget the acting, you'll be glad you did, and focus on the dancing, because it is great. And I gotta say I was pretty surprised by Patrick Swayze. He is one hell of a dancer. Can't say the same about Jennifer, but I guess she is not supposed to be a good dancer in the movie, since she is just learning.The bottom line is that despite its bad parts this is a good movie that is definitely worth your time.

Ridiculous Female Fantasy,"This nostalgic look at a time that never was has mousy Jewish girl (Jennifer Grey) about to go off to college but going off with her family to vacation at a Catskills resort and finding love with a sleazy and vapid dancer (Patrick Swayze).Nothing rings true in this story. The mix of vintage music with new music doesn't work. The resort staff that does ""dirty dancing"" in their private quarters is moronic. The acting is horrid.The narrator waxes nostalgic in the opening, telling of that time before the Kennedy murder and before the Beatles. We then get shown people who also would not have been employed by a Jewish resort. People didn't talk this way in 1963 and they didn't act this way in 1963.Grey plays ""Baby"" Houseman, a nice Jewish girl without a Jewish name. She's taken with Johnny ... they're always named Johnny ... a street kid who can dance as well as he can mince. Swayze has the sex appeal of cold mashed potatoes.His preening and posturing is supposed to pass for machismo but he's less butch than Grey is. The dancing that wows the fans would get the boot on any local talent show.Caught up in this mush are Jack Weston as the resort owner, Jerry Orbach as the Jewish daddy, Kelly Bishop as the vacant mother, Jane Brucker as the apparently retarded older daughter. Cynthia Rhodes as the knocked-up dancer, Wayne Knight as a comic, Paula Trueman as a geriatric kleptomaniac, Max Cantor as Robbie the seducer, Lonny Price as the smarmy grandson of the owner, and Charles ""Honi"" Coles as the bandleader.Most of the cars are too old, the hair styles are wrong, and the Catskills resort was actually filmed in Virginia and North Carolina and looks nothing like Upstate New York.The dance ending is ridiculous with Swayze leaping offstage into the audience and gyrating in a group dance, and they all know the steps! Apparently Baby lands her Johnny ... a relationship that should last all of two weeks.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
LOVE Dirty Dancing!!!!,"Hello all you lovely Dirty Dancing fans!!!! I came across this message board when i was bored one day and think it's cool. I absolutely love DD! I first saw it at my friends house when I was 13 (now I'm 17) and got hooked!! I saw it there at least 10 more times and soon after, I bought the DVD for myself. At this stage, I have memorized most of the script and can recite it whenever anyone asks me about it. ''I carried a watermelon?!'' It's gotten so bad that I bought the soundtrack and recorded Micky and Sylvia's song, and now it's the ringtone on my phone!! Most of my friends think it's a crap movie, but I don't care what they think of it, I know it's brill! I was reading the comments earlier and I have a few questions for you lot - 1. Why are you asking trivial questions like what ages Lisa and Baby are? I don't think it matters that much. They are teenagers in the 60's, isn't that enough? 2. Where did ye get this special edition that you're all talking about? It sounds VERY interesting... Please reply to this. I'd like to see other fans opinions...

No one Puts Baby in a Corner,"""No one puts Baby in a corner"" is the tell all line in the classic coming to age movie Dirty Dancing. Now in a special 25 year blue ray release. Skinny Cow Ice cream held a celebration for fans or new fans to delve to an age of innocents in the summer of 1963, before JFK was shot, before the cynicism that has permeated our world. In this tale, Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) goes on holiday with her family to the conclave of a resort. She is set to tackle the world and make her mark. In the mean time she falls for her dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) as she works with him to master her mambo steps. In the end you leave yearning for a much simpler time and that one period that the world was filled with possibility.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Empowers and Inspires,"Movies should awaken and invite viewers to focus attention on what transpires on the screen. Dirty Dancing does this very well. The story plot is easy to relate to for those in their teens and older. The cast seemed perfect for their roles, the music fit the scenes and told the story in sound to compliment the visual effects beautifully. A really good movie is watched over and over again with similar emotions being stirred up again again each time it is viewed; Dirty Dancing is such a movie. Not only did I enjoy watching this film over and over again with wishful thinking and dreaming, I actually made some of my thoughts and dreams develop into reality by dancing more often myself (which is great arobics, by the way). Dirty Dancing inspires a zest for living and empowers one to action. When a film grips you and motivates to make dreams come true, it is an excellent film that did it job of stirring your soul and mind to make fantasy a reality in your life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Pro-Abortion Propaganda that I loved as a ignorant little girl.,"I loved this movie when I was growing up. I owned *both* sound tracks. Then I watched the movie as an adult. It loses it's charm when you realize a baby is being killed. The heroine/protagonist deceives her physician father into giving her 200 dollars (a lot of money in the early 60's) so she can pay for a dancer to have an abortion and thus break the law. The teenager lies to her family and in doing so finances the dismemberment of a child and the butchering of the baby's mother and is made out to be selfless. Add to it the sob story the mother gives about getting herself pregnant: "" I don't sleep around. I thought he loved me. I thought I was special."" That certainly justifies cutting your baby into pieces. I pity those who never grow up and accept this line of bull. I pity those who don't recognize this movie as the political propaganda it is.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The best,"Dirty Dancing has always been and will likely remain my favorite movie ever to be made. Great music, humor, romance, and a happy ending - everything a great movie needs.

music,"I think, like many others on here, that the music was exceptional. Last week, one of the channels had a ""dirty dancing marathon."" Good thing the husband wasn't home, because I watched it all day. I kept wondering why, I love it so much. When he came home, he said that it's the music I like---he's right. And, maybe the fact that we live a 1/2 hour northwest of the Catskills? They did a good job with the movie, to look like Upstate NY. (We don't get that much sun tho.) And I think I noticed Pilot Mountain, NC in the movie? Or near there? Beautiful areas. Just like here. I never tire of watching this movie, tho some on here thought it was awful. Too bad. One thing I really love, is a particular song; ""in the still of the night."" Growing up in the 50's, my brother and I always had to listen to a neighbor's brother, rehearsing a song-- and they wanted to know, if we liked it. Yep--it was that song! So it was so good to hear it played in a movie! I have to get the soundtrack, and the movie! I agree, about the clothes. Especially that blouse Baby had on, after they go to the Sheldrake. I remember those coming out in the very late 60's. And when her father says; ""when I say I'm wrong..."" well, he didn't really apologize IMO. Just said he was wrong, but not to him? It should have been; ""I'm sorry Johnny."" The sister and waiter play good roles too. They all played good parts. ""22 countries in 3 days."" I've been to Europe 8 times, and to me, that's too much! Every time we drive on Route 17 thru the Catskills, and see the billboards, I laugh thinking about Dirty Dancing. Good bagels too, lol.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Bad filmmaking 101,"No matter how lousy a film is, if you make it sappy enough people will just lick it up.This is one of the worst films of the 80s, and I can't fathom how so many people rate it so highly. The only good actor is Jerry Orbach, and he's hardly on screen. The film uses every single cliche in the book, from the ""good little girl who's so repressed"" to the ""spontaneous"" choreographed finale. This is like a lesson in how to make a bad movie.I'm not surprised that plenty of people seem to enjoy watching this film. But that doesn't make it ""good"". If you like the music because it reminds you of your childhood, fine. If you admire baby because you wished you could broken out of your prison when you were a teenager, fine. And if you like seeing Swayze shake his booty around, that's fine, too.But don't say this is actually a good film. It's awful.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A classic for a reason,"This movie is the right amount of sexy. I rewatched this movie recently when a friend came to visit and broke the news that she'd never seen it. This movie was better than how I remember it being as a child. While it is a horny movie with a coming-of-age plot, all centered around dancing, it's not really ""about"" any of those things, and certainly doesn't do it in a cheesy way. This film covers bases of classism, toxic relationships, capitalism, money, abortion, familial and parental relationships, and the concept of changing the world. It is absolutely a classic for these reasons. Done well, this can absolutely be the quintessential girls night movie, OR a movie to stimulate thought. Either way, wonderful.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Patrick Swayze can have my babies,This movie truly is a classic. The music as well as dance numbers really do make the movie memorable but isn't all that is offered. Johnny as a character goes through some awesome character progression along with Baby. The movie houses some standard tropes/life lessons such as don't judge people before you know what they've been through. This trope is even more emphasized by Baby's dad. It touches on real topics without changing the feel of the movie. The 'dance how I want' idea was not utilized quite enough. This movie is ICONIC and Patrick Swayze is HOT.,8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

This silly movie succeeds despite itself!!!,"Don't misunderstand me! ""Dirty Dancing"" still ranks as one of my favorite movies! A bright and cheery ""feel good"" experience that's always fun to watch and enjoy during a date night or a party! You simply have to take it at face value and not too seriously! The soundtrack,the photography,the summer resort setting and of course the fabulous dance numbers all have managed to work together to make one of the 80s biggest and most memorable hits! But,you have to laugh at what the filmakers tried to pull off: a conglomeration of characters who act and dress and behave in ways UNHEARD OF in 1960s America! BUT...maybe that's what does it! Is it the summertime vacation experience that everyone (young or old) has secret dreams about?

Guilty pleasure,"This lovely melodrama has a fair story and acting, and on the technical side it is quite decent. Although I do not like Patrick Swayze, and I consider Jennifer Grey to be a bit on the ugly side, their chemistry is incredibly addictive, but the main advantages of this flick are great music, for which it won an Oscar, and a lot of erotic dance. Objectively, the film is about a six, but due to awesome music and the powerful emotion it evokes, it has become a cult hit, especially among the women. Thanks to my sister, who's crazy about this movie ever since she was a kid, I saw it countless times, and I must admit that it got under my skin.

A timeless classic film,"**Review of ""Dirty Dancing""**""Dirty Dancing"" is a timeless classic that effortlessly blends romance, music, and dance into a heartwarming narrative. Set in the summer of 1963 at a Catskills resort, the film follows Frances ""Baby"" Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, as she embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Her unexpected romance with dance instructor Johnny Castle, portrayed by Patrick Swayze, is both passionate and tender, bringing an electrifying chemistry that captivates viewers.The film's soundtrack is iconic, featuring unforgettable songs like ""(I've Had) The Time of My Life,"" which perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the era and the emotions of the characters. The choreography is nothing short of spectacular, with dazzling dance sequences that showcase both Swayze's and Grey's incredible talents.Beyond the dance and romance, ""Dirty Dancing"" tackles important themes such as class differences, personal growth, and the fight for one's beliefs. The film resonates on multiple levels, appealing to audiences of all ages.Overall, ""Dirty Dancing"" is more than just a romantic drama; it's a celebration of love, freedom, and the joy of living in the moment.

The film is very good, approaching a theme with an extremely valid criticism (in general today it is already a cliché, but at the time still quite unusual). In addition, mainly the protagonist has a personality and charisma that bring something more to the film (in addition to the characters, in general, being truly interesting). The main couple, as a whole, are also of excellent chemistry, which surprises me even more given that I am aware of the hatred they both harbored towards each other behind the scenes.

"dumb teen movie, predictable sound track","I don't understand the fuzz about this one, to me it is no more than just another teen movie, about relationships, Love, etc. OK, the dancing is nicely done, the period re-making is excellent, in style, props, comments, etc., but that's all.

Just teen amusement for the drive-in, to get long times of kissing and hugging, as there is nothing to see anyway. Conclusion: mediocre, and only ""great"" when you're just 15, the market it was made for. (At that age I went to see A Hard Days Night at least, quite another teen movie).

A classic.,"DIRTY DANCINGA romance film... Not my sort of movie, but there is no denying that this is a classic.The movie is about a girl who goes on holiday with her family. There she meets a group of dancers. She finds out that one of the dancers is in trouble and decides to help. To help she needs to learn to dance professionally. Whilst learning, she falls in love with her teacher and they have to hide their affair as he would get fired and she would be in a lot of trouble with her family.The film stars the late great Patrick Swayze. Patrick was such a good actor. He made so many great movies and even acted towards the end of his life in the TV show The Beast even though he was in a lot of pain. He is in my top 5 actors of all time and he is missed. Dirty Dancing is one of his biggest movies. The man knew how to dance well and he really shows it in this movie. Jennifer Grey played the girl in the movie. Jennifer is a good actress and she played this part well. She has been in a lot of movies and TV shows, but she will always mainly be famous for this film.The soundtrack to this movie is one of the strongest draws to this film. It is a near perfect soundtrack. It has a lot of great songs in it and it is made all the better by the song called She's Like The Wind which is sang by Patrick Swayze himself.The story itself is actually quite weak. It is a love story that has no deep meaning other than a holiday romance. Normally it would not be a good story for a film... But it works because of all the elements that work well together.I really like this film. I watched it a lot when I was younger as it was one of the first VHS I owned. It is a classic that I liked now as much as I did. But I can imagine that I wouldn't like it as much if it was the first time I saw it.I will give this film 8 out of 10.""I carried a watermelon.""For more reviews please like my Facebook page.Ordinary Person Movie Reviews",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Patrick Swayze (Road House), Jennifer Grey (Red Dawn), Jerry Orbach (Crimes and Misdemeanors), Cynthia Rhodes (Flashdance) and Kelly Bishop (Gilmore Girls).The soundtrack for this is absolutely timeless and amazing. The circumstances are very unique and the dancing was excellent. The film also does a great job of mixing in some coming of age realisms with differences in social classes. The acting is out of this world with many strong performances.

The DVD has lots of extras including interviews with Jennifer and her old (better) nose. Every time I see Jerry Orbach I think of Baby. Worth seeing over and over again, until your eyes bleed. At least that's what my family claims of me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
the perfect film!,"i have seen this movie about 50 times already and it doesn't look like i am ever going to get bored of it. i always watch it with my best friend and it has become sort of a tradition for us now to watch it almost every month. every single time we see this movie we both get really emotional and we laugh and cry in front of the TV together and sing all the songs in a loud voice and in the end we always dance.by now we practically know even the whole dialog by heart and watching the film feels like seeing our own old friends on TV.this film is perfect! even though i have to admit that the story itself is a bit cheesy but the characters, the dance, the music and even the place where it all takes place make you forget all about it and you start believing that things like that really do happen and that the song ""all you need is love"" actually has some kind of a meaning.i am really a normal person and not too serious about this comment of mine but i just cant wait until the next time we'll be able to see Dirty Dancing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The Movie Draws You In - and Back to 1963,"I have watched this movie at least 30 times, maybe more, and each time I watch it I am drawn into the movie and back to 1963! The Movie takes me on a nostalgic vacation every time I watch it.I think the important thing to say here is I was 15 in 1963 and I can remember ""before President Kennedy was shot and before the Beetles came."" I can feel myself saying something like, ""I carried a watermelon."" and then realizing just how stupid that was! Jennifer Grey plays Frances ""Baby"" Houseman in Dirty Dancing. Baby is going to start college in the Fall. She goes to Kellerman's for vacation with her family (mom, Dad and sister Lisa).One of the staff dancers, Penny (played by Cynthia Rhodes) gets pregnant by another staff person (one of the college boys played by Max Cantor) and has a chance to get an abortion but it is on a night that her and Johnny (Patrick Swayze) are scheduled to dance at a nearby hotel.Thus, the need for a fill-in dancer for Penny. Johnny is persuaded by Penny and his cousin Billy (Neal Jones) that he can teach Baby to do the dance in time for the show. Baby learning the dance steps with Penny and Johnny are wonderful scenes!Baby's father (Doctor Jake Houseman played by Jerry Orbach) comes to Penny's rescue when the abortion is done wrong. Dirty Dancing brought back to me this time in history when girls got pregnant and had abortions in back rooms by butchers. Around this time (1963) many girls actually died from this type of abortion - but there were not many choices for a girl then.Lonnie Price plays a great conceited grandson (Neil Kellerman) to Jack Weston's Max Kellerman. Jane Brucker does a great job as Baby's annoying sister Lisa Houseman.The music is great and the dancing is wonderful! The ""dirty dancers"" are absolutely wonderful and very sexy - I can feel Baby's astonishment when she first sees them dancing and says, ""Where'd they learn to do that?"".Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze are just perfect together in their respective roles. Patrick's song, ""She's Like The Wind"" brings tears to my eyes each time I hear/watch it in this movie.The movie ends on an up note, but leaves you wanting to know what happens next in Baby's and Johnny's lives. Dirty Dancing gives something new each time it is watched - It mesmerizes the watcher with nostalgia, a feeling of wanting it to be 1963 again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
One of the best movies I have ever seen.,"I am not a very good one to say this movie is good this isn't, I found lots of movies interesting while those suffered poor comments by the wise ones. Darty Dancing is one that I would like to take with me in my personal haven. The chemistry between the lead characters are so strong that I felt like fly to my girl right away, and the music tracks and the dances, dialogues, a very good movie, and I am quite shocked with its 6.1 rating, I expected it over 7 at least, those who rated this movie bellow 5, with all respect to everyones personal choices, I feel sorry for you people.

Good film,"Good film. Great location. Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Grey) visits a holiday camp with her family, before embarking to college to study Economics of developing countries to make sure all is where everywhere. But unfortunately, not everything is well at the camp either. A female dancer Penny (Rhodes) becomes pregnant and ironically has no money to get an abortion, so Baby helps her out by loaning her a lot of money. Meanwhile, someone has to take Penny's place as a dancer in a nearby hotel, and Baby volunteers for the job. But she can't dance. Only if there was someone to teach her... And of course, that's what Patrick Swayze is therefore and plenty of scenes with the shirtless hunk ensue and sparks of love fire at every direction. But for the dismay of Swayze, Jennifer Gray can not act which flattens the experience from a great movie to a good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Closed minds come in many forms,"I have seen well over a thousand movies to date, yet I never gave Dirty Dancing a chance. It's a ""click flick,"" right? On a quiet Sunday morning I watched this film and I'm really glad I did. It's a really great, inspiring firm that holds up well to time - 20 years later I found everything to be very compelling and pertinent.First of all, Jerry Orbach kicks ass. That just needed to be said. Jennifer Grey does a solid job, but Swayze carries the day. This character-driven plot line is relatable and wholly interesting. All in all, I found myself thoroughly engaged.Finally, it even prompted a bit of introspection - if I'm so reticent to dance, what makes me any different from the obstinate, prudish old man? I'll close with this line, one of the real 80's classics: ""Nobody puts Baby in the corner."" For what this film is: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Patrick Swayze is fantastic in this...the dancing, the acting and even the singing (they play one of his songs 'She's like the wind' in the later scenes). Even those of us younger ladies begin to find him strangely attractive.

As the movie proceeds, we are sucked into their relationship, and believe every single one of their actions.The soundtrack is amazing, the music only adds to the romantic mood of the movie and adds to the relationship between Baby & Patrick.The last scene makes this movie, who can ever forget the famous line ""Noboby puts Baby in the corner.""

Watch it again - one of the best-written movies there is,"In a just, non-patriarchal society, this movie would have at least an 8 out of 10. All I can figure is that a bunch of guys who don't like ""chick flicks"" came through and downvoted this film without even watching it, or perhaps after half-watching it while trying to hook up with a girl. Because, quite frankly, this movie is just objectively great.It's perfectly written, directed and edited. There isn't one scene in this entire movie that doesn't belong, not one moment. The whole thing, from start to finish, is nearly a textbook example of how to write a good movie, without ever feeling formulaic or rushed. This movie has heart, and it was written by a woman who actually had a personal connection to the story. This movie wasn't written or made as a star vehicle or to become a big blockbuster. Its success, indeed, was entirely unexpected. It succeeded because of its quality, not because Patrick Swayze is hot - although he is very hot in this movie, despite never really doing anything for me in any of his other films. That's down to the quality of the writing and characterization. His other films never gave him as much to work with.Anyway, if you've never seen this movie, see it. ESPECIALLY if you are a woman or girl, but if you're a man, also see it. It's not a ""chick flick"" - a term which implies a movie churned out in a shallow attempt to make money off of a demographic.

I thought Jennifer Grey gave a somewhat flat performance as Baby but Patrick Swayze did a good job as Johnny. My favorite song appears only briefly, during the scene when Baby and Johnny are coming home from their first dance appearance and the car radio is on. The song is ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" by the Drifters. This became one of my favorite songs and it no doubt made a mark on my memory. My favorite scene is when Baby and Johnny are playing around in the dance studio, just before the grandson of the owner of Kellerman's comes in.

D Squared,"So often when I hit up ""list of shame"" films I wind up feeling disappointed.

I had no clue what this was, I just knew I'd heard about it endlessly and assumed that it was going to be pretty salacious based on the title and other implications.What a wonderful, surprisingly delightful movie. Yes, it's super 80s to the max but this was a really enjoyable watch with characters that still feel relevant and real in their way. Everyone here is enjoyable, it provides a wonderful insight into certain types of people at the time and is a great tale of love traversing class boundaries. Also, as an aside, pre-COVID I hadn't really seen anything Swayze had been in and now that I've been rectifying that I find myself really wishing he had been in more things because he seems like a Hollywood wet dream given how talented and attractive he is. Swayze, you the man!This was legitimately enjoyable. It's not the greatest movie ever but it's so charming and enjoyable.

I was mesmerised then as i am still today of DD. The well known fact that Jennifer Grey & Patrick Swazey didn't get along behind the scenes shows you what magnificent acting was portrayed. The sexual chemistry between these 2 characters was binding! I can still watch DD today and feel the same energy as there was in 1987. 17 years ago Eleanor Bergstein brought her beautifully written story to be directed by Emile Ardolino who unfortunately pass away 20 November 2003.

an absolute classic. works on so many levels.,"i don't understand why so many people have to hate on this movie. it works as a pure fun summer movie, and at the same time addresses much deeper political and social issues. every time i watch it, i see something new.here's part of the new york times article that eleanor bergstein, the writer and co-producer, said really helped the movie get serious publicity:The New York Times 'DIRTY DANCING' ROCKS TO AN INNOCENT BEATBy SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN August 16, 1987KELLERMAN'S, THE FICTIVE Catskills hotel that provides the setting for the new film ''Dirty Dancing,'' is meant to be more than the sum of its parts, which are golf, gossip and gefilte fish. It stands as a metaphor for America in the summer of 1963 - orderly, prosperous, bursting with good intentions, a sort of Yiddish-inflected Camelot. So when Frances (Baby) Houseman, the doctor's daughter at the film's center, loses both her virginity and her political naivete to a street-smart dance teacher, the collision should shake the audience, too, out of a certain complacency.These, at least, are the intentions of Eleanor Bergstein, the novelist (''Advancing Paul Newman'') who both wrote and co-produced ''Dirty Dancing''. It will be up to critics and the public to decide how well Ms. Bergstein and the director, Emile Ardolino, have managed to embody such serious ideas in a movie that also aspires to be a summer divertissement - one part ''Flashdance,'' one part ''Baby, It's You.''To Ms. Bergstein, the two poles of the movie are consonant. Growing up in Brooklyn, she moved effortlessly from tutoring inner-city students in the afternoon to shimmying in ''dirty dancing'' contests at night. Similarly, she says, the rock-and-roll that subverts the dance floor etiquette at Kellerman's during the film anticipates a whole array of exciting and disquieting things to come later in the 1960's - the antiwar movement, the sexual revolution, the uprisings in cities and on campuses.''I meant 'Dirty Dancing' to be a celebration of the time of your life when you could believe that a kind of earnest, liberal action could remake the world in your own image,'' Ms. Bergstein said in a recent interview in her Upper West Side apartment. ''The film couldn't have been set a few months earlier or later. The summer of 1963 was the first one after the Cuban missile crisis, which everyone had been following on television. The effect on kids was to make them very scared, and, for the first time, very suspicious of their elders: maybe things wouldn't work out all right.''But the thing that kept the optimism going was John Kennedy himself - young and energetic and sexy. So maybe you could have it all. It was the summer of the Peace Corps and the summer of the 'I Have a Dream' speech. It was like the last summer of liberalism. Because two months after the movie is over, J.F.K. is assassinated. And two months after that the Beatles are on the 'Ed Sullivan Show.' And after that, it's radical action.''''Dirty Dancing'' had its genesis years ago in a more domestic image that fascinated Ms. Bergstein - two daughters in the same family, one raised to be beautiful, the other brainy.Gradually, the writer's notion of the sisters coalesced with her sense of how some people live through dance and popular music. These ideas, in turn, dovetailed with Ms. Bergstein's autobiographical recollections of Catskills summers, ''dirty dancing'' contests and 1960's activism, providing a narrative framework for the screenplay. And by co-producing her own film, Ms. Bergstein retained a rare degree of leverage over its final form.Unlike some recent films,''Dirty Dancing'' treats the idealism of the 1960's as a genuine expression of faith, not a passing fad.Baby Houseman plans to study the economics of the third world and to enter the Peace Corps. Neil Kellerman, the grandson of the hotel's owner, expects to join the Freedom Rides in the South. Almost everything about Kellerman's attests to the heyday of New York, Democratic Party liberalism. Ms. Bergstein based her characterization of Kellerman's on memories of childhood summers spent at Grossinger's. She evokes some of the more familiar elements of the Borscht Belt, but with the affection of one who had shared in them.''I didn't want to make it ugly and vulgar,'' Ms. Bergstein said of Kellerman's. ''It was a world of grace and elegance and - yes - liberal values. I remember that when my family went to the Catskills, you had busboys who were going to take a semester off from college to go on the Freedom Rides. When the three civil rights workers were killed in Mississippi, there was a candlelight vigil.''But as ''Dirty Dancing'' shows in some moments and suggests in others, places like Kellerman's (and, by extension, Kennedy-era America) could not sustain their placid, satisfied existence. When Baby Houseman (Jennifer Grey) follows a friendly bellboy to the staff quarters at Kellerman's, she wades into a blue-collar life of jacked-up cars, raunchy rock-and-roll, and sneers at the affluent, all of it personified by a dance instructor named Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). She gradually gains some acceptance in this world by substituting for Johnny's pregnant dance partner in a mambo show at a nearby resort, after having lied to her father to get $250 for the partner's back-room abortion. Baby's father, Jake (Jerry Orbach), ultimately learns of the ruse, the abortion and his daughter's burgeoning romance with Castle; and the favored child, ''Daddy's girl,'' has to stand on her own. Baby becomes Frances....",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

I LOVE this movie!,"Dirty Dancing one of my MOST favorite movies. I've only watched it two times on ABC because I haven't had the chance to buy it or rent it from Blockbuster. I had no idea Jennifer Grey was 27 at the time she made the movie, because she was very convincing as a teenager. Compared to some women in Hollywood she has a very flat chest, which is why I was fooled so easily about her age. So both physically and emotionally, Grey pulls off playing a teen very well. I also loved the dancing--who WOULDN'T? Both times I've watched Dirty Dancing, I keep wanting to look up dance classes. I also love the soundtrack, and I do recognize some of the songs from when I was eight or nine. I would LOVE to be able to watch this in my drama class, and I'm going to ask my teacher at some point if there's any part of the movie he can use for educational purposes. It's much better than the stuff he made us watch last year. And the ending was absolutely FANTASTIC. That's one of the best moments in the film.I can't believe I'm looking forward to the first day back to school because of Dirty Dancing! Who could ask for a better influence from a movie with that sort of title?",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Nobody puts baby in a corner.,"As of now this is in my top ten favourite. The dancing, music, emotional scenes, iconic lines, steamy romance and great acting make this an amazing experience. Very good plot and the leads are at their absolute best. The plot follows 17 year old ""Baby"" and her summer romance with her dance instructor Johnny castle. Never watch a remake because they are all absolute garbage. This has everything that will keep the audience captivated. Co starring Jerry orbach , Cynthia Rhodes, Jack Weston, Jane Brucker, Kelly bishop and Lonny price. Overall great movie. Definitely watch it if you want to be entertained.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
... nothing short of a masterpiece.,"this summer, love is in the air, and the dancing is dirty...it is the summer of '63. it's holiday time and everyone wants to relax and enjoy themselves...how can i even start to say how great movie this is? it's full of LIFE, spark and passion... a must-see for every person. not only is it a good dance movie, but the acting is fantastic. not making a sequel, dirty dancing 2, was a good move... movies like these should be a once-off hit, and it will remain a classic forever. this movie tickles your feet, and touches your heart. all you want to do afterward is dance, and love as if heartbreak doesn't exist.i definitely recommend that everybody should see this masterpiece - dance, cry and live, and most of all, feel the pulse of love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
THIS is the holiday romance I never had.,"I can't fault this film. The characterisation and subject matter had me hooked from the start. Despite the heroine's trials and tribulations, I would gladly have swopped places with her to get my hands Patrick Swayze. What more could you want? Holiday setting, beautiful people, romance, and more sexy dance scenes than you can wave a stick at. This is one of the few films I can view time and again and still get a thrill of excitement watching the plot unfold.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Hidden love in dance,"""It's truly worthy of watching. There is a significant amount of hidden love communication woven throughout the dances that are performed. It is absolutely beautiful how, in this production, you are invited to immerse yourself so deeply in the visuals that you should not even focus on the spoken words, as there exists a powerful and intricate form of communication that unfolds through the art of dance. The way each character's dance movements react to the rhythm and flow of the accompanying music, along with the carefully chosen backgrounds and lighting, conveys a plethora of emotions, saying so much without uttering a single word. Additionally, the music and sound effects are meticulously crafted, hitting the right notes and evoking feelings even before they fully resonate. You can truly witness how love can manifest itself beautifully and profoundly through the combination of music and movement. As you reflect on what needs to be encapsulated within this form of expression, it is essential to ensure that the content remains respectful and devoid of anything that veers into inappropriate territory.

BEST FILM EVER!!!,"This is my ultimate favourite film. Romance, Dancing and one very sexy Patrick Swayze.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
a classic,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. The dancing and the music are both so good that you can watch this movie over and over. I never tire of it. I just wonder what happened to the gal's that played in this movie, seems like they all went away. What a shame. If you enjoy music that beings back memories of the 50's and 60's you will love the music in this movie. Seem like this movie just warms your heart for so many reasons. Take the time to watch it, you will see why it has become timeless. I had heard that this movie was a low budget movie but it does not seem like they cut corners. The resort where this was filmed brings back the days when families spent vacations together. Just a simpler time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
This Movie Is A Breath Of Fresh Air,"This is a fabulous movie. Probably one of the best musical romance movies ever. Jennifer Grey couldn't have been better cast as 'Baby' Francis Houseman and Patrick Swayze is in great form as dirty dancing Johnny Castle. The interplay between the two stars is amazing throughout the movie. All of the stars are perfectly cast in this romantic, summery movie which is simply a breath of fresh air.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
how can the soundtrack make an average film to be good,"For this film I would give a 6 for the story and directing, because it has a lot of holes in the story and main role (Baby) was badly casted. But I give a 10+ for the music, because every time I watch the movie it gives me the chill. It has a great power to put you in that time and create the atmosphere. Although it is not an artistic film, it is a good film and I think the shallowness of the story and the characters is understandable and fits better in ""the whole picture"" than a more serious and deep would. So it is an 8, and I recommend it because it is an epic film in his genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
addicted,"I'm 15, usually not kids my age usually watch these old classic movies. But this is one of my favorites. I was totally addicted after watching it for the first time. It's really good if u think about technology and movies back at that time, music is great, storyline is OK,choreography is great, must see it. I don't know why there's a prequel for this movie. Not many people like this movie, but i love classic love movies, they're so much better than movies now! This movie will make you smile, cry and make you start dancing. The music is absolutely ear catching and beautiful. I haven't seen Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights(prequel), prequel should have star the original actors, thats what i hate about prequels, they ruin the original. No one wants a prequel, they want a sequel. Many people will agree that for a movie- the original, sequel and the 3rd one is enough. Beyond that, people wont be bothered to watch it. Who remembers the movie about the St Benard Beethoven? I think there's 5 movies altogether.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Classic,"Dirty Dancing is a beautiful movie that everyone should watch. It's suitable for kids. I watched it at age 15, but I wanted my my little sister to see it earlier than I did, so we watched it together few days ago, it was terrific and she'll remember it forever, so as I will.It's very likely my favourite movie ever, even though I don't like coming out of age movies very much. Actors are amazing, Jennifer is so cute, and Patrick is magnificent, as always. They did very good job. It impacted so many lives, and every person in my family, from my grandpa to my nine year old sister, have watched it, so we call it our family movie. Music is so good too, I got soundtrack album just after I watched movie, because I've fallen in love with it. Long story short it's must watch!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Very good movie,"I normally don't watch romantic, sentimental movies, but Dirty Dancing is so much more.The story centers around characters who grow and learn, and who you really empathize with.Add to this the performances of Swayze and Grey. They both did an excellent job, as did the supporting cast. I read another review here which said that the two actors really didn't care much for each other. If this is indeed true, then double kudos for their on screen chemistry.Who would think that two people who didn't like each other could generate such chemistry. I guess that IS acting :-)Jennifer Grey was about 27 when this film was made, but she looked at least 10 years younger (braces and all), which I thought was fascinating. And her performance was heartfelt.Also, kudos for the writers and Patrick Swayze. It would've been so easy to have his character as a two dimensional ""hunk/stud"" with no brains, but instead he gives a a performance that's both macho and sensitive (which is probably the reason why women went ""gaga ""for him).Another plus is the storyline. It dealt with subjects like abortion, which was especially taboo back in the early 60's, and a young girl's coming of age, by seeing what life was like outside of her sheltered upper middle class upbringing.And, need I say, the ending dance sequence was DYNAMITE! I have no doubt, in a dance contest, Swayze could probably give John Travolta and Christopher Walken a run for their money.The signature song brings back memories for me.All in all, a very good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
All time classic,"I first watched this when it first came out in '87, I had the CD, the picture disk and eventually the DVD. I've just watched it again after a long break and yup, still love it. I love a good love story with a great sound track.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
And I owe it all to you.,"Dirty Dancing. And I owe it all to you. Three awesome. Amazing drama, dance and music. And of course the famous final dance. I am sure this movie can be re-watched in 100 years and it will also be great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
What I loved everyone else missed.,"The scene in this picture that blew me away was when Creepy Guy tells Baby, after refusing to help the girl he impregnated, ""Hey, some people matter, some don't!"", he gives her a book by Ayn Rand (was it The Fountainhead?) which he highly recommends. Baby then dumps a pitcher of water over his head and tells him to stay away from her. During the time the film is set, Rand (who celebrated selfishness as a virtue) influenced many otherwise bright teenagers, some of whom later became neo-cons. Loved that the director or screenwriter planted this hidden gem.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Love Dirty Dancing,"Like for most women this movie is the ultimate chick-flick. With it's hot chemistry, sexy dance rountines and beaitiful songs, i mean timeless classic like (I've Had) The Time of My Life & the wonderful She's Like The Wind makes this movie. I adore Patrick Swayze in this movie and he shows he can sing and dance it's so hot. He sings ""She's Like The Wind"" in the movie. The chemistry between Swayze and co-star Jennifer Grey is amazing. I love all the dancing and everything that goes with it. But saying this Dirty Dancing 2: - Havana Nights is also great but Patrick Swayze scenes makes this. I love the songs, dancing and everything about it but it isn't Dirty Dancing. Like I said it's an amazing chick flick. Please let there be a 3rd because I love to see what happens with Patrick's character Johnny. Jennifer character could have been more sexy but hey Patrick makes up for that if you know what I mean!!! Great movie and I'm so pleased Billy Zane didn't win the movie role. I heard whispers he was meant for the role but they found out he couldn't dance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
