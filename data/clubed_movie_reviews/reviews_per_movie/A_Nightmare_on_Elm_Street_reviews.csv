You'll never want to fall asleep again,"While I love horror films, I am not a big fan of the slasher genre, which has come to dominate and indeed practically to define horror since the late 1970s. While I do love the original ""Psycho,"" most slasher films follow a different, and far more predictable, formula. The idea of a faceless killer going around stabbing teenagers just doesn't frighten me a whole lot, though some of these films do fill me with disgust--a rather different sort of emotion.I am far more frightened by films that deal with distortions of reality, where it's hard for the characters to tell what's real and what's not. Admittedly, that genre isn't always so lofty either. Dreams are one of the most overused devices in the movies, having a whole set of clich√©s associated with them. We are all familiar with the common scene in which a character awakens from a nightmare by jerking awake in cold sweat. This convention is not only overused, it's blatantly unrealistic, for people waking up from dreams do not jerk awake in such a violent fashion. Moreover, these scenes are usually nothing more than little throwaway sequences designed to amuse or frighten the audience without advancing the plot.What makes ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" so clever is how it creates an entirely new convention for representing dreams on screen. The dreaming scenes are filmed with an airy, murky quality, but so are many of the waking scenes, making it very difficult to tell whether a character is awake or asleep. Indeed, the movie never shows any character actually fall asleep, and as a result we are constantly on guard whenever characters so much as close their eyes for a moment. In crucial scenes, it is impossible to tell whether what we are seeing is real or happening only in a character's mind. But the movie ultimately suggests that the difference doesn't matter. The premise of the movie, in which a child-killer haunts teenager's dreams and has the capability of killing them while they're asleep, turns the whole ""It was all just a dream"" convention on its head: in this movie, the real world is safe, and the dream world is monstrously dangerous.The movie finds a number of ways to explore this ambiguity, including a bathtub scene that invites comparisons with the shower scene in ""Psycho"" without being a cheap ripoff. My personal favorite scene, and one of the scariest I've ever seen in a movie, is the one where Nancy dozes off in the classroom while a student is standing up in front of the class reading a passage from Shakespeare. The way the scene transitions from the real classroom to a nightmarish version of it is brilliantly subtle.The director, Wes Craven, understood that the anticipation of danger is usually more frightening than the final attack. There are some great visual shots to that effect, including one where Freddy's arms becomes unnaturally long in an alleyway, and another where the stairs literally turn into a gooey substance, in imitation of the common nightmare where it is hard to get away from a pursuer. The movie continually finds creative ways to tease the audience, never resorting to red herring, that tired old convention used in almost all other slasher films.Despite the creativity in these scenes, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is still a formula movie, with relatively one-dimensional characters and no great performances. This was Johnny Depp's first role, as Heather Langenkamp's boyfriend, and although he does get a few neat lines of exposition (his speech about ""dream skills""), his personality is not fleshed out, and there is no sense of the great actor Depp would go on to become.Within the genre, however, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a fine work. My main criticism isn't its failure to transcend the formula, but its confusing and obtuse ending, apparently put there in anticipation of sequels, but managing to create a mystery that the sequels were unable to clear up. The climactic confrontation between Freddy and Nancy is weakly handled. The crucial words she says to him are surprisingly clunky, and her father's muted behavior during that scene is almost inexplicable. It has led me to consider an alternative interpretation of the scene, but one that feels like a cop-out. The scene that follows, and where the movie ends, is anticlimactic and unnecessary. These clumsily-made final two scenes come close to ruining the movie, and it is a testament to the film's many good qualities that it still stands as an unusually effective horror film that invites repeat viewings.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Changing the face of horror,"There have been many periods of film release that have had impact on film history(think ""Wizard of Oz"",""It Happened One Night"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" in 1939 or ""Close Encounters"" and ""Star Wars"" in the Summer of 1977,for examples),but one that comes to mind for me was one particular month:November,1984. That's when two somewhat under-budgeted films,James CAmeron's ""The Terminator""(which would catapult then-cult figure Arnold Scwarzenegger to super-stardom) and this film,Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". Both central characters,the eponymous Terminator and ""Nightmare"" menace Freddy Krueger would become iconic film images for decades to come.The plot line of the story's no government secret here: a handful of high schoolers in a seemingly ordinary town in Ohio are being haunted in their dreams by a grotesque figure. When this figure starts murdering each one of the group,it's up to Nancy(Heather Langenkamp),the most stable and level of the group,to ferret out and end the terror. Robert Englund,previously known from supporting character roles and his touching,gentle alien in the ""V"" mini-series and t.v.series,is able to develop a nearly permanent career as the seemingly indominable child-killer. Wes Craven would redefine his own career,as well as the slasher genre,with this film,where he had previously been known for visceral,uncomfortable shockers like ""LAst House on the Left"" and ""The Hills HAve Eyes"".Definitely worth a look,especially for those who consider themselves horror film buffs.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nightmare on Elm Street certainly delivers,"Nancy is having grisly nightmares. Meanwhile, her high-school friends, who are having the very same dreams, are being slaughtered in their sleep by the hideous fiend of their shared nightmares. When the police ignore her explanation, she herself must confront the killer in her shadowy realm.This Film Starred: John Saxon, Heather Langenkamp & Johnny Depp.A Nightmare on Elm Street was released in 1984 was written and directed by Wes Craven.In my personal opinion this was a great film, it had it's scary moments which every horror should have unfortunately they did go a bit far on a couple of the sequels which got rather low ratings on here. Not all of the sequels are bad, for example I am a fan of 3 & 4 but sequels like 2 & 5 ARE GIVING THE Freddy movies a bad name and are shadowing the excellence of this movie in particular. People seem to recognise Freddy Krueger as the burnt serial killer with knives for fingers who appeared in all them bad films. A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 is not one of them films and should be recognised as a the great movie it is. I highly recommend this film to all fans of the horror genre.****/***** Very Good.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A horror classic...,"The ""Nightmare"" has been recently on in our TV and I must admit that even after those fourteen years it made a deep impression on me. I saw the film for the first time in 1989 and at that time I was scared because I was just a teenager then. But now, I can see that the film has got something unique, which makes the film different from other horror movies. I think it`s down to the basic idea of this film - dreams and everything that can happen in our dreams sometimes become true. The authors of this film did not have to be bound with the need to stay realistic and that opens a free way to their wildest imaginations. Charles Bernstein`s music in this movie has become clasic and we can hear the basic melodic motive in some of the sequels. Original music composed by different authors in the sequels to this first Nightmare stays far far behind Bernstein`s masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) The best slasher horror film in The Elm Street series.,"I am written this review In Memorie of my all time favorite the best horror director Wes Craven that sadly is no longer with us anymore. On August 30th 2015, Craven died of brain cancer at home in Los Angeles. I am doing this for him.A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American supernatural Classic slasher horror film written and directed by Wes Craven, and the first film of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise.The best horror flick I have ever seen.I love this film to death, I love it!!! It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. It is my number 1 favorite film in the franchise it stays in my heart forever. I am a big fan of this film I even have a poster hang on door in my room, my girlfriend give it to me as gift. I love some other films of Wes Craven that he directed like are New Nightmare, Scream, Shocker,The People Under the Stairs, Scream 2 and Scream 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) for me will be always in the genre the best slasher classic horror film written and directed by Wes Craven. He gave us Freddy Krueger which was followed six sequels one crossover and one remake after success of the first film that gross $26.505.000 in USA. The sequel after the first film A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge was refused from Wes Craven to work on the film because he never wanted or intended A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) to become an ongoing franchise (and even wanted the first film to have a happy ending), and also because he didn't like the idea of Freddy manipulating the protagonist into committing the murders. The sequel for me wasn't a good movie after the original was released. My top 5 films of We Craven would be A Nightmare On Elm Street, Scream , New Nightmare, Shocker and The People Under the Stairs.The first film is so original, realistic, and overall terrifying horror classic slasher flick that is actually happening in dreams, a sociopath child killer with sharp clawed glove who has knives in stead for a fingers, can enter into your dreams. If he kills you in your dreams, you're dead for real. The main protagonist is Nancy Thompson a teenager where her friends start dying and are killed one by one from Freddy Krueger, she try's to warn people from Freddy coming in to their dreams, but no one listens to her not her father the Sheriff not her mom or her friends. Her parents hold a dark secret from her long ago. She is alone in this and she has to fight him by her self by going back in to her dreams and get Freddy out of her dream in to the real world. Nancy the character was so clever, smart and intense carefully. She was awesome unique legendary heroine did you see how she put booby-traps for Freddy? Awesome!Tina Grey played by Amanda Wyss, is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film.Heather Langenkamp is excellent in her role as the main protagonist in this film. She's legendary unique teen heroine a very attractive,and gives 100% as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares.Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger the actor's contribution to the character is 100% superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa, even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence, he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation: Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series, Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. For me Robert Englund will be the only Freddy Krueger I love him in all Nightmare films.John Saxon as Lt. Donald Thompson, Nancy's dad was fantastic in his role and his performance.Johnny Depp in his first role as Glen Lantz was awesome, I seriously loved him in 21 Jump Street TV Series and today I still love him in Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise.I love the main theme Nightmare Freddy Krueger score from Charles Bernstein and I love the song at the of the credits Nightmare by 213.A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) is the best classic slasher film,one of the best horror movies ever made. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. My number one favorite horror film in the franchise and it will always be the best one in the series. I have always enjoyed seeing this film, it is fast paced, entertaining, not boring or over long film, but short and very intense from the beginning till the end. I love this movie death. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Its reputation is a bit flattering but still a very good low budget horror film,"Every small-town neighborhood has an old legend that never dies. For the residents of Elm Street, Fred Krueger is the demonic soul that plagues their nightmares. Krueger was an evil child molester, burned alive by the parents of the children he had slain in the past. Now, years later, he has reappeared in the nightmares of Elm Street's teenagers. Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) continually experiences these haunting visions in which the permanently scarred man chases her through the shadows of a boiler room -- the same room in which he used to slay his helpless victims. Nancy considers her dreams to be typical nightmares one of her best friends is apparently ""sliced"" to death during a deep sleep in her home.Soon Nancy's dreams become worse, and her boyfriend Glen (Johnny Depp) admits that he has also been experiencing unpleasant nightmares. Together they uncover the truth behind Krueger's death years ago, and vow to stay awake as long as they can and strategize a plan to bring Krueger back into the ""real world"" and kill him once and for all.Loosely based on true events, Wes Craven's inspiration for the tale originated after he reportedly read that a number of people across the world had died in their slumber. Blending fantasy with reality, Craven wrote and directed one of the most iconic horror films of all time, which -- similar to ""Halloween"" before it -- spawned an inferior legion of sequels and imitators, all of which continue to pale in comparison to the original.The brilliance of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is that it relies on psychological fear vs. cheap exploitation tricks. ""Halloween,"" directed by John Carpenter and released in 1978, had re-sparked interest in the Hitchcock-style horror/thrillers, and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" builds upon this, cleverly channeling the mystery surrounding dreams and using it as a gateway for chills and thrills. Midway through the movie, a doctor played by Richard Fleischer tells Nancy's mother that the process of dreams -- where do they come from? -- has yet to be explained, and the fact that all humans tend to have dreams on a regular basis is essentially why this film remains so scary, even by today's standards. Some of the special effects are quite outdated but, unlike the ""Nightmare"" imitators, gore plays second to the plot and characters -- something rare in a horror film.The sequels became sillier and gorier. Fred's name changed to the less menacing ""Freddy"" (which we all now know him by), he was given more screen time, the makeup on his face was not quite as horrific, he began to crack jokes more often and his voice evolved into a less demonic cackle. In the original ""Nightmare"" it is interesting to note that Freddy is rarely given screen time at all -- we see his infamous hands (wearing gloves with butter knives attached on the fingers to slice his victims), we see his hat, we see his sweater, we see his outline in the darkness of the shadows, but even when we finally see Freddy up-close, Craven manages to keep the camera moving so that we never gain a distinct image of the killer. Now, twenty years later, there's no mystery anymore -- Freddy's face is featured on the front cover for most of the films and his very presence has become the cornerstone of all the movies in the franchise. But in 1984, long before Craven predicted his character would become a huge part of modern pop culture, Freddy was mysterious and not very funny at all.The acting is one of the film's weaknesses -- Heather Langenkamp is never totally awe-inspiring as Nancy, truth be told (although she does a decent job); Depp -- in his big-screen debut -- shows a sign of talent to come but basically mutters clich√©d dialogue most of the time. The co-stars are acceptable at best. However the greatest performance is -- not surprisingly -- by Robert Englund, as Freddy, who is in the film barely at all. Ironically, as mentioned above, this only makes the film succeed at scaring us.The direction is not as superb as ""Halloween,"" and for that matter either is the film. Over the years, ""Nightmare"" has arguably been given an overrated reputation, although it is inferior to ""Halloween."" However, compared to some of the other so-called ""horror films"" released during the '80s -- including ""Friday the 13th"" and other dumb slasher flicks -- ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" does seem to stand as one of the best horror films of the decade. Despite its flaws it is quite smart with a surprise ""final"" ending and one of cinema's greatest villains lurking at the core.""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is really Nancy's story. The film focuses on Nancy's troubles, Nancy's dreams and Nancy's actions. The ending of the film becomes a bit muddled -- the booby traps are unfortunately a bit goofy and Freddy helplessly (almost humorously) chasing Nancy around her home supposedly trying to murder her is something the film could have done without -- but overall it is a satisfying mixture of horror, thriller and fantasy, a movie that taps into two seldom-recognized everyday events in human life, which are sleeping, and dreaming. Craven's ability to realize this unknown fear in a movie is, needless to say, quite fascinating. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is not a great movie but for horror buffs it is a must-see and for non-horror-buffs there is a fair amount of other elements to sustain one's interest.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good Ideas, Poor Execution","A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the original horror movies. It contains some genuinely creepy moments, but looking at it now, it does show its age. It is a landmark film that helped usher in the ""slasher age"", but that doesn't make it a good movie.The whole concept of a monster that kills people in their dreams is a wonderfully original idea, it's only too bad that the execution is less than stellar. Wes Craven was still in his directorial infancy here, and it shows. The terrible acting doesn't help matters, but the characters really don't have anything interesting to say, either. The ending drags the film down further by not giving the film a conclusion of any kind.What's good about the picture is Freddy. Here he is a monster, plain and simple. No one-liners, just a cold-blooded killer out for revenge.In short, this is a good movie from a historical perspective. Obviously, the concept of the series is sound in order to carry through six sequels, but the direction and poor acting drag down this particular effort.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Whatever you do, don't fall asleep","A Nightmare on Elm Street, one of the scariest movies of all time, and one of the scariest in the 80's. It also introduced one of the scariest villains of all time, Freddy Krueger, one of the ultimate boogeymen that you know who he is just by his name. Wes Craven brought us one of the most terrifying ideas, what would happen if your nightmares were real? That if you died in your dream, you died in real life? He brought us A Nightmare on Elm Street, a low budget horror film that has made it huge in the horror genre's world. The whole concept of the film is just what makes it so brilliant. Not to mention how cool is it that this is Johnny Depp's first film role? Who knew that that kid was going to be so huge one day, right? But the entire cast made this into one of the scariest movies that will always bring you a few nightmares on it's own.Tina is a girl who has been having tons of nightmares about a scary figure, a man who is severely burned and has knives for fingers. She's so scared of this man that she asks her friends, Nancy, Nancy's boyfriend, Glenn, and her boyfriend, Rod to stay over. But Tina is brutally killed in the middle of the night, the only witness is her boyfriend, leaving him as the suspect of murder. But when he is murdered in jail, Nancy knows there's something wrong and soon she's having the same nightmares as Tina. Soon she knows that she might be next, no one believes her, until her mom reveals a deep dark secret about the mysterious figure, Freddy Krueger. He was a sick child molester/killer who the neighbors burned alive to keep him away, but now he's after their kids and he's not going to take it easy on Nancy.A classic horror film that's perfect for a sleep over with your friends to watch in the dark. It's such a great film that sparked quite a few sequels and a new icon for slasher films. Freddy Krueger is so cool and extremely scary just for the fact that he's so confident in knowing that he will kill you. He's ruthless, scary, and clever and he's coming to kill the kids in their dreams. A Nightmare on Elm Street is such a great film and I highly recommend it, Wes Craven is an original genius who spawned a new type of terror.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Has some cool ideas, but doesn't really amount to anything.","The best part about this movie is the whole idea that sleep can kill you in a horrible and gory fashion. Once that is established, Craven does an excellent job of making normally comforting settings such as a soft bed or a warm bubble bath seem menacing. Never before has falling asleep seemed so scary, and it gets better and better as Nancy tries to come up with a solution before she goes crazy from lack of sleep, while surviving on coffee and caffeine pills. It has a very interesting suspense to it. There is also the nicely done part where they try to apply cold hard science to Nancy's problem (""Something's wrong, the numbers are never this high!""). Very cool.Those are the good parts. The bad parts are the lame acting (excluding Johnny Depp) and the laziness of the script. It really, really hurts this movie that so little attention is paid to the parents. They are barely even IN the movie, even though the entire premise revolves around them! The backstory about these seemingly nice parents, in a quiet suburban town, viciously killing a man (child murderer or not), and keeping it a big town secret, is a neat idea that is just briefly mentioned like an afterthought (""Oh, by the way honey, all of us parents burned a man to death when you were a kid. Now go to bed, OK?""). The implication is that Freddie is getting revenge on the people who killed him by murdering their innocent children, but it's not explained or developed at all. Why is he coming back NOW, for instance? Why not earlier? And why in the world do Nancy's parents completely ignore her? If you murdered a guy years ago, and then your kid, who knows nothing about it, provides an exact description of him in her dreams, wouldn't you think there was something a bit odd going on? It would have been much cooler if they had realized Freddie was killing their kids, and there's nothing they could do about it.I also hate the ending to this movie. Why do horror movies always have to have such bizarro endings? The climactic battle at the end is awesome, but then it takes such a weird turn--(and I'm not even including the nutty twist here, I'm talking about the father NOT CARING that his wife just got sucked into a bed by a demon!)--that it totally runs out of steam and turns into a horrible, nonsensical train wreck. Roll credits.If the movie focused more on the parents, and had a decent ending, it would have been a true classic. Instead, it is a mediocre slasher flick with a few interesting elements, which is a real shame.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The original and best of the Elm Street series!,"The teenagers of Springfield, Illinois are having nightmares. Tina and her best friend Nancy learn that they're dreaming about the same creature, a hideously burned man in a dirty red and green sweater who bears an odd weapon; a glove with razor fingers. When Tina is brutally murdered in her bed one night, suspicion falls upon her volatile boyfriend Rod, who was the only other person in the room with Tina when she died. But Rod swears he didn't do it, and tells Nancy that he too has been suffering from terrible nightmares in which a knife- fingered man is trying to kill him. Nancy begins to suspect that something evil is happening within their dreams, and that perhaps the boogeyman is real. When Rod turns up dead in his jail cell, Nancy is convinced that a ghostly killer is stalking them in their sleep. Her mother, worried for Nancy's sanity, takes her to a dream clinic where her sleep patterns can be monitored. When Nancy awakens screaming from a nightmare with a bloody slash mark on her arm, she shows her mother and the doctor what she has pulled out of her dream: the battered fedora that the killer always wears. The hat bears a name tag: Fred Krueger. Nancy's mother recognizes the name and soon tells Nancy the story of a brutal child killer who had terrorized the town many years ago. When he was released on a technicality, Nancy's parents and the parents of the other nightmare-plagued children hunted Fred Krueger down and burned him alive. Fred Krueger is dead, but he's found a way to return and wreak vengeance upon the children of his killers. Nancy knows that she must find a way to stop him before he kills her and everyone else on Elm Street.I just sat down and watched this movie again the other day and it's still damn impressive. The acting isn't always the greatest and it looks just the slightest bit dated, but it's still a really damn good movie. It's power lies in the fact that sleep cannot be avoided. In so many other horror movies, the victims are nothing more than vapid cattle wandering dumbly up the slaughterhouse chute and calling out: ""Is anyone there?"" as they go up. They purposefully get themselves into stupid and dangerous situations and therefore we feel no real pity for them when they are eviscerated. However, in A Nightmare On Elm Street, all the characters have to do to endanger themselves is to go to sleep. Even the most hardcore insomniac (like myself) knows that eventually, sleep will come for you; it is unavoidable. We cannot blame our cast for wandering around doing stupid things in their dreams, because how many of us have had dreams in which we show up for work naked? Very rarely are we in control of our dreams, and in A Nightmare On Elm Street, the only person in control is Freddy Krueger.Robert Englund as Freddy is flawless. Before this movie was released, the boogeymen of horror films had always been hulking, silent, expressionless shapes usually hidden way behind masks. Not that there's anything wrong with that! But Englund gave us a new kind of Boogeyman - a smartass. Freddy is hideously burned, covered in scar tissue and has all the fashion sense of a wino, but he's cool. Not content to simply disembowel his screaming victims, Freddy has to tease them a little first, flirting, humiliating or showing off. He makes Tina watch him cut off his own fingers and smiles at her like a drunken uncle who's just pulled a coin out from behind her ear. He sticks his tongue in Nancy's mouth via her telephone. He doesn't waste his sense of humor on the guys in this film, but there's plenty of sequels in which he makes up for that.This is such a great, innovative film, filled with pretty cool special effects, disturbing sound effects (including scraping metal fingernails and baby goats bleating in terror) and creepy music. The boiler room is an especially unnerving set, complete with hissing pipes and dripping chains. A young Johnny Depp and his feathery 80s hair make their debut in this film as well, and though his character is about half a million miles away from Captain Jack Sparrow, the raw talent is still very much in evidence here.This remains the best movie of the Elm Street series, with a few good sequels and some really crappy ones. But Freddy is always worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A great classic, terrible performances.","Throughout my entire life, I have encountered countless references to ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" on television (especially in The Simpsons), so seeing it for the first time had a special spice for me.The title of this review perfectly describes this film: it is a classic, no one doubts it, but it goes no further than that, that is, a classic is not necessarily a great film, and this is the case.I think what caught my attention the most about this film is the acting, for the worse. The protagonist (Heather Langenkamp) plays a disastrous role. The rest of the cast is a disaster too. I think the only saving grace is Johnny Deep's performance, which, by the way, is not fantastic either.I wouldn't recommend or watch this movie again, but I don't think it was a waste of time either.

"Kind of cool I guess, but very poorly done","I was aware that this movie, along with the Freddy Krueger character, became a massive horror movie franchise.  I grew up in the 80s during the era of ubiquitous Freddy dolls and posters, conscious of the fact that he was in this movie and a lot of people seemed to like it, but I had never seen any of the Nightmare movies until recently.I simply don't understand why this is supposed to be a good movie; I found it barely watchable, and largely laughable.  The special effects, even given that the production team did not have the ability to use CG effects at the time, are terrible.  It is completely obvious how every single effect was done when they pop up in the movie.  Furthermore, many of the scenes contain nonsense character actions that seem to exist only to show off more crappy effects (e.g., when Freddy says, ""Watch this,"" and chops off his prosthetic fingers).The movie starts off very suddenly, with absolutely no character development.  I found it difficult to care about or sympathize with people I don't know anything about, who can't act, with ketchup squirting out of them.  I just didn't get it.The Freddy Krueger character is far too clownish and rubbery to be scary (I've read that it gets even worse in the sequels).  The annoying cheesy synthesizer music is far too present in the film, drowning out most of what could have been genuine scares.The performances in the movie are some of the worst I've ever seen.  Johnny Depp, unsurprisingly, turns in one of the less ridiculous ones, but given that this movie has almost no redeeming qualities, he has almost no lines. Heather Langenkamp is a boring, vapid heroine who clearly just can't act. She displays an extremely narrow range of emotions, from tired, to asleep, to sort of tired and angry, to somewhat scared.  Speaking of which, she seems alarmingly unconcerned when Freddy Krueger materializes out of nowhere and tries to stab her.  Maybe she's just tired.I will acknowledge that this movie seems to be more creative with the story line and visuals than those that were coming out around that time, and it's more gritty and original than a lot of the slick, boring crap that Hollywood churns out today. Other than that, this movie really isn't anything all that special.  It's not scary, it's extremely fake, and the script and performances are terrible.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A real horror classic and among the best of all time.,"This movie might very well be one of the best horror movies of all time, together with movies like ""Poltergeist"", ""Dawn of the Dead (1978)"" ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)"".I didn't expected it to be but this movie was just brilliant. Certainly the best slasher movie ever made. There are several things that make this movie a good horror classic. Of course the classic 'killer' Freddy Kruger is one of them. Another thing is the concept. Yes, the story of course is just simply ridiculous at times but it's the perfect concept to fill a movie with, with some scary scene's and brutal killings with tons of blood.The movie has the same scary gritty atmosphere like a horror movie from the 70's, when the horror genre was at an all-time high.The actors are giving their best but some of the dialog is just plain cheesy. Still I think that the actors should deserve more credit then they are getting right now, especially Johnny Depp made a impressive movie debut. The talent was already showing, back then. His role in this movie was way bigger than I expected it to be by the way.Really entertaining horror classic. Some things might look cheesy, especially the ending (I really laughed my butt off!) and the story in general but the atmosphere, gore and Kruger make up everything! Guess you have to be a fan of the genre to fully appreciate it though.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best Horror Film of the Last 20 Years,"""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is so original, realistic, and overall terrifying that it is easy to overlook the film's numerous shortcomings. The film deals with a deceased child molester who now lives only through the dreams of the children of those who cooked him to death.  Robert Englund is truly frightening as Freddy Krueger, a dark figure whose only purpose is to kill all the siblings of his killers.  The knife-styled finger glove has become a trademark of this amazing character who was created by writer-director Wes Craven.  The film goes for suspense, drama, and gore and delivers for the most part.  None of the characters are developed very well, but most do not live to see the end of the film so it really does not matter.  A great horror film that still delivers today.  Ignore the endless sequels, they each detract from this truly original and interesting film. Look for a young Johnny Depp as one of the unlucky teens.  4 out of 5 stars",,Anonymous,Horror
"Whacky, Creepy, Entertaining and Amusing; A Highlight In Definitive Horror Cinema","Looking back at the world of film in the '80s you will notice that overall it was a fairly disastrous and disappointing time for cinema. It was a time where focus was spent on money, fame and fortune, rather than talent and a decade that introduced the rise of the sequel. It was also a very popular decade for horror films, particularly slasher films and yet there are very few exceptional horror achievements from the '80s. I've never been too fond of horror as a genre. I find it a clich√©d and unproductive genre; although it is a genre that has so much going for it and when done accurately you might be lucky enough to have the pleasure a skin-crawling masterpiece. You see, horror needs imagination and originality to work; it has to blend genre elements together to craft something genuinely unique. Horror is a genre that has so much to offer. Alas, it is a sad fact when you acknowledge just how little is accomplished due to focus on spawning money-laundering, gore-filled sequels. Yet, there is something so appealing about Wes Craven's triumphant '80s classicA Nightmare on Elm Street is crafted around the now infamous ""bogeyman"" story, which has become somewhat globalising by marketing sequels and Halloween costumes. The film follows the story of a group of suburban American teens who are being stalked in their dreams by a murdered, superficial serial-killer named Freddy Krueger. So the teens decide to fight against the creature inside their dreams. The film is centred on a heroine (a popular Wes Craven trend, e.g. Scream) and oddly reminisces specific elements of John Carpenter's masterpiece Halloween.A Nightmare on Elm Street undoubtedly has its flaws, although these are flaws that are disguised by some of the truly brilliant factors that the film holds. Yes, it has become somewhat dated, yes, the young actors/actresses hold nothing special performance wise, yes, the film is at times cheesy and yes the script is extremely bland. But when you have the brilliance of a film where the editing manages to create a parallel universe, thereby the dimension of reality and dream-state are fused together (the viewer notes the film's dimension through subtleties in the direction) creating a horribly surreal and literal nightmare. A Nightmare on Elm Street is extremely intelligent in the way it wants to attack your sub-conscious. This is another method at creating a lasting fear for viewers unnerved by the actual viewing of the film and rather will be thinking about it when they are ready to fall asleep. Fact is, everyone can relate to A Nightmare on Elm Street due to the fact that everybody has had nightmares and this is the reason for it being considered (for some) a terrifying film.Filmed on a low-budget and using a mixture of dizzying camera techniques A Nightmare on Elm Street does not stop at being unique. The use of a few set-pieces and masterful props are perfect at creating the atmosphere for a horror film. There is a strong use of poignant lighting and shadow techniques scattered throughout the film. These take wonderful focus on the grotesque make-up for the iconic villain Freddy Krueger. Wes Craven uses sly editing processes and music to delve inside the film's story. The narrative has been paced at a steady speed, never feeling rushed and unnecessary meaning that you are inside the tension throughout the entire running-time. There is an amusing touch of dark comedy littered throughout the film, primarily gained from Krueger's insane antics. It really is a shame that Hollywood is obsessed with making unnecessary sequels to solid films which get away with unexpected climaxes and open endings. The American film industry seems to be obsessed by the idea of having everything wrapped up in a tight package for today's audiences.If you want a highly entertaining, influential, iconic and productive horror film then look no further than A Nightmare on Elm Street. It remains fantasy horror at the top of its game and a respectful ode to '80s cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The classic original is the best in the series.,"I love A Nightmare On Elm Street. Every time i watch this i think it has a terrific energy and strength running through it. I like the way the film starts with Freddy Kruegar making his Finger Knife Glove in his basement cellar, then the music kicks in (what a creepy score) as the first teenager is frantically running around his maze-like Boiler Room in her dream state. Freddy is only hinted at in the shadows or ripping through cloth with his glove and i love the way you can hear animals and creepy noises emitting from all around Tina, as she becomes cornered before Freddy comes out of the shadows. A great opening.Tina Grey is played by Amanda Wyss, who is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film. I always remember her character in this film the way i remember the Chrissie Watkins character at the start of Jaws, i think you know what i'm coming too. Tina's encounter with Freddy in her backyard is my favourite moment in this film, and it is one of the most horrifying deaths I've ever seen. Its frightening to see and if you are faint hearted at splashing blood then look away because it is a screamer.Heather Langenkamp is excellent in this film. Shes very attractive,and gives 100% as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares. My favourite moments with Nancy are mostly her scary encounters with Freddy scored to an energetic music beat by Charles Bernstein. I would say part of the movie's success is down to his creepy score. I also love the bathroom scene when Nancy falls asleep, absolutely gross and hilarious at the same time. The thing is, these 'funny' moments are actual imagines of how Freddy wants to prey on his victims before killing them, this is done in this first film with a measured discipline, then you watch The Dream Master and Freddy is basically killing kids while being 100% comic about it as well.One of my favourite other scenes in this film is when Nancy is following Tina's corpse down her School halls (having falling asleep)and runs into a prefect women who states 'Wheres your pass?' Nancy doesn't respond in kind, and as she goes running down the hall, the girl reveals herself to be Freddy 'No running in the hallway' an eerie moment that is funny too.Finally, special mention must go to Robert Englund as Freddy Kruegar. This actor's contribution to the character is 100% superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa, even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence, he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation: Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series, Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. Rightfully so.A Nightmare On Elm Street is a classic horror thriller and, along with Halloween, is one of the best horror movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Didn't Scare Me One Bit, But It Was Worth Watching","As for myself I was not scared of this movie, it is movies like The Hills Have Eyes and Wrong Turn Sequels that scare me. But A Nightmare ON Elm Street was fabulous and very creepy, Freddy Krueger did a fantastic job but was much included but had good step in's. The death scenes were great and really creeped me out, the story was good and they built up the suspension to whatever was gonna happen. The ending I have to say was really inventive, in fact this movie is one of the best horror flicks I have watched. But- A Nightmare ON Elm Street should improve on their settings and scenes and for the up coming NOES Remake I suggest they improve the terror, violence, scenes and add some more action into it. Other than that it really was worth watching and have already watched the second one. 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great beginning of a good horror franchise,"A legendary horror with one of the most popular slasher killers of the 80s-90s. The beginning of this franchise turned out to be more than successful, an original idea with a mysterious maniac and an atmosphere, it is in this part that the intrigue of horror is most sustained.The young cast is quite good, it was here that Johnny Depp started, Freddie has not yet become that charismatic killer with his jokes, as in subsequent parts. So far, he is more secretive and tries to instill fear in all the victims.Many people at that time were afraid to sleep after watching, nowadays it's hard to scare you with this movie, but you'll still get pleasure!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not THAT great,"This isn't a bad film. Not at all. It is a classic slasher film which contributes to the slasher genre very much. But the only thing that this film had going for it was the kills, and the dream sequences. Other than that, it just wasn't that great. The other scenes weren't that interesting. It was just, mediocre. I don't even have anything else to say.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Do not Sleep on Em Street,"On Elm Street, the teenager Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss) has a creepy nightmare with a burned man wearing a glove with blades called Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). She invites her friends Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), who had also a nightmare with Freddy Krueger, and Glen Lantz (Johnny Depp) to spend the next night with her, but her boy-friend Rod Lane (Nick Corri) appears in the house and they spend the night together. In the middle of the night, Rod awakes and sees Tina having a nightmare and being sliced. He is accused of murder and arrested by Nancy's father Lt. Thompson (John Saxon), despite the protests of his daughter. When Rod and Glen are mysteriously murdered, Nancy realizes that the only way to defeat the evil Freddy Krueger is bringing him to the real world.The classic ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is one of the best horror movies of the 80's and Freddy Krueger is my favorite villain. The story is original, very well written and directed by Wes Craven and is the debut of Johnny Depp in the cinema. As far as I know, the open conclusion was forced by the producers to give a sequel to the saga of Freddy Krueger. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Hora do Pesadelo"" (""The Hour of the Nightmare"")",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Slasher film,"Let me say i am a HUGE fan of slashers. I don't know why i do, they are just so entertaining to me. Fredy Krueger is one of my favorite slasher villains ever, but is the movie actually worth to watch? First off, i will be writing 2 reviews. one from my point of view as a fan of slasher films, and one from a open minded view.1. OK as a fan of Krueger and slasher films, i must say i love the hell out of this movie. Just the atmosphere and the creepyness of Krueger just really hit the spot. It wasn't much of a scary fim..but it still had its moments. The killing scenes were nice and gory and violent. the way Krueger scares people is also interesting. He freaks them out in there dreams until they just think nothing can happen to me...but when he kills them in there sleep they die for real. just such a brilliant idea to me. 8 stars out of 10.(remember this is coming from my fan side.) 2. OK to look at it openmindedlly. It was above average..I thought the plot of the movie was decent..nothing amazing but nothing bad. suitable for a horror movie. The cast of the movie was great. Robert did a excellent job as Krueger and it looked like he really got into the character. Everyone else in the movie did a fine job also. the lighting and effects in the movie are pretty good as far as a 1980's flick. The music was kinda weird don't really have a comment on it. The climax of the movie was eh..pretty good but not that great. I thought it was kinda rushed out. As soon as she figures out she has to bring him to the real world. the climax just hits you across the face. not in a good way. i feel as soon as the climax began, it ended at the same time. because it went by so fast. Not the best horror movie or movie of all time, but definitely worth seeing for any movie-goer.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
goofy for today's standards,"I was born in 1995, and I just had my first watch now in 2023, and for me it was a waste of time, at the time certainly was interesting judging by the nostalgic reviews but for newer audiences like me, is just goofy and cringe.It didn't feel scarier at all and the history events were predicable, some stuff just hurts any logic like, going to school the next day after your friend was murdered in a gruesome way, like c'mon... the acting was bland the characters dumb.The concept is good but poorly done and i'm not even considering the special effects that are dated (obviously) wouldn't recommend.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A true classic Horror Movie about a modern Vampire,"Do you need a big budget to make a good Horror Movie? No, Wes Craven and many other Directors of that Genre proved that more than once. From today's point of view some special effects might look a bit poor but some others are still impressive and they still stick in my mind. What I impressed more than the blood and gore scenes are the creation of a new kind of Horror figure: Freddy Krueger. In a kind he is a modern Vampire. He isn't like Bela Lugosi's or Christopher Lee's Dracula a fashionable and handsome man who tries to seduce his victims. No he is more like Max Schreck's Count Orlok of the classic Nosferatu. An ugly person you fear when you see him. Freddy Krueger doesn't suck out the blood but the sucks out the fear of his victims. He needs their fear to live and like a Cat with a Mouse he plays with his victims before he kills them. Most of them are teenager and like a Vampire he is coming into the night when all the children sleep. If one of the youngsters let him in their dream it's pretty difficult to survive for them.It's not so easy to create a horror figure. Director Wes Craven had the luck to find with Robert Englund the perfect cast for this role. Also some of the young actresses and actors are showing good performances. As Max Schreck was Count Orlok Robert Englund is Freddy Krueger. No wonder that so many sequels would follow. Next to the creation of a perfect new horror monster the whole movie follows somehow the concept of old classics. If you hear a children song in a horror movie it's always scary. The concept of the plot is like an old urban legend, myth or old classic ghost story. A young teenage girl is telling his parents that she dreamed of a monster that tried to kill her. Nobody believes her and keep on telling her it's just a nightmare. Freddy Krueger cannot come into the dreams of adults they don't have the imagination of fantasy anymore.Next to the plot I was always impressed of the style of directing and photography of A Nightmare on Elm Street. It's 80's style with contemporary music. The movie it self has a Gothic nightmarish atmosphere but Wes Craven used the colors and the look of the 1980's for it. The first A Nightmare on Elm Street Movie isn't a typical Horror Mainstream product. Wes Craven not only broke with some of the common rules of the genre he also reinvented some old classic rules of the genre into a new light. I highly recommend this piece of 80's culture to every movie fan not only the horror fans. If you don't like horror series don't watch the sequels but watch Wes Craven's Version of a Nightmare.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dated and very genre but still an effective low budget horror,"When a group of friends all have similar dreams with a weird man in a dirty red and black jumper they just think it's a bit weird. However when one of them is brutally murdered by an unseen force while she sleeps, her boyfriend Rod is arrested for the murder. Meanwhile, Nancy falls asleep in class, only to find herself chased through her dream by the same disfigured man. When it becomes apparent that this is more than a dream, more of Tina's friends start to dieWith seven or eight (who can keep track?) sequels under its belt, Freddy merchandising and the fact that the 'monster' has become almost a hero, it is hard to look back at this film with fresh eyes. This film is not the gory spectacle that teenagers with video recorders in their bedroom will have come familiar with over several flashy sequels; rather this is a low budget horror movie that is quite gory, quite scary and pretty effective. The plot is interesting enough and is better than the 'gore for gore's sake' that the sequels fell into ¬ñ it's still not the most intelligent thing you'll ever see but it is still interesting enough. Of course it is about 20 years old now and it looks dated, an effect not helped by the way recent horrors have made fun of the things in here that have become genre clich√© over the years. The downside of watching it now is that you expect it to be as 'big', 'gory' etc as the 7 or 8 sequels have progressively become ¬ñ but it isn't, it's a lot more straightforward a horror than that.Despite this though it is still a good horror movie ¬ñ low budget but yet with effective effects and a monster that has grown larger than the series itself. The cast all fit into the requirements of low budget horror, that is to say they can't really act and just scream lots. Langenkamp is a good example and, accordingly, she has done little since this film of any high caliber. Wyss, Garcia and even Depp are all pretty wooden and just fit in with the genre. Saxon puts in a better performance but even then it is only comparable. Englund is actually in the film a lot less than you would expect and, as a result, makes more of an impact. He would later take his Freddy to the level of cartoon character or celebrity (as shown in the New Nightmare) but here he gets his horror character just right ¬ñ a monster.Overall this is a good low budget horror but it is one that is difficult to view now without looking back and seeing it as the start of a long horror series that producing a character that has even moved beyond the constraints of his own film. The best way to enjoy this is on its own terms ¬ñ it is not a massive horror series, it is a single low budget horror movie from the mid-eighties; as such it suffers from the usual genre flaws from the period but it also delivers the goods in terms of scares and gore. It may not be as gory or as knowing as some of the later sequels but it does what it originally intended to do ¬ñ scare and thrill.",,Anonymous,Horror
Like Freddy Kreuger the film is iconic,"What can I say really about Nightmare on Elm Street. It has been said that it is a horror classic, Freddy Kreuger is iconic and it is an all round great film. I have to say, I agree. Is it a perfect movie? Not quite, the characters are not that well developed, but actually with everything else done so well that is a small gremlin. The film is shot in a non-cheap and atmospheric way with good editing and lighting that is never too dark or dim. The music also helps to enhance the mood without being too obvious, the script is smart, the story is compelling but what Nightmare on Elm Street really succeeds in doing is how it incorporates its scares. There is gore, but it is not used in a cheap and excessive way, and there are some genuinely suspenseful touches. The ending is surprising and very shocking. The acting is good, this is all about Nancy and she is very believably played. Johnny Depp went on to do better things but he's also fine. I'll remember Nightmare on Elm Street though for the terrifying performance of Robert Englund, Kreuger is now an iconic villain and after you see how Englund interprets him you would say justifiably so. And Wes Craven directs efficiently. Overall, the first of the series and the best and most iconic of the series. The sequels were mixed with a lot of gore and silliness and not much heart and suspense and the remake is not worth bothering with. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nightmare On Elm Street  Okay But Not Spectacular,"A Nightmare on elm street was okay but nothing spectacular. The movie is creepy with a little suspense but once you've seen one person get killed in a gruesome way you've seen them all. Writer/Director Wes Craven is admirable in making this horror movie about a dead child murderer who comes back for revenge by stalking people mostly teenagers in their dreams. Craven has shown his talent in all of his films and this is no different. Robert Englund is admirable as Freddy Kruger as the dead burned child murderer giving audiences a villain who is creepy and scary but the inevitable sequels that followed after just got old because it was the same plot all over again with his character stalking teenagers in their dreams. Englund is still effective as Freddy none the less. The rest of the cast are good including John Saxon, Ronee Blakley, Heather Langenkamp, and a young Johnny Depp in a small part but his role unfortunately gets cut short. The bloody deaths committed by Freddy are well executed but after a while they get kind of old. The lack of real scares, suspense build up which there was some but not a lot, and the dialogue at times is what weighed the movie down the much at least to me. Overall though A Nightmare On Elm Street is an okay horror thriller with some suspense and decent performances that make for a creepy but flawed film to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror's favorite neighborhood!,"The 80's biggest horror landmark was this smash-hit that brought director Craven into mainstream film and gave birth to an unstoppable horror icon!Young lady discovers that she and her friends are having the same terrifying dreams about a scar-faced maniac, who's about to transcend into murderous life!Wes Craven's biggest claim to fame, A Nightmare on Elm Street was a far more imaginative slasher film than the numerous others that flooded the 80's cinema scene. Craven's clever premise and inventively shocking story added a kind of dark fantasy element that made this film so much more engrossing (and frightening) than the average slasher flick. It also turned villain Freddy Kruger into the biggest horror icon since the monsters of 50's horror cinema. Craven's direction is truly great, giving this film plenty of feverish atmosphere, tight suspense, and a share of good scares! Adding even more to the movie is the occasional touch of dark humor, who could ever forget that 'tounge phone' bit. The movie also has lots of gruesome special FX as well. The Elm Street theme by Charles Bernstein is a nicely chilling touch too.The cast is quite good. Heather Langenkamp makes for a terrific and likable heroine. John Saxon and Ronee Blakley are both great as Langenkamp's disbelieving parents. Amanda Wyss, Nick Corri, and Johnny Depp (in his debut role) are also great as some troubled Elm Street youths.

A masterpiece of modern horror! Still the best in the series!,"After such gruesome drive-in flicks as ""The Last House on the Left"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" master of horror Wes Craven wanted to make a movie that would bring the slasher genre back to life, since the genre was clouded by untalented, unoriginal films that shouldn't have been made. So, along came ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" To this day, Craven's masterpiece of modern horror is the movie that elevated the horror genre. Avoid the awful sequels that followed it. The first ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie is still the scariest and most effective movie in the series.The story revolves around four teens in the town of Springwood: Nancy Thompson, Tina Gray, Rod Lane and Glen Lantz. All four have had horrifying dreams involving a terribly burnt boogeyman in a red and green sweater and a brown fedora on his head with extremely sharp blades for fingers. Sure, they're just dreams. But not until Tina is graphically murdered in her sleep. No weapon was found, but there were four long cuts in Tina's chest. The rest of the group soon finds out that it is the Springwood maniac Freddy Krueger that is haunting their dreams. None of them are safe. If they fall asleep, they will meet their gruesome demise. Now it's up to Nancy to stop Freddy once and for all. But how can she stop somebody that isn't supposed to be real?""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" created a terrifying villain, a plot that is very original, and a group of characters that you care about. Everybody knows who Freddy is, just like everyone knows who Michael Myers is, or Jason Voorhees, or Leatherface. He is now one of the most iconic slashers in horror cinema.One of the things that I admire the most is the cast. Heather Langenkamp is an awesome heroine. Nancy is one of the girls in the genre that fought the villain and didn't run. Langenkamp creates a suburban teenage girl that is filled with pizazz and wit, which she has the most of out of all the characters. In a very brief performance, Tina is played by Amanda Wyss of the hit comedy ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High."" Her character's death is uncomfortable and disturbing to watch. Craven shows no mercy during Tina's death, not having an ounce of the scene edited. He makes you watch all of it, and that creeps the viewer out even more. Nick Corri is a very good rebel. And you'll also notice Johnny Depp in his first big movie as Glen. His death is second best.Nancy's parents, Donald and Marge Thompson, are played by John Saxon of ""Black Christmas"" and Ronee Blakely of ""Nashville."" They are the last of the parents on Elm Street to hold a very dark secret about Freddy, something that they aren't telling Nancy or the others. Not such a good idea, since Freddy never seems to leave them alone.I can't imagine anybody else playing Freddy other than Robert Englund. Englund is flawless in the role that made him a star. This is where Englund is scariest as Freddy. In the sequels, Freddy becomes a comedian with rather stale wisecracks. What makes Freddy so scary in the first ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie is how his dark, macabre sense of humor comes off as frightening. And he's always there, wherever you are. ""Since he's a dream figure, he can basically do anything,"" says critic Aviva Briefel. ""He can transform into anything. That's what makes him so scary. How can you resist sleep? He's everywhere."" If horror movies got nominations, Englund would be first in line to win the award.Craven's direction is perfect. He films ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" with a great amount of flair and he provides plenty of gore that will satisfy gore-hounds and enough scares to make you jump.The verdict: ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" still holds up as one of the scariest horror movies ever made. And people are always going to remember it. When kids are off to summer camp or they want their parents to tell them a scary story before bed, they most likely will hear about Freddy Krueger and his razor-blade glove. Nightmares are guaranteed.

This actually passed for horror in the 80s...,"I guess this was considered horror back in the 80s but looking at it today it's really more of a comedy. I heard stories from people growing up with these movies claiming they were afraid to fall asleep in fear of getting murdered while they were sleeping.. Which I find rather hard to believe. I get that you didn't have a lot to choose from back then, maybe it was original for it's time and maybe it gave people nightmares but it's painfully outdated.. And the acting is not particularly impressive. I will admit, Freddy's one liners are pretty amazing and Robert Englund does a good job portraying him but I fail to see the scary part.. It's actually pretty funny and it had me laughing hard at times.. For the wrong reasons thoA Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic regardless of my point of view but it's hard to take it seriously in this day and age.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Luckily, there weren't any bruises or cuts on me before leaving to school the next day.Starting on my review.Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is about a group of kids led by Nancy (Heather Lagenkamp) where her friends have one thing in common: They see the same guy in their dreams. Freddy Krugger looks like a burned piece of meat after coming out of the fire where he wears a red and green stripe sweater and has long knives as fingernails and chases his victims when they're asleep giving them a souvenir. One night, Nancy invites her friends for a sleepover where one of them is brutally attacked by the monster himself where nobody believes Nancy or her pals about the incident.To this day, A Nightmare on Elm Street scares the living crap out of me where every night before I go to bed, I try to tell myself that it's only a movie.Sweet dreams, everybody!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Come to Freddy...,"There really are, when you come to think of it, not that many films that are truly frightening. The kind of film that gets under your skin and eats away at you. The kind of film that stays with you days ( and nights ) after you see it. There certainly aren't any that come to mind from the 90's. But along with films like Aliens the first Halloween, The Exorcist, Angel Heart, Last House On The Left and the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the first Nightmare is terrifying. And that is owed all to Wes Craven. The sequels of this film are really trash and that is because Robert Shaye may be a good business man but he certainly does not know how to see to it that The Nightmare series stayed it's course and kept viewers on the edge of their seat. The sequels became more comedic than scary and even though Freddy had a personality in the first one, he was still more diabolical and evil than he was funny. More Lon Chaney than Jerry Lewis. But the first one has every element in it to keep you scared beyond belief.This film is iconic in many ways. There are those that say it is dated. I beg to differ on that point. This is a film that transcends generations and expertly amalgamates gore and tension. When you think of all of the so called horror films that have come out in the last year or so, many of them try to enthrall us with buckets of blood and special effects, but they forget that with a horror film, you must have an element of fear with it. Nightmare on Elm Street captures that better than most, and is on a level with the all time greats.Fred Krueger, as we all know, was a child molester who was hunted down by the local Elm Street parents after he beat a court systems on a technicality. They trapped him in his basement and lit his house on fire and then watched him burn. Somehow he comes back and haunts their children's dreams and murders them while they sleep. This sets up the premise of the film and it is stated on the SE DVD that Craven got the idea for this film while reading a story in an Asian newspaper about kids dying in their sleep and telling their parents that they knew something bad was going to happen to them in their dreams. It is an interesting concept and because it is done to perfection here, it has now become one of the cornerstones of American horror.Wes Craven has been revitalized as a master of modern horror with his very commerically successful Scream series, and as much as I love Scream, it is horror lite when comparing it to his efforts like NOES, LHOTL and The Hills Have Eyes. Those films, and Nightmare in particular, revolutionized ther horror genre. Nightmare on Elm Street is his best film and if you forget how truly scary the film is after viewing all of the inferior comedic sequels (with the exception of the last) view this one. Freddy is a horror icon and he has achieved that status because he is the true definition of fear.10/10 One of the 10 best horror films ever!Come to Freddy!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wes Craven's Breakout Film,"A group of friends (including Johnny Depp) all have the same nightmare: a man with claws and a Christmas sweater is trying to kill them. Unfortunately, the man is not just some bad dream: he is Freddy Krueger, and if you die asleep, you die forever.This is Wes Craven's big break. His earlier films, particularly ""Last House on the Left"", may have been better, but this is the one that grabbed everyone's attention and today even those who haven't seen a single ""Nightmare"" film know who Freddy Krueger is: this film made Craven a master, and established a horror movie icon.With one exception at the end, the special effects are also top notch for the time period. Bodies thrown into the ceiling, blood geysers spraying like mad. The makeup and costuming isn't bad, either... Freddy's burnt face gets even nastier when he starts to bleed maggots.Mike Mayo is a bit cynical when he says, ""Because his powers are so elastic, this little moneymaker can be killed and resurrected as long as he stays in the black."" This is, of course, very true... at this point Krueger seems limitless, and even his origin is vague. Exactly how much sway this had over producers, I do not know. I can't see Craven in the office arguing that the film has sequel potential, especially since this was New Line's first major release.If you see only one Wes Craven film, I guess I have to say make it this one. ""Last House on the Left"" and ""Hills Have Eyes"" are stronger, more edgy films, but they have not had half the cultural impact as ""Nightmare"". It is no exaggeration to say this film is a part of American history.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror Cinema Gold,"By the late 70s and early 80s, the slasher film genre was at its peak. With then-new special effects, they were always sure to have the audience on the edge of their seats. In this genre in particular, you had the Father (Michael Myers of Halloween), the Son (Jason of Friday the 13th), and last and most importantly, the Holy Spirit; none other than Freddy Krueger of A Nightmare on Elm Street.A Nightmare on Elm Street is on a slightly different level than the other gory slasher films of the 80s. It delves into a different part of the viewer's psyche that a lot of other films have ignored. Freddy, our villain, is as gruesome as our other horror movie monsters, (although he's acquit with slightly more witty banter) but he can only attack you one way--- in your dreams.Having the dreamworld as Freddy's playground is one of the smartest, and scariest ideas film maker Wes Craven could have come up with. Sleep is a thing that all humans have to do, no matter how hard we try to stay awake. Caffeine and cold showers can only take you so many days before you eventually drift off into slumber, where a real-life nightmare awaits you.As far as the acting goes in this film, you can't get any better for a number of reasons. Freddy's (Robert Englund) sly and sometimes perverted remarks bring a sense of comic relief into the script, a thing many other horror films don't have. Also, this was Johnny Depp's first role in a feature-length film. And let me tell you, the 17 year old Johnny made being torn in two look pretty realistic. Our heroine of the film, (Heather Langenkamp) played a very believable, strong role. She made the audience root for her the whole way through, and made viewers feel her frustration when no one would believe her about her night stalker.Along with a great musical score that made The Nightmare on Elm Street theme famous, a great cast, and a very talented director, Nightmare is safety one of the slasher genre's greatest films. With six sequels to follow, a television show, and various merchandise, it is obvious that this was one of horror's biggest franchises. With its cult following, this movie will be loved for generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Inventive entry into the horror genre,"Sleep is an essential part of life; it allows our bodies and our minds to relax and recharge for the next day. It is also the time when we are the most vulnerable. When we are asleep, we are blissfully unaware of what is going on around us. Wes Craven's landmark horror film, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" takes advantage of this often overlooked part of life and uses it in unusual and effective ways.Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) is your average sixteen year old girl. She's got good friends and a great boyfriend. But when her friend Tina (Amanda Wyss) is brutally murdered, and her boyfriend Rod (Jsu Garcia) is arrested for it, Nancy's world is turned upside down. However, Tina had a nightmare the night before she died, the same one that Nancy and Rod had. As her friends keep turning up dead, Nancy begins to realize that there is someone who is killing her friends in their dreams, and what happens in their dreams, happens in real life.This all sounds highly convoluted, which it is, but Craven explains it pretty thoroughly. The premise is golden, and Craven, never one to shy away from taking risks, exploits it for all it's worth. The crossing of this boundary opens up a lot of possibilities, not only for the staple events in a horror movie (gruesome and inventive murders), but some philosophical questions about this given boundary.Unfortunately while the film can boast a highly original premise and story, it's not that scary. Maybe it's because it's not particularly well-acted. Amanda Wyss and Jsu Garcia aren't particularly good thespians, even within the broad constraints of the genre. Heather Langenkamp is solid as the spunky heroine. For once, the heroine of the horror film isn't as dumb as a brick or supremely wimpy. She's brave, and more importantly, pretty smart. Johnny Depp shows us a glimmer of his talent as her boyfriend, Glen. Ronee Blakely is okay as Nancy's mom, who knows more about what's going on than she's telling. However, the real star of the show is not Robert Englund (who is very creepy as the film's sadistic villain, Fred Krueger), but John Saxon. Saxon is great as Nancy's sympathetic, but incredulous father. He acts just the way a normal father would act in the given situation.Wes Craven is known as the Master of Horror. While he's made a number of solid horror movies, I don't agree with that statement. His films are engaging and competently made, but they aren't all that frightening. The one thing that Craven has that no one else does is a penchant for taking risks. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" doesn't follow the slasher film formula (in fact, this is just a horror film, and not a member of the slasher genre).It's recommendable because it's a spooky story with a few shocks and tense moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
More creative than the average horror flick.,"OK, Ronee Blakely's acting is more like something out of an Ed Wood movie, but ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is truly a horror classic. Specifically, it's more creative than most of them, due to the fact that Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) has to go inside peoples' dreams to kill them. His blade-fingers are like a character in and of themselves. This is one movie that no horror-fetishist can afford to miss. One day, I think that we're all going to look back on these horror classics like we nowadays look back on the sci-fi/horror flicks of the '50s and early '60s. Just try and go to sleep after watching this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The movie that makes you terrified of falling asleep,"It's been over a decade since and when I saw Jason X and Freddy vs Jason. As a kid then, I was more pulled with the action and violence rather than the story. So of these two slasher villains, it's been Jason I was fond of. I grew up. Watched many movies. It was recent that I decided to get back to my roots, to know more of these villains. So I watched all the Friday the 13th movies first. And recently, the first of A Nightmare on Elm Street, and wow. ANoES is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Immersive. Very atmospheric. The story is focused. The imagery nightmare material. The score relentlessly terrifying. A slasher movie done right, I didn't feel annoyed by the characters at all, partly because of the screenplay itself but the acting did it for me too. I do not want to spoil things for people yet to discover the movie so I would say this vague: the scene where the blood gushed profusely, and rather in an exaggerated way from the hole in the bed to the ceiling just added to the overall darkness of the tone of the film. Usually, exaggeration is off-putting when exaggeration is not the name of the game, but not that. And it was only now that I appreciated Wes Craven and only now that I learned I've watched some of his movies already - Scream and Scream 2 which are both very good too. I just don't think that ANoES can be topped by any of its sequels. But I will still watch them. I crave for more.I also noticed Heather Langenkamp who played Nancy in the movie really looked like Lily James. Lily James has played several period movie characters. Nice.I am more of 21st century movie guy but this one has aged so well the movie still holds up to this day. This is one of the movies that make me want to watch movies older than me.I wish I could have watched this as a kid so I would have gotten more terrified by nightmares then. I'm an adult now. I will just make sure to have it watched by the kids in the family. They like scary movies and I'm sure this will spook them up.One, two Freddy's coming for you / Three, four Better lock your door / Five, six Grab your crucifix / Seven, eight Gonna stay up late / Nine, ten Never sleep again",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A nice horror film...,"A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET Starring: Heather Langenkamp, Johnny Depp, Amanda Wyss, Jsu Garcia, Robert Englund, ...Plot: The killer Fred Krueger (Robert Englund) appears in the dreams and he kills the people who see him in their dreams. A teenager girl, Nancy (Heather Lngenkamp), wants to stop him, but that is so difficult...My opinion: That film is one horror low-budget movie from 80s and I think that is the best one, after ""Friday the 13th"". I had scared when I saw it. It has some very scary scenes. The best part of the film is the only one Freddy (Robert Englund) who is the best!!!! Freddy Krueger is the best killer I have ever seen and here is really good. So I put on ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" 10 out of 10. See that film. Trust me is really good. And I suggest and the sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sleep Tight...,"The best thing about A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET is its originality. When it came out there was nothing else like it. Director Wes Craven had fashioned a whole new type of slasher movie with a supernatural twist. Like Don Coscarelli before him (in PHANTASM), Craven overlaps dream and reality to mind-bending effect! The nightmare sequences are actually terrifying, especially one involving Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) and her friend, Tina (Amanda Wyss) at school.There are also some incredibly innovative scenes full of gory events that are impossible to forget! Some of the deaths are downright spectacular! Even those who don't care for such scenes must admire the work that went into creating them.Unlike the mindless murderers in other such films, Fred Krueger (Robert Englund) is a sly, haunting specter who stalks his prey in their sleep. He is terrifying, and nothing like the one-liner-spewing comedian he would become in the sequels. Nancy is not the usual female fodder either. She's smart and able to come up with ways to fight her nemesis.Co-stars a young Johnny Depp as Nancy's boyfriend, Glen.Easily one of Craven's best efforts...",,Anonymous,Horror

"She is the only one who can stop it... if she fails, no one survives.","A repulsive, decaying figure with razor-sharp appendages suddenly appears in the dreams of four Los Angeles teenagers. It is the ghost of Freddy Krueger, a suspected child murderer killed long ago by the neighborhood parents. Now he's able to exact his bloody vengeance by killing the teens off, one by one, as they sleep. Finally, just one girl remains. Desperately, she tries to stay awake by every means possible, but even pills and massive amounts of coffee wear off sometime and when they do, she'll have to battle Freddy for her very life. It's her worst nightmare...and it's coming true.I would like to apologize firsthand that I'm around 25 years late in seeing this film because I should have seen it a whole lot sooner, but what can I say? Anyway, ANOES is one of those films that could have been a classic with some other horror films if it were not some producers messing around with the director's true vision. Yes, in fact, producer Robert Shaye made director Wes Craven change the ending for this film (which I will certainly not spoil to you in this review). However, I shouldn't be all that scathing to Mr. Shaye because, after all, he was the one who helped Craven bring this project about and without him, we'd probably not have a franchise nor an iconic villain named Freddy Krueger to this day.The film has a very low budget and it could be seen throughout the film through the shoddy visual effects. However, I must admit, Craven knows how to use money because some effects in here seemed like a lot of money to be pulled off. What may seem like $20 million to make is, in reality, only $2 million. With that low of a budget, the film surprisingly pulls a lot of things off. The look of Freddy is quite frightening, I must admit, as opposed of his ""cleaned up"" look in the later sequels, with an exception of part 7. The theme is also haunting and very notable to this day.As for the story itself, it's very genius and original. Who would have ever thought of a guy who can kill people in their dreams? It's fantastic! The film does a great job at confusing the audience with dream and reality, one of the key things that makes the series successful and unique to other slasher films. Heather Langenkamp is the heroine in this film. She pulls off a sympathetic role for the audience to root for. Robert Englund plays the iconic villain, Freddy, and plays it perfectly, giving plenty of witty one-liners and scares, sometimes at the same time!But where ANOES starts to fall down the hill is when it gets closer to the third act, where everything goes almost berserk and where many inconsistencies start springing up, where dream and reality cross one another. It's quite confusing. However, I got it after another viewing. But the worst part of the film is the ending. It really is that bad, and bumps the film one or two points. The ending ruins the whole point of the film and I can tell why Craven is angry. Oh, well. At least Craven got success out of it. If you're a horror fan, you must see this film because it has a franchise for a reason.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Very Clever Horror Movie,"This movie is much different from other horror movies because it's more about the story and mystery and less on pointless killings.in some pointless horror movies I think to my self when pricks get slashed d by an obvious killer I say ""yeah sure there getting killed but gives a cares"". But in Nightmare on elm street is clever psychological suspense. By 1984, the slasher genre was wearing thin. Halloween bombed out with number 3, and Friday the 13th was falling into the dreadful mix of completely clich√© horror. Without A Nightmare on Elm Street, that could have been it for the slasher film. With it, however, the genre was brought off the respirator for another 10 years when Craven did it again with Scream, but I digress. Wes Craven delivers a very original, creative, and well played out horror film that has the perfect level of plot, fright, gore, and imagination. The balance of these elements is key, as it gives you the best of all of them, without becoming too clich√©, too bloody, or too silly.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

More than a slasher movie,"Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss), Rod Lane (Jsu Garcia) and Glen Lantz (Johnny Depp) are all high school friends hounded by a serial killer named Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) with a bladed glove in their dreams.

Nancy's police detective father (John Saxon) investigates but it's beyond his power to help.Wes Craven created something more powerful than a simple brute killer like his compatriots. This is a serial killer of the imagination. Freddy Krueger doesn't simply slice and dice. He comes for you in your own mind. It is my favorite horror franchise of that era. The ideas are bounded only by the imagination and more importantly the budget. The other great thing is that Robert England is able give the character some personality.

Nancy kick ass! Finally a character who fights back.,"Nancy kick ass! Finally a character who fights back! I am so tired of horror film where everyone dies at the end and all that really happens is that they get massacred. The main character in this movie: Nancy Thompson deserves the title heroine in my opinion. There are few good horror movies where people fight back and this is one of them.Being a big fan of John Carpenter I felt Wes Cravens film where worth checking out, and so far I'm not disappointed. i think most of you 70's and 80's horror fans noticed the same thing like me; this kinda reminds me of John Carpenters ""Halloween"". The lead role is a few years younger and Michael Meyers is replaced with Freddy Krueger an equally creepy bogeyman-ish character.Of course like all horror movies is write reviews about I note that these are not for the faint of heart. It scared the hell out of me, that's for sure. And it may freak you out even more, I just wan't to make clear it's R rated for a reason, so don't show to anyone under 13 or 14 (it's not that bad, just don't show it to a child).PS.MINOR SPOILERS: You may be a little confused at the end, but remember, it's just a dream.

Horror films classic!,"I watched ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" last night and...Oh my God,how good it is! I thought ""Where were I earlier?!"". It is good in spite of its age. As we all know, old films - good films. Believe me, I have seen a lot of horror films and I think that ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" is worth attention. You know,I can confess that there were some times which made my heart to beat intensively than theretofore. I was surprised how professionally actors were acting in spite of the fact that it was the first time for Johnny Depp! The plot was intense and I love it. There is one feature of good horror film - restlessness about characters. And You know, when I was watching this film, You don't know how much I was worrying about them, especially about Nancy. ""What's now? No,Freddy, don't!"" and so on... Second feature of good film is unexpected ending. I really didn't expect an ending like this.

One of my favorite movies to watch around Halloween,"To tell you guys the truth, I didn't see this movie until last week (1/24/2014) And I just fell in love with it. The creepy atmosphere, the story, the characters and even everybody's favorite killer, Freddy Kruger. Played by Robert Englund 8 times throughout the course of the series. There was even a TV show, called Freddy's Nightmares. Freddy was always the character that steels the show. In the first movie, he was scary, but as the series went on, it become more like a comedy then a horror series. The Story in the movie, is (I think) told really well. The movie kinda reminds me of Halloween (1978) almost. How to movie takes place in a suburban atmosphere, with a bunch of teenagers. In this movie though, the teens are not throw away characters. These characters, I actually like. well anyway, the story is pretty good, the characters are awesome, the acting is pretty good, Freddy's my favorite villain in film. everything about this movie is pretty good. It's not the best movie ever made, but it's one of my favorites to watch around Halloween.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""One, Two, Freddy's Coming For You...""","Of the time, there where three slashers that where popular with pop culture and still are today: Micheal Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Fred Kruger. A Nightmare On Elm Street is about the clever, scary Freddy. Not only is Freddy more clever than Jason Voorhees as a killer, but A Nightmare On Elm Street is done a whole lot smarter that any Friday the 13th film. However, A Nightmare On Elm Street was lacking the true suspense that Halloween gave. Nightmare DOES have quite a few good jump scenes. It is also very atmospheric, and never really stops being scary due to atmosphere. There are a few gore scenes, but none are gross. The gore content is high, though. Higher than Friday the 13th and MUCH higher than Halloween.A Nightmare On Elm Street is about a group of kids who are starting to have nightmares. These are however, not normal nightmares. All these dreams are about is this strange, burnt man who chases after this group of teens. These nightmares seem to be too real to be mere dreams, but that's all they could be... right?A Nightmare On Elm Street stars Robert England, Heather Langenkamp, Amanda Wyss, Jsu Garcia, and for the first time ever, we see Johny Depp on screen. Each actor did a good job with their performance, but I felt that there was something missing with the character chemistry. This may be due to acting problems or due to a poor script/storyline. However, the viewer wouldn't be worried about the actors performances. The viewer would more likely be terrified, so the chemistry doesn't take away from the movie for first time viewing. However, re-watching can be a bummer.Now here we come with the other cons: Wes Craven's directing. I'm going to be honest with you guys. I have never been a fan of any of Wes Craven's films (especially Scream.) He did an above average job on A Nightmare On Elm Street, but it's still nothing phenomenal. But then again, first time viewers wouldn't care about the directing. All they would care about is the constant scares.Another thing that disappoints me about this movie is the inability it has to impress people the 3rd or 4th time they view it. I have viewed A Nightmare On Elm Street 4 times now, and each time it louses some of its mystique. I have not watched it for several months now, and I do not intend on watching again for at least one more month. I want to forget about pieces of the movie, so I can be scared by it again. A Nightmare On Elm Street is a truly frightening movie, but once the viewer has all of the scares figured out... what's left?One more thing I would like to mention is about how terrible the sequels are. The sequels are all either silly or poorly done. Those are however, different reviews.So overall, I recommend giving a Nightmare On Elm Street a rent. It's a good movie, especially for a first time viewing. However, re-watching can be a true bummer.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I adore Fred Krueger,"Sure, this may not be a great topic to bring up, but I just love the character of Fred Krueger. He comes off as one of the best sympathetic villains in film history for me (or well, the best undead one). Michael Myers is too much a mystery for me to understand (I hate the sister theory the series introduced. Personally, I prefer to think he was confused on who Laurie was and figures it was his sister back from the dead), Jason is just Michael on steroids, his mother was a failed villain and Cropsey, though sad, is too mean to be truly appreciated. Freddy though, he has so much going for him! In the TV series Freddy's Nightmares, the first episode shows him as a living human being. He always comes off as being a bit crazy/depressed to me, being a total creep yet still likable. In every movie, he had an amazing body language that just screams that he's cocky, confident and ready to tear up everything in his path.Maybe it's Robert Englund that I really like here...",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Slasher Films can be Done Well Too,"The most terrifying situations that most people experience are nightmares. They can happen even if you are in the safety of your home and since the rules of reality do not apply to them, they can take any turn. And since they are in your own head, there is no escape. What can be worse than such a nightmare coming true? This movie adopts this premise literally. A group of parents murder a serial child killer, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). He exerts revenge on them by haunting their children in their dreams. What these kids experience in their dreams is parallely happening to them in reality...Freddy Krueger is an iconic villain today and he has spawned numerous sequels and cross-overs, all for good reason. He has a plausible back- story which is frightening even in real life. His mode of operation in unique. His weapon is a clawed glove, simple yet so scary. He steals the show and possibly even the audience's night-time visions with a mere seven minutes of screen time.The film does not rely much on jump scares though there are a few. It creates a tension-heavy atmosphere and plays more on psychological fear. The narrative is simple and coherent. For those who want to see gore, there is some of that too.The film suffers from two major drawbacks. First, most of the acting is hammy especially by Langenkamp. But, this could be due to the fact that it is a slasher film, a genre not well-respected and it is of low budget. They could probably not afford the right kind of actors, though they roped in the then unknown Johnny Depp. Second, the ending looks like a cheap trick to exact one last scare from us and/or pave way for a sequel. I read that the director, Wes Craven wanted to have a different ending and was persuaded to alter it by the producer, Shaye. Craven's idea sounds much better and he should have stuck to that.

What a big Nancy!,"A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) -I had to watch this film in the afternoon, because even after all these years it still petrified me, like the big Jesse that I am.I personally think that the effects in some of the older films were the most creepy, perhaps because they had to try harder, but Freddy Krueger will always be a source of terror for me. The way I sleep, he would get to me in seconds and my dreams are weird enough that he would easily find a way in.There was some really bad acting, Nancy and her Mum being the worst culprits of that, with Johnny Depp being the only actor to show any real ability at all. I'm actually surprised that Nancy played by Heather Langenkamp ever got acting work again or Ronee Blakley as her Mother for that matter, she was a proper Barbie doll and just as fake.It's also annoying after all these years, that it's still always a girl in the central role and actually Mr. Depp in the same lead position could have delivered a much better interplay with Freddie and provided a bit more of a back and forth in defending himself, while Nancy should have been killed off in the first act.And although they were good enough to frighten me, the special effects were not generally that good at all. There is one point where someone (Obviously a mannequin and not even flexible at that) gets pulled through the window of a door which actually had me laughing out loud and the scene where Nancy was on the phone and Freddy says ""I'm Your Boyfriend Now Nancy!"" makes me giggle hysterically every time, because of the tongue effect.And to be fair, the pathetic way that Nancy ran, she deserved to get caught and at times I found myself on Freddie's side in the hope that he would stop all of their whining.As a horror film I thought that this one was still very relevant, even after nearly 40 years. I don't like scary movies and Fred in particular, but I could see why this has always been regarded as such a classic.It is a shame that they never repeat any of the further instalments on TV, because I definitely don't want to pay to watch them, but it would be interesting to see just how well they progressed or how badly they degraded with each chapter.It would probably be classed ""Of it's time"" for a new generation of viewers, but for those of us that were born when this film was released, it still had a certain sadistic thrill to it.700.56/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Deservedly iconic horror,"Despite the final minute threatening to derail everything that's come before, A Nightmare on Elm Street is still a horror film that definitely deserves its iconic status in pop culture. A smart, inventive and unsettling horror film.Heather Langenkamp gives an incredible lead performance, definitely one of the best and most satisfyingly active final girls. Robert Englund is terrific as Freddy Krueger, his scary presence and design made all the more effective by the fun he's clearly having.Wes Craven's direction is excellent, there's plenty of energy and pace and clever set pieces that still hold up quite well. The special effects are impressive and the music by Charles Bernstein is effectively creepy.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A horror fans dream,"Towards the end of the seventies and beginning of the eighties, we were blessed with some great horror films that have become cult classics today. First off there was Halloween, that introduced us to Michael Myers. Secondly was Friday the 13th which gave birth to Jason Voorhees. Next came A Nightmare On Elm Street which unleashed a demon into our dreams in Freddy Kruger. Looking back on this film now, after having Freddy Kruger being a huge horror villain as I grew up, I see that in the very first film he is nothing like he is interpreted today. The sequels seem to have ruined the character slightly as in the first film he is frightening, unpredictable and kept in the dark for most of the film, leaving you anticipating his next move. There are none of the wise cracks that he is resembled with today, and he is nothing like the version we saw in the 2010 remake.For those who don't know, the film follows a girl called Nancy (Langenkamp) and her group of friends. One by one they begin to have nightmares, each involving the same man, Fred Kruger. This man is heavily scared, wears a hooped red and green jumper, a tatty hat, and has knives for fingers. As the group begin to realise they are dreaming of the same guy one of the girls is killed in her dream by Fred Kruger, which kills her in real life. Shown in a fantastic scene where this poor girl is dragged across the ceiling, blood spilling from her but no other person in sight. Once this girl is killed her boyfriend becomes the main suspect and he has no way to prove his innocence. The only one that believes him is Nancy, who has now started to have these nightmares more frequently, and finds herself attempting to stay awake for days on end in order to avoid her nightmare. Once the truth about Freddy is revealed she devises a way to finally bring a stop to her nightmare and sets up a trap involving her boyfriend (Depp) to finish Kruger once and for all.What makes this stand out from other horror films of its time is that it explores the notion of dream against reality. At times during the film you are unaware of which reality we are in and this really adds to the visuals of the film, especially when we see Freddy's destruction in reality and he isn't even there. We are also introduced to another horror icon who doesn't remain silent throughout, and walk like a machine hell bent on death. We have a killer insistent on laughing at the poor children he is tormenting, and one that also looks feeble in comparison to other icons. He may not be as scary as Michael Myers but something about Freddy Kruger really sends a shiver down your spine.Considering the film was made nearly thirty years ago, it is still pretty scary. Scenes that show a blood soaked girl calling out from inside a body bag is chilling, and when she is dragged around the room is incredibly disturbing and one you won't be able to shift from you minds.Other scenes however aren't as scary and can look a little comedic, but I think that is due to the low budget and standard of film making back then.Robert Englund, who plays Freddy, is brilliant in this film. He brings the character to life and I'm sure would scare children if they watch this film. The make up for him is brilliant and his costume is now very iconic. Langenkamp unfortunately is not great in her role as Nancy, and it is her kind of performance that stereotypes today's horror female leads as poor actors. Her delivery of lines at times is amateurish which makes you struggle to route for her. Really all you want to see when you get into the film is Kruger. Depp is average in his performance, and it is hard to see the Depp of today in his performance here.The film is full of clich√©s but you can over look these as horror in the eighties was designed like this. To watch it now you would cringe or roll your eyes at the character decisions to venture into the dark due to a noise, but when this was made that was brand new and wasn't as frowned upon. There are some scenes which are bad though and can't use the excuse of when it was made. One scene Nancy manages to set up a house full of booby traps in ten minutes, which includes setting a sledge hammer up above a door. There would not be enough time to set this up and certainly not if she had to find the items to use as well. Also she lives alone with her mother, what use would they have for a sledge hammer. It is parts like that in movies which is really frustrating. Also the ending disappointed me. I know it was supposed to be a twist but it didn't really make sense with the rest of the film. This ending also shows the worst piece of special effects on show.All in all I can see why this is a classic. We are introduced to a new villain, and asked to believe in the notion of dreams being real. To look at it now it isn't as good as it would have been thirty years ago, but it is still better than the poor remake. The poor effects of this film really do add to the suspense of it all. Halloween this is not, but an influential horror film it certainly is.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Whatever you do... don't fall asleep!""","Wes Craven's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' (1984) is a horror classic about a mysterious, clawed killer tormenting a group of teenagers by making it into their dreams.Talk about an intense and deeply unsettling horror film!
'A Nightmare on Elm Street' introduces us to one of the most iconic horror film villains of all time, Freddy Krueger!
This is one of those movies that can make you have nightmares or even make you afraid of falling asleep!This film has plenty of things in it that I can truly appreciate.Let's talk about the great villain Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund)! I genuinely really like so many elements about the character. His cool look, his menacing face and claws, his deep and scary voice, the fact that he haunts people in their dreams and the vicious way in which he kills them. This is why Freddy Krueger works so well! It is also because people have control of themselves when they are awake, however when they dream, they lose that control and are trapped in a dream which makes our villain even scarier! Freddy Krueger just has this great effect on the audience because they cannot figure out how you beat someone that kills you in your sleep through your dreams!
The composer Charles Bernstein did a great job with his soundtrack for this motion picture! Bernstein's soundtrack has really become iconic in the film fan community! The way he uses his music to exemplify a speciific situation and to emphasize as well as enhance the danger makes the entire experience so much more worthwhile and riveting for the viewer!
Fun fact: This film marks Johnny Depp's first acting performance (according to IMDb)!
The cast does a pretty decent job overall, especially Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger of course!
On top of that, the pacing of the film is really good. The movie itself isn't that long and it is also pretty fast-paced! Is this film predictable? In some areas it is, but in others it isn't! You don't know how the film will end, but there are certain plot points that are indeed predictable!Unfortunately, my biggest issue with this film was that it was too ""basic"" and generic when it came to the storytelling! In my opinion the side characters are way too naive not to think that there is anything supernatural going on. I get that they try to use rationality to explain certain situations, but I'll just say one thing: ""the hat""! The people, who have seen the film, know what I am talking about! Really? That wasn't enough to believe her? How much more evidence do you need??? Like in pretty much every other horror movie, this film also has those clich√© horror movie moments that only ever happen in horror movies.
Apart from that, I had a great time watching this horror classic!Overall, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is a good horror film with a great villain and it is even self-aware every once and awhile. A real horror classic that comes along with a cool story and a kick-ass soundtrack! 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Craven finds, and gets trapped into, his niche","Wes Craven found an idea that played entirely to his strengths, and it's probably his best film. It's also hindered a bit by the fact that he couldn't quite get rid of his weaknesses around character and structure. Craven was a frustrating filmmaker, is what I'm saying. He had great ideas, and he could do certain things really well. However, he was missing an insight into how basic storytelling worked. I think he should have picked up a writing partner at some point.Tina (Amanda Wyss) has a nightmare where she's being chased around an industrial setting by a man with long knives for fingernails, and she wakes up in a cold sweat. The next morning, she talks to her friend Nancy (Heather Langenkamp), Nancy's boyfriend Glen (Johnny Depp), and her own boyfriend Rod (Nick Corri) about it. Nancy acts a bit weird about it because she seems to have had the same dream, but Glen says it's nothing and he never remembers his dreams while Rod is dismissive of it completely.That night, all four stay at Tina's house with Rod and Tina sharing her mother's bed since she's out of town. While she sleeps, the sweatered man terrorizes Tina at night again, killing her in her sleep horribly, and, in the real world, slashing open her stomach with his razor-like fingernails and dragging her around the room invisibly, up the wall, and along the ceiling as she screams in pain. Now, this is awesome stuff. It's pure gory slasher stuff, but it goes well beyond just blood and guts. There's real imagination in the conception and execution of this idea.Rod becomes a target of law enforcement, notably Nancy's father Lieutenant Don Thompson (John Saxon) all while Nancy becomes more consumed by thoughts of her friend's death while...still attending school. I know why Craven had her do this (the dream sequence that she has when she falls asleep is probably the best dream sequence in the film), but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense from a character perspective. Nancy is essentially in a procedural film where the focus is on identifying a problem and then working towards a solution. Outside of the situation, she's not much of a character. I don't know what she wants, what drives her, or even how much she even likes her boyfriend Glen. The same for Tina, Glen, and Rod. They are all just pawns in the game played by Freddy Krueger.And that would be fine, except that there is something of a story in between the dream sequences, and it's not the most interesting of procedural stories because Craven didn't really understand the concept of escalating stakes or tension. Tina's death is probably the most gruesome in the whole film, and it's first. It's a great death, but it really should have been the final death before Nancy set up her traps to face off with Krueger for the last time. Instead, the last death is Glen's, and while there is certainly some wonderful surrealism on display as the blood pools on his ceiling rather than his floor, it's just not as good or emotionally impactful because he simply disappears into a hole, replaced by a fountain of blood. Tina's anguish is much more impactful, but it happens too early for Nancy.And, again, I point back to Summer of Fear, and how the events just seemed to happen randomly without any real sense of building up to anything in particular. That's the same thing here. Nancy's slowly becoming the last girl standing, but outside of that, there's no sense of real dread that she's the end point. There's no sense that her world is getting smaller (her simply just going to school the next day is indicative of this) or that she's getting more alone. I think part of that is structural, and another part is that the cast of friends is too small. Add one or two new friends, leave Tina for second-to-last, and the two realize that they are the endgame for specific reasons (her dad is the police officer who covered for the parents who killed Krueger in real life, maybe? And he wants her to suffer most because he wants Don to suffer most, something like that). Instead, it's just random death around her.I also want to note that the concept seems a bit squiffy. In particular, the intersection of dreamworld and real world and Krueger's ability to influence real world things. When he's pushing Tina around up the wall, I don't think it really breaks the concept, but when he uses the blanket to hang Rob it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. And the finale is all about bringing the dreamworld into the real world, and I don't think Craven really thought this through too clearly. It's off, is all. It doesn't break everything, but it just feels like there was another level of thought that needed to be addressed before actually filming the script.Now, I've complained enough about a film I really do enjoy. The story connecting these dreams may be functional at best, but those dreams are dotted throughout the film at a nice even pace and they're all really good. As I said before, my favorite of them is the one in the school, especially the way Tina's body gets dragged through the hallway. Krueger himself is a great bad guy, full of personality, and while the backstory is kind of awkwardly delivered in the worst performance of the film (Nancy's mother Marge by Ronee Blakely), it gives him a motive that makes sense, and the idea of real danger invading us while we sleep when we are the most vulnerable is a wonderful horror convention to exploit. Krueger is dangerous in more ways than one, and Craven uses that to its fullest extent.I really do like this film. I think it's a good slasher with real imagination that takes horror seriously instead of just an excuse for gore, but I also feel like it could have really used another rewrite.There's real horror here, but it could have been just a bit more.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the most scariest n atmospheric movies of all time.,"I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs which i used to own.
Revisited it recently on a dvd which I own.
This movie is one of the most atmospheric and scariest movies of all time. It is one of my all time fav horror film. It is one of the best work of writer/director Wes Craven's career.A dead serial killer in an iconic sweater with his unusual weapon is tormenting n killing teens in their sleep. Nice concept huh, done very well.
Robert Englund is terrifying as Freddy, he's subtle and menacing. There is something unique bah this character in future installments. His sense of humor is darkly comical but brutal.
We hav veteran actor John Saxon who is never present at home but pops up whenever a teen dies.
His facial expressions is lol during the climax scene.
We also have Johnny Depp n Lin Shaye.
The film gets surreal during the dream sequences n the cinematography is splendid.
The best thing bah this movie is that it introduced to horror movie fans one of the most memorable horror villains of all time.All the death sequences r innovative n bloody.
Most of the scenes r blatantly plagiarized by Bollywood horror films.
In fact there is a very bad n awful copy known as Mahakaal. Avoid it like plague.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Scary, very scary","Yes, Nancy is god-loving Marie from the tv show ""Just the Ten of Us"" but you can't tell it from this movie.  This is probably one of the scariest in the series, and Freddy is somehow more evil in this one.   This is a very good movie to see when you're in the mood for a scare, and it just may keep you awake for a while.  It also has probably the bloodiest death scene ever in a movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
An Original Slasher Movie With All The Right Elements But..,"I know a lot of people probably read my title then saw my rating of 6 out of 10 and asked themselves why would he do that? Its true this movie is a fresh take on the slasher genre and Freddy is a wonderfully designed character. The kills are great which is usually all I need to enjoy this type of movie. However a few things bother me when it comes to not only this one but the whole series.(Relax I am only reviewing what I think of this one and not the series).First off the comparisons between this and Friday the 13th is ridiculous. FT13 simplifies the slasher genre and makes it fun and gory and is one of the FEW slashers where you actually root for the bad guy. Here we have a child killer(admit he was a pervert to) who comes to you in your dreams. While most people say he is scarier than other slashers because you can not get away from your dreams, you can't get away from Jason either since he can not die. Also when Freddy does come to the real world he always gets his @$$ kicked. Onto the film.I won't talk of the story because in slashers its always basic. Instead I will talk of the concept. I love Wes Craven's works and think Scream was a great slasher series. The ideas presented in this movie are great concepts. I mean a serial killer all burnt up with a glove on his right hand with knives on each finger is a great design. He invades your dreams and kills you off in sick ways. While it is interesting I just do not find this movie to be all that great. While the later ones get more humor put in, I feel this one has just as much black humor and I think it works against it. Freddy has great one liners but a character needs more than that in slashers. The kills are good like I said earlier but they still don't entertain me as much as FT13's or Halloween's.I will admit the remake that came out in 2010 had a lot of problems with it. The pacing was pretty bad and while I enjoyed the kills, I wish they wouldn't have copied some of the kills from the original. However the one shining character in the remake is Jackie Earl's portrayal of Freddy. Robert England did a good job but Jackie actually makes Freddy menacing. I believe with a more original story put behind it he could become a great Freddy. Also for all you fans saying FT13 turned slashers into clich√©'s. I agree to a point but NOES does the same. This has original ideas but the series would go on to do what all successful slasher series do and get made for the cash. Maybe I will do a report on these two franchises and show what each did do and didn't compared to the other. IN till then this movie stays at a 6 outta 10. It is a good movie with original ideas but I don't find Freddy all that creepy or interesting. If you haven't seen it don't let my review stop you from seeing it. With this movie you will either love it or just like it which is something you can't say for a lot of slashers.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best Villain of all time!,"The Movie: I can still remember the first time I saw this one! And from that day became my favorite movie for life! The movie refreshes the genre, witch was exploring at the time the slasher sub-genre. It launched a new kind of slasher, who talks, teases and could kill his victims in their sleep! We always wonder what would happen if we die in our dreams, well, a nightmare on elm street answer that question in the most macabre way. The cast is fabulous, starting with the villain Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund from Eaten Alive and V), the heroin Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp)and the beginning of a amazing actor witch plays Glen (Johnny Depp), the heroin's boyfriend. Wes Craven's work is one in a lifetime, the effects are amazing, making this movie looked like it was big budget production. The short amount of money, makes a Nightmare on Elm Street the ultimate Classic of the modern age, and Makes Freddy Krueger the most loved villain since Darth Vader. All the energy spent with the will of wanting to make this movie is felt during the hole time.The sequels: Well, as usually, if the formula works it will comeback for more! In this case, the numbers of sequels is a little bit too much for the character Freddy Krueger, because sequel after sequel the character became too much of a joker, instead the sarcastic killer from the first movie. One of the biggest mistakes of New Line Cinema was as the Budget grew, we started to see more detailed Krueger's face, witch made the character more exposed and less scary. Freddy's Revenge is probably where the ambient is similar to the original, Krueger is still in the dark, half hidden by the shadows of darkness and although after the sequel it's not my favorite part, is one of my favorites. As the character started to loose the audience, new line cinema started to loose control over Freddy's character, until the creator Wes Craven came with Wes Craven's New Nightmare, refreshing the franchise. In my opinion, Freddy is dead and he should stay that way in sign of respect for what he has given to New Line Cinema! The remake news that Robert Englund is not going to play Freddy Krueger only makes us (fans) wonder that New Line Cinema couldn't care less for the importance that the character had for the studio, and if it wasn't for Freddy, Lord of The Rings would probably be made by another studio. Freddy Made New Line big and New Line is making Freddy shrink!Long Live Freddy!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could have been better,"Being made 20 years ago, obviously this film feeled somewhat outdated when watching it for the first time in 2004. The plot has now become known as one of the great horror films of the 20th Century - and rightly so. The story is far better than most of the modern horror films and never fails to keep you interested throughout. Saying that, the rules of the actual dream world connecting to the real world seemed far too loose, it could have been a much better film with a more concentrated idea of what is possible (this is what brought it down from 4/5 to 3/5). The extras on the DVD are near worthless, except commentaries. I didn't hire it for long enough to listen to these, but I always enjoy hearing what the makers have to say.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Wes Craven is a good director, but NOT a good writer","Let me tell you in one word why this movie is very poorly made.  Simply put, it's the writing.  Wes Craven has written other things in his time but when he set out to write this screenplay, he wrote some horrible dialogue! This whole movie is runed because of it's poor dialogue and idiotic situations.  Only the character of Nancy played by Heather Lagenkamp is credible onscreen.  Even Johnny Depp, the most underrated actor of the past two decades and a great character actor, stumbles over the lines as if he where in an elementary school production.  The character of Freddy, although somewhat scary in this first movie, loses alot of the presence he has by joking and snickering.  There's no suspense, only shock value.  Everything looks like it was filmed on a sitcom stage.  It almost feels like an eighties hairmetal music video.  Maybe another factor is that this movie didn't age well at all. To prove that Wes Craven started out with an interesting idea and turned it into grade B junk, one need only look towards Scream.  While Scream was a partial parody, it was also a far superior horror movie.  Scream was written by Kevin Williamson and only directed by Wes Craven.  It is Craven's most popular movie.  Watch the first A Nightmare on Elm Street ( the sequels are even worse) for curiosity's sake or for the great, creepy special effects. But don't expect, natural dialogue, suspense, logical situations, or for ""Nightmare"" to even hold a candle to Scream or Halloween.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Horror Masterpiece,"Wes Cravens stands as one of the best horror movie directors of all time. And with good reason. The man knows what he is doing. A Nightmare on Elm Street proves this point. The idea of a man that attacks us when we are most vulnerable (dreams) is terrifying to say the least and oozes with originality. One of the things I love about this movie is that it has many thought provoking ideas which are not usual in horror/slasher movies. Also if you're a fan of gore and cool, 80's bloody props, you are likely to really enjoy this movie. A must watch for any horror fan, A Nightmare on Elm Street is an incredibly entertaining movie that not only has creepy visuals, but actually engages the brain.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great first chapter in the Elm Street series!,","The original 1984 A Nightmare on Elm Street is more than just your average ordinary scary movie. It's a scary movie that influenced other scary movies such as The Ring, The Grudge, Saw, Hostel and Paranormal Activity and it is the reason why we have Freddy Krueger, one of the most iconic horror villains on the screen.The original 1984 classic is written and directed by Wes Craven and was released on November 9, 1984 and it's distributor, New Line Cinema from going bankrupt and spawn a multi-media franchise, including eight sequels, a 2010 reboot of the same name, produced by Michael Bay and starring Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger, video games, comic books, a TV show and a crossover between the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and Friday the 13th franchise, which was titled Freddy vs. Jason, and released in 2003.The plot deals with a killer named Freddy Kreuger attacking Nancy Thompson and her friends in their dreams, successfully killing all but Nancy, in fictional Springwood, Ohio. Krueger's back-story is revealed by Nancy's mother, Marge, who explains that he was a child murderer.The parents of Springwood killed Kreuger after he was acquitted on a technically. Nancy defeats Freddy by pulling him out of the dream world and stripping him of his powers when she stops being afraid of him.The original Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic for me because at the time I was growing up, I really did not know what a scary movie was until I got my first taste in 2003 when I saw ""Freddy vs. Jason"" and that's when I started to like scary movies.Robert Englund plays the role of Freddy Krueger and he would remain in that part for all eight original Nightmare on Elm Steet films, but would soon be played by Jackie Earle Haley in the 2010 version. Now, I can't say which actor is better as Freddy Krueger because I like both of them. I know my sister LeeAnn is going to curse me out for saying this, but I'm gonna say it anyway. I actually prefer both actors playing Freddy Krueger. Sure, Jackie Earle Haley may not have the comedic stuff like Robert Englund, but he does do one thing right: play the part of Krueger in a scary way, much like Englund does in the original 1984 film and it's sequels. Heather Langenkamp plays Nancy Thompson and she would play the part of Nancy again in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" and she would also play herself and Nancy in ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"". Johnny Depp plays Glen in the first film of his career and a lot of people said that this is his worst performance, but I actually like him in the first Freddy Krueger film. Jsu Garcia and Amanda Wyss plays Tina and Rod and they are good in the time they have on screen. John Saxon plays Lt. Don Thompson and he is just amazing.The music composed by Charles Bernstein is amazing and really amazing and I really liked the musical score. The movie's tension and suspense builds up to each nightmare in the film. My favorite nightmare is when Nancy is in the bathtub and Freddy's claw comes out of the water and tries to kill her, but she drowns and she eventually gets out.The visuals were impressive for 1984 and they are just as incredible now as they were back then. The editing and dialogue is memorable as heck and this movie is really cool and impressive.The style and tone of this movie is really dark and serious and it is very good for this kind of scary movie. The sequels were also cool and amazing, but the only one I had mixed feelings about is the fifth film, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child"". But, I will get to that in a later review.Overall, the original 1984 version of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET is really well directed, well-written, darn good acted and has a great musical theme that tells you that Freddy Kreuger is coming for you. The movie is gory in some scenes, but it has a purpose for being in the movie, which I like and I have no problem re-watching the Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise over and over again, especially the 1984 film, the 2010 remake and the 2003 crossover with Friday the 13th. The music by Charles Bernstein is really amazing and it is very dark and sinister and it is really cool to hear the Freddy Krueger theme. The film is definitely getting the best possible rating I can give it and that is a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still One of the Best...,"Despite the pale sequels and imitations that have since followed, Freddy Kruger remains in this, his first appearance, an actual scary, ruthless dream avatar, without the devotion to F/X and one-liners of the later works.  This is considered a classic by many, and deservedly so.",,Anonymous,Horror
A rough little jewel,"It's poorly-acted, sloppily-made, and far too bloody, however the very first ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" spooked me at the time and has an ingenious premise. Teenage girl finds that her friends are being killed in their dreams by a deceased child-killer seeking revenge; she plots to trip him up and save the neighborhood! It's a modest thriller with fake blood splashed around, but it isn't an ugly, mean-spirited movie (as some of the sequels were). In fact, it's rather playful and fun-scary, the way a good chiller ought to be. Director Wes Craven allows himself to get a little dopey (check out that finale!), but he takes some chances here that his more recent work rebuffs. Craven is working on pure adrenaline as well as a loopy, lopsided sense of logic, and this ""BOO!"" sensibility suits him. A nifty little screamer. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

NOT a horror film,"alright, I'm not going to speak about ""gore"" or ""thrill"" i'm just going to talk about the fact that this film is not actually a horror film, but it could have been the best horror film ever done. First of all, being directed by Wes Craven was not the best thing that could have happened to this movie, in fact, it's one of the week points it has. He had the main idea, which was awesome, but the rest sucks. The performances were hideous, and the low budget effects too, i think the only good thing that this movie has is the Robert Englund appearance. But is still a classic, and if I had seen this movie in the time it was released, I'm sure I'd have been scared, and it did gave me the creeps, but not when I was seeing the movie, it was after everything had finished, when I had to go to sleep... If some other person got this movie script and really made an effort to make a non-Hollywood horror film with this, I would pay whatever it costs to see it, because i know it would be great. I mean, come on!!!! a guy that killed little kids, that after being burned alive by your parents follows you in your nightmares!!!! it's great!!! Great but not well done, that's how i describe this movie, I recommend it though, for the reasons I have already explained... Try Again Wes!!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A masterpiece of americanized fear,"A classic that will have a long line of descendants. All the necessary elements are there to make a blockbusting horror film, a phenomenal scary movie. It concerns teenagers that are definitely in between desire and sex, both creating and nourishing in them fear and insecurity. The main characters are girls who are even more insecure and more fragile in their sexual fantasms and fears. Then the film systematically blurs the limits between reality and dream, reality and nightmare. It is one fundamental human fear that has been with humanity since the first homo sapiens ever appeared on this earth : the fear that what you imagine or just plain see in your mind may be just as real, even if virtual, as reality. Virtual reality is the other side of the living coin and it is so simple to toss it over. Then you get into smaller elements like underground airless and lightless corridors. Nerverending furnaces that leak and steam around. Snakes, bugs and other creepy crawly monsters. Then the film can center its focusing eye onto the essential element that is going to shine bright on the background of fearful and frightening people and objects. It is the four long razor sharp metallic claws or nails that this Fred Krueger wears on his right hand. This handful of claws, this handful of expanded and deadly nails is the ultimate fear in itself : the hand that can crush you, choke you, strangle you, seize you, grab you, etc. The claws that can tear, cut, scratch, perforate, and do so many other actions. Then you just have to add some blood, some metallic shine, some rust, and some sharp sound and the trap is ready and your soul can fall in the hole and it does at the bottom of a bathtub or in the middle of a bed. Then the film is a neverending story",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Dated, but quite enjoyable if you're in the right mood.",The headline basically sums it up. Movies like Nightmare on Elm Street have become very outdated which is a shame.

A film you shouldn't watch before bed,"I had never heard of or seen this film before, except for The Simpsons' spoof of it. Then I found information about the film, and I finally watched it on YouTube; I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Of course, I did get a little scared, but I know it is only a movie. Also, for you Johnny Depp fans like me, this is his first film.The film (as you all know) starts with 15-year-old Nancy Thompson, who is suffering from violent nightmares about a badly burned man wearing a glove with knives on each finger. She quickly learns that this man is the demonic ghost of a child murderer named Freddy Krueger and is also terrorizing the dreams of her friend Tina, her boyfriend Rod, and her boyfriend, Glen. As they begin to die one by one in their sleep, Nancy learns from her mother that years ago, the parents of Elm Street burned Krueger alive by leaving a tank of gasoline in his boiler room and splashing the gas around the place. Now Freddy's Ghost is back to claim their children's lives as revenge! So Nancy must save herself by bringing Freddy out of her dreams and back into the real world to destroy him forever.The film was a horror success, and four sequels were made. But because of the negative reviews I have seen, I am not going to watch them. So my last word is that this film is an excellent scare-fest, and I would recommend it to those of you of a naive nature like me not to watch it before bed (*evil laughter*).",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the classics of horror genre,"The original A Nightmare on Elm Street is seen as game changer in the horror genre. It pretty much codified the meaning of slasher film, where a group of teenagers is chased by a supernatural horror, with heavy overtones suggesting that it's because of their budding sexuality. Yeah, not exactly subtle, especially because it's almost always the young virgin female that survives, but the subgenre has other things to offer and it's the excellence of this movie that has spawned so many sequels and imitators.So what's the story? A group of teenagers are all dreaming about a boiler room and about a man with burnt skin and terrifying claws chasing them within. One of them, Tina (Amanda Wyss), is especially worried and asks her friends to have a sleepover with her in order to help her sleep in peace. And naturally things don't go like they're supposed to. For Freddy's coming for you.It's a fantastic setup and what makes this film so strong is how unsettling they make that blurring line between dreams and reality. For if you're not safe within your dreams, where can you run? How can you hide? The film slowly builds upon this idea, raising the stages constantly. Helping this atmosphere are some really, really nice practical effects, some of the best I've ever seen in a horror film. It's bloody and gory beyond belief, choreographed beautifully and simply a joy to watch for all fans of slasher genre. Colour me impressed.The thing I was a bit disappointed by is actually the villain. Freddy certainly has a striking look, very good actor backing him up and his powers are certainly worthy of his status, but the movie gets rid of him rather easily, making me feel disappointed. Sure it's a proper horror film in that it doesn't have a true happy ending, nothing like that, but I still expected a bigger climax. Plus the actual kid protagonists are more than a bit bland. Perhaps I should check out the sequels.Nevertheless, it's a must-see horror film for all fans of the genre and certainly a good film to check out in any case. As long as you're not squeamish about blood.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic in its own right but mediocre,"Maybe this cheapie began the endless flow of teen slasher movies and that's why it's considered to be a classic. And maybe it was horrific (for mainstream viewers) when it was released in 1984 but today it looks mostly cheesy.Of course, it introduced few new things to horror films (which was recycled in all the 6 sequels over and over again) but that's not much. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not aged well but still has the most iconic slasher out there,"Some high school kids start dreaming of a scary burned man with knives on his gloves. And soon he starts killing them in their dreams.I just waited too long to watch the movie. It isn't hat it used to be. I mean, I am sure it seemed terrifying back in the days as it has created such a cult and I also heard to many people refer to it as a scariest movie ever. But watching it now as an adult who saw many slasher movies this one just didn't do anything for me.I do like the idea. The fact that one is killed by someone in the dream is a scary thing since one can't escape sleeping, it something one just has to do and then is out of control. Too bad it didn't age well.Was also fun to see Johnny in his first film role. The acting of his and everyone else in the cast doesn't seem so impressive, but I guess this is part of the genre. And the fact that the laughable dialogues make it harder.Fred Krueger is an iconic villain. Greatly done by Robert Englund. I may not find this movie scary but whenever I think of the perfect slasher he is the one who comes to mind. And his back story actually makes me root for him, I can't stand people who perform their own executions when not happy with justice system. So go on Freddy, kill them and their families off!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"You Will ""Never Sleep Again""","A Nightmare on Elm Street is an unbelievably original, terrifyingly realistic, and overall terrifying that, despite a weak ending, is one of the best horror flicks of the quarter of a century. The film deals with a deceased child molester who now lives only through the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive. Robert Englund is truly frightening as Freddy Krueger. Wes Craven delivers a surprising amount of tension that still holds up today.Nancy is having nightmares about a frightening, badly-scarred figure who wears a glove with razor-sharp ""finger knives"". She soon discovers that her friends are having similar dreams. When the kids begin to die, Nancy realizes that she must stay awake to survive. Uncovering the secret identity of the dream killer and his connection with the children of Elm Street, the girl plots to draw him out into the real world.The film goes for suspense, drama, and gore and delivers for the most part. Heather Langenkamp gives a very solid performance as Nancy Thompson, the young woman is the ""leader"" among her friends and the only one who may get out alive. Forget about Jamie Lee Curtis' whimpering performance in ""Halloween"". Here Langenkamp is the real deal and she kicks ass. A great horror film that still delivers today. Look for a young Johnny Depp who, arguably, has the best death scene in the flick.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wish I'd seen it in 1984....,"I came into existence in 1993, exactly 9 years after this movie got released and spooked the dim lights out of many people, including my dad. But now, in the year 2008, when green or brown color blood is no longer seen in films, I didn't find the film so scary as I would have if I was born at that time.The film did have some spooky and jumpy moments, especially in the climax. But there are number of flaws in the movie that cannot be ignored.Firstly, as its a low budget film, it looks very outdated and some of the scenes look downright silly. The acting too was a major problem. The main character just couldn't act properly. She was good in a couple of scenes but just couldn't grab my attention.The other cast members, including Johnny Depp, were just about okay. Freddy was spooky though. I also found Nancy's behavior with her mother rude and irrational as her mother didn't seem so bad to her. The end sequence looked like a Home Alone film.On the bright side, it still manages to get you hooked due to the clever plot. Some of the scenes were well crafted. The best part was it was just a 1 1/2 hour movie, an ideal time for a horror flick.I'm going to go with a 6 out of 10 for Nightmare on the Elm Street.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Maybe I didn't give the movie enough credit,"Now that I just bought the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" DVD collection, I watched the original ""Nightmare"" again just to refresh my memory about the film.  A couple years ago I rented the movie on video and submitted my comments.  I felt it was a good movie, but I wasn't raving about it.  Maybe I wasn't in such a good mood that day.First of all, the transfer from video to DVD looks wonderful.  If you watch it on video, the reception is grainy and you can determine how old it is by its picture quality alone.As I've mentioned in previous reviews, I don't get scared easily, so I'm not going to give this a negative review just because I wasn't leaping out of my seat.  However I was creeped out a few times.  Hell, even after seeing Freddy Krueger's face a million times, I'm still creeped out by the dude. And nobody--I mean--nobody could've played the role better than Robert Englund.  For some reason I regarded the acting as cheesy the first time around.  OK, so the acting isn't extraordinary, but it's good, especially for a horror film.  And I've learned to appreciate Heather Langenkamp more and more as a scream queen.  It is amusing to see Johnny Depp, who didn't possess the same star power or talent he does today.Perhaps I was too hard on the film, and I'd regard ""Nightmare"" as at least a minor classic.  After all, Freddy is a supreme horror villain!  And I forgot to mention the film's nifty premise.  I'm fascinated by psychology, especially the subject of the unconscious mind.  It's a very perplexing element, because nobody really has control over their unconscious minds, so nobody has any control over what happens in their dreams.  So what happens if those dreams, or nightmares I should say, become a reality?  Kudos to Wes Craven for an inspired and original effort.My score:  8 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A modern day horror classic.,"Released in November of 1984, A Nightmare On Elm Street was a very personal project from Wes Craven. He was already a cult icon after directing two of the most notorious low budget films of the 70s, The Last House On The Left (1972) and The Hills Have Eyes (1977). By this point, Craven was moving up in the industry but still struggling in Hollywood and after directing two films back to back, Deadly Blessing (1981) and Swamp Thing (1982), he went off and wrote a screenplay that he has stated was inspired by true events.A Nightmare On Elm Street came from a series of articles that Craven had read where many children were afraid to fall asleep, even trying the best that they could to avoid sleep. There was one article in particular though in the L.A. Times I believe that was so haunting to Craven that it inspired him to come up with the concept of a dream stalker or figure. While the script proved to be an inspired story with brilliant characters through out, many studios in Hollywood rejected it, claiming that it was too gory or dark. Some turned it down because they thought that the concept couldn't be pulled off. The future looked very bleak but then Craven found someone who saw great potential in the script and that was Robert Shaye. Shaye was the founder of a small distribution company called New Line Cinema, which had been around since the late 60s and released a lot of low budget films during the 70s and early 80s, all of which they were able to make their money back on but still were not huge successes. You have to give a lot of credit to Shaye who saw a lot of great things in Craven's script and believed in it probably as much as Craven himself. He felt that not only did this have commercial appeal but also, it was a great story that could work.Production began in early 1984, Craven casted some of the freshest up and coming actors at the time, one of them being the very beautiful and intelligent Heather Langenkamp who proved to be a very strong choice to play the film's hero, Nancy Thompson. What Craven wanted was someone who was strong, smart and wouldn't fall down unlike most female leads in slasher films but also, someone with a lot of courage and determination and Heather pulled it off perfectly in the film. To me, Nancy is the main reason why the film works so well and while Freddy deserves credit too, Nancy is the true lead in the first film. Other actors casted were John Saxon, who had been in the business many years before and was even known as a great character actor. Also, Amanda Wyss as Tina, who you think is going to be the film's lead heroin at first and even though she is killed off in the first 30 minutes, you still care about her a great deal and I don't think Amanda ever received enough credit. First time screen actor Johnny Depp was cast as Nancy's boyfriend, Glenn. We all know Johnny as the huge movie star today but at the time, he was very much afraid of working in front of the camera and Craven stated himself that Johnny's hands were shaking a few times but because of his willingness to put himself into that character and play something that wasn't him shows what a gifted actor he was and still is.Of course, Craven was looking for someone to play Freddy. He was actually looking for someone much older but it proved to not be effective. While Robert England may have not looked right for the part on first look, Craven saw something in him and Robert was cast, we can now all agree that he made the right choice because Robert brings something to the character that goes beyond what Craven had envisioned.After a hard shoot that caused a lot of tension between the crew because of the low budget and restrictions, the film had an uncertain future. If the film had failed, it could have been the end for New Line, which caused a lot of stress for Robert Shaye and everyone working for the company. The film opened that November and surpassed everyone's expectations by becoming not only a film that was profitable but also one that found a huge cult following before a franchise had even been born. It launched a series of sequels, most of which are very effective and well done and while Freddy became less mysterious as he was in the first film, it was clear that because Robert Englund believed in the role so much and that the filmmakers worked so hard to make them unique visual experiences, they deserve a lot of credit and should not be ignored as far as I'm concerned. All of the actors are remembered for their roles today, especially Robert and Heather. They both are extraordinary talent and care so much about the characters while most people would try to forget about it as much as possible. I want to say again that Nancy is a great character, one that pulled me into the movie and made me believe in the story. I hope that someday, a Nancy doll will be made.This is a modern day horror classic, one that came at the right time and so much hard work from people who were determined to do their best and make a great film. A company's future relied on this film and it is now one of the biggest studios in Hollywood. So check this film out if you're into the genre. While I can't speak for everyone, I think that this is a great film and one of the best of the 80s. Find yourself a copy and watch it now!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A classic movie!,"Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a classic of the horror genre, earning its reputation as a groundbreaking and influential film that has left an indelible mark on the genre. While it may not be a perfect cinematic experience, it remains an 8/10 for its innovation, iconic antagonist, and lasting impact.The film introduces audiences to Freddy Krueger, a nightmare-inducing, razor-gloved killer played with malevolent charisma by Robert Englund. Freddy's ability to haunt and harm his victims in their dreams is a concept that remains both terrifying and unique. Englund's portrayal of Freddy as a darkly humorous and sadistic figure has solidified his place in the pantheon of horror villains.Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson provides a strong and resourceful final girl, and her character's determination to confront and defeat Freddy adds depth to the story. The film explores the psychological toll that these relentless nightmares take on its young characters, tapping into the universal fear of the unknown lurking in our subconscious.The practical effects in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" stand as a testament to the ingenuity of the era's horror filmmaking. The surreal and dreamlike sequences, including the famous blood geyser scene, showcase a level of creativity that still impresses today.The film's thematic exploration of the blurred line between dreams and reality resonates with audiences, as it challenges our perception of what is safe and what is truly frightening. This underlying subtext adds depth to the standard slasher formula.While some viewers may find the film's pacing to be slower compared to more modern horror films, it allows for the gradual buildup of tension and suspense. However, there are moments where the practical effects show their age, which could potentially distract viewers accustomed to modern CGI.In the end, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a must-watch for any horror enthusiast, not just for its historical significance but also for its ability to tap into primal fears and deliver memorable scares. It's an 8/10 for its impact on the genre and its enduring ability to haunt our dreams.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Terribly Overrated and Not Scary,"I may be new to the horror movie genre but it's my understanding that horror movies are supposed to be...you know...scary right? They're meant to leave you cowering behind a pillow, behind your sofa, gripping your friends or whoever you're watching it with like a boa constrictor, afraid to turn lights off and reluctant to go to a farm or a castle or in this movie's case reluctant to fall asleep. ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" is meant to do all that and is applauded as a horror classic...problem was I wasn't scared once! I knew of it from a young age and vowed never to watch it because of the plot and my over active imagination but I sat and watched it with a former girlfriend still worried about the aftermath of watching it (made worse by her saying ""you'll p*** yourself with terror""). However not once was I terrified, shocked or left cowering behind her or anything near me, in fact by the time the credits rolled I was sat with a confused scowl on my face wondering how it was considered a classic I'll probably never fully understand why either To me, this movie is one of those that is over-hyped to the point that when you eventually watch it, you're left puzzled and somewhat underwhelmed by it, others may well enjoy it and have memories of it but I did not enjoy it at all",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Once upon a time, Freddy Krueger was scary.","It's amazing, but no matter how many times I see it, the original still grips me. What's important to do when you watch the original is to forget everything you know about Freddy.Forget the endless sequels, forget the series, forget the fame, forget his face, forget his name, forget about Robert Englund, all of it, and return to that moment in 1984 when you knew nothing, not who he was, what he was or what he wanted. If you can do that than you'll be amazed at how fresh, new and scary Freddy's first appearance was!He's no laughing matter in the original, no one liners, no jokes, just a mysterious phantom who's intentions were frightening and that's the Freddy I love, when his image, the image intended by Craven, wasn't tainted by celebrity and over exposure.",,Anonymous,Horror

It was almost a perfect horror. BUT something happened. Sequels. Tv shows. Robert Englund parading in his Freddy suit on Jay Leno or something. Easy said; the success destroyed anything scary about Freddy Krueger. Freddy dolls, for Christ sake. Freddy became a Chucky. A Crusty The Clown.

Also good performances by the actors particular one well known John Saxon best remembered starring with the Late Bruce Lee in ENTER THE DRAGON.

Wes Craven's iconic horror masterpiece with an amazing monster portrayed by Robert Englund,"In the town of Springwood, four teens Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), Glen Lantz (Johnny Depp), Christina ""Tina"" Gray (Amanda Wyss), and Rod Lane (Nick Corri) are tormented by nightmares with all of them sharing the same figure, a disfigured burnt man in a red and green sweater with blades on one hand (Robert Englund). As the nightmares begin to leave impacts upon the waking world, the truth about the man in their nightmares comes to terrifying light.A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 horror film written and directed by Wes Craven. Craven had been inspired by a mixture of stories of Hmong refugees who had died in their sleep in the 60s as well as various eastern religions and even took elements from his own life such as the villain of the film who was named after a bully from his childhood. Craven had wanted to make his villain standout from the crowded field of the ""slasher glut"" as many of the villains were masked brutes who didn't speak and Craven wanting to break from convention wanted his villain to taunt the victims and have a unique weapon as knives were overly common place. The screenplay was shopped around to various studios around Hollywood and while Walt Disney Pictures had shown interest, they're desire to tone it down to a PG-13 rating was seen as unacceptable by Craven and Paramount and Universal also rejected the film. Eventually New Line Cinema agreed to finance the film which would end up being their first in house production as up to that point they had served exclusively as a distributor. Made for $1.1 million, New Line opened the film in limited release where it scored $1.3 million in its opening weekend eventually earned a total of $25 million in the United States and $57 million worldwide and helped establish New Line is a prominent mini-major studio. A Nightmare on Elm Street has endured itself with a rich premise, a creepy villain, likable characters, and a line of sequels most of which are not half-bad (albeit not to the level of the original).From our opening sequences wherein we follow who is seemingly setup as our protagonist and introduced to the underlying concept within the film, A Nightmare on Elm Street does a solid job of leading you through the darkly lit corridors of nightmares with Robert Englund's terrifying take on our antagonist solidly reprehensible and inhumanly sadistic with a twisted sense of humor. Our core teenage cast are quite likable and as the events of the film continue onward with the only option for avoiding the man in their nightmares being to stay awake there's seldom a feeling of safety as everyone needs to sleep at some point and the question of how you defeat something in your dreams is a daunting one. While certainly a lower-budgeted production the film is rich in character and atmosphere with the legends surrounding our villain with the skip-rope rhyme well ingrained in the memories of those who have seen this movie nicely eerie and memorable, but also the conspiracy of silence among the adults of the town which is only hinted at with characters like John Saxon as Nancy's father Don.A Nightmare on Elm Street remains a solid example of the horror genre and one of the best examples of the slasher sub-genre with a memorable villain and rich atmosphere.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The boogie-man of your dreams,"I'd never seen the first Nightmare on Elm Street until a couple of nights ago, though I have seen some of the others. Parts 2 and 3 were my first introduction to Freddy, back when I was 12. Can any kid born in the 80s and beyond truly say that they haven't had a nightmare about Freddy? Wes Craven really has no idea how much he stuck fear in the public subconscious with this character.You all know the story at this point, so I'm guessing there's no point in summarizing it, but with a small cast and limited locations/budget, Craven proves just how much you can do with a good script and lots of determination. If only all horror wannabes realized this before saturating their movies with ugly CGI.Depp had the most successful career of all the actors, but special mention must be made of Robert Englund, who played the character of Freddy for 21 years after this movie. He's probably one of the most iconic horror villains of all time, and make-up or not, it's ALL Robert Englund.The mythology of Freddy certainly does lend itself well to numerous sequels. ANOES sets up so much potential that I have never really found the series and spin-offs to be stale or repetitive. The film itself hasn't really dated that much either, which is a common flaw of older horror movies.I'm not really sure why I put off watching it until now, I feel like I'm a 'little bit' late to the party. It may be kind of tame by today's standards, but it's a great low-budget horror with plenty of imagination.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
See you in your nightmares,"On Elm Street a group of teenagers are tormented in there dreams by a spectral child murderer with a clawed hand named Freddy Kruger. Who will survive this nightmare and who can stop Freddy Kruger before he enacts his evil ever going revenge? One thing is for sure DON'T FALL ASLEEP!!One of the quintessential and classic horror films of the 80's and one in which not only inspired multiple sequels but terrified legions of film viewers for generations to come. The original being the most terrifying of the entire series, and one in which made Freddy Kruger an icon in the horror genre and a staple in the modern era. Gory, terrifying and imaginative is some of the words that comes to mind when one discusses this film. Its nightmare sequences are truly frightening as the tension builds to an almost unbearable point. The pacing of this film is methodical and Robert Englund taking on his most famous of roles does a fantastic job portraying the evil Freddy Kruger. Wes Craven also makes a name for himself with one of the truly most frightening and gory films of its generation. What can easily cross over into the hokey manages to stay the course and truly terrify the viewer, showing that all attached to this film did there best to maintain not only the films credibility but maintain its terror soaked tension.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A true horror masterpiece,"For a slasher movie that was created in the 80s after countless Friday the 13th and Halloween copycats, Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street is incredible. Thanks to the genius concept that Craven came up with, the special effects, the suspense and the character of Freddy Krueger, the original Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the greatest horror movies of all time.After over 38 years since the film's release, there's not much I have to say other than this is a genre-defining motion picture.

A sheep in wolf's clothing,"I grew up with ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" It was one of the defining themes of my childhood; Freddy Kreuger's iconic face and finger knives were part of the cultural fabric of the eighties. Freddy was like a demon in the media, haunting our collective consciousness just like he is supposed to have done in the film. I was terrified of him; I probably would not have been if I had ever actually seen the movie.You see, my mother had seen it; and, while she considered it a good film she declared it simply too scary for me to watch and so, for many years, I sat on the sidelines as all of my friends came back with their survival stories (This was Britain, where an 18 rating MEANS 18, so unless you had permissive parents who didn't care what you watched on video, you didn't see horror films under age)and I concocted Francis-Baconesque visions of the film in my mind; gothic dreams that came from the darkest depths of my soul.Well, illusion can trump reality at the best of times, but never was it more so than with this film. It was not scary in the slightest; it had a completely ludicrous plot (If Freddy is supposed to be killing children in their dreams, than how is he moving ropes or turning beds into blenders in the real world?), and a suprisingly incompetent villain (a supposedly omnipotent nightmare-master who does little more with his power than jump out behind trees and yell ""Boo!""). I know that later sequels did more with better special effects, and created more realistic death scenarios, but this film remains a severe dissapointment. Perhaps the only Freddy-inspired creation I saw that dealt with the concept sucessfully was, oddly, the ""Simpsons"" parody",,Anonymous,Horror
What Nightmares are made of.,"Every now and then, Cineworld bring an old classic back to the big screen. Sometimes randomly and sometimes in relevance to the season. Last year's Halloween one day special was ""The Shining"" (which, to my dissatisfaction i missed :'( ) and this year round it was A Nightmare on Elm Street.I had already seen the film years ago, but was eagerly awaiting seeing it on the big screen and hearing the iconic Nightmare theme on the big speakers. I mean what can be said about good old Fred Kreuger; along with Micheal Myers and Jason Vorhees, those three where the absolute benchmark of deranged killers in the 80's and although their psychotic stature has been unfortunately tampered with -....Freddy vs Jason.....- and rehashed, the term they don't make them like they used to couldn't be more accurate.What separates this from other horrors is that in some ways it doesn't take itself too seriously; there are several parts -whether it be a one liner or an over exaggeration- which are funny. It's part of it's charm as a horror. And instead of a typical dark and ominous soundtrack when killer meets victim; you are met with an unfamiliar techno beat. But what is spectacular is the plot, the story, the idea behind it is ...well genius. You either suffer trying to stay awake forever or come face to face with a knife wielding lunatic. It's dilemma at it's most desperate.Although i have a lot of praise for the film, the acting can get on your nerves; mainly from Nancy (the main character), but despite that it is without a doubt one of the most iconic horrors of past and will continue to be.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the most iconic horror villains of all time!,"A Nightmare on Elm Street has to be my favorite horror franchise of all time! Definitely would recommend!

Not upto the expectations....,"For a long time, I wanted to watch this movie and now I have finally watched it (I am late, I know).The whole concept of a monster that kills people in their dreams was a wonderfully original idea. The problem was that the execution of the idea was not so good. Also, the acting wasn't good. Film's conclusion was also messed up.Film contains some creepy moments, but not that much hyped moments.What's good about the picture is Freddy. Here he is a monster, plain and simple.

Was expecting more from a Wes Craven film...,"I saw this film was directed by Wes Craven, so I decided to give it a go seeing as one of my all time favourite films is Scream and he was the director for it. This film is classed as a Horror film and while the idea is quite a frightening one this is not a very scary film.I think the problem is that there simply isn't enough blood and violence, modern day horror is filled with it and that is what makes us jump. There are a few jump moments in this film but overall it is actually quite a dull film... I expected to not want to go to sleep ever again or something extreme like that but really it was just... Dull... Although this is the case, the acting is still very good, believable and strong. Most of the characters don't get developed enough throughout the film and this lets it down though. The cast is good and the story is original and well thought out. The execution of it all - sadly - does not live up to the hype...The ending was predictable and the rest of it was too, the shock moments that people desperately crave just weren't there. I'd recommend this if you're bored but don't expect to finish watching it and say ""Wow what a fantastic movie!"" because it's not...

"One, Two, Here's My Nightmare On Elm Street Review...","A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of those movies that gets progressively better and better as it runs along. At first it all appears like your typical clich√© horror but eventually, by the near end of it, you've been hit over the head with an insanely explosive, unforgettable, and frantically aggressive finale. Wes Craven's original horror classic challenged the concept of a ""slasher killer"" and introduced us to one of the most notorious icons ever: Freddy Kruger. The idea of a serial killer only having the ability to kill victims within their dreams is devilishly dexterous and might I add, effective. Additionally, some of the more dramatic moments-especially in argumental sequences involving Nancy and her mother-are actually quite efficient and add to the trauma of the film's present situation. The score is as overdone as it is vibrantly energetic and the horror kills have never been so ingenious! This movie however, certainly isn't without its flaws-whether it be the at times, mediocre acting or the cheap jump scares or the glaring plot-holes. It's still none of the less, a horror flick that never, ever gets tiresome. (Verdict: A-)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best horror movie ever,"A nightmare on elm street has always been and will always be my favorite horror movie of all time. But not just because it is an amazing movie, but also because it is the movie that really got me interested in movies, especially in horror movies. If i'd have to criticize anything, it'd be some of the acting. The acting in the movie is actually good except for Heather, who plays Nancy. She was decent, but i think the could have been better. But of course Robert Englund plays Freddy in this movie, who is my personal favorite horror movie villain of all time. Just the idea of some haunting you and trying to kill you in your dreams is terrifying. And of course he looks awesome. I think the characters in general are extremely likable and you really don't want them to die. But when someone dies it is really has an impact on you because first of all we don't want them to die and second of all the death scenes are really well made. This movie has one of the most iconic deaths in horror history and some of the most iconic moments in horror history. For example Freddy's hand coming out of the bathtub. Also i love the ending to this movie. Of course i don't want to spoil anything, so i'll just say that i love the ending. I know Wes Craven actually wanted to have a different ending, and yes i would've preferred the ending that he was planning on putting into the movie, but i still love the ending that we got. So, this movie is not only one of my favorite horror moves of all time, it is one of my favorite movies of all time. I can watch this movie over and over again and it just never gets boring. The cast is overly good in my opinion and Craven introduced us to not only one of the best and most iconic villains of all time, but also to Jonny Depp. This is an absolute masterpiece and of course i'll give a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Nightmare on Elm Street,"Wes Craven was an English language academic before he became a filmmaker. There is even a scene where a High School class discuss Hamlet.A Nightmare on Elm Street could be Craven indulging on surreal ideas between dreams, nightmares and realities. A Freudian exploration of teenage neuroses as they go through puberty and sexual awakening.Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) is a side figure in this movie. The local child molester who was burned to death by angry parents.Krueger now seeks revenge on the children as a burns scarred boogeyman who stalks their dreams.If the teenagers fall asleep, they are in trouble as Krueger infiltrates their nightmares and they could face a grisly death.Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) is being haunted by Krueger. Her dad is a cop, her mother tells Nancy the truth about what happened to Krueger.Her boyfriend Glen Lantz (Johnny Depp) fails to take Nancy's advice to stay awake and his bed turns into a bloodbath.It has a mid 1980s low budget horror feel. There are a couple of effective shocks, some black humour and a few dumb adults and teenagers.

"An Excellent,Scary,Imaginative,Original and Haunting Horror Classic. Wes Craven's Greatest film.","A Nightmare On Elm Street is simply one of the greatest Horror films ever made,an excellent,scary,frightening and original Horror Classic that is filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy and memorable score and amazing Special Effects. It's one of my all-time favorite Horror films and is Wes Craven greatest film.Set in Springwood,Ohio,A Nightmare On Elm Street tells the story about a group of teenagers who live in the same neighborhood of Elm Street who have been having the same nightmares about a burnt and scarred man with finger knifes named Fred Krueger(Robert England). When one of the teens is killed in their sleep,Nancy Thompson(Heather Langenkamp)has to figure out why Fred Krueger is stalking her and her friends in their nightmares and stop him before it's too late or Nancy won't wake up at all.There are many reasons A Nightmare On Elm Street is a classic and my opinion a landmark Horror film. By 1984 everyone and their Mama was making a Slasher film and the Slasher genre during the period from 1978 to 1984 had hit it's peak,the Friday the 13th series by that time was in it's forth installment,the Halloween series was in limbo and semi-retirement(then brought back four years later)and the genre needed something fresh and exciting and ANOES was the answer. ANOES brilliantly combines the bloody,gory kills of the Slasher genre and mixes it with Fantasy and dreams. One of the reasons ANOES is so frightening and scary is because it blurs the lines of dreams and reality. Wes Craven pulls the viewer into a world where you're not sure if the events in the film are really happening or is it a dream or a nightmare or are the characters in the film going crazy and imagining things. The film is a dark and scary experience where you feel like none of the characters are safe when they're awake or asleep and film's atmosphere adds to the characters since of dread and fear whether it's the darkness and shadows at or even in the beautiful daylight,with images and scenes that are disturbing and creative and will give viewers nightmares themselves. The kills,gore and special effects are scary and brilliant and is impressive for a film made on a low budget of 1 million dollars. The gore and special effects enhance the film and matches the film's nightmarish tone. Unlike most of the Slasher films during the 80s where the characters are not developed and unlikable and waiting to get killed,the characters in ANOES are likable and well-developed and you feel sympathy for them whether it's the teenagers or their parents. The teenagers in the film aren't like the unsuspecting teens in the Friday The 13th films,but sympathetic to the point where you feel sorry for them and what the characters have to deal with whether it's dealing with Fred Krueger or dealing with their parents. Before he was Freddy Krueger,popping off one-liners and becoming a Horror/Cult icon,Freddy Krueger was Fred Krueger in this film,a sick,twisted killer that killed you in your dreams and did it with a dark glee and joy. Unlike the other slasher icons like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers,Freddy had a personality and style and was unique. Instead of just using a machete or knife,Freddy uses his finger knifes and fear in this film,I also love the fact that Freddy doesn't get much screen time in the film always hiding in the darkness and shadows and not saying much dialog. What also makes Freddy a great character is that in the nightmares Freddy can control anything and have all the power to do what he wants to his prey and the victims are powerless and can't stop Freddy. While I love the Freddy character in the sequels,the version and character in this one is the scariest and most frightening. This film and the Freddy character in this film do for sleeping what Jaws did for swimming in the water and what Psycho did for taking showers and one of the reasons ANOES is such a timeless classic. The ending of the film like the rest of the movie is scary and ambiguous because you are not going to be sure if the ending is real or a dream. The ending is one of the things that adds to the film's greatness and will stay with you after you watch the movie.The whole cast is great in their roles. Heather Langenkamp does a great job as Nancy,the hero of the film,bringing depth,sympathy and a likable presence to the role. Robert England is simply amazing as Fred Krueger,bringing a menacing,scary and frightening believability to the role. England's performance in this film and the sequels made Freddy one of greatest movie villains of all time. John Saxon is wonderful as LT.Donald Thompson,a cop who is Nancy's father,Saxon is calm and collective in his performance. Ronee Blakley is effective and sad as Marge Thompson,Nancy's alcoholic mother. Johnny Depp does a great job as Glen,Nancy's boyfriend. Who would've known Depp would become one of the biggest stars on the planet. Amanda Wyss is wonderful in her small role as Tina,Nancy's best friend. Nick Corri does an outstanding job as Rod,Tina's bad boy boyfriend.Wes Craven's direction in the film is fantastic,giving the film and sense of fear and dread,moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and the scares are well done. Great job,Craven.Charles Bernstein's score and NOES theme is dark,frightening and effective and matches the film's scary feel. Creepy score by Bernstein.The Special Make-up effects by David B. Miller are amazing,gory and realistic and add to the film. Great effects,MillerIn final word,if you love Horror films,Slasher films or Wes Craven,I highly suggest you check out A Nightmare On Elm Street,a landmark and timeless Horror classic that will make you afraid to go to sleep and will stay with you after you watch it. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Quintessential and defining horror,"Murdered serial killer Freddy Krueger appears in the teenagers of Elm Street dreams to exact revenge for their parents unlawful actions.Made in 1984, it's inevitably dated slightly - only loosing it's edge due to imitations and sequels, nevertheless, it still retains much of its eerie factor and many of the effects still hold up today. (That said, Freddy's long arms segment are just as tacky and odd as they were back then.)Heather Langenkamp's Nancy goes against the stereotype and look of usual damsels in distress lead and to director/writer Wes Craven's credit he's uses the Psycho (1963) casting ploy with Amanda Wyss as Tina. An unknown (at the time) Johnny Depp appears and veteran John Saxon give some weight to the film in an extended cameo, the rest of cast are above par for the stigmatized genre. Notable is Ronee Blakley as Marge Thompson Nancy's alcoholic mother.There are many standout moments - the hand between Nancy's legs in the bath scene, the body bag in the corridor, the bloody ceiling and bed deaths, the shock ending and more, actually too many to mention. This coupled with Charles Bernstein's excellent and memorable score, sound design and creepy makeup effects is enough to deliver chills.A Nightmare on Elm Street is a quintessential and defining horror that made a star of Robert England sowed the seeds for Freddy's pop icon status. Craven delivered a novel concept and villain which has been imitated many times since.With an assortment of slasher, fantasy and horror - nightmare mixed with reality has never been quite equalled since.",,Anonymous,Horror
Slow build with big payoff,"The good thing about A Nightmare on Elm Street(the original) is that it doesn't shoot it's load by trying to do to much too early in the movie. The story builds at a steady rate with a few big moments early on but nothing where it shoots its load without leaving much to do at the end of the movie.Freddy Krueger is in the movie just a little bit, just enough to where it keeps the character interesting and make every one of his appearances that much more meaningful. Robert Englund IS the best actor to play Krueger and the idea that they decided to replace him in the sequel was a terrible terrible decision on the producers part.Some of the acting could've been better but really what did you expect from this, Sir Laurence Olivier?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
JWB's Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 review,"Greetings Fanboys and Fangirls everywhere, Halloween is coming close, A time where monsters come out to scary the innocent, a time where Legendary Monsters like Dracula, Wolfman, and Frankinstain return to our media, A time... of Nightmares for he has returned, to murder us in our dreams, a being who refers himself as the Dream Master, A being who would make Jack the Ripper look like on old man... His Name... is Freddy Krueger, He first appeared in a Movie called A Nightmare on Elm Street Released in 1984 and Directed by the Guy who made SCREEM, Wes Craven From the history in this This was one of New Lines first ever successful movie they ever had involvement with, And this is the same movie company that did The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit Trilogy, The Mask, And the Blade Trilogy (Before Marvel got the rights of the Character back) and lets not forget that The 80's in some perspective the Year where Horror movies where taking over the cinema's along side Friday the 13th, Hellraiser, even some Horror movie that where... Frighteningly bad, I'm not sure what was going on there but I'm sure the people where into horror despite of the Ratings.The Stars of this is Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson (Much to my surprise and I never noticed She was Moto in Star Trek: Into Darkness) Glen Lantz was played by Pirates of the Carabian star himself Johnny Depp (And get this This was his First ever Movie he stared in, That's right Nightmare on Elm Street was the Beginning of Johnny Depp's Movie Star life) John Saxon as Lt. Don Thompson which in my opinion has done a very good job at his role, although trying to hide that fact that Freddy is killing people in there Dreams But I'll get to that later on, Ronee Blakley as Marge Thompson, Who in my opinion is more of a complete wreck, Hell Throughout the film she struggles with Nancy's growing instability from lack of sleep and adds locks to the doors and bars to the windows to try to keep Nancy in and the supposedly at-large killer out, turning to alcohol to deal with the stress, (Which doesn't help) and who is playing Freddy Krueger in this, Why it's non other then Robert Englund himself, Looking at his Wiki file he's done a lot after, He was the Riddler in 2005's The Batman show, He played Vulture in The Spectacular Spider-Man show and Felix Faust in Justice League.Funny enough I never watched any of the Nightmare movies until I got the Blu-Rays in 2014, And I was like this after watching the first movie Wes Craven & Robert Englund, You Mad son's of Bitch's, Not only did you create a Timeless Horror Movie Classic, But this movie Revalutionazed the Horror marketing, This idea originated from a real event of someone Having a nightmare that he was being chased by some maniac, and when he went to sleep, He died the morning after. And Let me tell you about the origin of Freddy, Frederick Charles ""Freddy"" Krueger (a.k.a. The Springwood Slasher) is a child killer responsible for the kidnapping and murder of several children before he is eventually captured. Due to a legal technicality he is released without charge and the parents of the murdered children take the law into their own hands, burning him alive. After his death, Freddy gains the ability to infiltrate and control dreams and uses it to stalk and murder the remaining children of Elm Street. Despite being defeated several times, Freddy repeatedly resurrects himself and continues trying to kill children. Now the fact of some lunatic Murdering people in dreams is pretty terrifying when you put it that way, You can say that this movie is perfect for Halloween, Later on Freddy's movies would go into of Horror comedy, Freddy having his own T.V. Show that resembles The Twilight Zone Freddy vs Jason which put's Freddy against Jason and then there's the Remake in 2010, I will cover them later on but in the mean time, I better have Khadgar put anti-Dream Hacker wards around the place so not Dream-Psycho-Path kills me in my sleep.I give this move 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Go Johnny Go!,"Well if one thing's for sure it's that Mr. Depp has certainly come a long way, not just career-wise but with his acting ability as well. I have the funny feeling that if you told this young man back then that he'd become one of the most sort after people in the moving picture business today that you'd only receive a laugh as a response. This was actually pretty good for a early-80's horror movie. The concept was great since it differed from all the regular slasher flicks and it gave the villain an eccentric personality.Some CGI could've been used but all in all the cheesy special effects did their job. The look into dreams was interesting as it is a subject that fascinates most people since we still don't know the exact cause of and reason for them. Unfortunately the first installement in horror film sets is usually the best and the series did tend to go downhill after this (although there were a couple others that were decent). The idea gets beat to death though when producers try to milk an idea for all it's worth and all that is left is just a corny by-product.

"One, Two Freddy's Coming for You","As a kid, Freddy had me shook. I already had bad dreams as it was, the last thing I needed to see was a movie about a killer that kills you in your dreams! And Freddy was no normal killer, even his backstory was something of night terrors. Then that frightening kid's song:One, two Freddy's coming for you. Three, four better lock your door. Five, six grab your crucifix. Seven, eight better stay up late.I haven't seen this movie in decades and I still remember the song!!!For me, A Nightmare on Elm Street has to be compared to two slasher predecessors: Halloween and Friday the 13th. It is different than those two in that Freddy Krueger was paranormal whereas the other two were not (although they were supernormal). Like Michael and Jason, Freddy preyed upon teenagers and he was exceptionally good at it.Freddy belongs in the slasher hall of fame. What he was able to do with his glove of knives was epic. In fact, I'd put him on the slasher Mount Rushmore along with Jason, Michael, and maybe Chucky. I can't decide between him and Norman Bates.And Nancy belongs in the killer escapee hall of fame. Laurie escaped Michael twice, Jason had his escapees, but none concocted a plan as bold and as brilliant as Nancy.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Classic horror title, more of an 80s teen fantasy movie.","A Nightmare on Elm Street was created by Wes Craven, an English lit professor, who probably got the project green-lit because its so teen orientated, and plays on the idea of dream-reality invading our waking life in such an original way.The movie starts with an excellent plot conceit, local bad-boy (played by Johnny Depp) is accused of a crime he didn't commit. The real culprit? A scarred, cackling ghost, formerly a school caretaker that was burnt alive by vengeful Elm Street parents for abusing children.A Nightmare on Elm Street has a sense of purpose, context, and layered story elements the other films in this series lack, and that said, the movie is also the only ""Nightmare"" film created by Wes Craven for the whole decade of numerically staggering hack-n-slash sequels. (Seven? Eight? Nine???) The decision to build this movies character into a ""franchise"" is actually a symptom of how 80s cinema was overly commercial and a tad mindless compared to the 70s classics that film geeks and reviewers still laud today as quality cinema.That aside, the movie does have a sense of dread and insularity as the teens of Elm Street realize that they're trapped in a supernatural pact against the evil spirit of Freddy Krueger, and the special effects are pretty cool. The prosthetics, Jacques Haitkins cinematography and the pulsing 80s synthesizer score all became standard tropes for 80s big-league horror and its various low budget imitators where you gets stabbed in the eyeball by a guy in a hockey mask coming out of a closet in the dark etc. Bam!!! You got stabbed!! Ouch!!! Ewwww¬Ö.fake blood.Personally, I'd rate the film as a '6', but upped it a notch because of the excellent title!! Also, creature design effects for Freddy Krueger are some of the most iconic in horror history, that said most of the other releases in the series are just VFX vehicles with anonymous teens getting sliced and ""nightmare-ified"".

Horror Classic,"A Nightmare on Elm St. Is many things at once. It's one of the quintessential 80s horror flicks...defining a decade where horror was quite prolific...it gave birth to the legendary icon that is Freddy Kruger (Robert Englund)...who now sits proudly among Frankenstein's monster and Count Dracula in the halls of horror... and it certainly is one of Wes Craven's best films, in a solid career of genre filmmaking. Most of all, it's a damn good horror flick!Wes Craven gives us a cast of likable teens haunted by the malevolent specter of a child molester that their parents murdered after he was freed on a technicality. Now vengeance comes when they are at their most vulnerable...while they sleep. And that's what makes this work so well. We all know how vulnerable we are when we are sleeping and Craven uses that fear to not only draw the audience in, but present us with some unsettling and spooky dream sequences where Freddy torments and then finishes off his victims.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sweet Dreams,"As one who just watched this for the first time, I have to give an honest rating and not one based on cult staus.The story and Krueger character are great, but the acting by pretty much all accounts is atrocious; young Johnny Depp was no exception, albeit he got much better with practice. With horror movies that's usually secondary anyways, but still. The editing certainly doesn't help. Nevertheless, it still manages to evoke terror with its kill scenes.It's almost sacrilege that I'm writing this review on Friday the 13th. Perhaps it's a sign to watch 'Freddy vs Jason' next... oh boy can't wait.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dreamy horror flick.,"This is the horror flick that will give you nightmares, about a group of friends living on Elm Street trying to stop the evil spirit of Freddy Krueger, a clawed killer who stalks young victims in their dreams.Like the horror flicks of the late 1970s to the 1980s, this film is one of the first original slasher movies of its kind and holds well on its own, spawning a set of sequels and remakes. It has some very creepy and scary moments that will jump out at you and will make you cover your eyes.The plot is pretty basic, though, with lots of people hiding, slashing and screaming - not much substance to the story. The acting was mostly campy with cheesy dialog, but it was cool seeing Johnny Depp in his movie debut. The overall atmosphere and cinematography of the film have this lazy, dreamy and emotionless feeling, probably wanting to give the audience the impression of a dream; however, and I think it gives the film a lackluster and somewhat boring feel.You will get some good scares out of the film, but the plot somewhat goes all over the place, living you a bit confused in the story at first.Grade C",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
In the top 5 best horror movies,"Wes Craven has made some brilliant horror films in his time, but this is definitely his best.Nancy Thompson and her friends are stalked by a deranged serial killer, but instead of the original plot line of this happening in real life, they're being hunted when they're at their most vulnerable.Including Johnny Depp in his first ever performance (Although you really won't recognise him!), this movie will take your breathe away, and really, I'm not exaggerating!Overall, amazing music, lots of jump scenes, outstanding special effects for the time it was made (and still great today), a story line that nobody has ever thought of before and great acting, this movie has got to be one of my favourites of all time, and not just horror. Well done Wes Craven! You're a genius!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Realistic effects in a pre CGI slasher horror film,Classic US slasher horror film from the 1980s by genre master Wes Craven. It really is difficult to believe the film was released back in 1984 in an era where technology looks so primitive! Take for example the black and white portable television's and ghetto blasters with audio cassette players!The film is about a group of US teenagers terrorised in their nightmares by a very ugly bloke characterised with metallic knives for fingers and a hat. (Freddy Kreuger played by Robert Englund). Kreuger was a notorious child killer years before in their parents generation and his murderous bloody reign is back. However he features in the world of sleep. The film was directed by master horror film maker Wes Craven. The cast includes a teenage Johnny Depp. Its success spawned several sequels as franchise films hit off in the eighties. The effects still look realistic today despite the lack of CGI in those days. Make up effects and masks obtaining the desired effects.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the many Movies That Will Never Die,"I've seen almost every classic iconic horror movie that most people find to be terrifying. But this is the one movie that blows all other horror icons out of the water, there is no way anyone can say the first Freddie film isn't scary. Wish I could say the same for the other Freddie knock- offs but I won't because they all were TERRIFYINGLY AWFUL. What in God's name is more terrifying than a man who invades your dreams and can kill you if he gets to you in them? The answer is there isn't anything more terrifying, that's why this is one the best horror films ever to have hit the big screen. I saw this movie when I was 13... even now I'm still terrified of the whole concept of a dream invader.

A new and original approach to the slasher film,"It's quite hard separating A Nightmare on Elm Street from the franchise it spawned. Freddie Krueger became one of the icons of the 80's. Because of this he became completely unscary. You can't really blame the first film for this development however. What director Wes Craven did here I guess was to reimagine the possibilities of the slasher film. On the back of first Halloween and subsequently Friday the 13th, there was a bucket load of these types of movies released in the early 80's. It wasn't the most diverse genre either, and by 1984 it had more or less run its course; Craven's film took the basic idea of this sub-genre but expanded with a much more original approach. Out was the faceless killer who stalked a group of dumb half-naked teenagers and instead we had a weird supernatural villain who attacked his victims via their dreams. This was a much more original idea for a slasher film. It still had murder set-pieces but these ones involved people being dragged over ceilings and fountains of blood erupting out of beds. The surreal and dream-like moments are ultimately what make A Nightmare on Elm Street an interesting movie. Another unusual aspect is the teens themselves. They're actually sympathetic and not merely there to be killed in a state of undress. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with the more typical sleazy approach but it is notable and commendable that Craven chose to do things a different way for a change. It's not a perfect film by any means though and there are some cheesy moments. For example the scenes near the end where the heroine constructs home-made traps to snare Freddie in were dangerously close to MacGyver territory. But overall, it's an interesting movie in places.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not effective anymore.,"I saw A Nightmare on Elm Street in 1985 on VHS and I loved it. Very much.I saw it many times during the eighties, and then one day I forgot about it.When the film arrived on DVD I watched it again: was it the same film I used to love on VHS?I didn't feel the same.It's strange because many films of this period are standing the test of time. But not this one.To be sure, I watched it again on HD yesterday.The concept is still cool, there are still some iconic moments and effects, there is the cool music too, but the film is not frightening, Freddy is more like a clown than a real monster, and most actors are bad.This film is just not effective anymore.No idea why it loses its impact with time.I give it a 6 because it was a major movie at the time, but if I were watching it today for the first time I would have give him a 4 (and it was a solid 10 for me in 1985; how strange is that?).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Disfigured Man with Razor Blades for Fingers,"This film begins with a teenage girl named ""Tina Gray"" (Amanda Wyss) having terrible dreams about a disfigured man with razor blades for fingers chasing her in the dark of night. Upon awakening she then proceeds to school and tells three of her friends about it. To her horror she finds that they too are having similar nightmares. Not knowing what else to do they gather at Tina's house that night while her mother is in Las Vegas and suddenly Tina's dream comes alive as she is sliced to death in bed while her horrified boyfriend ""Rod Lane"" (Jsu Garcia) looks on. Naturally, since there was nobody else seen in the room at the time Rod is arrested and charged for Tina's murder. However, while in his cell he too becomes a victim of the same disfigured man with razor blades for fingers-and the killer is just getting started. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie pretty much earned its place among other established slasher films of the time like ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" garnering $57 million dollars worldwide and competing quite successfully with those aforementioned franchises as well. In short, those who are looking for a good 80's slasher film should certainly be pleased with this particular picture and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fun 80's slasher.,"I love this movie because of the fact It's completely stuck in the 80's. It gives that vibe and it makes every scene a little bit more enjoyable. Freddy is enjoyable in every scene and gives off that scary yet somewhat of a funny vibe, and I really like that. If I have to criticize this movie for one thing is the main character is done HORRIBLE. I didn't believe her performance half the time and when Freddy stole the scene, I legitimately forgot she existed. The other characters are a little weak as well, but some are decently enjoyable like Johnny Depp. Altogether, its just a fun 80's slasher with some creative ideas at the end of the day. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Good Slasher Flick That Makes Little Sense,"The biggest problem with this movie comes from the fact you don't enter the dreaming state of sleep until much later in the sleep cycle, thus making this entire movie stupid and pointless./End Review Actually this is a pretty good slasher film. Freddy Krueger was a child killer back in the day and now haunts the nightmares of a group of kids. This eclectic bunch is nothing more than your typical horror movie cannon fodder. The main girl is about the only character that I enjoyed slightly, and even she wasn't great. The idea of her perhaps going insane rather than actually being in a horrible situation could have been used to much better effect. The whole movie seems like Inception where there is a dream within a dream within a dream. There's no physics or laws that Freddy works within and he appears pretty much everywhere. That's why I'm led to believe this is dream within dream territory.Nonetheless some of the effects are really good, Freddy can be really funny and has a lot of personality for a slasher villain, and the movie, overall, is a relatively good example of the genre. A little confused but definitely watchable and fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

First of all, A Nightmare on Elm Street flirts with the viewer, breaking the line between the real and fictional. Given the small budget of the film, it surprises both cinematography and a really smart script for a teenage horror. And Freddie Krueger himself as a character is registered, this is the first scary character since the original Halloween that can scare the viewer.

Classic Horror that bleeds into the films of today,"A Nightmare on Elm Street is the first movie in a series of films that did become the ""typical horror movie"" but this one doesn't suffer from it.

"Run of the Mill Horror,","A Nightmare on Elm Street is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and an average cast. The main antagonist is certainly not a let down, Freddy Krueger is extremely chilling every moment he is on screen. The intensify and presence of Robert Englund in this role makes it come as no surprise that the character would go on to become iconic.As far as horrors go, it is quite predictable. Maybe it was groundbreaking for its time, but for today's standards, we can see every jump scare that is coming from a mile away, every shocking moment, it never genuinely thrilled me.The dialogue in the film is also very poor. It is all very typical and delivered by its performers in a very fake, unbelievable manner. Even actors who would go on to show off their talent as a performer, such as Johnny Depp, failed to do anything effective with this horrendous dialogue.While it may be a classic for some, it never did anything mind blowing for me. It's certainly entertaining, but A Nightmare on Elm Street has shown signs of aging, might be a fun horror to watch with friends, but I would not highly recommend it.A child murderer takes his revenge on the children of the mob who killed him.Best Performance: Robert Englund / Worst Performance: Heather Langenkamp",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Classic,"Nightmare on Elm Street, A (1984)*** (out of 4)Craven's now classic thriller about four teens battling a burned maniac (Robert Englund) who stalks them through their dreams. I've never been a fanatic over this series but I don't think there's any denying that this first entry is a very strong staple of the genre. Craven's tight direction really makes this film but there are also some very good performances thrown in to make it even stronger. Heather Langenkamp has a certain mature nature that really comes through that makes her character very believable. The young Johnny Depp is also enjoyable to watch, although you certainly can't watch this and predict what would eventually become of him. John Saxon is the one who doesn't get enough credit for his performance as is Ronee Blakley. Then, of course, there's Englund with his terrific performance as the now legendary Freddy Krueger. In the end I think most of the film's credit has to go to Craven who really builds up an incredible atmosphere, which stalks this film from start to finish. The opening sequence in the boiler room doesn't show too much but at the same time it perfectly sets up the mood of what's to come. The dream sequences are also very well handled and a lot of them come off very disturbing. People can debate on what the studio would do to the character of Freddy over all the sequels but he had a purpose in this first film and it wasn't to make people laugh or telling funny one-liners.",,Anonymous,Horror
33 Years Later,"Nowadays, with the world wide web, countless social media and mass advertising how can one not know the name Freddy Krueger? A Nightmare On Elm Street is the most iconic horror film of the '80s and is constantly referenced in pop culture, such as Stranger Things (2016), It (2017) and Rick and Morty (2013).Such hype and praise really raised my expectations for this film.Sadly, these 91 minutes of film I got was a rather forgettable experience.It may have been ahead of it's time, but the uninspiring cast of characters and their progression is very outplayed in the year 2017. A leather jacket wearing jock, the dumb blonde, the not-so-bright boyfriend and the girl who knows what's actually going on. As the mystery becomes clearer, one by one they get killed off by the horror icon.The thing is, this horror icon I am speaking of is still incredible. Robert Englund and the make up department were mostly responsible for the reason people like this film. No one is going to root for those teenagers, when there's such a great antagonist out there.This film is about as '80s as it gets. The sounds and opening title indicate this a lot, and that's fine. But I feel like the only reason people like this film so much is because of Freddy (which is a fair argument) and plain nostalgia for the setting.All in all, not as good as I expected, but I can understand why A Nightmare on Elm Street can be considered a cult classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

There's humor and horror. He's fully committed to the role. Wes Craven nailed the character and Robert Englund delivered it to perfection.Nancy, our main character, is active. That's a welcome change. She plans to fight, creates traps, and will survive at any cost. It's a refreshing take on the typical ""female lead"" horror trope.It's still a slasher at heart.

"Classic, Horror that changed everything",I don't dish out 10/10 scores easily but Nightmare on Elm St can score nothing else.This movie redefined what a horror movie can be and brought one of the most iconic villains ever created. Robert Englund's portrayal of the infamous Freddy Kruger is faultless. He is scary and sinister with one advantage over other slasher villains of the time... He Speaks!No silent kills from a super strong killer who can't be hurt. This is a killer who toys with his victims adding an element of terror that the likes of Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees lack.The script is unique and original taking us away for the basic formats that are the back bone of slasher movies. Adding the element of dreams no only made the whole concept scarier but it allowed complete creativity for the film makers which is apparent right from the off.I had expected the visual effects to look poor by todays standards but the reliance on practical effects have allowed this movie to hold up if not better many modern movies. The scene with Freddy over Nancy's bed is noting short of spectacular.All in all this is the perfect horror movie and Wes Craven's masterpiece. A must see for any fan of horror!,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Whatever you do, don't fall asleep...","I grew up on the slasher movies from the 1980's; those being ""Friday the 13th"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Halloween"". And this first installment from 1984 in the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise is certainly entertaining, but it lacked the zest that was established with the Freddy Krueger character in the later movies. And as such, then this first movie just turned out to be an adequate slasher movie. But all beginnings need to start somewhere.I assume that you will already be familiar with the storyline, especially if you are a fan of the horror genre. But shortly recapped, then it is about a deviant killer who strikes terror and deals death to the youth of Elm Street from the dream world.Granted that the Freddy Krueger character and the story concept was refreshing to the slasher genre of the early 1980's, then I just doesn't find this movie to be all that outstanding, especially compared to the later movies.Heather Langenkamp was quite good in the role as Nancy, a she carried the movie quite nicely. And being more than overly familiar with the movies, then it is a nice character that she will reprise again in later movies. Robert Englund was a great choice for the Freddy Krueger character, just a shame that he didn't have the chance to be as much in-your-face with the Krueger wits and jokes as he is in the following movies.The effects were quite good, and having good effects in a slasher movie is a must. Especially as the effects can be a deal breaker for the movie if they are bad.While it is a no secret that Freddy Krueger is not my favorite of slasher characters, then he is a close runner up. I like the part that he kills in people's dreams and the dark, perverted humor that he has. His appearance is also remarkable and it is one that is easily remembered.All in all, a fairly adequate start to the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
not as good as i remember,"Nightmare was my favorite horror movie growing up.  It used to give me my own nightmares after late night viewings.  I recently watched Nightmare again and was completely disappointed.  I was never scared in the least, the F/X were prehistoric, and the acting was atrocious.  Heather Langenkamp, though young at the time, is horrible.  Her mother in the flick is even worse.  Johnny Depp is also quite poor in this movie, though I liked him in Gilbert Grape and Ed Wood.  There is definitely no hint in Nightmare of his potential.I give this flick a 3/10.  It is watchable and is not laughable as some horror films can be.  That being said, it is not very good.  It is clearly not in the same league as Halloween.  It isn't even as good as Craven's more recent offerings.  It's on a par with the Friday the 13th movies and that is not a complement.

The iniquities of the father (and mother) are to be visited upon the children,"Horror movies have always derived their power from monsters: those figures which inhabit realms we dare not go for fear of the unspeakable things that may be done to us. In early horror movies, by way of extension of folklore, these monsters lived under the bed, in the shadows, in the woods, or among desolate ruins¬Öall those places that parents warn their children not to go and where we (if possessed of sense) actively choose to avoid. However, with Freddy Krueger, writer/director Wes Craven presented us with a monster that lives, and kills, in a place all of us have no choice but which to visit every night: our dreams.In addition to this unique twist on folklore, 'Elm St.' supplies Freddy with a richly developed back story which distinguishes him from the other slasher genre anti-heroes Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Leatherface in delivering an archetypal punch as well as the classic movie monsters like Dracula and Frankenstein in its wholly contemporary nature. In the original writing, Freddy was penned as a child molester before being changed to ""merely"" a child murderer for the film, who is assaulted and killed by a vigilante mob of parents who cover up their dastardly deed and set about raising their children to be well-adjusted and wholesome members of society. However, Freddy returns to enact his revenge by stalking their children in their dreams.As such, the film could be said to contain a criticism of the hypocrisy of society's moral rectitude which, looked at in a larger context, is the same hypocrisy which is offended by bad language but which supports unjustified wars like the then-recent memory of Vietnam. However, Freddy's genesis is not only found in the mal-formed reflection of society at large but also the very personal fears of Craven himself: Craven had been bullied at school by a child named Fred Krueger (and indeed, an alternative title for Craven's debut 'Last House on the Left' was 'Krug and Company', after the lead villain's name), while Freddy's dirty clothes and hat was inspired by a homeless man he saw as a child who scared the bejesus out of him. All of this enables Freddy to effectively straddle the role of a personal and societal monster.However, let not this abstract chin-stroking fool you ‚Äì 'Elm St.' is possessed of a crushingly claustrophobic atmosphere unmatched in any slasher film (save perhaps 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre') due to the convincing nightmare-you-can't-wake-up-from vibe many people will recognise from personal experience. In addition, it's a darn sight more gory than notable slasher entries like 'Halloween' or 'Black Christmas' and the explicitly supernatural element adds an imaginative dimension to the ""kills"" unmatched in the genre (as the Johnny Depp bed scene (calm down ladies, it's not like that) will testify) and all pulled off without CGI. Things are rounded off nicely with a decent set of performances from ""final girl"" Heather Langenkamp, Johnny Depp (in his film debut), 70s/80s horror stalwart John Saxon and a host of lesser known talent who, albeit as Freddy-fodder, nonetheless deliver solid performances which flesh out the 'Elm St.' universe¬Öall to the accompaniment of an effective and eerie score and the infamous ""one, two Freddy's coming for you"" children's rhyme.Like 'Friday the 13th' and 'Halloween', 'Elm St.' became a franchise: spawning a host of sequels (of varying degrees of quality from barely passable to painfully awful), a TV series (which continued the trend of Freddy as hip king of the one-liner), and all manner of merchandise which effectively de-clawed the grim visage of Freddy and offered him up to our consumerist society as merely another innocuous product. However, even with the bad taste of the franchise in the mouth, the fact that 'Elm St.' holds up well to repeat viewing even today and still retains the power to chill newcomers, is truly a testament to the quality of this mould-breaking supernatural slasher which stands as an exemplary example of what horror can, neigh, should be.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolute classic in the horror movie genre !,"What can I say about this gem that hasn't been said. Nothing .. Almost everybody loves this film and for a good reason. Made with a small budget A Nightmare on Elm Street is amazing accomplishment from the late Wes Craven. The practical effects are just jaw-dropping. They don't seem dated at all for me and they are waaaay better than the cgi crap we are witnessing today in the horror movies with the super unrealistic blood and the films as a whole. Johnny Depp's death is still one of the best and most brutal deaths i have ever seen in a horror movie, it is just amazing how many blood was used in this thing! First death of the franchise (i don't remember the girls name) was astonishing and creepy as well.On to Freddy Krueger, who is at his best here. Not many words spoken, no jokes, just a frickin psycho.. The characters here are very neatly chosen, they are interesting and you root for them which is a rarity in horror movies. Nancy is one of the best female characters in an old school horror movie which i can remember. The acting is good, not great, but the story is captivating and cool so there is a balance.I saw this film late in my years - i think 2014 and i knew almost every line and scary scene in the film, but it was still great and memorable , scary as well.With so much great and quotable scenes A Nightmare on Elm Street is and will always be a true classic, and the go-to for every horror movie fan that can call himself that way.

"A menagerie of creative kills and set-pieces, but not a classic.","In typical horror movie fashion, the characters in this film are boooring. Heather Langenkamp does a good job developing Nancy as she goes through the grief and distress of the film, but the other performances are just fine, nothing more. Even Robert Englund's iconic Fred Krueger is just a hammy villain with goofy dialogue.Fred's backstory is more interesting than Fred himself, and Marge's involvement with Fred's death is a nice reveal. Generally, the plot unfolds at a good pace and doesn't really slog at any point - the film opens with a nightmare, and soon after we see the first murder. The murders after that cross over with Nancy herself being haunted by Fred in some pretty creative (and visually compelling) nightmare sequences. I admire the way the film seamlessly and unpredictably blurs the line between dreams and reality, although the dream-within-a-dream ending stretches things and becomes incoherent.While I don't like the silly nursery rhyme (in fact, horror movies making children's things creepy in general is just lazy), the film has a neat synth score. I wasn't blown away by the cinematography outside of specific set-piece moments (Fred looming over Nancy in bed, Tina appearing to Nancy in a bloodied body bag, the whole bathtub scene), and some of the special effects were lame but admittedly charming (mannequin Marge being dragged through the window, Fred's super-long arms). The revolving room effects sequences are deservedly iconic though.There are some religious and sexual undertones to be found, but they're too vague and don't amount to much. The least a slasher movie can do though, no matter how boring the characters, is at least have fun and creative kills, and that's something this film has in spades.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A True Supernaturally Great Horror Flick,"Ladies and gentlemen, here we have an R-rated series a lot of you guys know well, even for non-horror flick guys, series is otherwise, A Nightmare on Elm Street. It started on a very high note with this first film directed and written by the great late Wes Craven, a man incredibly talented with the horror genre, from the studio of New Line Cinema, which was close to bankruptcy at the time in the year 1984.The film involves mid-western teenagers falling prey to Freddy Krueger, a disfigured midnight mangler that goes after and kills the teenagers in their dreams, which, in turn, kills them in reality. Freddy Krueger himself is played by the great actor Robert Englund. He does a fantastic job here, showing some terrifying presence while at the same time having some slightly humorous moments, which is something most horror-movie villains lacked at the time.After investigating the phenomenon, Nancy, played by Heather Langenkamp, who does a great deal of acting here and shows how her character feels through all of this, begins to suspect a dark secret kept by her parents. Don, played by the great John Saxon, who also does a fantastic job with his role, just wants to keep everyone safe from danger. Marge, played by Ronee Blakley, does a great job displaying emotions and so forth, later explains Freddy's dark origins to Nancy when she learns more about Freddy himself in her dream.This dark secret involving Freddy that they keep hiding also applies to her friends' parents and may be the key to unraveling the mystery. However, can Nancy and her boyfriend Glen, played by Johnny Depp in his first movie role, solve everything else before it's too late?The movie has some significant build-up within' each scene, all of which are memorable, some of these include the school hallway and bathtub sequences building up to what Freddy Krueger is about to do, each kills that Freddy does against the teenagers, for example, Glen's death is very memorable and pretty new and aspiring for the time, although the final scene is pretty laughable. Many memorable quotes are also in the movie such as ""This.... Is God!"" and ""Come to Freddy!""The characters are very memorable for a slasher horror film like Nancy Thompson, who is the primary focus and who we root for and can relate to her fear and desire to stop Freddy. Don Thompson, Nancy's father, wants to protect everyone from awful situations while denying Freddy's existence. Freddy Krueger, arguably the best character, is a scary menace that can kill you in your dream and causes you to die in real life. Glen Lantz, Nancy's boyfriend, and the others trying to solve the case with her. Marge Thompson, Nancy's mother, eventually reveals some of the origins behind Freddy Krueger. Tina Gray, the first person killed by Freddy Krueger, leads some becoming aware of his existence. Lastly, Rod Lane, the boyfriend of Tina, is falsely accused by the heads of being responsible for murdering Tina.The acting is fantastic in this movie, each character feels believable, and you can easily feel the emotion, fear, and terror they have in the movie, which makes you help but feel sorry that these people that you can easily like get killed. However, the best part about this movie is none other than the Freddy Krueger actor himself, Robert Englund, his performance as Freddy is easily the best and gives out a terrifying scary presence in this movie, with some memorable moments in each scene he's in whether it's something visual scenery or a quote he may say.The characters are pretty smart, which is unusual for most horror films around this period. In most horror films, the characters often stupidly get themselves killed by the murderer coming after them after they try to figure out ways to stop Freddy's madness while also trying to figure out why everything is going out this way. One exception is Tina, played by Amanda Wyss, who does an alright job with her role, whose character stops running after Freddy tells her to watch him cut off his fingers before killing her.The settings in the movie itself are beautifully executed in this film, with this film while there are two settings within' the world, those being the real and dream worlds. However, it gives you that feeling where at times you cannot entirely tell what's happening whether it's happening in real life or happening in someone's dream. Especially when the dream sequences usually are often set around real-life settings so anything could happen if this were to possibly happen in real life. The film's premise seems to revolve around the struggles between dreams and reality, which are manifested by the lives and dreams of the teens in this film, which is truly able to toy toward the audience's perceptions between the boundaries of imagination and real life.The special effects are astonishing when they're used, whether showing the dream sequences, the gore effects, or any fantasy-like effect such as whenever Freddy's around. The designs of each costume and makeup are great, particularly with Freddy Krueger who looks pretty terrifying, especially when he's in the dark, giving out a dark and mysterious look behind him as we're not entirely sure of what he truly is if he's real or just a legend. The lighting is especially nice, with the dark stuff being very dark though you can still see nicely, this especially applies to Freddy Krueger, who looks pretty unsettling to look at with this.The music in the film is extremely memorable and truly captures the fear and scare factor between the dream sequences when the teenagers are pleading for help as Freddy's coming, or when tension comes in between the two worlds, the music fits well when it's necessary with the scene to create a huge impact with the scene itself.There are some flaws that I have against the movie, but they're incredibly minor, so they don't ruin the movie that much. One example is how oblivious the character Tina can be. Some slightly noticeable errors in some scenes like how Freddy's hat may appear in one shot but disappear in the next shot, as well as the other way around for it. Some of the special effects also didn't entirely age well like some of the scenes during the last bit of the film where it's a dummy used and it looks pretty laughable.Overall, I highly recommend it to anyone that isn't scared of horror movies or is just a big horror movie fan in general, it's one of the best horror films in the entire horror genre of all time. However, if you're neither of those, this is not a movie you'd enjoy, it has some genuinely scary scenes that can make you feel worried or jump easily. In the end, this movie is an outright fantastic horror flick and one of the best in the slasher and supernatural genres of horror, but also the horror genre as a whole, you horror flick guys will love it!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The beginning of the franchise, and the early suggestion of problems with it.","I'll hand it to Wes Craven.He can construct a fairly original story, and throw in just the right amount of scary twists at us to keep us watching. Even with being 22 years old, Nightmare still smells and looks fresh (save for some of the items that have been updated since). The idea of having someone take your life in your dreams is just an interesting one that has yet to be done as well, if at all, since the franchise's run during the 1980's. The death sequences are imaginative, and make others pale in comparison. This movie was popular at the time for a reason (and gave Johnny Depp a name as well). They are all done very well done for 1984, especially considering they all would be benefiting from the help of CGI if the movie was remade today.Another interesting thing to note, is how the characters aren't dumb like the casts in their horror film brother and sisters (read: Friday the 13th). They genuinely have no idea what's going on with their dreams, and the Freddy Kreuger cover-up only adds to this fact. They attempt to avert the inevitable, but just end up failing. Whereas most horror just have the characters being complete morons, and walking right into their fates with no chance of thinking before hand. The heroine in this picture genuinely has ideas for what to do, and fights to try and get them to work. She is the one who set the clich√© up for future generations of horror films, and you can just see the beauty of the original idea playing out in the movie. And while Kreuger had yet to become the smart-ass he was in other films, his creepy presence only adds to the genuine scares of the film (and he is pretty witty in some instances).The problem with the film is how the film falls apart after it all sets up completely. The entirety of the final 30 minutes of the film are just silly, and do no justice to the rest of the film. The ending is absolutely awful, and makes the clich√©s of today look absolutely brilliant. It looks entirely half-baked, and too well appreciated for its own good. It had the makings for something that really should continue to live on in 2006, and just dissolved faster than it was made. It just stops making sense. Yes, you need to have an open mind, and just let the movie play out without using your brain, but if you're left sitting there completely not understanding one thing that just happened, what kind of payoff is that?Craven had created a great horror film, and simply, he just didn't know how to make it play out. A number of things could have been done to make his status even greater than it was after this, and one is definitely to allow it to make sense.Adding more sense to the finale of the picture would have benefited greatly, in 1984 or in 2006. It would have added so much more to this memorable film, and really made the sequels pale in comparison. I will say though, it was a hell of a way to make a name for yourself Craven.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the greatest slashers of all time!,"If you're a slasher or horror fan and haven't seen this film, where have you been for the past 35 years? This is one of the greatest slashers ever released and it's not one of the earlier one but it still brought new concepts. I will avoid the synopsis since over 700 other reviewers have gone over it, so instead I'll go over what this film succeeds and fails at. First the acting is some of the best in the genre with Robert Englund who was fantastic and it also has the debut of Johnny Depp. Next on Freddy Krueger this is the best he's ever been and is before he went really goofy. Next the kills and gore are amazing and the practical effects, right from the get go you can tell this film is something else. The music is also really good and also is the origin of one of the best horror theme songs of all time. The atmosphere and tone are also amazing and can't get much better. This film also has more suspense than any other films in the series. The only problem i have with this film is the ending, no spoilers of course. Overall check this film out it's widely available on DVD, blu ray and streaming services.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A good urban legend flick, but best as a meta film","This review will go into the film's merits as well as its most gaping flaw.By now, you've surely seen many movies and shows that imitate or reference this classic horror. So you might wonder: can it still surprise you and thrill you, or is all the surprise ruined like Rosebud in Citizen Kane? Simply put, it's a thrill alright. This film is full of utterly unique and creatively creepy ideas that have never been successfully imitated. You can tell the cast and crew put a ton of energy into this production; the dream scenes are both extremely spooky and just plain fun.The film doesn't beat around the bush or give you infodumps about how the nightmares work. It just jumps into its Twilight Zone concept, truly embracing its genre of horror-fantasy. It piques your imagination and puts you on the edge of your seat during the tense parts, especially in the claustrophobic cat-and-mouse finale. Almost 40 years later, the film's style still feels like an innovative breath of fresh air.By now, you surely know the premise: a killer stalks teens in their nightmares, and when they die in their dreams, they die in real life--often in very bloody and messy ways, at that! So the plot is a thrill, but what about themes? The story's themes are pretty familiar territory for slashers. But when you step back and look at the film's meta-themes, there is some darker, deeper stuff at work here.For instance, if you're watching as an adult, you'll probably notice how exploitative the film is towards its teen actors. The movie is glad to give glamorous shots of half-naked teens, showing off the boys' muscles and as much as they could of the girls--after all, we all know sex sells. But this is a movie where the villain is a child molester who sexually assaults teens onscreen; the villain's actions are presented as evil, yet director Wes Craven (a middle-aged 45 year old man when he made this film) is utterly shameless in objectifying his teens for profit.This hypocrisy is utterly disgusting. If you're actually thinking while you watch the film, you will probably find that its exploitation (and lack of integrity) is a huge drawback that makes it harder to enjoy the movie.And so, if you really want to enjoy this film, it works best to view it as a meta-horror. It is a psychological tale of a director, Wes Craven, a middle-aged man who makes a movie about his idealized, sexy teens. He creates a scene where two teens have cartoonishly loud, screaming sex while a virgin boy listens obsessively--a scene that clearly reflects Wes' own intense preoccupations. We see a dirty old man living out both his sexual fantasies and his sexual insecurities through teens, like a stunted Peter Pan wannabe who never accepted his own adulthood.That statement might sound like a stretch, but it simply isn't--Wes' rejection of adulthood is on full display here. He portrays every single adult in the film as a useless loser or an adversary. In appearance, the adults all range from frumpy and homely to downright monstrous, making the teens even MORE idealized in comparison. The heroine is Craven's flawless dream girl: smart and brave but also vulnerable and fine with getting half-naked for his camera. We never even learn about the characters' interests; she is just Craven's tool. He presents her as sexy, but it's important that she's virginal because that childlike innocence makes her more exciting to Craven. Craven's next step is making a villain who embodies all of his dirty-old-man qualities, allowing him to self-flagellate but also revel in his sleaziness, entertaining people with it, making it charming and fun. His idealized girl degrades and dominates Craven's shame-avatar Freddy... and yet Freddy gets what he wants in the end.If you just take the film as a story, it has some great spooky scenes and a tense, satisfying ending. If you take the film as a whole, then its exploitation will detract from its appeal. But if you take it as a meta-story about a twisted director who exploits teens, self-flagellates for it, but ultimately embraces his sleaziness because it's profitable, you will find some a thought-provoking psychological tale here (as well as a shining example of Hollywood's usual hypocrisy).Whether you enjoy this film for the surreal, gory spectacle or for its meta-narrative value, I can confidently recommend it for sheer horror value.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The birth of a franchise.,"After watching the 2010 re-make of this film I dug the old one out of moth balls so I could compare the two films. It had been about 15 years since I last saw the original and I have to say my opinion has not changed on how I felt about the old one, whether it was 1984, 1995 or 2010. I was glad that the sands of time did not change how I felt. It was painful to hear the ridiculous 80s canned-music, but I was able to get passed it. When I look back I remember that this film really hit the mark back in 1984. I remember that it was popular, did not anger the critics and made some good cash, plus it spawned seven sequels that racked-up $340,000,000 worldwide at the box office. After the success of Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees it was time for Freddy Kreuger, but the difference here was a supernatural sub-plot that was on a much higher level, in the fact that Freddy can kill his victims through their dreams, when Jason and Michael just kill. So, that was the part that the writers had to sell to the audience. Another plot device that helped this film move along was the schlocky dark-comedy aspect of it. Freddy drops all kinds of jokes and one-liners for comic relief and Robert Englund definitely sells it and sold it well. He would be Freddy in every one of the sequels and some people are mad that he wasn't in the 2010 remake. Not me though. I think after eight films spanning 19 years that was good enough. Great jog Rob, but let's reboot this thing. Anyway, back to the original film. The structure of this film is quite good, in the fact that, with the introduction of each character, each one feels like they could be the main character until Freddy knocks them off and you think, ""Wow, now what""? Each character had a pretty-good back story, not like the characters that Michael and Jason had to deal with. There are a few things that seem to be missing in the plot and I can't say anymore here, but the film somehow sells it. It must have if it spawned seven sequels and a remake 26 years later. The cast was tough, and I mean the acting, but this film also has a place in film history as being the first film for Johnny Depp. Oh, and John Saxon is John Saxon. What I thought back in 1984 and what I thought in 2010 was that I saw a new kind of horror franchise in the making that entertains with a little silliness thrown in.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A True Classic,"I was still young when I watched this movie for the first time, probably too young in my opinion. This is without a doubt the scariest idea any movie director as ever come up with, and all due to a great crew and cast, such as the great Wes, or the ever supporting Robert Shaye. It is such a great idea, mostly because of the psychological effect it tends to have on people. It is when we are unguarded and helpless (like in a dream) that we feel most desperate and we can feel the true nature of fear. A note to the cast of course, with such great actors like Robert Englund (they couldn't have chosen a better Freddy), the debut of Johnny Depp or even the under rated Heather Langenkamp. This truly is the scariest movie made and any other sequel (except for the new nightmare) is somewhat low (especially the fourth and the fifth).",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The sequels were certainly unnecessary!,"¬ëLast House on the Left' (1972) and ¬ëThe Hills Have Eyes' (1977) director Wes Craven brought us this eerie and unnerving horror movie which went on to create one of the most highly recognised characters in the history of horror. The teenagers of Springwood are all suffering from nightmares and in a bizarre coincidence it turns out that they are all dreaming about the same man. When her friends start being slaughtered in their sleep it occurs to Nancy Thompson (Heather Lagenkamp) that perhaps these nightmares are actually reality.Long before Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) became the wise-cracking, anti-hero he is known as today he was a dark and menacing monster who took sadistic pleasure in methodically slaughtering teenagers. ¬ëA Nightmare on Elm Street' features sparse amounts of the humour that the sequels were beset with, and is all the more better for it. By 1984 Wes Craven had established himself as one of the great up and coming horror directors. His controversial exploitation flick ¬ëThe Last House on the Left' had thrust him into the horror limelight and his subsequent offering, ¬ëThe Hills Have Eyes', won several awards and established Craven as one of the most exciting horror directors. It was therefore only fitting that ¬ëA Nightmare on Elm Street' retained the ugliness and gloominess that had made his earlier films so enduring. Except for sporadic moments of black humour, ¬ëA Nightmare on Elm Street' is a dark and unsettling horror movie which features a truly frightening premise. Ingeniously playing on an already fear-provoking experience, the movie takes the idea further and gives it a startling realism.¬ëA Nightmare on Elm Street' is an imaginative, bloody and surreal movie that rises above other 80's slashers such as ¬ëFriday the 13th' for its slick direction and character development. Unlike slasher villains such as Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees who were almost robotic in the way they senselessly slaughtered, Krueger is an animated sadist with a real purpose behind his killing. Craven built ¬ëA Nightmare on Elm Street' on a brilliant premise and dexterously blurred the lines between fantasy and reality. That is not to say that ¬ëA Nightmare on Elm Street' is a flawless movie, there are times when the film seems to drag and the acting is not always up to par. On top of this the characters, although developed, remain typical slasher movie clich√©s. However, considering ¬ëA Nightmare on Elm Street' was made for a budget of just over $1million, the movie appears remarkably stylish and features low-grade special effects that are effective nonetheless. ¬ëA Nightmare on Elm Street' blends dark, atmospheric horror with an inventive and captivating premise; a quality that is somewhat rare in modern horror.It is little wonder that ¬ëA Nightmare on Elm Street' has become one of the most popular post-1970 horror movies. I recommend this for all fans of the horror genre that have not already seen it. Featuring interesting and well developed characters, a strong and imaginative premise and a dark, foreboding atmosphere throughout, ¬ëA Nightmare on Elm Street' is one of the staples of the horror genre and is certainly worth a look. My rating for ¬ëA Nightmare on Elm Street' ¬ñ 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Whatever you do, don't fall asleep!","Freddy Krueger has never been a nice guy, and death has not done anything to improve his mood or lack of respect for human lives. As a son of 100 lunatics, Freddy is a perfect example of bad genes' influences on behavior and personality, which is something every teenager on Elm Street is going to suffer from.'A Nightmare on Elm Street' can still freeze the blood of the toughest guy, and when Robert Englund does the lullabies and gets to the teenagers in their dreams, you'll be finding yourself filled with an unpleasant feeling.

Oh Boy! A five-fingered slasher!,"While Jason Voorhes a Neanderthal, Freddy Krueger(Robert Englund) is a total nutshell in the making.

Some of the scenes got some getting use to at times, I like the part where Johnny Depp's character gets electrocuted in his water-bed. I know electricity and water don't mix, but in a nightmare like this one, it gives a whole new meaning that you don't get electrocutes in baths and pools, but in a water-bed? Get real! Heather Langenkemp role as Nancy will always forever be memorable. The phone scene where my brother tells me was creepy, Freddy's tongue trying to reach Nancy? That'll make anyone's skin crawl. But boy can she fight back! The Freddy Krueger nursery rhyme is the most annoying thing in the movie, if you not careful, you might as well meet your end to him.

A Nightmare on Elm Street,"""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is, more or less, a pretty formulaic horror film in the sense that there's a killer on the loose who's murdering the cast one by one. Been there, done that etc. Stylistically-wise it's a so-so affair as well, with some of the horror sequences and effects being cheesy and others being nicely-made and well thought out. However it works quite effectively where other horror films only hint at: the killer as a symbol for sexual desire.As soon as the teenage cast becomes sexually active, whoosh, there comes the deformed monster Freddy Krueger (in their dreams of all places) to deal with them. Furthermore, their parents refuse to acknowledge the existence of Freddy (aka sexual libido), though Nancy's mother eventually admits to coming face to face with him in the past and killing him. It is also worth noting that the females (Nancy and Tina) both go on in their dreams looking for Freddy, whereas the males (Rod and Glen) seem oblivious to his existence and are much more easily murdered.""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" adds this twisted psychological framework in the background and that is why it's a worthwhile film to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Iconic Horror Film.,"A horror classic, Wes Craven reinvigorated the supernatural horror theme hinted at in the greatest horror film of all time Halloween and in the Friday the 13th sequels. Here he introduces the world to Freddy Krueger, an icon of post-modern slasher culture, which got so over the top in the sequels that he took the mickey with his self-referential return to the franchise, Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994). Aside from the freaking looking Freddy and his Fraudian scissor fingers, the key to this film being scary is the terror caused through sleep, a place where we seek solace and comfort...not any more! He expertly depicts a nightmare world inhabited by the dream demon Kruguer and conjures up numerous frightening revelations resulting in a pretty silly ending but the overall horror effect is pretty startling.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Nightmare on Elm Street,"""I'm gonna kill you slow""In the event of my death, please cease all life support systems that may be even biologically or genetically in place.Why?""This Is God!""I was young when I first saw Freddy in a dream, probably in my early teenage years. He was sitting in a greenish-yellow hued, dark room with nothing aside from a disappearing window that bleakly shown the light of a black moon through a white sky.Have I gone crazy since the night of that particular dream? Definitely.Have I recovered and became readjusted to the side of dreams that are more lucid and easier to mentally digest? Yes and no. It was in reality one of many nightmares that I had in my youth that I could not control, so it will always be my self-employed job to control myself during sleep.Am I still concerned that the dream may reoccur? Indefinitely. A quote, not from the original Nightmare on Elm Street, that I'll use here, is the one sentence spoke by the monster of my own unconscious creation, after a long night of staring dreadfully at the shrouded face of Freddy Kreuger. At the end of the dream he merely said this before hopping out the window.""I'll be back""A year before I was born, the masterwork of infamous director Wes Craven was released worldwide. It was unquestionably the most original work of horror in history."" Count myself a king of infinite space""The lucidity of the dreamer's is questionable. Is Freddy in charge of the dreams, or is he merely an invasive force that beckons them deeper into lucidity? It becomes apparent that the fearlessness of the heroes is partially an effect of the dreams, as we become acquainted with the characters whose fears of sleep become dangerously unhealthy. It's only when they fall asleep that their irrefutable anxiety becomes pure angst that lashes out at the filmviewer's conscience.Scream ""Stop!"" Scream ""Don't go down the stairs!""

Original fright feature,"My review was written in November 1984 after a Times Square screening.""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a highly imaginative horror film that provides the requisite shocks to keep fans of the genre happy. Absence of a powerful dramatic payoff will limit its breakout potential, however.Unlike the summer release ""Dreamscape"", which posed a nightmare vision within a farfetched science fiction framework, ""Elm Street"" relies upon supernatural horror. Young teenagers in a Los Angeles neighborhood are sharing common nightmares about being chased and killed by a disfigured bum in a slouch hat who has knives for fingernails. It turns out that years ago, the neighborhood's parents took deadly vigilante action against a child murderer, who apparently is vengeful haunting their kids.With original special effects, the nightmares are merging into reality, as teens are killed under inexplicable circumstances, starting with Tina Grey (Amanda Wyss), found dead in her room covered with blood. An interesting story structure has her start out as the film's heroine, with friend Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) taking over after Grey is killed early on.Writer-director Wes Craven tantalizingly merges dreams with the ensuing wakeup reality but fails to tie up thematic threads satisfyingly at the conclusion. Atmosphere is spooky with sustained suspense and admirable special effects work on a low budget. The young cast headed by Langenkamp is uniformly effective, for once believably approximating the look and behavior of young teens. Adult cast is strictly functional, with Robert Englund properly frightening under tons of monster makeup and Langenkamp's screen mom, Ronee Blakley, scoring in one riveting scene when she reveals the neighborhood's dark secret.",,Anonymous,Horror

The idea of an old man ( a legend you could say) who had a thing for molesting and killing small children in a boiler room, he ends up getting off the hook due to minor miscues and that prompts the parents of the dead children to form a mob and kill this man, well they did..except....There is this girl named Nancy who is having dreams along with her friends Tina, Rod and Glen about a guy wearing a green and red striped sweater with a burned/scarred face and he sports a glove customized with knive-blades for each finger, the mans calls himself Fred Krueger. The household of 1428 Elm Street in the town of Springwood is about to meet the 'slasher'. Have fun kids.......",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A classic...,"This is the one that started it all.  Freddy Kruger will always be the most interesting horror movie character, over Jason or Michael Mysers simply because of how innovative and creative he is with his kills.  You can't help but like Freddy because he's so cool.  He represents  a welcomed change from the straight up, 'see someone, kill them' mantra that both Myers and Jason share.  Seeing A Nightmare on Elm Street after all these years, it's still effective.  One of the best low budget horror films, starting the phenomenon of the iconic Freddy Kruger.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly good,"Basically about four teenagers who all have the same dream of being murdered which is caused by something their parents did in the past.When I saw the very beginning of A Nightmare on Elm Street yesterday I thought: ""Great..., yet another slasher-movie."" But I was soon to change my mind as the film ran. The very idea of the murderer existing in the teenagers dreams and that injuries/wounds which are obtained in the dreams transfer to the real world is brilliant.I must say that I am impressed with Heather Langenkamp's performance as Nancy. Also Johnny Depp was good in this very early role of his. It was fun to see him here before he became an established actor. Robert Englund was superb as Freddy Kreuger and he really did look evil! The film itself was only partly scary but the excitement lasted throughout. The gore was at a reasonable level, because in my opinion even slasher-movies can be too gory. I feel that the music was good but not great which prevents me from giving this a higher grade as music is a crucial part of horror-movies. Having said this, I have to give A Nightmare on Elm Street a well-deserved 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unique Story to go with everybody's favorite bad guy Freddy,"Nightmare on Elm Street was a clever story idea involving dreams and death. I believe the movie got some of its ideas from Phantasm, a movie released in 1979 that many probably don't remember. Nightmare also has Freddy Krueger(Robert Englund), a wisecracking killer who invades teenagers dreams and does very bad things. This movie and the Scream films are Wes Craven's most popular films.A group of teenagers who live on the same street begin to have dreams about a scarred killer who wears a blue and red sweater and a hat. He also has a razor glove on his hand. The dreams prove to be more than just dreams when some of the teenagers begin dying in their sleep with razor cuts caused by the razor glove the killer wears.But Freddy Krueger is not just any ordinary killer. He also has the ability to play with any dream reality, which makes it easier for him to get his victims while they dream and murder them. Of course one teen-aged girl named Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) is determined to fight back and get rid of the grisly fiend once in for all. Of course there is a reason Freddy is killing these particular teenagers, but for those who haven't seen any of the Nightmare films and know very little about them (which I doubt) I will not give that little secret away.This movie also starred Johnny Depp in his first movie role, as well as John Saxon and Ronee Blakely. It boasts very good special effects and gave us one of the most infamous undead villains in Freddy Krueger, putting him up their with Jason Vorhees from the Friday the 13th films and Michael Myers from the Halloween films.Like the Alien movies, one and two in particular, many people compare Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street. I found that though the first Halloween is better than all of these films put together, Nightmare on Elm Street contains the better sequels, and some of them weren't all that great either. Goes to show you what happens when you make sequels that end up just being gore films without any real suspense.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984),"For a low budget horror film in the mid-1980's. I thought it was pretty good. A lot better than the crappy sequels that followed. Yes there were a few visible errors in places. Palm trees in Ohio? But other than that it was still great. The story/screenplay was pretty good as well. The original A Nightmare On Elm Street is as classic as the original Friday The 13TH, being a slasher flick without really being a slasher flick. The funny thing with that film was that I think 99% of the film's budget was spent on fake blood. But in general it was pretty great.

"9, 10 Never Sleep Again!!!","A Nightmare on Elm Street, the iconic horror classic that spawned several sequels and even a remake, but this remains arguably the best of the bunch, and in Freddie Kruger still remains one of the most memorable horror antagonists of all time.A classic set in my favourite decade, the 1980s, a group of 4 students (including a young Johnny Depp) seem to plagued by mysterious nightmares, Tina Gray in particular seems to bear brunt of these vicious nightmares involving a strange burned man in a hat and red and black sweater, with knives for fingernails (Freddie Kruger).As the nightmares become more real, and even more vicious, tragedy strikes Tina and her wild boyfriend Rod Lane is wrongly accused and Tina's friend Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) is determined to prove his innocence, only her father Police chief Donald (John Saxon) isn't convinced.When Nancy's dreams intensify, her mother takes her to a dream specialist, and when she inexplicably brings something out of her nightmare, her parents are forced to tell her the truth about notorious child murderer Fred Kruger, killed by an angry mob of parents, it seems he has taken his revenge by haunting the dreams of the children of the parents of Elm Street.Nancy is determined to bring his murderous rampage to an end, by falling asleep and attempting one final battle, perhaps even bringing him out of her nightmare into the real world.An iconic horror which screams the 1980s, influenced by films earlier in the decade and even the 70s, this took on a life of its own, a monster which invades ones dreams (nightmares) is a very formidable foe, for everyone has to fall asleep at some point, right? This is a must see for any horror fans and those that love B-Movies (while not listed as such it does have many elements of B-Movies, and I say that as a good thing).
And the cast was good here too, great selection and directing by Wes Craven.A party horror film if you like, this is a great film to watch with a group of friends on a beer filled evening, so order the beers and a pizza, put your feet up and enjoy, a horror classic.8.5(rounded to 9)/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is an all time classic and easily the best Nightmare on Elm Street picture,"A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) is a movie I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a family with a teenage daughter, Nancy, who is experiencing a series of nightmares that causes weirder than normal teen behaviors. When she finds out her friends are having the same dreams, and they start dying by methods that appear to be by the man in their dreams, Nancy and her friends will band together to see if they can overcome the murderer. This movie is written and directed by Wes Craven (The People Under the Stairs) and stars Heather Langenkamp (New Nightmare), Johnny Depp (Sleepy Hollow), Robert Englund (Wishmaster) and John Saxon (Enter the Dragon). The storyline for this picture is so fun to watch unfold. The setting are well selected with perfect backdrops and sets. The opening introduction to Freddy in a dark stormy night on the streets was perfect. The tub and bed scenes in this are all time classic horror movie sequences. They also did a good job of depicting how teenagers and parents never seem to be on the same page when they talk. How fun is it to see a young Johnny Depp every time you see this? Still a shock he became what he did. Englund is fantastic as Kruger and the closing scene, with the nursery rhyme, is legendary. Overall this is an all time classic and easily the best Nightmare on Elm Street picture. I'd score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend seeing it and adding it to your collection.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Laughable dialogues,"I guess why I rated A Nightmare on Elm Street only 8 stars is because of the laughable dialogue, the inconsistencies and irregularities. For example, some things can come out of the dream when captured, such as the hat and (spoiler ‚Äì someone else) but then the trellis she doesn't even hold onto comes back with her. A feather from her pillow is seen floating but the mirror Fred crashes through survives. Nancy requests 20 minutes to capture the killer and still has time to set half a dozen traps, have a nice mother-daughter talk and fall into deep sleep. And Fred is only supposed to appear when one's asleep; yet, Nancy receives a call from him and the ending blows any of the story's mythos out the window. Literally.I'm not just talking about goofs, as all movies have them, but they set up a premise, a good and original one in a series of horror movies that relied on a masked killer stalking in the shadows. At least they tried here to change the trend. But, unfortunately, they kept breaking their own rules. It actually would've made more sense to have him as a ghost and then all bets are off. (Granted, he's sort of a ghost, but with rules.) As for the dialogue, though some of its iconic by now, it really doesn't hold up. A few years back, I saw A Nightmare on Elm Street in the theater for a one-night presentation. Being a huge fan, I arrived way early to get good seats, but still thought hardly anyone would show up. Well, it completely sold out. And to my surprise, everyone practically laughed all the way though it and it appeared both at and with the movie. I had to, myself. Even though I grew up on the series and loved them, the movie really was silly, namely for some of the lines, acting and characters ‚Äì Oh, that drunk mother! Alcohol should be part of any nutritious breakfast! I don't think the audience was really criticizing the movie, they were just having fun.Aside from negatives, I am still awarding the movie 8/10 due to the movie being enormously inventive, original, fun and despite Fred(dy) not being in it too much, he was extremely iconic, an instant super-villain. Also, I'm glad it started a cult following since a lot of the sequels explored a lot more and were, in a lot of ways, far superior to this original one. So, it did set the stage, introduced a whole new world and just as Jaws did for swimmers, this one did for sleepers. Only, with Jaws, you could choose to stay out of the water. Here, and in real life, you eventually have to sleep. Maybe for the last time.",,Anonymous,Horror

The way the character attacks in dreams and Wes Craven's direction in these scenes makes them very striking and really scary. The story is very interesting and the main characters are charismatic, even though they are generic teenagers, they have something captivating.

Englund isn't enough, despite doing a great job, to make this watchable, and neither is the incredibly promising plot or great special effects.The main character is incredibly annoying. It's not the actress's part, she was simply too young to play such a part. Even if she were able to deliver her lines, she's a kid, and kids don't act that way. In fact, people don't act that way.It's a film aimed at kids, so it shows the adults being rubbish and a teenager being super resourceful and so clued in on what's happening that it's like she read the script and no one else had one.

As horrifying as it is spellbinding.,"A Nightmare On Elm Street often gets called a ""slasher"", but if you ask me, the reason why this movie stands out and is so incredibly good is because it's not that all. It's incredibly original. This isn't some killer in a mask stalking teens, but a boogie man with a sinister personality toying with these kid's minds and psychologically torturing them before butchering them in supernatural and surrealistic ways that could only happen in your nightmares... but what normally would be a nightmare ends up crossing over into reality. They really die.I don't know about you, but when it's laid out like that it certainly doesn't come off as a Halloween clone to me. The movie's concept is truly AWESOME. It's a great example of an idea that's so good that it HAD to be made into a movie. Ideas this good can't go to waste.But it doesn't stop there. So many other things make this movie so good. The cast, fantastic. ESPECIALLY Robert England, give a truly iconic performance . The cinematography, colorful, vibrant and excellent. Practical special effects that don't come off as cheap and are so effective. The music, Charles Bernstein's score is absolutely HAUNTING and CREEPY... but it also knows how to ROCK us with its more intense sequences. I'm pretty sure Trent Reznor and other industrial musicians got their whole sound from Bernstein.Seeing this film was a defining moment in my childhood. I distinctly remember being absolutely terrified, but at the same time so compelled to keep watching because I found it to be so cool. The supernatural element really captured my imagination. I had never felt so entertained by a film's aesthetic while simultaneously feeling so scared.I am tempted to go into all my favorite parts of this movie, but that would take all night.

It deserves its rightful place in horror movie history,"Aside from its clunky ending, A Nightmare on Elm Street is my favorite horror movie of all-time. For starters, Freddy Krueger does not discriminate, and he will haunt your dreams no matter your age. Aside from Alien's ""In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream,"" ""Don't Fall Asleep"" is the second-best horror movie catchphrase of all- time.After Friday the 13th and the 80s slashers took the scene, Wes Craven came through with a whole different evil villain in Freddy Krueger, a former child murderer that kills kids in their dreams. I'm sorry, what?He got the idea from a string of stories ran in the LA Times about a young child that had survived the field killings in Cambodia. After a slew of nightmares, the young boy was found dead in his house after dying in his sleep. The police found a coffee pot in his closet with an extension cord running up under his bed and plugged into the wall. He obviously didn't want to fall asleep either.Craven ran with the story and created the most heinous, vile monster in horror movie history. With some Hitchcock elements spun throughout, A Nightmare on Elm Street is a fantastic ride from start to (almost) finish. The mood, music, atmosphere, shots, effects, blood, kills, and nightmares are all perfect. There are a few scenes that you watch and say ""Wow, that's a classic cinema shot,"" or ""Holy hell that's terrifying"". Some scenes make you feel like Freddy Krueger is actually out there waiting for you to fall asleep tonight.Heather Langenkamp, aka Nancy Thompson in the film, works perfectly here. All of the characters do really. There are some missed opportunities, sure, but it all works out and there are times throughout the film where you feel trapped inside a boiler room, a terrible nightmare or a dangerous place and think, ""Is this really happening to me?"" The ending is a bit clunky and takes the fear away a bit, but I also think that is part of the point. As Nancy fights back and becomes the ultimate bad-a#$, Krueger becomes less and less of a threat.Facing your fears is difficult, but Nancy shows us the courage and tenacity it takes to destroy an evil entity like Freddy Krueger. Or, does she?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A little originality goes a long way,"In 1984, there were several serial-killer flicks in which some unknown loser with a grudge murdered a long list of people who had other things in their lives to focus on. The Halloween franchise was up to a couple of episodes, and Friday The 13th was about to film what was purportedly its final chapter. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was in the midst of adding sequels, even. So what separates A Nightmare On Elm Street from an overcrowded market?In a nutshell, Wes Craven takes a clich√©d story and adds a fantasy element that makes the whole thing more plausible than any of its sequels have ever achieved. How he achieves this is simple. Instead of making the story about his villain, he focuses on one of the potential victims and their struggle to deal with some extremely unusual events. Everyone over the age of eighteen probably has a high school friend who died in unusual, tragic, or even violent circumstances, and that is the hook Craven uses to put the viewer into the film. Human drama will always win out over special effects and simulated violence.Where it begins to undo itself is that Nancy is the only character with more than one dimension. The cop hates teenagers because they're teenagers, the mother is a drunk for reasons we're still guessing at, and the teens who struggle against the villain are distinguishable only by how much the cop hates them. The villain is the one character who gets anything resembling a back-story, and his total screen time is little more than a third of the total feature.The special effects budget on the film was minimal, so the makers had to be a little more creative with how they shocked the viewer. Trick shots or cheated shots feature very heavily in this episode. This is a very good thing, as they are far more convincing than the myriad of expensive special effects that have followed, particularly in later sequels. The latest crossover episode in particular is bad in this regard. All the gloss and shine of Hollywood virtually leaps out in latter episodes, but none of the dramatic tension that exists here is even suggested later in the series.Overall, this is a five out of ten effort, but don't let that fool you. This is a textbook example of how much of an improvement a different idea can bring. In a film school, this would make a great example of how an active mind is far more important than financing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Still Very Frightening,"Wes Craven's horror classic holds up remarkably well, and remains a truly scary movie.Freddy was always a more chilling villain than Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees. Whereas the other two went about their ritualistic killings like zoned-out zombies, Freddy delights in his, and enjoys the fear his victims feel as he toys with them before he murders them as much as he enjoys the murders themselves. And he's just physically scarier as well: he runs, darts around, can pop up anywhere as anything.Wes Craven's genius in this entire series was the plot hook that has Freddy only able to murder in his victims' dreams. This allows Craven fantastic, surreal set pieces, that really do manage to capture the feelings that nightmares have in actuality.One of the best in the horror genre.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

That is just an example of the great mind of Wes Craven.  ""Freddy"" in my opinion is the scariest and funniest killer of all time.

A Nightmare on Elm Street,"This is the ultimate in slasher-horror that thrives on the basis that it is, at times, genuinely quite scary, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Robert Englund is super as the legendary ""Freddie Krueger"" who, complete with his razor sharp right hand, takes over the dreams of the teenage children of parents who had been responsible for his gruesome death many years earlier. When a terrorised ""Nancy"" (Heather Langenkamp) begins to put two and two together she sets out with cute boyfriend ""Glen"" (a first outing for Johnny Depp ) to trap him in her world - and that means drinking enough coffee to sink the Titanic and staying awake! Ronee Blakely does a mean impersonation of Faye Dunaway - as the girl's almost permanently drunk mother (whose battles seem to get larger as the film progresses) too. It doesn't hang about - Wes Craven keeps the pace almost frantic, and there is plenty of humour to keep it's tongue in it's cheek. The effects are limited, but fun, and the whole thing raises more smiles than goosebumps but it's still an entertaining watch 35 year later.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Influential, tightly constructed shocker that redefined a genre","Wes Craven has made four films which have redefined the genre -- they are ""Last House on The Left"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"", ""Scream"" and ""A Nightmae On Elm Street"".The grimy prologue of this influential shocker establishes Freddy as he constructs the glove he will use to murder and maim. Charles Bernstein's minimalist score provides a chilling, almost nauseating backdrop to proceedings.As in the first ""Friday The 13th"", this film's villain may be the product of a deranged mind. A lurker in the subconscious, he exacts a gruesome revenge on those he holds responsible for his mutilated state.The film, like Craven's best works (up to the excellent ""Red Eye"") is tightly constructed and filled with thought-provoking concepts. The use of signature sound effects such as Freddy's metal fingernails is a key to its success and subsequent injection into popular culture.Actor Robert Englund, who had appeared in films for Tobe Hooper (""Eaten Alive"") and Gary Sherman (""Dead and Buried"") before this, is perfectly cast as Freddy and brings a twisted, sardonic humour to the role.Certainly a watershed for horror, the film's sequels, unfortunately, manifested no understanding of what made this so effective and served up surreal special effects showcases instead.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A classic.,"Plot Synopsis: When her friend is killed while being asleep, Nancy Thompson discovers the killer is a shadowy figure who haunts his victims in their dreams. With her friends being picked off one by one, Nancy must confront the killer in his domain.When ""Halloween"" came out in 1978, it spawned a very prolific genre known as the slasher film. In a slasher film, a group of characters, mostly teenagers, are stalked & killed by a shadowy bogeyman who usually has an axe to grind. By the time ""Elm Street"" came along, the well had been sucked dry by dozens of poor-quality films. Wes Craven gives us a film that is purely nightmarish (okay, bad pun) & very clever. While it is not the masterpiece that it's fans are claiming to be, it is nonetheless a classic, giving birth to a character that became a legend in the horror genre: Freddy Krueger, a child murderer who was killed by an angry mob & who gets his revenge by killing his victims in their dreams. The acting is all over the place, with the teenagers being the usual round of morons that we have seen in other films, but Robert Englund commands the screen as Krueger.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Shocking Cerebral Scarefest!,"Wes Craven is a genius! What else can you call a man who could conceive this twisted and macabre ghost story about a claw-handed killer who haunts your dreams? Craven tapped into mankind's collective fear of the unknown and helplessness when he unleashed Freddy Krueger upon Hollywood in the mid 1980's. This film is very scary and extremely effective, not to mention gory as all hell and way more intelligent than any horror film before it. What would you do if you knew that an evil man was going to murder you when you fall asleep, and knowing that we all must inevitably sleep, we have no choice. What if you saw your friends dispatched one-by-one by the mad man only to have nobody believe you? What if you realized that unless you confront your fear and face the monster that he will not only kill you, but every child in your sleepy town. What if you were Nancy?

"Q: Was This Film Inspired By An Episode Of ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker""?","Back in the 80s I liked this film. However, exactly 10 years earlier in 1974, when I was ten years old, I used to watch my favorite TV show, KOLCHAK: The Night Stalker...and in particular, on November 8, 1974 was an episode titled ""FIREFALL"". I propose that the writers of A Nightmare On Elm Street got the inspiration for their film from this episode of KOLCHAK.
The plot of this episode is...
The evil spirit of a murdered gangster who loved classical music is acting as a doppelganger, taking on the ghostly form of a gifted orchestra conductor. Then while in the form of the conductor, he must wait for his former enemies to fall asleep, upon which as soon as they sleep, he supernaturally causes them to self combust...all the while, his ultimate goal is to take over the body of the conductor and become him.
While the two plots are not identical, the elements and a base on which to flesh out a new story are all there...fire, revenge, fear of sleeping due to being killed in sleep etc.
Check out this episode of KOLCHAK for yourself...it is GREAT 70s kitschy TV!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It is only a dream or is it,"Nightmare On Elm Street is a classic horror film in every sense of the word. It includes bad acting, weird music, cool killer, lots of blood, bright cute leading lady and action from beginning to an end. Wes Craven's script is despite somewhat over the top storyline is incredible and the film manages to keep you excited for the 90 minutes running time. Sure some people might complain about few things - some of the special effects are yes downright awful even for 1984 standards and the goofs cannot be overlooked yet for some people it makes the film even more hip and cooler. I also liked the character of Freddie in this feature where he has less than 10 minute screen time and is surely creepy and believable as an ex murderer and child molester.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Nice Beginning, but Could be Better...","""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is one of the slashers you always think of when you hear about Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers. Freddy Krueger is definitely not my favorite, but he is a nice character that gives a good scare at times. But the movie itself... Well, I can safely say that it isn't that scary as you might think. The positive reviews are dominating on the Featured page, but I don't think it deserves that high rating. I will tell you why soon. But first about the plot: A group of teenagers are discovering a mysterious character called Freddy Krueger, that enters our world to kill them all and haunt them every single night, in different ways. I got to admit, the story doesn't seem so interesting at first, but it's getting interesting when it evolves and overall it's effective. That was a pro. The second good thing was the different ways Freddy was haunting them on. He always attacked in original, specific ways, for example when he springed out of a bathtub or jumping out of your bed while you sleep. That was made very greatly with nice visuals, as well as Freddy. He had that scary and disgusting thing about him, and was made well. But I think that's it. I mean, it's a fair beginning for a longer franchise, that's ok, but if this was a stand alone film it wouldn't work well. As well as it wasn't that scary as I expected to be. I expected something more on the Friday the 13th movies level, were things can be scary and fun and entertaining at the same time. In here, it was only the fun and entertaining part, and I wished more suspense and maybe better jump scares. The acting is also something to work on. I think it was average for some of the characters, while others were extremely plastic and basic, something that our main hero, Nancy, was. She was more on a school play level than something really professional. Johnny Depp did play here, too, and I didn't notice. He played the second character, while I thought Johnny was going to come afterwards and play someone else. Nope, he played Nancy's boyfriend, and I didn't saw that. Well, it's funny, and this movie was kind of too. It's more of a fun entertainment with a fair beginning to a franchise, than a serious horror on a higher shelf.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrifying,"Just the idea of sleep being perverted into something awful is horrifying enough, but throw in Freddy Krueger as the one who's doing it and it gets so much more frightening. This is a man who gets off on your fears and he loves exploiting them to his advantage.Nancy is one of the best heroines horror has to offer and that's not up for debate. While Langenkamp's performance can be read as somewhat amateurish to some, I found it unaffected and charming, especially when compared to the bizarre and mannered performance of Blakely as her drunken mother.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ideas and concepts that helped to resonate with the ""slasher"" subgenre, playing with the definitions and boundaries between the imaginary and the real","There is no better way to describe fear than with a nightmare. Within it, there is no rule, there is no chance of winning, it's just you and your biggest fears. Who has never woken up in the middle of the night scared, not quite remembering what they had dreamed of, but with a sense of complete dread that seems even more absolute in the dark of night? In 1984, Wes Craven established himself as a reference in horror works by launching the frightening The Nightmare Hour which, even with characteristics of the so-called B movie - such as grotesque passages -, ended up revolutionizing the genre and became a reference for future works of the type. It is impossible to understand the importance of the Freddy Krueger saga without taking into account the year of production of the work and also its consequences for the genre's market.In the plot, the young men, Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss), Glen Lantz (Johnny Depp), and Rod Lane (Jsu Garcia), are tormented in their dreams by Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), a man with a burnt face, red sweater and big claws that hunt them, night after night, with no adult to believe in them, it will be necessary to learn how to fight this monster and unravel some mysteries in order to survive.First of all, you have to put yourself at the time of release, many of the ideas may seem small and undeveloped, but they were extremely inventive in those years, helping to define this style of plot. What elevates A Hora do Nightmare to the status of a horror classic is, above all, its creative story that, until its surreal outcome, manages to make an unbelievable plot believable. Wes Craven's own script is original and well tied to the point of building a fascinating villain in the first film of the saga. The mysteries about Freddy Krueger and his motivations for attacking the Elm Street youth group are effectively developed. The sadistic assassin attacks Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) and her group of friends during their dreams, but what could be simple nightmares turn into greater torments as the wounds occurred during sleep leave marks on young people in real life as well. The taste for torture that moves Krueger leads the viewer to witness true bloodbaths. The special effects, if seen in today's perspective, are weak and, therefore, scenes that should grow in tension as they unfold end up becoming comical. However, for the time, the effects were effective and consistent with reality - mainly budget.After a mysterious presentation, we have a well-structured three-act development, with a somewhat rushed ending and a curious plot twist in the last seconds. The first is about introducing the group of friends formed by Nancy, Rod, Tina and Glen, and gradually introduces the great charm of the story, the nightmares, which take on a strong character of danger for young people. From there we have everything the audience needs, gore scenes, good suspense and the appearance, not only of its villain, but of all its oneiric mythology.What strengthens the second act is the way they knew how to hide the truth about Freddy and unravel it in minute details. Bringing the information that he was killed by the parents of each of the boys was an essential part and responsible for introducing a climate of paranoia and despair in the protagonist. Its third part is the most exciting, as each discovery, whether it's how a nightmare works, or the secret that the parents have hidden, leads to the climax of the clash between the heroine and the monster. The problem is that to speed up, the film chooses to use some expository dialogues about the dynamics of a nightmare, and how to use it to your advantage, but fortunately the final plot twist leads us to see that the happy ending was just a lie, showing us that everything was another nightmare created by Krueger, playing again with the fine line between dream and reality.The film works in an amazing way with what the viewer is seeing. Could it be that what we are actually seeing is not a nightmare? Or was it reality? The viewer is in constant doubt. The script also has some other great insights as at the beginning of the film the character Tina is bewildered not knowing where she is and suddenly there is a sheep that serves to warn that the ""wolf"" (Freddy) is coming. This was a great innovation and helped to make the fear that this character was taken by everyone who watched, in addition, there is still a punctual use of jump scares, and suspense, all very well worked in the script, especially in this middle of the film. At this point, the plot twist comes, with Tina's death, Rod ends up being taken away by the police and is framed. At this point the duo of ""heroes"" (Nancy and Glen), will have to figure out how to survive, and how to save their friend and unravel the truth behind the events.Superbly directed, the film has countless anthological scenes. In his wake of blood and terror, Freddy Krueger stars in landmark scenes, such as Tina's murder, dragged through walls filled with blood, Glenn's descent into the bed that sucks him and then, spewing frantic jars of blood everywhere, beyond from the famous chase of the opening, with the antagonist and his huge arms. In the cast, Heather Langekamp does a fantastic job as heroine Nancy, while veterans John Saxon and Ronee Blakey play her troubled parents. But who really stand out are Amanda Wyss, perfect as the fragile Tina, who steals every scene in which she appears and has an ending worthy of Janet Leigh; and Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger. His psychotic look, his voice and his gestures are enough to make anyone afraid to put their head on the pillow. With a single dialogue about the villain's past, Craven leaves Krueger's story and personality in the dark: all that is known is that he wants to kill, and that he feels a demonic ecstasy in it.The first feature film with the villain showed a very serious facet of Freddy Krueger. There were some more ironic moments, but he was basically an insatiable killer in a dream world with no rules. Over time, it's true, the character changed. Over the course of the franchise (there were six more films and a crossover with Jason), the seriousness gave way to games. Krueger has always been and will always be bloodthirsty. But in the other appearances, the villain played by Robert Englund had more room to play with his victims. It wasn't just killing. He needed to enjoy this moment. Englund was the perfect interpreter in embodying these two facets of the monster with equal competence. Unfortunately, he couldn't get rid of the character, being relegated only to forgettable points in other productions.Another interesting point about Freddy Krueger in The Nightmare Hour is the character's raw evil. Unlike Jason Voorhees, who was abused as a child, and Michael Myers, who has serious mental problems, Krueger is evil incarnate, a figure who revels in the pain of others. There is nothing to explain his actions, other than pure sadism. Add to that the fact that he attacks during his dreams, at a time when anyone is completely vulnerable, and he emerges as one of the most dangerous villains in cinema.On the technical side, Charles Bernstein, responsible for the soundtrack, efficiently builds the music that accompanies the characters, a composition that many people still find chilling, especially the lullaby, as unforgettable as the arrangements by John Carpenter for Halloween - The Night of Horror, memorable musical performances in the realm of slasher movies. There are few notes, but the efficient amount to become the main theme of the entire franchise, chilling melody that dialogues with Krueger's image, strengthened further on, during and after the end of the film, crystallized forever in our imagination. Still on sound topics, the engaging work of Jess Soraci's team in sound design, part of the important technical team in the development of a horror film, is also important.Furthermore, throughout its 91 minutes, A Nightmare on Elm Street flirts with the ambivalence of its outcome that allows for multiple interpretations. Was it a collective nightmare for everyone in the city, especially Elm Street, the stronghold of the local middle class and its fears and insecurities? Unlike Jason, Michael or any other slasher assassin, Freddy attacks people in their nightmares, something more difficult to escape, because as we know, we cannot command all aspects of this dream environment. That's what A Nightmare on Elm Street works with, a set of conflicts established in situations that are often beyond our control, basic raw material for the dramatic development that involves us and makes us reflect and fear.Wes Craven's work stands out much more for the ideas and concepts it helped to resonate with the ""slasher"" subgenre, playing with the definitions and boundaries between the imaginary and the real. A lot of his ideas about scares, suspense and horror structure were copied and reinvented over and over again in cinema. Its small number of characters and its premise seem simple to those who see it today, but it was extremely innovative in its time, becoming a classic and a great franchise that we don't know if it will return to theaters, but if that is the case, we hope it will honor the involved in this great work.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

This proves Wes Craven is the king of horror,"1996's Scream may be a slightly more improved film than this but there is no doubt the cultural impact Wes Craven's original slasher film had on the public in 1984. Not only did he create one of the most memorable horror characters of all time but he introduced the world to a certain young actor named Johnny Depp. The murder scenes are fantastically well put together, showing the director's vision of how a horror film should be, tongue in cheek.A Nightmare on Elm Street is no comedy though, some scenes are genuinely scary such as Robert Englund's arms stretching to inhuman lengths and the blending of Johnny Depp. The only drawback is the ending which tries to be something of a Carrie but doesn't pay off, unfortunately none of the sequels were even close to the brilliance of the original.Verdict: One of the best b-movies of the 80's and an iconic horror film that showed the workings of a true genius.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disgrace,"A Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic and I respect that, but I was very disappointed. This movie is plain boring and dull. The reason why this is unbearable to watch is because of the acting. Seriously the acting is HORRIBLE. Probably the poorest acting I've ever seen. There is not one decent performance. It seemed like the producers picked random bums off the street to play in the movie. The dialoge is just as poor. Also I was surprised that Johnny Depp played one of the teenagers. I feel sorry that he had to be in this crap fest. Still the plot is okay and the special effects were average. The only thing I enjoyed is Freddy Krueger terrorizing the teenager's lives.

One of the best 80s horror films!,"After ""Halloween"" (1978) there were many horror films trying to be successful. Many succeeded. But the people who were making the imitations also tried to be original. Nearly no one succeeded. A Nightmare on Elm Street was one of the rare exceptions. Sure, there are similarities between ""Halloween"" and this one. But A Nightmare on Elm Street was far more original than any of the other slasher horror films. The idea of a mass murderer killing people in their dreams is very exciting and very original. Freddy Krueger is one of the best and most sadistic persons in the history of horror films. Unfortunately they turned him into a comedian in most of the sequels.Robert Englund is great in the role of Freddy. He was born to play this part (that's why they never replaced him). Heather Langenkamp is very believable and not one of these blond and dumb girls that can be seen in other films of this genre (Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode was an exception). The opening sequence shows us right at the beginning what the film is about. There are no flaws in the film and it never gets lame. It is unpredictable because you can never be sure if you are in a dream sequence or in real life.The film is very intense and scary and the special effects are gripping. I still wonder how Wes Craven and his crew were able to shoot this film and the effects in it on such a small budget.A must-see for any true fan of the horror genre and anybody else who likes being scared and entertained at the same time.My rating: 10/10 (I don't recommend Part 2: Freddy's Revenge to anybody who is not a passionate fan of the series)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The ultimate movie, an underated classic.","Without doubt, the best movie of all time.  Forget your Godfathers and your Citizen Kanes; this is simply the best concept of all time.  Wes Craven deserves a Knighthood for creativity for coming up with the dream-stalker plot and Robert Englund should be the highest paid actor in Hollywood for his performances throughout the series. We all know that Nightmare lacks a little in presentation and acting, but Craven's resourcesfulness is phenominal.  This is a premier example of slick movie-making, everything that is here is a necesity to the growth of the film.  Just imagine Nightmare with the budget and studio backing of something like Armageddon or Titanic; people would have been terrified for years to come and we might have actually seen some decent sequels.I have no wish to rant for pages on everything that is brilliant about this movie, there isn't space.

Exciting and creative classic slasher.,"Finally got around to watching this classic movie. It holds up decently well! Though I could imagine this having had more impact back when it released.Overall I really liked this approach to a slasher, it's so creative and for me it was never about the killer in this movie, nor was it too much about the kills (though they were done very well too). It was the stuff in between, the gooey stair steps, Freddy protruding through a wall/ceiling. Very imaginative and creepy stuff that can only be imagined in dreams. And this movie captures that very well.Though I loved those scenes and moments, the overall story is a bit meh, with mainly absolutely awful police officers, one of the worst I've seen recently, just complete irrationality. The story is extremely vague, there's nothing to really give Freddy any character aside from the stellar performance of the actor.The events are well paced though, it is a slow movie, but it's balanced in its kills. But at the end of the day, it is a slasher. And a tame one at that. For me it also missed a bit of levity in terms of comedy that a slasher needs. I guess you could say Freddy provided the comedy though, but the normal characters are just very bland.Loved it for its creativity, not so much for its story.That said, I'm looking forward to see how this franchise develops watching the sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
My favorite slasher flick,"If someone were to ask me who my favorite movie slasher was, I'd have to say Fred Krueger (Robert Englund) from ""A Nightmare On Elm Street.""Krueger, the brainchild of horror movie veteran Wes Craven, has a distinct personality, which separates him from his contemporaries (i.e. Michael Meyers of ""Halloween"" or Jason Voorhees of ""Friday the 13th."")He's given a sickly humorous and sadistic personality by Robert Englund, who first dawned the dirty, red and green sweatshirt, raggedy hat, and razor fingers in 1984 when he began his reign of terror by stalking Heather Langenkamp and numerous others in their dreams.He was unique amongst them because of the fact that he even had a personality. He didn't hide his face behind a mask; if he were killing you, he wanted you to know that it was him doing it. Krueger was also unique because you couldn't be really sure that he was even a living entity, since he stalked you in your dreams.Craven has stated that the character of Fred Krueger was inspired in part by an article he read about perfectly healthy people dying mysteriously in their sleep. To further add to that, the name of ""Fred Krueger"" was inspired by a bully and a disfigured hobo who scared him when he was a child.With ""Nightmare,"" Craven had crafted himself an icon horror film, one that was sure to inspire many knock-offs in the coming years. The sequels turned down the terror and upped the dark comedy. The series only seemed to return to its roots when Craven became involved with the project again and created ""New Nightmare"" 10 years later in 1994.Even to this day, ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" still terrorizes its viewers, prompting them to not fall asleep as that razor-fingered sleep-stalker Fred Krueger could come looking for you in your dreams.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

An unexpected encounter with a brilliantly original Horror film,"I was still at school when a friend of mine in my home town of Redcar, on the English North-East coast, suggested a trip to the Redcar Regent.I had heard that this movie had had rave reviews in the States and that it was very scary but that's all i knew (i didn't even know the name ""Freddy Kruger""!)The thing i most remember about the film was that the rows in the cinema were actually shaking at the scary bits!!!The film is wonderfully original - a great concept (invading nightmares) and villain (Freddy!) are perhaps the keys to it all. There are a lot of jumpy moments in the movie - OK there's a little blood and guts but this is a scary movie not a slasher flick.The movie franchise this created was an opportunity missed (Freddy could have maybe got scarier instead of more drole?), but, of course i agree, that the third film was special, too.This is a must-see horror film and occupies a place in my top ten horror movies of all time.

Interested in wetting your pants?,"Freddy Krueger will always be scarier than Jason Voorhees. And do you know why that is? Because Jason can't do anything super-cool, just cut you into swiss cheese. Freddy Krueger can take an ordinary thing, like a blanket, for example, and use it to kill somebody. Or in Part Five, where a diving board comes to life and almost kills a girl.In dreams, anything can happen, and Freddy uses this to his advantage. Although there's a low body count (which I think is one of the strengths because it shows that the movie isn't about the blood and gore) it's extremely creepy. Yay for Wes Craven!I guess I'm supposed to write out the plot, so here it goes: Fred Krueger was a child murderer who killed over 30 kids. He was arrested, but the court couldn't throw him in jail because of some technicality. So a bunch of parents got together and fried him. Freddy Krueger exists now as a dream demon, who kills kids in their dreams. He's after the kids whose parents killed him, and only Nancy, one of the kids, knows what's really going on.I'd recommend this film to just about everybody.

A Truly Horrifying Experience,"There are three characters that make you think of truly terrifying horror, and they are Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. Michael Myers' ""Halloween"" is deffinately a classic, filled with suspnese and chilling music. Jason Voorhees' ""Friday the 13th"" didn't even star Jason until Part Two. The movie was probably the dumbest movie ever made. And neither were particularly scary. Probably because everybody knows that people don't go on murderous killing sprees because the people they're stalking are between 17 and 26. Wes Craven read a news article about a group of kids who died after having violent nightmares of a creepy killer. Of course, everybody has dreams, so what better way to scare people than to find something that occurs in everyday life and put a murderous twist on it? After this, he created Nightmare pn Elm Street, one of the scariest movies ever made. The killer, as said above, is Freddy Krueger, a child murderer who was killed by a group of parents after being declared innocent of his crimes. He now exists as a dream demon; if he kills you in a dream, you die in real life. He's hunting down the children of the ones who killed him, and they don't seem to stand a chance, until one of them, Nancy, learns Freddy's moves and takes a stand in a truly amazig showdown. This is the movie for all horror fans to see!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wes Craven's Masterpiece,"This film, the first installment in the seven part series creates a dark premise, and a hideous madman, along with a clever storyline, all created by a horror great, Wes Craven. His work on this, the third, and the seventh, are the reason the series is popular in the horror genre.The film displays a tense and frightening feel that lets you wonder, what if your dreams could really hurt you. This is very successful. The film's only let downs are the cheesy ending scene ( mom through the window ) and the fact the it spawned a wretched, repulsive set of sequels, that excludes number seven, which is just as intelligent, if not more than this. In the later films, Freddy tosses of more bad one liners than Arnold Schwarzeneggar films. He becomes a joke. This film keeps him as a frightening figure, and is set up well by good direction, a plot, and reasonable acting. See this film, and then see Wes Craven's New Nightmare. They are both extremely intelligent and fun. Skip the 2-6. I've warned you....",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984),"I watched A Nightmare on Elm Street again after about 35 years. I wanted to revisit this classic horror and see if it still holds up. I remember watching it as a teenager, and back then, it felt much scarier. Now, as an adult, it doesn't have the same effect, but I still enjoyed it.The movie has a great soundtrack, and the dream sequences are very creative. Freddy Krueger is an iconic villain, and the idea of him attacking in dreams is original and terrifying. The special effects may look a bit old now, but they still work well for the film's atmosphere.The horror is not as intense as I remembered, but the dark, creepy vibe is still there. It was fun to go back to this film and relive the 80s horror style. I don't regret rewatching it. It's still a solid horror movie, and I would give it a 7 out of 10.Oh, and one more thing - I had no idea Johnny Depp was in this movie! I mean, I saw the character, I heard his voice, but my brain refused to connect the dots. It wasn't until I saw his name in the credits that I realized - Wait, that was Johnny Depp?! I guess even Hollywood stars have to start somewhere.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The ultimate journey in terror!,"I am a horror fan. My first horror film was Phantasm III, when I was five years old. Since then, my maturity has led e into better films. I first watched the original Nightmare when I was 12. After the credits rolled, I knew life s I knew it was changed forever. With a great plot, fantastic acting for a horror movie, and a killer that just won't quit, the claustrophobic production sent shivers down my spine. A wonderful contribution to the film was heroine Heather Langenkamp. She evoked the proper sympathy for a person who has lost all of her friends. She then shows that sh can work well under pressure. Langenkamp acts as well as another woman in a dramatic film, and I believe that she, along with Freddy Krueger, are the reasons that the film series became so popular. And now, Freddy Krueger, played to menacing perfection by Robert Englund. Frightening yet interesting, the film's dark atmosphere was pertained thanks to Englund's performance as the claw wielding maniac. In the fourth through the sixth movie, Krueger would acquire a witty sense of humor, which wasted the movie. And now, Wes Craven's direction. I believe this was a true 80's gem, that he made sure was not another slash-and-dice flick. He would not achieve such greatness until Wes Craven's New Nightmare, ten years later. And lets not forget the wonderfully gory deaths in this picture. Amanda Wyss, being dragged up a all. Nick Corri, hung from a sheet in a jail cell. Johnny Depp, pulled into his bed thrown back up. And Ronee Blakely, burned alive. This is a horror movie that no fan should miss! If possible, get the DVD box set, which contains all seven movies, a bonus disc, and a booklet! It's a real treat.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror movies as they should be,"First of all it should be noted that I am a big fan of the Nightmare On Elm Street series so I'm afraid that some readers may find these comments biased. A Nightmare On Elm Street is probably the second biggest reference in the world of modern horror movies - alongside with The Exorcist. Freddy Krueger is one the greatest horror characters ever to be created and that alone should attract you to watching this movie. Although this movie isn't really scary for The Exorcist's standards it still can give you a chill if you aren't an usual viewer of horror movies. This is the first of many sequels and I must say that it is, as usual, one of the best. It is purely original, defining an era of horror movies, and giving you a thrill that you won't find in any post-1990 horror movies.

One of the best horror films ever made.,Wes Craven's A Nightmare On Elm Street is one of the classic horror films of the modern cinema. It's a very creative film with some awesome visuals and knockdown scares. The first film is still the best film in this series because it takes the Freddy myth seriously and doesn't treat it like a comedy routine. Robert Englund is lucky to have landed the role of a lifetime in Freddy Krueger and you can tell he relishes the part. The direction by Wes Craven is some of his best work and the cinematography by Jacques Haitkin is amazing. The entire film is well cast and Freddy is a great modern urban legend.

Innovative teen slasher featuring Johnny Depp's debut,"Released in 1984, Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is about a psycho specter (Robert Englund) who haunts the dreams of four teens on Elm Street in Springwood, USA, with intent to kill. The four teens are played by Heather Langenkamp, Johnny Depp, Amanda Wyss and Jsu Garcia. John Saxon and Ronee Blakley play the parents of the heroine.I like the way ""Nightmare"" takes the slasher genre and adds a new dimension‚Äîa ghostly killer who slays people in their dreams. I also appreciate how the story builds as it progresses; things aren't as simple as they seem in the first act. Speaking of which, the first act features an innovative murder sequence that takes place as a teen couple is locked in a bedroom. The horrific way a girl is shown ""climbing the walls"" (or however you want to put it) didn't come into vogue until over a decade later with those Japanese ghost flicks. I also like how the hoodlum teen (Garcia) APPEARS to be the culprit when the viewer knows this isn't true.In addition, Heather is a quality protagonist and its interesting seeing Depp in his very first movie. It goes without saying that Freddy Krueger became a horror icon and deservedly so. Lastly, the ambiance of the movie is decidedly early-to-mid 80s, like the soundtrack and the (lame) electronic drums, but how can you hold that against the film? It's part of its charm. Nevertheless, I prefer the Friday the 13th flicks due to the camping-out locale and superior women.The movie runs 91 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & Venice, CA.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"One, Two, Freddy's Coming For You!","I can honestly say that this is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The opening Scene of ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" is a very intriguing one, one of the better opening shots I have seen in the horror movie. After watching these opening shots, you know this is not a normal slasher flick.The story of ""Nightmare"" concerns a group of friends who all slowly come to the realization that they are all being stalked by the same character in their dreams. Their nightmares become fatal, for as soon as they fall asleep, the killer will come into their dreams and butcher them. Give or take a few minor plot details, but that's about it.The movie is not a classic, but it is so well crafted I always felt threatened whenever the characters grew tired and nodded off. You've got to love the heroine, Nancy, who carries the film and learns quickly. Although, in this movie, the first installment of the series, Freddy Krueger is much more hidden and darker, and ultimately scarier. He truly enjoys scaring these kids to death and then brutally killing them. Yet, despite all this, he's almost a heroic figure and definitely larger than life.If you're going to watch an 80's slasher film, be sure to watch one with style!

CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...By the time ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" came out in November of 1984, we already had three ""Halloween"" movies, four ""Friday the13th"" movies, and countless other copycats like ""The Burning"" and ""Sleepaway Camp"". Though fans of slasher films had these titles to fall back on, they were looking for something more ... something a little bit different. Wes Craven gave it to them with this landmark movie.In 1978, Michael Myers was born. In 1980, it was Jason Vorhees. In 1984, the big three was completed when Freddy Krueger hit the scene. Instead of giving him a mask to wear, his hideousness comes from having been horribly burned and wearing a beat up old hat, a red and green striped sweater, and he had razor sharp knives for fingers on his right hand. Also unlike his predecessors, Freddy is quite vocal. He snarls and laughs mercilessly at his teenage victim's predicaments - taunting and teasing them as he goes.This first movie in the franchise is the best one, where we find him haunting teenagers in their dreams causing them to fear sleep. They pop pills and drink coffee ... anything to keep them from drowsing off into his nightmarish world. Because if he kills you in there, you die for real. Robert Englund is nothing short of genious as Freddy, Johnny Depp stars in his debut film role, and Wes Craven was put on the map.""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984) is a horror classic and no doubt one of the best horror movies ever made. Ever. I honestly couldn't even tell you how many times I've watched it over the years. I was 16 years old when it came out. It is still just as much fun to watch today as it was back then.

Neat,"I had never seen any of the 80's slasher flicks until I watched this one today. I think it's a neat movie, to put it simply. It has a downside: the score is kind of cheesy in certain parts, the ending is quite dumb even if entertaining, and the acting is pretty weak, save for the performances of Robert Englund and Johnny Depp. Of course, the movie doesn't really need good acting:1) Heather Langenkamp is pretty, and a great screamer. That's good enough for me. 2) The visual effects are outstanding; all of them but one are practical. 3) I was expecting the gore to be over the top, but it's fairly light. Of the kills in the movie, only one is graphically violent. If the gore were heavy, good acting would be needed to make it more believable. 4) The boogeyman can kill you in your nightmares? The premise of this movie is gold. 5) There were a few times that my pulse quickened; The Sixth Sense was the last movie I saw that had me reacting that way.All in all, Nightmare is a decent way to spend 90 minutes. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A perfect nightmare for horror lovers,"A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) :
Brief Review -A perfect nightmare for horror lovers. When I watched this film in my school days, I couldn't sleep for a few hours. This film ran in my mind, and I thought that maybe if I fell asleep and dreamed, the boogeyman would come and kill me. Those were the days when we kids took movies seriously. Now, watching it after two decades took me back to those crazy memories, and yes, it's still a very frightening film. This was new-age horror for the 80s, of course. The concept of the boogeyman was quite old by then since a film like Halloween had done a great job with that word and that ""scary figure."" With A Nightmare on Elm Street, the idea of the boogeyman becomes more relevant and frightening because it is related to something we do daily-dream. It's also unique because the ghost/evil figure here is only alive in dreams, making it difficult for anyone to catch him. In any other film, the ghost would be visible to others and therefore easy to defeat. Here, he appears only in dreams (nightmares), so it's difficult or rather impossible to stop him. Some scenes are so brutal that they immediately send chills down your spine and have you check your tongue. Some bloodshed, nails, slashes, and the whole concept coming together with teenage characters truly scare the daylights out of you! Heather Langenkamp looks gorgeous and performs very well here, while it's always a pleasure to watch the legendary Johnny Depp in his early days, looking so handsome and cute. Robert Englund as the boogeyman will give you jitters for sure, and the rest of the cast has also done well. The ending scene of the film plays a major role in leaving an impact that will last forever. You don't expect this kind of ending in a horror movie just after your mind has accepted that everything is fine. Wes Craven's direction and uncompromising vision make it one of the best horror movies of the decade and, to some extent, of all time. Watch it, but just don't fall asleep.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Are you ready for Freddy?,"Director Wes Craven became instantly world-famous through his immensely successful ""Scream""-trilogy, but his finest and most original film was made more than 10 years beforehand. Not only the movie was groundbreaking but its main character also became one of the all-time greatest horror icons. ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" isn't your typical slasher film; it's far more impressive and intelligent. The story is about a demon that kills teenagers in their sleep. The cinematography is so brilliantly done that the lines between the dream world and reality often get blurred. Near the end of the movie, it becomes a real puzzle to figure out whether what you see is a genuine event or part of a dream sequence.The bad guy in this movie is one of the most powerful demons from hell. His clothing however might suggest otherwise. He wears a stupid, brown hat and a red-and-black striped sweater. The most unique trademark of this horribly-burnt child molester is his glove with razor-sharp finger-knives. He will use them to slaughter his innocent victims who find themselves trapped in a mysterious world from which they cannot possibly seem to escape. In this world, the monster is all powerful like a god and he will set the rules in opposition whenever he feels like.This movie is certainly the darkest and most terrifying of them all. The first time we see Freddy Krueger in the flesh is truly one of the most spine-chilling moments in horror history! This creepy-looking creature is beautifully played by actor Robert Englund who's an American leading actor of Swedish descent and very famous for appearing in dozens of horror films. His greatest achievement will however always be his chilling portrayal of Freddy Krueger. The main part is played by actress Heather Langenkamp who stars as Nancy Thompson; the girl who decides to fight back rather than become another victim. Her performance is quite good as is John Saxon who plays her father. This is also the debut of Johnny Depp. Needless to say: Wes Craven is the most important person for he came up with the idea and directed the movie as well.In short: ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" is not only a horror classic, but also one of the finest horror movies ever made! It's an intelligent and very original yet gory thriller! If you ever wish to try out a horror movie - this is a great one to begin with! As for Freddy Krueger, he is - in my humble opinion - the single most original horror icon ever thought of!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Whatever to you do, don't fall asleep.""","A couple of masters to me who staple images in my mind through their films are Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese, but Wes Craven ain't too far off them as there are some images (some quite creepy) that will never leave my mind.In the original 1984 classic it is the story of Freddy Krueger (amazingly played by Robert Englund) who is haunting the dreams of the teenage kids in the small town of Springwood. The main teenager is Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) and I must say in the end she is one of my favourite ""final girls"" in horror. To compare her to previous classics she is way better than both Alice in FRIDAY THE 13TH 1 & 2 or Laurie Strode in HALLOWEEN 1 & 2. In this film she does have to figure out how to beat Freddy and its not as easy as a machete falling to your feet or having Dr. Loomis protect you. Englund as well is not the stand-up comic he became certainly by part 4. He was creepy, scary and did it with images and fears that the characters possess. Not some ""funny"" lines that mostly fall dead...no pun intended. Krueger is also used sparingly, which the first 3 films did properly, but by part 4 it seems as he was getting as much screen time as the victims.Also starring John Saxon (who I have always enjoyed) as Nancy's father who is a local cop, Johnny Depp in his screen debut as Nancy's boyfriend Glen. It's pretty funny to see Depp so young and skinny. Produced by Robert Shaye for New Line Cinema. Had a say in the ending to the film, which to some really is the worst aspect of the film. To me it doesn't in any way wreck the film, it just sort of seems weird, doesn't match the rest of the film and really seems like it was tacked onto the ending.Also has a terrific score by Charles Bernstein. Really one of the best horror scores and mixes perfectly with the images Craven puts on the screen and the character of Freddy Krueger bringing you into one of his dreams. Certainly a must-see for any horror fan and to me this is Craven at his absolute best.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A much different Freddy.,"The first Nightmare on Elm Street movie introduced us to horror icon Freddy Krueger, a man with razor sharp knives on his glove that attacks you in your dreams. It was dark. It was scary. And it cemented Robert Englund as a horror movie staple.As a stand alone film it stands up really well. There is genuine menace from the character and a reliance on atmosphere and wanting to tell a scary story over jump scares and gags.But as a part of a series it's a lot different than the subsequent movies that turned him from a scary figure to one that made bad puns and used things like the ""power glove"" to do somebody in. As such until ""A New Nightmare"" came out this was the scariest incarnation of Freddy which means if you started watching the series after the first one you'll see a remarkable difference.The story is of a former gardener of an elementary school that is accused of child molestation and gets off on a technicality. The parents decide to take justice into their own hands and burn him alive. Years later he shows up as a horribly scarred man haunting the dreams of the children of the parents who killed him and kills them in a rather gruesome way.The special effects are great for the era considering that computer animation was very primitive at the time. There's lots of blood to appease the gore hounds and there's a good story to appease those that want to see a scary movie.While not my favorite of the series, that would be the third one a.k.a. ""Dream Warriors"", it remains a horror classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Problematic, but still a quite chilling horror film","Let me start by saying that I judge horror films not just by how much they scare me, but how good they are story and acting wise. This is a danged creepy film, full of creepy set-pieces and a brilliant concept that managed to scare me into not wanting to go to sleep for a few days (I managed, but I was afraid for my life). Story wise, it has some goofy bits and holes, but nothing too out there. Script and acting wise is where this movie fails. Except for an early performance by Johnny Depp that manages to be quite normal and human, and Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger, who manages to be evil and ruthless (instead of the clown he became in later films), the acting is rather ho-hum. This is not helped by some poor writing on the screenplay's part. Heather Langenkamp as Nancy stands out as quite bad, and the rest of them are sort of there (yes, that includes Saxon). But Wes Craven was at the top of his game scare- wise at this point, so many of these problems are excused. The ending is very chilling.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Freddy's Coming for You,"As of today, Nightmare on Elm Street remains one of the most iconic and beloved horror franchises. If we're to go back to the one that started it all, it remains a creepy staple of the mere concept that even if you die in your dreams, you could die for good. After going through numerous studio rejections, New Line Cinema was fortunate to take a risk with the late Wes Craven's project, and the final result was met with huge financial returns and rave critical reviews upon its 1984 release. Often regarded as one of the greatest horror movies of all time, it's time to see if said status is truly worth it.The film follows teenager Nancy Thompson whose friends become targets of the spirit of a bladed gloved serial killer named Fred ""Freddy"" Krueger in their dreams, in which if they die, it kills them in real life. From that premise alone, arguably the biggest theme set in stone is the struggle to determine the distinction between dreams and reality, manifested by the lives of the teen characters in the film itself. Nancy's friends all become victims of Krueger's reckoning, which is concealed by the guilt within her parents based on the killer's origin story. By detailing Nancy's friends as sexually promiscious teens, the film is also somewhat of a morality tale both in biblical and general means, as a lot of the consequences from their death ridden dreams become miscontrued by the paranoid policeforce and the worrisome neighbors across town. Nobody, not even those who witnessed the unprovable murders, can comprehend anything related to Krueger, emphasizing just how dangerous a dream can be if it means your life will be at permanent risk in a world you're meant to doze off in.Outside of the scare factor, the cast themselves are what make the film all the more thrilling. Heather Langenkamp has to carry the film as Nancy through paranoia based on the surreal murders and presence of a killer she cannot see awake, and her downfalling mental state as she desparately refuses to fall asleep becomes twice as concerning as the fear of Freddy knocking at one's door. Speaking of Freddy, Robert Englund nearly steals the show as the scarred skinned sweatered killer, embracing the evil within the role to the point of becoming a staple in nightmare lore. Next to Langenkamp and Englund, John Saxon and Ronee Blakely display just enough denial and sadness as Nancy's parents who struggle to cope with themselves outside of their own daughter's problems. Johnny Depp, Amanda Wyss and Nick Corri display just as many annoying traits common in their teened roles as well as the right amount of fear and confusion needed for victims of Freddy's wrath. Just like the better horror movies out there, the cast should leave just as much of an impact as the scares.Since this film was made on a fairly low budget, its production values come off all the more impressive through what the filmmakers used. In contrast to the more sunny looking Ohio setting within the film, the nightmare sequences are appropriately bleak enough to leave room for the imagination, allowing Jacques Haitkin's cinematography to replicate the same level of dark nonsense one would expect in a world without logic or cohesion. Although far and few in between, the gore effects add into the uncomfortableness our own leads witness as they cannot stop the brutal force from slaying the innocent. The sound mixing and film editing are a nice added bonus with just the right amount of grotesque imagery needed to leave an unsettling mark on anyone witnessing whatever is going on in the minds of the film's characters. Charles Bernstein's score is another frightening detail, as even with some outdated 80s orchestral touch ups, the music accompanies the unpredictable nature of jumping through one world to another. After all, dreams create what we cannot bear to hear.On top of an already frightening concept, A Nightmare on Elm Street remains a staple of top tier horror cinema thanks to its wonderful cast, terrifying sequences, minimal albeit creative effects, and the mere presence of Freddy Krueger alone. It's no wonder the film garnered countless sequels and spinoffs immediately after its release, as to this day, New Line Cinema will forever have their place as the House that Freddy Built. If you're yet to check this film out, then kindly do so even if you'd prefer to have a good night's sleep. Besides, you have to face your fears sometimes, regardless if they're dreamlike or not.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

the best as far as what Freddy's character really was and what he did...,"The original Nightmare on Elm Street is by far the best. I know it naturally goes that way-- with the reason always being, 'well its the original...it started it all' and such, but as far as to what the story is about and the actual character of Freddy Kruger, the others don't even compare. Don't get it twisted, the Freddy we've all come to love in the sequels is cool... funny, witty, but remember-- that version of Freddy is the ""Sequal"" Freddy. In the original, the idea of Freddy's character is a much more frightening concept then smart-alec, ingeniously imaginative and creative killing machine he has evolved into. Think for a moment what Freddy is... what he was before he was burned alive by a mob of angry, vengeful parents. I think Freddy as a sick, little, psychotic pedophile is much scarier, realistic, dirty and all things bad. He is weird little man, with a weird little laugh, spending his time alone fantasizing, plotting and eventually carrying out his twisted urges to kidnap and hurt little children. Although it has never been officially established in any of the films I don't think it is absurd or out of line to believe Freddy did more than just kill children. Whether he literally molested those children sexually or not I think its safe to bet that he achieved some sort of sexual stimulation from hurting them.In the original, Freddy is darker, not just in character, but also is the way they lit him. You hardly saw his disfigurement in bright sharp tones... he was always in the shadows, and although he did speak and had a few darkly humorous quips, (in contrast to a few famous killers that came before him), his words were few and far between and definitely not of the stand up comedian stock. Freddy is a phantom, a supernatural evolution of what he once was as a mortal man, and I like to imagine what he was while I'm watching what he is. He was a deviant, a perverted, sick bad man who is even sicker and badder as a spiritual entity.p.s. while the make up appliances giving Freddy that stretched, burnt look is classic and much admired by this fan, I always loved the darkness of his flesh in the original. I'm saying though, ever leave a hot dog on the grill too long.. it goes well beyond the fleshy red color... blackened and charred--just like Freddy's heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the great classics of the horror genre.,"It is difficult to say anything about this film that everyone has not already mentioned. It was scary when it was released and remains one of the most respectable films in the horror genre, a classic in its own right. Despite its merits and qualities, personally, I did feel the weight of age at some points in the film, which never really scared me.The plot is known to everyone I think: the teenagers of a certain American street are disturbed in their sleep by Fred Krueger, the spirit of a child murderer who was killed by their parents, decades before, when justice failed to punish him for the crimes he committed. Appearing in their dreams, he disturbs them until he manages to kill them, and the death inflicted in the dream resounds in real life, with violent and tragic contours for everyone.Director Wes Craven (one of the big names in horror cinema, with solid credits in the genre) knew how to make the film effectively, albeit without developing much of the story or characters, focusing on entertainment and the deaths that go on. Happening. The cast is made up of names I don't know well. The film did not demand much from them and the characters are very sketchy and not very noticeable, being in the film to die or simply to show fear. Young Heather Langenkamp, however, gave life to one of the central characters in the plot and was entitled to better material and more careful development. The result is natural: it stands out from the majority, with quality work, even if it is not brilliant. Robert Englund also deserves applause for the convincing way in which he brought the film's villain to life. Finally, a brief mention of Johnny Depp's participation in one of his first cinematographic works.Technically, it is a film based on effectiveness. Cinematography is used with skill and decisively helps to create a scary environment. The visual and sound effects were also well-used and enjoy the best that was there when the film was released. I especially liked the effects with fire and electricity. The scenarios were equally well done, especially the abandoned factory that appears to be where Krueger resides. Everything seems convincing enough, and it doesn't seem to have been done in a way that saves on the budget. Incidental music, with an abundance of treble, is very good for the most tense moments, and the soundtrack is discreet, highlighting the children's song sung at the end, as if it were a prelude to indicate that evil was not effectively defeated.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Scary, thought-provoking original movie...","1st watched 7/9/2022 - (Dir-Wes Craven):
Scary, thought-provoking original movie from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" creator Wes Craven. This movie does what it's supposed to do - scare you, but it also presents a heroine who fights back, and doesn't just expect to be taken down by the killer. It starts inside the dream of a young girl who's haunted by a creepy character with knives as fingers, that we later find out is named Fred Krueger. Half of the movie takes place in a dream world, but it's grounded by a real story of four kids who are having the same character taunt their dreams. We find out later why these kids are the ones he taunts, but I really don't want to reveal too much of the story. This horror film is unique compared to other similar films in the eighties because it focuses on the story and doesn't exploit the teens like other slasher films tended to do. It has it's share of gore, but it's also kind of a mystery movie - where we are trying to figure out what's really happening. John Saxon, supposedly stars, but the real stars are the kids starting with Heather Langenkamp and her boyfriend played by Johnny Depp, and of course the villain played by Robert Englund - who ends up becoming a superstar due to this character and this franchise. A not-to-miss classic for those who like these movies, but does have a confusing ending where we really don't know what happened - but I guess that's why there are sequels...lol.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

An ageless horror gem,"While age has wearied the scares found within, there's no doubt that A Nightmare on Elm Street is an indisputable horror classic, a creative and unnerving world created by legendary genre filmmaker Wes Craven.Causing much fan-fare and becoming a box office sensation off a meager budget upon release in 1984, Street holds up incredibly well thanks to Craven's imaginative direction and world building, that takes us on a bizarre journey into the universe of deranged child-killer turned deformed dream stalking murderer Freddy Kruger.Played by cult figure Robert Englund, Kruger almost instantaneously becomes an icon of horror figures as we are introduced to him as the film opens, Charles Bernstein's moody score accompanying him on his way as he haunts the dreams of Amanda Wyss's unfortunate teenager Tina.It's an unforgettable entrance, Kruger's now often imitated razor claws burning their way into the viewers memory and Craven never lets up the tension and suspense as Tina and her friends, including Heather Langenkamp's Nancy (who becomes the film central focus) and Johnny Depp's dimwitted and very sleepy Glen Lantz, find out that sleep is not the answer as they become more aware of the fact Mr. Kruger is targeting them when they are at their most vulnerable.It's a fantastic set-up, everyone can relate to the feeling of being at their most open to terrors when they lay peacefully in their bed (I'm sure many viewers at the time thought twice about their cosy beds) and Craven perfectly plays this out as the victims of Kruger's campaign of terrors face off against rotting flesh, terrifying chases through abandoned factories or quiet side alleys or even in now mainstream imagery, pulled into their beds to a world far below or hunted in the confines of their own bubble bath.There's much kudos that needs to be paid to Craven and his team, particularly those responsible for the ghastly burnt visage of Kruger's raw and tortured appearance, its incredible how off-putting and vile a single look from the creature can be, as they managed to against all the odds develop what could've been nothing more than a college like production into something that spawned countless rip-offs and follow-ups that never quite managed to make the most of the creation handed to them.Throughout the fast-moving reign of terror and battle against evil at its most uncompromising is a collection of committed and well-tuned performances that became a staple of Craven ensembles throughout his career.All giving it their all, the cast of up-starts all dive headfirst into the material provided to them and sell the horror's of their plights as a group of school students in well over their heads try their best to find a way to stop Kruger from enacting out any more bloody acts of revenge, rounding out a solid package that is deserving of its reputation.Final Say -There are elements to A Nightmare on Elm Street that haven't aged as kindly as others but Craven's crowning achievement remains a deserving horror icon, anchored by its masterful and detestable evil incarnate.4 tongue phones out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"One, Two, Freddy's coming for you...","Wes Craven's A Nightmare On Elm Street has become one of the most famous and scariest franchises in all of horror, mainly thanks to the pop culture icon, Freddy Krueger. Freddy Krueger has become one of the most recognisable figures in all of pop culture and he's the burned, sadistic, slasher in this movie, wielding his iconic razor fingers and haunting teenagers in their dreams. A Nightmare On Elm Street was the first film in the long running franchise and follows a young group of teens, who are being troubled in their dreams by a scarred man, with razor fingers, the teens include Heather Langenkamp as the main survivor, Nancy Thompson and a young Johnny Depp playing Glen, Nancy's boyfriend. Nobody believes the teenagers so it's up to them to find a way to stop Freddy Krueger before he kills them all. For an 80s movie, it still holds up to this day the effects look more real than any horror movie today, the cinematography is well executed and the movie overall gives off an eerie feeling, just waiting for the main attraction to pop up on screen again. The acting is good although there are at times parts where you can see the young actors smirking but that's nitpicking and isn't that much of importance. The main star of the movie is Freddy Krueger played to perfection by Robert Englund who defined the character, his movements, sounds etc. And the movie's soundtrack is great at setting that eerie feeling and sound cues let you know when Freddy is near. A Nightmare On Elm Street is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and will leave you unsettled after watching, it is a genre-defining classic and anyone who has not seen it I would encourage you to. Although the series went downhill as time went on, this is the one movie that you can watch and be guaranteed to be creeped out over and over again. 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Enemy Within,"""Nightmare..."" is, perhaps unavoidably, most directly derived from ""Psycho"". ""Carnival of Souls"", ""The Haunting"", ""The Entity"" and ""Altered States"" are suggested.The center of this is Shakespeare: ""The sins of the father are to be laid upon the children..."" ('The Merchant of Venice'), which in turn came from classical and biblical sources. 'Hamlet' is also directly referenced. These are wedded to Grand Guignol excess.The acting and dialogue are almost toe-curlingly bad. But those aspects are forgivable, because they are compensated by the rather clever idea of the movie itself being a 'nightmare' within nested 'realities' -- Craven toys with us by confusing each level of reality with the others.Also quite clever is the construction: Freddy is Craven's alter-ego. The demon enjoys frightening the characters within in precisely the same manner that Craven enjoys frightening us -- a nesting of realities by self-reference.It wasn't the low budget that kept this from greatness, though. What's missing is any sort of interesting camera perspective or movement. The editing is competent, geared towards maximum jolt effect, as we expect from the horror genre. Other than that, it's mostly ordinary hand-held footage, par for the course.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Where Craven images succeed excessively,"This review leads to my interpretation of the whole story. Some major plot points are detailed. However, if you know little or nothing of the film, then read no further because this review may spoil the ending, such as it is, for you. See the film, then come back another time, perhaps?But first: I think we all know what is meant by the term 'chop-socky', a term that references physics-defying martial arts films from Hong Kong.Nightmare is a film that I put under the heading of 'chop-sicky' and a film that I deliberately avoided when first released, simply because I wasn't too interested in another specimen of what many call a horror movie, but which is in fact a terror-fantasy or a fantasy-terror, if you like. Chop-sicky just seems more appropriate to me...{For real horror, however, start with House of Wax (1953), then on to Psycho (1960) of course, then Peeping Tom (1960), perhaps The Shining (1980), Blue Velvet (1986), definitely Cronenberg's Dead Ringers (1988), don't miss Lost Highway (1997) and ¬ñ if you can stomach it ¬ñ Audition (1999), my own choice as the piece-de-resistance of horror movies. There're many others of course.}There are already some excellent retellings of the Nightmare story here. So, I'll mention it only briefly: Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) was a serial child killer who was murdered by angry parents years prior. Now, he resurrects in the dreams of some of the children of those murderous parents because Freddy now seeks revenge by killing their children. Hence, the plot traces how Freddy serially eliminates Tina (Amanda Wyss), Rod (Nick Corri), and Glen (Johnny Depp), the first and the last in particularly over-the-top (pun intended) gory scenes. The plot continues with Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) setting out to confront and defeat Freddy, while her father, Lt. Thompson (John Saxon) and her mother, Marge (Ronee Blakely) try to keep her from any harm.Now, if you buy that as a viable story, then you've bought into a fantasy where anything goes. Which is precisely what director Wes Craven wants when he has Tina torn to shreds on the ceiling by Freddy's unseen hands; when he has Freddy's knife-encrusted hand appear between Nancy's legs while she's in the bath; when a hole opens up under Glen in bed, and he's sucked down, minced up and then squirted back in a fountain of blood; when Nancy runs through the dark streets pursued by Freddy, but she eludes him, but only just; when Nancy, in class at school, appears to hallucinate about Freddy; when Nancy is trapped inside her home with Freddy and nobody outside, particularly her dad and the cops across the road, will respond to her frantic cries and gesticulations for help; and when Nancy descends down to the basement (oh, my, all alone again) to then wander through a labyrinth to finally defeat the nightmare of Freddy Krueger...All pure fantasy, of course. But, all dreams are fantasies, of one kind or another, with nightmares the worst kind. And this one is heavy with sexual symbolism, but not so far from some of the nightmares that some people have in real life, perhaps. So, does Nancy really defeat her nightmare? In this movie, she doesn't because, the story ¬ñ the whole caboodle, from opening to closing scene - is revealed as Nancy's own nightmare that is still in progress ¬ñ thus easily allowing the continuation of Freddy's rampaging in the sequel. In short, we're inside Nancy's head from the get-go. So, good night and good luck, Nancy, continue with your nightmare... and so also you, dear viewer, says Craven.Now, whether the resolution of this nightmare (with all the subsequent Freddy Krueger films) ultimately turns on fantasy or reality, I don't know. Frankly, I don't care because having finally seen this one, I'm quite sure that all the sequels are worse. With few exceptions, sequels do tend to go that way, don't they?Having said that, there's no doubt that Wes Craven (with a less than stellar cast) did a great job with the visuals, the special effects, makeup and editing. Sure, typical slasher stuff, but still technically very good and with great shock effect for the unwary. John Saxon plodded, competently, through the story as he does, usually; Heather Langenkamp overacted and was just too shrill, in my opinion; Johnny Depp was a welcome addition in this, his first movie (and the real reason I finally decided to see this film); and Robert Englund has, arguably, become a legend, but for all the wrong reasons, I think. The stand-out act, however, must go to Amanda Wyss (Tina) with the death sequence on the ceiling {over the top ¬ñ get it? ¬ñ and yes, a direct steal from Friedkin's The Exorcist (1973) when the devil raises Regan (Linda Blair) up to the ceiling} that is graphically and bloodily shocking, while also technically quite fascinating.What's that old saying? Yeah - the greatest flattery is copying! Craven, here with buckets of blood, obviously had barrels of laughs making this movie.To sum up, I guess I'd say that, as the first of the series, Nightmare is worth seeing ¬ñ just so that you can say that you've seen it.Not recommended for kids twelve or less.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

This movie is very interesting and has given a new twist to everything I despise of horror movies.,"Actually, I hate horror movies.
This movie is very interesting and has given a new twist to everything I despise of horror movies.It's finally a movie with its own stories that stands for itself, that acting is good and understandable despite the clearly much older actor than the characters (that goes for all), broken ones are good and I was the dark atmosphere who pervades all the movie.But I like this here in the dark literally pat tapping most of the time, I hate it when movies are just dark because we watch movies I want to see what happens in most parts of the movie play during the day or are so lit up that you even scenen at night recognize enough I also like the fact that we end up with little to know about Freddy that gives the whole a mystery touch and one is willing to work with the protagonists to find out more.I also like the fact that people really fight against Freddy and do not just run away that one sees far too rarely. There are some parts in film that you do not know if Freddy is real or not, or if you are in a dream or not that is very good for the movie experience
(Why do horror movies of the 21st century all have the same ideas and horror movies and films of that time are unique and different? One would think that today where more time has passed and there is more technology people would have more ideas?)The practical effects are all really good except at the end of the film Passau's a picture in because you can clearly see it's a doll and it gets laughable, even though it's not even a second, it's a big deal the last second of the movie is.I probably will not believe that, but I found the film to be 0% scary but at least incredibly interesting and exciting.Unlike many other horror movies and you really swear the danger here and you're excited and want to see people win, this movie is really exciting, interesting, had a good sorry, great acting and I also like Freddy Kruger's voice in places really funny.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Only in horror movies do men give birth,"Well, with the exception of John Hurt in Alien (1979), they give birth to themselves, as horror franchises. Michael Myers just keeps getting reborn, and Jason Vorhees likewise. And of course today's loon, Freddy ""Scissor-fingers"" Kruger.This is a landmark horror film with an original villain. He targets the young people in their nightmares, and it all comes true in reality. No, that isn't a spoiler. Everybody knows that much.Look out for the very young Johnny Depp, the only one with passable acting. The heroine, and her alcoholic mother, are basically terrible. Maybe that's alright?

Waking up dead...,"Something strange is happening on Elm street, teenagers are mysteriously dying and yet nobody seems to know why, the adults of course are concerned but when the children ask about Freddy Krueger they get nothing but silence as the adults try to stonewall their story. However Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) is determined to break the silence and escape the terror once and for all. John Saxon and Ronee Blakely co-star. Nightmare On Elm Street which is of course famous for introducing us to the bogeyman who invaded dreams, is by itself a classic horror movie with lots of suspense. Back in the 80's when it first came out, it was truly frightening and disturbing but now it's lost some of it's edge due to the sequels which took away from the menacing edge Freddy once had. Although it may not be quite as scary, it is however quite suspenseful with a fascinating premise and shocks that work. It is obvious that this is a classic but I for one found the mix of reality and dream-like mentality to be intriguing. One striking sequence in particular is how Langenkamp sinks into the stair way like quicksand, it's a very effective moment which borders on both reality and surreality of a dream with effective tension. If you haven't seen this movie, well you have either been under a rock or are squeamish of violence, never the less for a horror movie this is by far one of the best from the 1980's.* * * * out of 4-(Excellent)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A true classic though the ending is less than it could have been,"Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a truly masterful work. It is uniquely scary: No other horror film makes use of  the ""dream aesthetic"" as this one does. However, it does have three flaws: 1. The acting is uneven in quality. Heather Langenkamp's (Nancy's) performance is excellent as are the performances of most of the teens in the film and Robert Englund. However, the other performances are rather poor (with the possible exception of the actor playing Nancy's father). 2. Wes indulges himself, allowing his film to be diluted with some of the cheapest and most hum-drum devices of horror film. 3. The ending, which was changed from the one originally written by Wes, hurts the theme of the work---it destroys the sense that ""it was only a dream"" and again makes the work quite stereotypical. Despite these flaws, the aware viewer will notice much that is clever about this film and much that is terrifying in a way that can only be described as primal and archetypal. I give this film a 9.5 out of 10. A true classic. (With the intended ending, I'd have given 10 out of 10.) This film and ""New Nightmare"" are the only worthwhile ones in the series, however. If you must watch a third, Watch ""A Nightmare on Elm Street: 3."" Avoid all the others like the plague.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic indeed,"Okay, finally a scary old-school horror movie. Unlike ""Halloween"", which I consider to be overrated as hell, this one 100% deserves the hype and the legacy it has left is completely justified.I mean, let's be honest, the concept is just too good to mess up - a freak chasing you in your dreams? Just reading about it makes my blood go cold. The actual presentation and realization of the idea didn't disappoint in the slightest. The ending, though, was kinda disappointing.

Geeky Randy's summary,"A group of teens are haunted by Freddy Kruger (Englund), a burn victim with knives for fingers who murders his prey in their dreams. Not only scary for its violence and Englund's performance, but director Craven does a terrific job toying with the audience's perception between imagination and reality. However, the film is plagued by terrible dialogue, and Oscar-nominee Blakley's delivery is horrendous. Depp is surprisingly forgetful in his debut. Despite its overwhelming flaws, it's still worth a replay every five or so years.

Krueger is without a doubt an iconic character, the overall story is great, there's a lot of tension/ some genuine scares, several good moments of comic relief. It also has a great backstory plus our heroine has an immense determination and pretty much fights the fight all on her own/single-handedly.

A pioneer of today's terror films?,"I usually have a strong dislike towards terror films, especially modern ones or from recent years. This one had the age advantage for me to watch it, to see how it would be like. But I also watched it, following the suggestion of two people.It's significantly better than I expected (for a terror film, of course) but it's not a great movie, just okay. But then again, there are much worse in this genre.There is no denying that this movie had a deep impact on this type of films, not only because it was followed by a ridiculous number of sequels, but also because in later years many slasher/terror/horror (whatever) films were made, inspired on this. Even now this still happens.This movie is, as any film like it, disturbing. There is brutal, graphic violence. Plus, the character Fred Krueger (today more known as Freddy Krueger) is more than just sinister: he is nauseating, to say the least. It gives one nauseas, makes one feel sick just to look at him, even through we don't see him that well (at least in this one). Fred Krueger, with his razor-sharp knives on the fingers, makes me wonder if somehow he didn't inspire Edward Scissorhands (even though they are completely different type of characters). Ironically, Johnny Depp is in this (and he was Edward Scissorhands). Johnny Depp was really young here, looks so different that he is almost unrecognizable (and was still far from becoming an actor famous for portraying weird, eccentric characters).As much as the film is terrifying, it also is confusing. The way it transgresses the boundaries between dream (more appropriately, nightmare) and reality often made me not knowing what was real and what wasn't real. And it's strange (and scary) how nightmare becomes reality in this.The cast was nothing special in terms of acting, but I liked Heather Langenkamp as Nancy.

"Not exactly a ""classic,"" but a fun movie.","When I think of horror classics, I think more towards ""The Exorcist.""  In fact I found some of the ""Nightmare"" sequels more amusing.

In fact, I don't recall being terrified in the course of this film.  However, that doesn't reduce the entertainment value.Freddy's character was more developed in the later films, so this was merely an introduction to Mr. Krueger.  The effects are really good, but when not trying to generate scares Wes Craven wastes time with corny teen subplots, with cheesy dialogue and acting.  The other films in the series spent more time on the horror, so I think that's why I found them more entertaining.""Nightmare on Elm Street"" sets the parameters for the noted horror villain. As I said, this is not a classic.  But it's a good popcorn movie to sit through for ninety minutes.  And don't worry.

Freddy is the angst,only affecting the teenagers in the movie.Their parents don't understand/believe the situation,although they had problems with Freddy themselves in the past.

A fun and terrifying watch,"A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) is one of the more horrifying and well made horror movies of the 80's and I applaud Wes Craven for this film. Firstly, the premise alone is haunting - I don't think I need to go too much in detail on how being chased in your dreams by some burned figure with knives as fingers, and not being able to sleep because of it is excruciating. I mean our main protagonist went on a seven day run without sleep in spite of Fred Kruger.Speaking of the protagonist, I thought she was a complete badass and I loved the performances in this movie - they were genuine and believable. Obviously there are some little character choices and lines of dialogue that bothered me for the sake of narrative purposes but I typically suspend my disbelief for things like that now because they're only trivial matters.Overall, this movie is well-made and it is what you'd expect it to be. The ending was a little bit anti-climatic but I understand the underlying reason of why it ended the way that it did (or at least I interpret it that way). Nonetheless, a fun and terrifying watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The original man of your dreams,"Wes Craven's Magnum opus, A nightmare on Elm Street took the world with its creative style and tone when it debut. Terrorized an entire generation from going to sleep. Almost 40 years later it still remains one of the most iconic films of all time still keeping it's tone without being dated. The character still remains relatable basic high schoolers yet at the same time likeable. With such faces right off the back Johnny depp. In his film debut it's fun looking back now, but his character of Glenn isn't the most investing. It's Similar to Keanu Reeves in Bram Stoker's Dracula he has a part, but he's just really not that interesting when you get past the actor. Although he does get probably the best death in the franchise . While Heather langenkamp as Nancy she comes off as basic just like Jamie Lee in Halloween, but at the same time she relatable. She socially awkward with a Dysfunctional family, John Saxon as her father who's a cop investigating the murders and an Alcoholic mother. She does look like the least likely person to survive and fight back. Although the progression of her character over the movie really flows well with the pacing. Both are slow paced and build up to a payout. Creating a very interesting experience especially for it's time. Not just simply doing something supernatural like past films, but giving more of a psychological theme to it. The blurring between real life and dreams never really know right away where the dream starts and where reality ends. The toll of sleep deprivation and paranoia. It just all creates a surreal feeling to it. Thanks to it cinematography accompanied by it's very eerie Soundtrack. It incredible use of camera work and practical effects during the dreams sequences. Obviously can't talk about nightmare without talking about the man himself. Robert Englund who defined the character he killed it like he killed these people. While in the later films like The Dream master and Child he becomes more silly here, he delivered such a creepy and witty personally that has never been topped.

A Nightmare On Elm Street is one of the most influential horror films from the 80s.,"It's fame and popularity managed to spawn an entire franchise, ludicrous amounts of pop culture references and I'm sure a massive sale in gloves with knives as finger tips. This is a story of a group of teenagers who, when they dream, have nightmares of a killer named Freddy Krueger. So what's the main lesson here? Don't sleep if you live on Elm Street...just don't. Krueger is then able to kill these teenagers in reality as well...or so we think. Its surrealism and reality bending story means nothing is certain. The whole damn film could've been a dream...so let's take the whole plot with a pinch of sweet sweet sugar and just enjoy what's on show. What we have is a pretty intense horror that, due to the realm of dreams, is able to be creative and innovative with its scares. Yes, watching this now for the first time is slightly tame, but there are moments of tension particularly as these teenagers try to not fall asleep. Some of the deaths are incredibly iconic, especially a young Johnny Depp (wait...let's take a moment to admire how fluffy his hair looked!) who is sucked into his own bed and sprayed back out in litres of blood. That's sure to be one of the best deaths is cinematic history. Wes Craven created one of the most iconic horror characters ever: Freddy Krueger. Burnt face, knife glove of doom, striped shirt of terror, crooked hat of dread...he is what haunts people at night. The horror imagery that Craven conjures up is rather visceral, so whilst the film lacks in jump scares it makes up for in creepy atmospheric tension. This imagery and gore is what makes it the horror film that is today. Acting is your standard 80's teen flick. The repetitive musical score was slightly infuriating by the end of the film, although that theme tune is embedded into my mind forever. As a first-time watch in 2017, it's tame...but back in 1984 I'm sure it was a genuinely terrifying experience. Creatively scary is how I would describe this.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Craven had lots of fun making it, so we do watching it.","Great, imaginative premise: Freddy Krueger comes to you in your dreams, and if you believe he's real, he can really hurt you, even kill you.Executed in a fun way, with Johnny Depp in his first onscreen role, as one of the main characters, boyfriend to THE main character, in fact. He has quite a bit of screen time. If you're a Depp fan and haven't seen this, you'll love it. He's very young, 21 exactly.Genre pictures which are self-referential, and don't take themselves too seriously, and are made by someone who loves the genre are always the most fun. This is why The Matrix Reloaded was one of the least fun sci-fi pics ever, and why The Matrix series was just asking to be spoofed in the worst way - there's not a single joke about the sci-fi genre in it, or a single moment where it doesn't take itself seriously.Nightmare on Elm Street does not compete with most ""serious"" movies due to its incomparably bad acting (with the exception of Johnny Depp, who even at 21 captured the half-serious tone here), but in this case these unconvincing performances actually benefit the movie by drawing attention to the fact that this is only a movie, and further allowing the audience to enjoy and have fun with it. I was thinking, while watching it for the second time that if the performances WERE incredibly convincing, Nightmare on Elm Street would be rather unpleasant to watch. If you REALLY thought these teenagers were dying, and the central character was REALLY having to deal with their deaths, then it wouldn't be as fun. In an interview on the Scream DVD, Wes Craven says: ""People don't go to scary movies to be scared, they go to them to have fun."" The fact that he thinks this is what makes his horror movies the most fun. I sometimes wonder whether he'll be known for anything other than Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream. I hope he does give us something new and original, but if not, he has at least started two great fun modern horror series (even if their sequels are mostly garbage).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

the only horror film that scared me...,"Ok, I was only ten at the time, but of all those classic horror films of the 80's this is the only one that kept me awake after it was over.  The fact that it deals with dreams had a hand in that as well.  I know that it would have the same affect if I saw it for the first time today.  Everyone knows the story by now, but here's my two cents:  a group of four friends are being tormented at night by a creep in their sleep.  Now, it's undetermined how long this has been going on, which would've been interesting to know, so we could contrast how long it lasted before he starts killing them!  Yep, in their sleep, he has someway of manipulating time and space, and physically slashing them with knives he has affixed to his hand (the famed ""glove""). The ability of which was something that was never determined either. Heroine Langenkamp realizes what's going on when one of the menaced kids says it looked like four razors were cutting his girlfriend at once.  She tries to mastermind a plan to bring the killer from the dreamworld, into the real one.  A truly innovative premise for it's time, which included elements from more convential horror films, made this a memorable and heavy hit. Aside from your usual dark and spooky imagery, one of the more overlooked effects is the absolutely chilling music.  Lots of slow screeching, bongy noises, then shocking keyboard stingers to help jumpstart your heart.  They contribute to the eeriness as much as anything else.  And anyone who says the film is dated must be in a dreamworld of their own, as buckets of blood spewing everywhere (though TREMENDOUSLY overused in the silly bedroom death involving Depp) never go out of style.  The film has really held up well, as nothing like it has come along since.  The performances still work, Saxon's doubting dad, Blakely's boozy mother, cute and spunky Langenkamp, and then the man of your dreams, the hardly heard, but coarse voiced, giggly Englund as Freddy.  One downspot is the ""second"" ending, a confusing moment designed to finish the film with a scare, that made no sense.  But overall a fine beginning to a series that would spawn 7(!) movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of my all time faves,"This movie still creeps me out as much as it did when I was a kid. This is just plain and simple a classic horror movie. The story was original, the characters were relatively likable enough that you feel bad for them, and the atmosphere is just creepy. I don't know how, but watching it still makes you feel like you're in a dream. The town was so generic and I think that not having the familiarity of a big name town makes one feel lost or uncomfortable. There's this quiet discomfort that you feel from the moment the movie starts. Sure, the ending-ending is schlocky as all get out, but I can forgive based on the rest that preceded it.Freddy Kreuger is a legendary villain, slasher, and character. Pure evil and terrifying. Although his ""character"" cheesed out in later entries, you can still watch this and remember just how nee and fresh that kind of character was. He's not the guy under the bed, outside the window, or in the closet. He's in your dreams. Something you can't avoid since your body will eventually give way to slumber. Then you're on his turf and he can manipulate it however he sees fit. You don't get any scarier than not being in control of something that's happening in your mind.I could go on for days about this. It's one of my fave horror movies. I'm not jumping on a bandwagon of nostalgia either. I've been watching these since I was a kid. I just recently got around to signing up for imdb so I can rate and review.If you need an introduction to the horror genre, this should be high on your list....though not necessarily your first as you may not want to keep going!!

I did not think he was cool in this one he was creepy as hell. In fact Noes was the first horror film I saw at 5 and actually ended up going to school psychiatrist because of it. As a young effeminate boy my father thought it would butch me up. But it just made me have awful nightmares and idolized Nancy and wanted to be her. I mean after all she was the one who survived and she had a hot boyfriend played by a young Johnny Depo wearing a crop top. As I got older I really began to appreciate the perfection that is this film. Robert Englunds iconic performance as Freddy is nightmarish and the film's dark, gritty tone is disturbing. I now regard it as my favorite of the franchise and celebrate the unique creativity that went into every stylish frame and was the first step in establishing the late horror master Wes Craven as my favorite director.Budget: $1.8m

"1428, Elm Street : i thought it was rather 1963 ??? (Cinematheque)","Just kidding but Elm Street is the iconic place for JFK assassination and maybe its name stayed in the memory of Wes Craven¬Ö To tell more certain things, i wanted to do this new retrospective about Freddy's movies because they were great moments in my teens and the opportunity to see them on a big screen can't be missed! I don't remind exactly how i discovered them (maybe on VHS tapes or as multiple viewings on the french pay per view channel Canal +) and it's even more blurry to recall exactly the ones i saw then on TV. One thing is for sure is that i got interested in them with the extraordinary Scifi, horror fantasy french magazine ¬´ Mad movies ¬ª : i bought it from n¬∞ 69 (july 1989) to 83 (may 1993) so i have read detailed reports with lavished pictures about Freddy & Star Trek V, VI, Indy III, Batman I, II, Abyss, T2, Total Recall, Robocop II, III, TMNT, Twin peaks, Stephen King, Dracula¬Ö With all this, it's funny i can't say if i have ever watched this 1st one : i remember some scenes (in the bath, the long arms, the flames) but on the other hand, a lot of characters are black holes, even young Johnny Deep ! This franchise as put by Craven is interesting as it's a sort of crossover between ¬´ Halloween ¬ª, scary teens slasher and ¬´ Poltergeist ¬ª scary homes twisted by evil forces ! I expected to see also a sort of horrific ¬´ BTTF ¬ª for living in a small town in the 80s but unlike it, ¬´ NOEM ¬ª action focused heavily on the houses, bedrooms, cellars and high school¬Ö so it's difficult to tell about the town of Springwood itself but it's easy to see the nostalgia of those 80s in fashion, objects, cars¬Ö I can't tell if the story is sometimes lacking but this battle between reality and dreams is really confusing. It's hard to tell what really happens (especially the last scene ??) but in the same time, Craven is really talented to set a stressful pace¬Ö So this screening was really great for me and i'm thirsty to follow the sequels !!!NB: and i'm happy to be the 66-7th review and not the dreadful 666th!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The first and best of the the Freddy Kruegar films!,"""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" is a highly original horror film. A new icon of horror cinema was born and appeared in several sequels and a T.V series. The film made a star of Robert Englund, who made the character of Freddy Kruegar his own for all time. It is nothing short of remarkable and incredulous in what was achieved with ""A Nightmare On Elm Street,"" both from a technical and a storytelling standpoint. Audiences had never seen anything like this before. Wes Craven (R.I.P to a great director) was enjoying success with his films ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""The Swamp Thing"" at this juncture in the early 1980s. He drew inspiration for his next movie, from a real life incident somewhere in Asia. The said incident was about a young boy who claimed he was troubled by the nightmares he was experiencing whilst asleep. For the character of Kruegar and his appearance, Craven remembered as a boy, Walking along a pathway near his home. He came across this man who was a hobo. Craven said that he couldn't see the man clearly as it was growing dark but observed this shabby fedora hat the man was wearing. Then suddenly, the man cast a look at young Craven and stared straight at him. Craven fled in terror and soon reached home. The director took his ideas for the film to several producers but they all said no. They claimed that they didn't fully comprehend the story and that it would never be made into a film. Then an unknown producer named Robert Shaye was shown the project and he immediately agreed to be the producer for ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" via his own company of ""New Line Cinema."" The said company at this time, hadn't yet been established and Robert Shaye's office was slightly struggling. However, filming was scheduled to commence. John Saxon and Ronee Blakley were cast as the nominal leads but it was Heather Langenkamp who is the central character to the story. In the town of Springfield, a group of teenagers are experiencing some rather alarming nightmares. They all claim to being stalked by a man who wears a dirty sweater, a fedora hat, who wears a glove of knives and is disfigured. Soon, the teenagers begin dying and one of them, Nancy, begins to investigate who this man is and what it is he wants. The killer in the dreams, is one Freddy Kruegar and he has a score he wishes to settle. Nothing is what it seems in the world of Freddy Kruegar. In his particular world of dreams, everything around the victim is recreated to the smallest detail. That makes the film even more disturbing as the victim is lulled into a false sense of security. Only Freddy knows the rules of the game and he changes those rules to suit his own devilish ends. He turns reality completely upside down in his pursuit of his victims. The teenagers in question realise that it is fatal to fall asleep as they struggle to remain in control of their destiny. The dark photography highlights the eerie and thought-provoking scenario very well. Wes Craven's direction is amongst his very best as he makes this rather outlandish premise both plausible and very convincing. We are drawn into the world of Freddy Kruegar along with the teenagers. You have the impression of sharing their danger. What makes the film work most effectively, is that Freddy isn't seen all that much. Indeed, during the opening credit sequence, he is only seen in shadow and briefly in a close up. Robert Englund doesn't have a lot of dialogue but what he does have, is unforgettable. His actual screen time isn't much but his is the character to remember. However, the actors who play his victims are very good as they successfully display the vulnerability. Johnny Depp as Glen, was in his first proper film and he was one of these actors who developed his trade as he went along. Amanda Wyss makes for a convincing victim and gives her character of Tina some shading. Nick Corri makes it known in his character of Rod, that he is more frightened and vulnerable than he initially lets on. From the time the film was commissioned to be made, right up to post production, everyone involved in the making of ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" was aware of the tight budget and demanding filming schedule. Robert Shaye had to gain some financial support from elsewhere in order to have the film completed. His business partners kept appearing on the set and were always checking their watches and making some notes about the filming. Both Craven and Shaye felt the pressure of this and this caused a tense atmosphere throughout the rest of the shooting. The whole thing was made for $1,800,000 and that is not much money at all for a Hollywood movie. The filming schedule was for about 45 days or less. Considering all the technical scenes that were needed for ""A Nightmare On Elm Street,"" 45 days wasn't much time. The technical scenes represented the alternate real world as conjured up Freddy Kruegar. The effects department had to produce miracles and they did just that. The work they did is absolutely brilliant. The script could have been just another routine one, seeing as this film is another Slasher horror film. To the film's credit and to Craven's, the script is one of the best I have come across. It helps that the narrative is kept fairly tight and with no irrelevant subplots. The running time of 87 minutes is just right. ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" proceeded to make a fortune at the box office upon its release in 1984. The public immediately took to Freddy Kruegar and it wasn't long before a sequel was made.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very well deserved ""classic"" status.","Essential, well deserved ""class in the genre"" status.""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" is a unique Horror movie that successfully explores a common fear in humans : dreams. In this movie, a killer known as Fred Krueger uses dreams as his method for entering in the real world. Krueger turns dreams into deadly nightmares.This is truly Craven's Horror classic. ""A Nightmare..."" has set rules than only a few brave have managed to copy. Even though that Craven's killer in this movie is severely influenced by the Slasher craziness from the 80's, he is a scary concept in all the sense of the word. He can control nightmares and then kill his victims while they sleep. The concept is very scary but it's better executed. Craven's direction is classy and at some points looks like a real nightmare. The atmosphere is dark, unsettling through all the running time. There ain't no room for black humor or cheesiness. This movie goes directly to the point and manages to play with the audience's emotions.Also, the acting is really great. Specially by John Saxon and Robert Englund who carry the movie on their back. The rest of the young cast (including Johnny Depp) is fair good. The score is brilliantly scary. So when you have the correct elements to make a good Horror movie, think about ""A Nightmare..."" as a perfect example.I don't want to spoil this for those unfortunate who haven't seen it. Please, do yourself a favor and get this modern classic in the genre. It's not a defining movie but it surely is one of the best Horror movies from the 80's. Meet Freddy Krueger, the character that will mostly appear in your real life nightmares.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the undisputed godfathers of the slasher film genre,"Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street has become a quintessential genre classic; when people reference the ""good ol' days"" of horror or the slasher film, they generally have both Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street in mind. Not much can be said about the classic film that hasn't already been said before, aside from the fact that this remains one of the most fundamental genre films of its time and its impact as a film is still widely felt today like the waves of an aftershock. It's one of those horror films that you don't need to put in context of the times because it's so legitimately good and scary that it scares you anyway.We open in the midst of Nancy Thompson's (Heather Langenkamp) nightmare, where she is haunted by a figure wearing a red and green striped sweater, a fedora hat, and a hand made up of razors. She wakes up shell-shocked and informs her friends Tina (Amanda Wyss), Rod (Nick Corri), and Glen (Johnny Depp) about the nightmare, to which nobody but Tina seems immediately convinced, for she had a similar nightmare that same night. After a while, the gang brushes it off in favor of a sleepover at Tina's house, which ends in tragedy as Tina is brutally murdered in her sleep upon elevating from her bed and being viciously attacked by an unseen force. Because Rod, her boyfriend, slept with her that night, he is taken into custody and Nancy and Glen are left to confront what exactly is haunting them and how to stop it.The actual haunting comes from a demon named Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), a savage character that seems to be extracted from the bowels of your most sinister nightmare. His methods are dastardly original, for he haunts victims in their dreams and daydreams, before murdering them in their sleep, where they'll subsequently die in real life, as well. Wes Craven, who also wrote the film, makes Freddy so quietly ingenuous you might miss the reason why he's such an unexpected villain. Sleeping is when we, as humans, are at our most vulnerable, taken out of our environment temporarily in favor of a night's refreshment to ""recharge our batteries,"" so to speak colloquially, for the next day. With that, we cannot consciously control what and who we dream of, so Freddy shows up in our dreams in order to snatch us at our most vulnerable and make us not see another day. We can't defend ourselves, nor can we adequately predict what will happen.While Jason Voorhees, who predated Freddy a good four years to the point where he was already finding a new batch of impressionable youth to kill for the fourth time before his genre-counterpart decided to show up, could attack youth when their hormones and sexual energy were at its peak, Freddy attacked his victims during a time when they should've felt safety. With that, Craven emphasizes this realm of the dream-world by merging the likes of reality and dreams together, successfully blurring the line not only to confuse the characters in the film, but us, as well.None of this would be possible if the cast weren't as strong as they were, and save for some cheesiness in line delivery, most of the cast is strong here, particularly Langenkamp, who I would've loved to see take on varying roles aside from just horror films. The film also features the first on-screen performance by Johnny Depp, who gives one of his only human, everyman roles here in the face of grave danger.A Nightmare on Elm Street is often buoyed by a wonderful sense of suspense on part of Craven and cinematographer Jacques Haitkin, who do a fine job at not only blurring lines of reality, but creating a film that essentially bleeds creepiness, figuratively and literally. This is a downright spooky film, giving off the vibes of a demented haunted house, where at any moment a character will slip into an unforeseeable abyss and be scarfed up by demons like a piece of meat fed to hungry, feral savages. It's a film that manages to be occasionally gruesome without every being artistically empty or even an ugly piece of film; it's constantly enjoyable and a strong film in terms of its narrative structure.The only trouble, seeing past the cloud of nostalgia that often cloaks this film, is that the slowburn technique that Craven clearly tries to employ here sort of interrupts itself early in the second act, where we see a bit too much of Freddy, to the point where Nancy decides to engage in a fight with him. This feels like a case of ""climax come lately,"" where what could pragmatically be the conclusion to the film comes far earlier than expected and is instead used as a vehicle for the plot halfway through. Craven would've done better to keep Freddy a more abstract figure up until the end, focusing on his trademarks before revealing the final, hair-raising product. The scene where Freddy and Nancy face off in a dream feels like it happens far too soon and throws off Craven's methodical buildup.A Nightmare on Elm Street, through whatever flaw I try to accuse it of having, is still an indisputable masterpiece of the genre, destined to live on no matter how many sequels, remakes, reboots, or licensed products leach off of it. Much like The Hills Have Eyes, Craven's earlier work, this is a film that does a wonderful job at personifying fear, although while the former film gave us a taste of personified fear in an unfamiliar location, this particular film gives us a taste of unbridled fear at our most vulnerable.

The original and best of the Elm Street series!,"I just sat down and watched this movie again the other day and it's still damn impressive. The acting isn't always the greatest and it looks just the slightest bit dated, but it's still a really damn good movie. It's power lies in the fact that sleep cannot be avoided. In so many other horror movies, the victims are nothing more than vapid cattle wandering dumbly up the slaughterhouse chute and calling out: ""Is anyone there?"" as they go up. They purposefully get themselves into stupid and dangerous situations and therefore we feel no real pity for them when they are eviscerated. However, in A Nightmare On Elm Street, all the characters have to do to endanger themselves is to go to sleep. Even the most hardcore insomniac knows that eventually, sleep will come for you; it is unavoidable. We cannot blame our cast for wandering around doing stupid things in their dreams, because how many of us have had dreams in which we show up for work naked? Very rarely are we in control of our dreams, and in A Nightmare On Elm Street, the only person in control is Freddy Krueger.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

My personal opinion on the Nightmare series,"I first saw a Nightmare film when I was approximately nine years old - that was the fourth one. Keen to see more, I got hold of the first three. Out of all 7 original Nightmares, 1,3,and 7 are my faves - due to Nancy (Heather Langenkamp - who I admire as an actress not because she is a 'Scream Queen' but she works to make money on the side, it is not her life). The first NOES is much darker, scarier, and I recently watched the 're-imaging' and the original, and although I love the remake, this is one movie that stands out of the entire series.Even though the kill count is not high, the terror, suspense and horror is. He is a killer than cannot be stopped, getting us in the safest place - our dreams. I will not give away plot points but I will say this movie is a benchmark for many movies that followed, also spanning a pop - culture franchise that, to this day is still massively popular. Freddy was his scariest in the first, the killings were more thought out and more gruesome. In a way, it is a shame that Robert Shaye has more control over the series than Wes Craven. Four 'Scream' movies and I want more. Wes is the horror king, and I also want to thank Langenkamp for returning twice, and Englund for doing eight movies. He is the ultimate Krueger. The sequels were all good but none beat the original. Guess it comes down to Sidney (Neve) in S4 saying, ""Don't f*** with the original!"". THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVE MOVIES - IN ANY GENRE.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dream Attack.,"The kids of Elm Street appear to be having the same bad dream, one in which a scarred faced bogeyman in a stripy jumper hunts them with knives attached to his fingers. When the dream becomes a reality for one of the kids, and the worst happens, Nancy Thompson risks all to bring the bogeyman into the open.Stupendous horror movie, one that not even the ream of sequels, spin- offs and cartoons could ever diminish. Wes Craven creates a film of utter terror, unleashing one of the genres most famous monsters on the unsuspecting film loving public, with Robert Englund as the hideous Fred Krueger having the time of his life slashing away and delivering oral venom.A number of scenes and sequences are staggeringly memorable, in the process shifting into horror movie folklore. The youthful cast are sensibly written (Craven's screenplay that took inspiration from a true story he read about Cambodian refugees literally dying of nightmares!), they are not dumb these kids, just vulnerable, but led by Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) there may be hope of some survivors?The blurry line between dreams and reality gets a bloody make-over here, creating biblical snoots in the process. In short, essential horror movie for those inclined. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Slasher of the 80s,"While I'm sure modern audiences wont find this 80s slasher flick to be as terrifying as films like ""Hereditary"" or ""The Witch"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a classic horror flick that I believe is essential horror viewing for any cinephile worth their salt. Freddy is the most inventive slasher of the 80s, and he's one of the most entreating as well. Though I wouldn't say all of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies are worth watching, many of the sequels do have their merits.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Classic that rewards with repeated viewings,"I rate Nightmare as my third favourite horror, only behind The Omen and The Exorcist. Freddy Kreuger is one of the all-time great characters in movie history and he is played with the right amount of gusto and unnerving dread by the underrated Robert Englund. He embodies this character so well that there is no way anyone else could play it. Testament to the fact that they got him back for Freddy Vs Jason.Some people knock the sequels and it is true they don't have the horror of the first but they have that one staple ingredient that never leaves. Freddy.I can remember the film coming out in the mid eighties but being young I never had the nerve to rent it. I had had been scared s..tless by a viewing of The Exorcist and didn't plan to go through another few sleepless nights like that. After number three (Dream Warriors) had been out on video for a while, curiosity got the better of me and I rented it. A decision I'll never regret.People who know me know the story of when I was living in London and a friend of my cousin told of a great new film that was out. It was called An Angel at My Table and he said I should go see it. Standing outside the Prince Charles Theatre in Leicester Square I was standing there looking at two posters advertising the films playing. One was Angel the other was Nightmare on Elm Street 5. Needless to say I went to see Freddy. My cousins friend was disgusted. I upheld my decision which was the right one because I went and seen The Piano three years later and that is two hours I can never get back.It is a tribute to Freddy and his creator Wes Craven that I still enjoy the odd scare, although there hasn't been a horror film since Nightmare that has come close to that feeling of exhilaration and fear.Thanks.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is My Review of Nightmare on Elm Street 1. (WARNING: SCARY!),"4.5/7! I do not normally do horror movies (TOO SCARY!), but it is Spooky Season (right now, it is October here), so I watched Nightmare on Elm Street 1. Here now is my review:This movie is about teenagers being scared in their dreams. So scary, are the dreams, that they are afraid to go to sleep, because that's when the scary stuff happens.The movie stars Heather Langenkamp, and a pre-""21 Jump Street"" Johnny Depp (""the boyfriend""). It also stars Robert Englund, as the main bad guy who will appear through the entire series: Freddy Kruger (SCARY!).By the way, that is not a typo. His name is ""Englund,"" different than the country.Anywhoo, I watched this movie and I felt bad for the kids because the adults don't believe them. Who would? That's why being a teenager is so tough, I guess. No one listens, especially if it's far-fetched.There is a good joke towards the beginning where Tina (""the friend"") says ""Tina is 4 letters, that's not enough space."" I won't spoil what she's referring to (hee hee!).Heather Langenkamp is great as the lead character who overcomes her fears and realizes that Freddy cannot hurt her, because it's all a dream....OR IS IT! Got you! Ha ha ha. Anywho, watch this. It's pretty good. 4.5/7.Love,

Halloween Review #11: No horror film could beat this at the time,"So after Halloween and Friday The 13th,a new horror film was coming that was unexpectedly become a new horror film that would be going on for years to come,A Nightmare On Elm Street which focuses on the humorous killer Freddy Kruger who begins to haunt young Nancy's dreams unaware,she's get a police officer daddy and also,she's a pretty strong lady and won't take no sh*t from any one. When A Nightamre On Elm Street came out,it was booming,it was the new Halloween/Friday The 13th and as I said,it got another bunch of films and spin offs and a remake. The film is a brilliant classic,the acting was also brilliant especially from Heather Langenkamp who to this day,remains one of my favourite final girls along with Laurie from Halloween and Alice and Ginny from Friday The 13th:Part 1&2. Robert England was the only one in the three big horror franchises that actually appeared on screen and had actual lines,Michael and Jason just killed people and stared at people angrily. Johnny Depp also did a fantastic job in this doing an amazing performance as Nancys brother who was weird to see in this and even reappeared in the sixth Nightmare On Elm which was most likely the worst.

If Nancy Doesn't Wake Up Screaming She Won't Wake Up At All...,"If Nancy Doesn't Wake Up Screaming She Won't Wake Up At All...High School student Nancy Thompson, and three of her friends, are haunted by nightmares about a mysterious and frightening man with knives for fingers. When her friend Tina is horrifically murdered, the police suspect her boyfriend, Rod, of the crime. But Nancy begins to believe that the man from their dreams is killing them in her sleep.She deprives herself of rest in a desperate attempt to stay alive. Finally she learns that the man is Freddy Krueger, a child murderer who was burnt alive by the townspeople years ago. Yet as more of her friends are killed, she realizes that Freddy is alive and dangerous in the dream world. She must face him on his turf if she wants to survive.Nightmare on Elm Street is undoubtedly one of the greatest horror films of all time. Few slasher films have successfully created such an all encompassing atmosphere of tension, suspense, and terror. The film features a mix of decent and poor acting, with some of the better performances coming from Heather Langenkamp (Tina), Robert Englund (Freddy), and Johnny Depp, who plays Tina's boyfriend Glen and dies in one of the most classic scenes in slasher history. Nightmare is brilliant from start to finish, even if a couple of the special effects are a little cheesy, and some of the music is a bit hokey.Of course Nightmare on Elm Street has the dubious reputation of being one of the greatest horror films, but also spawning one of the worst series of sequels. Seven sequels followed the 1984 original, most of which were relatively poor all around. Freddy rapidly deteriorates into a wise cracking comedic character and the films transforming into cheese-fests composed of goofy kill scenes and plentiful female nudity strung together with feeble plots. The main exception to this sad rule being the 1994 sequel Wes Craven's New Nightmare, which saw horror master Wes Craven's return to the franchise as writer and director. The film was also remade in 2010 with additional unfortunate results, although nowhere near as dismal as the majority of the sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of my all time favorite Horror movies!,"Before the 80s, horror movies were very dark and original and they each had their own concepts and sub genres in horror. But when this movie came out, that changed EVERYTHING! Wes Craven has created one of the most iconic slashers in all movie history, ''Freddy Krueger'' played by the legendary Robert Englund and he is STILL known as one of the greatest to this day! This is a horror movie that knew what it was! It had likable characters, a VERY clever plot, great acting, and a very scary villain! I would actually consider A Nightmare on Elm Street the greatest slasher movie since Halloween! Nancy played by Heather Langenkamp was very good in this movie! I thought her character was very strong and was actually one of the few people in this movie who was ACTUALLY concerned about all these nightmares her and her friends are experiencing. Johnny Depp was also very good in this movie, considering that this was his FIRST movie he ever made, which lead him to a big career in the future and all of the other actors were good in this movie as well. A Nightmare on Elm Street REALLY surprised me when I watched it for the 1st time and as a horror fan, this is DEFINITELY one of my all time favorites! And as a low budget horror movie, this movie STILL works to this day! Some of the certain effects they used to make Freddy come to life in this film were very intense and scary and are still scary today! Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street is definitely a must watch for any horror fan and it is definitely a living masterpiece and of the best of the slashers and horror alone and of course I'm gonna give A Nightmare on Elm Street a 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Everybody's got to dream, young girl. If you don't dream... ya go","A good, simple question to ask about a movie that now has a kind of hollowed, pop-culture (not simply cult, like full-blown, mainstream) status in the industry - the kind of flick that's crossed over to the point where Kruger, via the sequels, is like the horror movie Mickey Mouse, a verifiable commodity as much as a scary boogeyman - does it hold up? For the most part, absolutely. Wes Craven knew how to make a helluva concept; indeed, that's in large part his legacy (look at the premises for Scream, Hills Have Eyes, People Under the Stairs, they're fantastic 'log-lines' in industry parlance). How he develops them, by himself as a writer or with another scripter, is the key thing.The great thing about Nightmare on Elm Street is that when it intends to be a horror movie with its sequences set in dreams - a good 20/25 minutes of this film are the nightmares, if not more - it's scary. Or it sure does try its damndest for 1984. And as a younger person, this first one was a legitmiately good time in the dark or with friends. It would come later for flicks like 4-5-6 (especially 6, good god) for the laughs, and those are enjoyable on their own. But this original, and to an extent 3 and 7, are meant to get under your skin. And for the budget they had, they do a lot with it.The blood supply certainly helps, but also the stunt-work and the effects are incredible; the shot of Kruger poking through the wall to look over his main target, nancy, is massively impressive, and it hasn't dated. Certainly as well the other main set pieces like the body in the hallway at the school being dragged by seemingly no one (that was the image that stuck with me seeing it at a too-young age) and the attacks on the other teens. But what's really crucial is atmosphere is built, piece by piece.This isn't a guy in the woods with a sack or hockey mask, nor is it some creep over a telephone (not that Freddy won't use a phone - he does, and it's the only goofy moment in the movie with him). These are dark, boiling furnace rooms and cellars, creepy alleys where Freddy can stretch his arms wide so that his finger-knives can get you quicker. The camera and editing in these scenes, like the opening and other parts - Nancy does, indeed, go down to the cellar, making this quintessential horror in that sense - is taut but it takes its time. There are a few jump scares, but they feel earned in a way; leave it to the dream aspect to make them acceptable.The acting is good too, especially from Langenkamp, who sells this teenager who is half sure she's in control and half nuts that she might be losing her mind, and Depp in his debut is solid. I think the only issues seeing it today come in a few story choices that don't totally make sense. It might not be distracting if the rest of the movie were lessor, but because so much of this is potent and effective (even the knives coming out of the bathtub, in-between the legs, is an obvious but awesome image), when it falters it shows. How Nancy is able to put together so many traps in her house, for example, is something that seems implausible, even in the scope of a ""slasher"", and I'm surprised just how blase the parents are. Maybe Nancy's mother's reaction has some point to it, and she may have a little more depth than the other adults, certainly more than straight-arrow cop John Saxon - but just when she gets interesting she drinks herself into a stupor and (very, very quickly, like as soon as Nancy leaves the house for what seems like a couple of hours) all the windows have bars over them. For... what reason? Foreshadowing?But in the grand scheme of what Craven is trying to do, these flaws are excusable. This is still an awesome effort in the ways that count; setting up a real, original threat that is like taking a Luis Bunuel premise and setting it in a demented-haunted house; the characters are not all completely worthless (even the idiot-jockish guy is more like Bobby in Twin Peaks than the jerks in Friday the 13th flicks); and I like how the concept of fear being the driving force behind Freddy's power as the conduit, something that would get more developed in part 3.

Contempory Horror At It's Frighteningly Best !,"This is the movie that gave me nightmares for months when i was a child, I know i wasnt supposed to watch it, but we'd go to this video store and get someone to rent this movie every week for us. Even though i have seen this movie for the 90 millioneth time, it still has that power to give me shivers.The main reason this movie sticks in my head is the pure horror of it,Wes Craven's fantastical direction and his tense set pieces (See Tina's Death for instance) Is pure horror movie genius and is definately one of my top 10 jaw dropping movie moments.For anyone out there that has'nt seen this movie (and i doubt it very much) RENT THIS or BUY THIS, because if your looking for a horror movie that has kept its scares, shocks, and creeps.. then this is the baby for you !ROLL ON FREDDY VS. JASON !",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Best Fantasy Terror horror film ever made,"Wes Craven brought us one of the most terrifying ideas, what would happen if your nightmares were real? That if you died in your dream, you died in real life? He brought us A Nightmare on Elm StreetThe monstrous spirit of a slain janitor seeks revenge by invading the dreams of teenagers whose parents were responsible for his untimely death. Fantasy Terror that set the bar for the surrealist horror genre .Produced on a low budget and a shot time line only 32 days to shoot the film . Wes Craven and crew came up with a masterpiece of Fantasy terror that pushes the horror genre even by today's age of CGI and green scene film making . A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of best horror movies of all time. It set the stage for a legendary fantasy terror horror film franchise second to none. This film is ""blew my mind"" when I was 18 and saw it in the Cinema in 1984. Watching it on the silver screen in 2020 after not being able to go to the cinema in 7 months was a real thrill for me personally. I took personal responsibility and took every safe precaution to stay cooties free. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a film that still delivers the fantastical visual emotional appeal thru the first rate sound effects,memorable dialog from Robert Englund . Believable acting from Heather Langenkamp who really makes the film sore. Wes Craven script and directing style bring this low budget film to the next level of creativity to the genre.

One of the greatest 80's horror movies ever.,"This is by far the best in the series. A boogeyman who attacks and kills in your dreams is just plain scary. He made me not want to sleep when I was little. He always stayed in the shadows and came out with a good scare. Had the best kill in the series with Tina. You can't argue the fact that this was a scary movie. One of my favorite scenes of the movie was when Tina was walking through the alleyway and see's Freddy with the long arms and says 'Please God' Freddy says showing his glove 'This is God"" and runs like a crack head chasing her. It had good special effects for a low budget 80's flick. Cast was excellent. Story excellent. The whole movie was excellent. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The best horror fantasy of the 80's,"""A nightmare on Elm Street"" is one of the best imaginative horror stories of all the cinema history.It is also one of the few movies that expresses a magic story that scares and it moves us.Our heroine is Nancy. A teenager that begins to suspect of a malicious man that only exists in her nightmares and in that their friends. Now she has to stop it before he kill her.The tale is fantastic, but after all had some flaws. For example, the end confuse a little, because we don't know if Nancy survives or not.I think one thing, the end is good. Why? Because maybe Freddy is dead and this was the last nightmare of Nancy.Of course, i say this without taking into account the sequels.Well, perhaps it is a question for the spectator...this it can be a way that the public decides what wants that it happens to Nancy.Another thing... i love the performance of Heather Langenkamp*Sorry, if there any mistake or something like that",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Wes Craven was a genius!,"Wes Craven really knew the horror genre like nobody else. A quick look at the body of work he created in his lifetime showcases some of the greatest stories in horror history. And the Elm Street series is no exception.
Perhaps his crowning achievement, this film still feels fresh and original to this day. It's the introduction we have to Freddy Krueger, the menacing bogeyman. And this isn't the Freddy Krueger that gets the most media attention, either: this isn't the wisecracking antihero. This is the man who works in the shadows, appearing only when it's absolutely necessary. His humour is pitch black and on point, and there's a serious vengeance in this film. This Freddy doesn't like to play with his kill.
The actors in this film, from Heather Langencamp to a young Johnny Depp to Robert Englund himself, give stellar performances, even when pitted against stunts that, at the time, would've been much more complex and complicated than today.
It's not the strongest entry in the series, but it's a remarkably solid introduction to one of horror's most iconic characters. It's a horror story the likes of which nobody had encountered prior.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Iconic horror classic,"Yes it's now dated, but you cannot deny the significance it showcased for the horror genre. The film created a iconic character and gave birth to a studio. The franchise may not be regarded as critically as this film, but that will distract from this cleverly created original. This film is better if you ignore the lore that surrounds it. It is a self contained head trip and the sequels tread all over its legacy. True cult phenomenon and definitely deserved the iconic status bestowed upon it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Freddy rules all!!,"Many people will already know of Mr Krueger because he is a household name and it is this movie which made him a star and the ultimate horror icon. This movie is a true classic and many consider it to be the scariest of all time, with the fact that Freddy attacks you in your dreams which we all have and can't resist sleeping so his victims all all doomed (which makes for good watching!). Some of the special effects in this movie are know dated such as the extending arm effect but others such as the scene where Freddy looms out of the wall are still impressive and will make many people afraid to sleep. The gore is brilliant with the first death being my personal favourite in horror history for reasons you will see for yourself. If you haven't already seen it, you must this is one of the greatest movie of all time with the greatest killer of all time. See it and love it.1,2 Freddy's coming for you.....",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Very Original Horror Classic.,"As a child, my older brother would always scare me with stories of Freddy Krueger.  You see i was at that age where my parents wouldnt allow me to watch anything like A Nightmare on Elm Street because they didnt want me waking up in the middle of the night and asking to sleep in there bed.  He would tell me the history of Mr. Krueger and that if i went to sleep he would get me in my dreams.  The thought of this at that age really scared me.  A few years later, i was a little older and i was home alone.  I took my brothers copy of ANOES and watched. I was extremely scared.  Freddy was a great horror villian.  I just saw this movie recently, me being much older then i was the last time i saw it and more mature.  This was a good movie. Now, not so scary, but definitly a classic and it was very original. It was also very entertaining and really made you think about your dreams.  This movie does live on as a class, although it was almost killed by the all of the horrible sequels, you were no long entertained and or scared while watching freddy, you were suppost to be laughing because freddy went from being a horror monster to the next Jim Carrey.  Please avoid all of the sequels besides Wes Craven's New Nightmare and watch this. A Classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Nightmare Movies,"This movie is the all time best ever! Even though He's more gory than the other Freddy movies. Readers be warned Freddy is not really real! He is just a character trying to scare u! Freddy is just a freaky name!! So don't be scared of the movie! Remember the jump rope song is just a song to scare people from falling asleep. Just tell yourself It's just a movie. But this movie is the best one out of all seven! Johnny Depp is the best actor in the movie. The best scene is when Freddy says to Nancy ""I'm your boyfriend now Nancy"" That's when Glen Lantz dies through his bed and blood soaks up the room! Wes Craven is awesome!

It's good for me,"Freddy Krueger is back...oh wait, this was actually the first movie in the series. I did in fact watch the 2010 remake and recognized it for the crapfest it was. This movie is superior in nearly every way even though I'm not a fan of slasher movies. Freddy was notable in being the first slasher villain who talked so this really was something innovative at the time. Come to think of it, has any slasher movie remained silent since his introduction? Chucky, Pinhead, the leprechaun, they all talk and came out later. I think a weakness is that Freddy isn't on screen that much.He actually doesn't talk that much in this movie which is probably for the better. He appears as genuinely scary in this. We actually do get some pretty good character development for everyone else. That's probably because this movie has a fairly low body count and we're not just given the sense of developing doomed characters like the lesser ""Friday The 13th"" movies. Hey, this had ""Home Alone"" antics before ""Home Alone""! It's interesting to learn about the series mythology even though it isn't all explored here. ***",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Craven's inspired movie,"This is truly one of Craven's best films; also I enjoyed Last House on the Left. The plot is outstanding, and the whole fantasy like environment gets your interest. Craven had about a 1.8 million dollar budget to complete this masterpiece and New Line Cinema was on the verge of taking a first class plane ride to ""no wheres-ville"". So when you watch this movie understand that Shaye and Craven gambled on their careers with this film. Actually, Craven had nothing to lose... his occupation before his outstanding filming career was a taxi driver. So, he was use to non extravagant living. Well, the film is truly good, scary and the actors are truly genuine.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of Craven's  best,"Wes Craven is one of the best known names in the horror genre, and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is one of his best! In the wake of his success with Nightmare, Craven was able to get movies made - even if nearly all of them were horror films (he was typecast as a director). During the late '80s and early '90s, he made a string of forgettable motion pictures. Following the original A Nightmare on Elm Street, he largely turned his back on the series (although he did executive produce the second sequel, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors). However, in 1994, he used a new and radical concept to take control of the Nightmares for one final outing, Wes Craven's A New Nightmare, which brought things full circle, once again blurring the line between reality and fantasy. In the wake of A New Nightmare (which was largely praised by critics, but was given a lukewarm greeting by horror fans), Craven turned his attention to Scream, the success of which advanced his reputation further.A Nightmare on Elm Street is tailor made for those who like their gore leavened with thought-provoking ideas - something that is a rarity in this genre. Sequels dumbed down the series to a regrettable degree, but the first movie still stands on its own as an intriguing and chilling example of how horror works best when the characters and the audience don't have to be lobotomized. Those who appreciate scary movies can do no better than a double feature of Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Taken in tandem, those two films epitomize all that was good about '70s and '80s horror films.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The script was something new at that time, reality, dreams and revenge. The teen slasher films were highly popular by then, but Craven mixed the serial killer with a supernatural elements, then ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" was one of the first supernatural slasher movies and Freddy Krueger a creepy villain. Nancy Thompson was played by Heather Langenkamp, a great performance, a scream queen, but this character was not the usual helpless last girl, she was the first strong last girl, fighting for survive.

Best Film of the 80s,"When I did my last review way back on December 13th, I don't think I got my point across.This movie is pure genius. With a low budget of $1,800,000, A Nightmare on Elm Street sure did great with the effects. All that blood and Tina being dragged on the wall, excellent. The acting was well done, and the dark mood (unlike the sequels) worked great and scared me through the whole movie. I liked the way that the movie started out as a bright world, and slowly turned darker.This is definitely Wes Craven's best work. He made New Line into what it is today.The story is simple for those who haven't seen the magic and pure horror of Elm Street. 4 friends are having terrible dreams of a dark man (Fred Krueger, not Freddy like in the sequels) who can kill you in your dreams.The sequels were good, but ended up going a little bit lighter, having Fred Krueger becoming a joke who no one is afraid of now. But back in 84, he was more then scary, he was... well... REALLY scary. I give A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 stars out of 4. 'nuff said.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Original, brave, and a saving grace for New Line Cinemas","Stylish and atmospheric, and with many bright young stars throughout- A Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic that may not be the best horror film around- but certainly earns its legendary status. To start off with the flaws of the film I feel it can be a bit stretched out at times. Some scenes feel a bit oddly placed, and I feel a bit more of screen time could have been used for character development instead of other useless scenes, but it did a smooth enough job of handling its 90 minute runtime anyway. Ronee Blakley who plays our main characters mother can feel a bit wooden at times, but besides her the cast is rather great, especially out lead actress Heather Langenkamp and of course Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger. Krueger only stars in the film for about 7 minutes, and yet Englund makes his character stand out more than most horror films could dream of, and truly is a great fit for the infamous serial killer. The atmosphere and look of this film is great, feeling grounded but also nostalgic in its tone and colors. It's atmosphere is magnificently done and provides for many fun and intense scenes throughout. It's not a perfect horror movie, but it's perhaps the best classic slasher film made at the time, and it is rather enjoyable to watch.My Rating: 8.6/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Freddy Krueger is a 10/10!,"Awesome movie, awesome story, awesome cast, just awesome.
Of course the special effects arent the best but considering the age or the movie(s), its totally fine. You can see the love and detail the cast put into the movie. Usually when I watch movies, I always do something like crocheting, doing a puzzle, drawing or things like that, because I get ""bored"" too quickly by ANY kind of movie/ tv show, some say this leads to not enjoying the movie enough but that is just how I roll. BUT this movie made me sit there, crocheting stuff beside me, and just watching and thinking ""ok, I will start crocheting any minute"" but then the movie was over, so it is safe to say that it keeps you entertained the whole time!Moreover, Freddy Krueger is such a cool killer.

A Delightful Trip To Your Nightmares,"Ah, the land of dreams...the place that we feel the most safe, where nothing can possibly harm you, but what if those sweet dreams weren't made of this at all? What if those dreams were horrifying? What if those dreams were fatal? What if if you woke up from having a particular terrifying nightmare only to find your friends had the same nightmare and weren't alive anymore? Our parents often say 'sweet dreams' to us when we go to sleep but those words aren't enough to keep the dark forces at bay. And what better dark force to haunt everyone's dreams than Freddy Krueger?Based on a series of occurences that Wes Craven himself read about, about a bunch of teenagers being killed in their sleep, this is Nightmare On Elm Street. The movie that launched an icon, and what an icon indeed. If you haven't heard of Freddy Krueger, I pity you for not knowing about him and I hope he'll visit you in your nightmares, because you deserve to be introduced to him.Freddy is an icon, iconically portrayed by Robert Englund (it's also kind of ironic that Englund said he has had nightmares of Freddy/about Freddy, but also i'm glad he loves the Elm Street fans) in all of the main movies in this franchise and Freddy VS Jason, this killer's look cannot be mistaken for anyone else, with his unsettling scarred/burned looking face, his signature hat and sweater, and of course his gloves with the claws. After the parents of the children of Elm Street burn him, he comes back from the dead as a dream demon to haunt said children/teens in their dreams and thus making it unsafe for them to fall asleep. 1,2 Freddy's coming for you, 3,4 better lock your door. No one else can pull off Freddy quite like Robert Englund does, which is probably why the remake failed. Also I adore the Treehouse Of Horror parody of this with Groundskeeper Willie, that's one of the best Simpsons halloween episodes/segments in my opinion. Also it's interesting that the makeup artist who did Robert Englund's Freddy makeup also did the makeup for Dan Aykroyd's demented judge in Nothing But Trouble (Aykroyd must be a fan of this franchise and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and also apparently he likes Hellraiser too),",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nightmares of Wes Craven,"Wes Craven's had played upon the subconscious nightmares of average Americans in his first two movies The Last House on The Left and The Hills Have Eyes. Both these movies were a typical motif of the 70‚Ä≤s exploitation grindhouse flicks, damned as B cinema, but which in years later would have a cult following of their own. They had certain elements common to 70‚Ä≤s Grindhouse flicks, copious amounts of gore, sex, nudity and violence. But most importantly they seemed to play upon the insecurity of the average American to the 60‚Ä≤s free sex, free living, flower power movement. In the Last House, two teen girls, out for a quick fix of hash, on a weekend, get into trouble, as they are kidnapped, gagged, taken to the woods, raped, tortured and finally kiled. Craven seems to set the line between the good folks and the bad folks, the bad folks, were guys who got stoned, were slutty, and horny. In an ironic indictment of the free sex mood, a particularly graphic scene, shows the two teen girls, forced to have sex with each other in front of their tormentors. Craven draws the line even more clearly in The Hills Have Eyes, where the good All American family, is stranded in the middle of nowhere, and they have to deal with the bad guys, the a family of violent thugs with a cannibalistic tendency.In 1984, Craven came out Nightmare on Elm Street, a movie , that actually preys on a common fear, of nightmares. So many times we would have had nightmares, waking up in sweat, and wondering what if it really had happened. Interestingly the word nightmare originates from an Old English word referring to demons called incubi which were thought to sleep on the chests of people. This could be one reason, why the nightmare device has always been a favorite of horror fiction writers.Traditionally horror movies have worked on the idea of something unseen somewhere, coming out and attacking us. Poltergeist played with the fear of ghosts coming from a TV set, and much later The Ring, toyed around with the idea of a spirit coming from an old video casette. The very reason why Nightmare is to date regarded as one of the best in the horror genre, is that its not just your routine, evil spirit comes out and goes slash, cut, slash on screaming victims. Nightmares have often been said to be the outcome of our inner fears, so Craven here by suggesting that our inner fears could actually end up coming true, puts in a psychological, Freudian sub text.One of the scariest opening scenes, a young teen female of around 15, by stalked by a mysterious stranger.What i loved here is the way, Craven, shows the credits in every frame, the girl leaves behind, and we have the blades ripping through the fabric.The opening murder is quite a shocker, following a standard clich√© of slasher flicks-With great sex, comes sudden death. What I loved here is the way Craven, shows this from the POV of both the girl and the guy. On a side note, some kinda underlying message too here. Nancy(Heather Lagenkamp) the heroine, who refuses to have sex with her guy Glen( a certain Jonny Depp)is the one who survives. Tina her pal, who has a hot romp under the sheets gets killed. Something on ""Don't cross the line"", which Craven showed in The Last House on the Left too.Not giving too much of the story away, but what works here is some absolutely creepy stuff, particularly one scene where Nancy gets pulled into a dark pool, while having her bath in a tub.It has a total kick ass heroine in Nancy, who seems smart, sassy, feisty, quite a change from the dumb low IQ scream queens of horror flicks. And yeah Freddy Kruger one of the nastiest characters you can ever imagine.This Nancy vs Freddy Kruger face off stands on par with Clarence Starling vs Hannibal Lecter, Ripley vs the Alien. And Heather Lagenkamp while no Jodie Foster or Sigourney Weaver, does a fairly good job. Also good to see John ""Enter the Dragon"" Saxon, in a support role as the heroine's cop father.Craven also creates the necessary creepy mood here, with good light and shadow effect, especially in the surrealistic dream sequences, and also the climax. Though shot on a very low budget, the movie does not have a tacky feel to it, and the special effects are well done. The 80‚Ä≤s feel is there though, especially with some of the blood spilling scenes. Craven however did not take much interest in the sequels, though he wrote for the 3rd part, with the result, that like any other franchise, this also went downhill, as the subsequent versions just dumbed down the intelligence of the original to make them more audience friendly.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great, Genre Defining Horror Movie","A Nightmare On Elm Street, directed by Wes Craven (Scream, Last House On The Left, Red Eye), is a great horror movie that added to the genre.The story follows Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) and her three friends Glen (Johnny Depp), Tina (Amanda Wyss) and Rod (Jsu Garcia). They are experiencing nightmares where they are being stalked by Fred Krueger (Robert Englund). As her friends start to fall to Krueger's blades, Nancy sets out to learn about Fred and his past and how to kill him once and for all.Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter and George A. Romero made movies that changed the horror genre in the 70's. In the the 80's it was definitely Craven's new concept of being killed in your dreams that changed the genre a little more.This film is great. The acting is OK for a horror, the storyline interesting and the chills are all there. This film doesn't contain a lot of gore but it still maintains it's constant shocks.
