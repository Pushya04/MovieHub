Tim Burton Claims Sweeney As His Own!,"As a fan of the original stage version of this grimly Gothic tale, going into Sweeney Todd was bittersweet in my hopes and expectations. However, I'm pleased to announce that I did find Burton's latest effort impressive and intentional. Fans of the original won't be disappointed with a top-notch cast and the wonderfully dark overtures that haunt every minute of Sweeney Todd. Tim Burton, one of the masters of ambiance, sets his atmosphere in the grisly streets of a depressed London and his artistry punctures through every scene of screen time. I would have to clarify that, while Johnny Depp is a skilled actor, fans of the original will find it hard to believe that Depp has the ability to transform into the George Hearn ""Sweeny"" we've come to know. This is in fact true and recognized by Burton. In this respect, the character of Depp is not played as the same manner as the deep-voiced, towering Todd from the musical adaptation. Depp's is more of a less boisterous and thoughtful one. The vocal performances are great but have a different approach and feel to them. It was a refreshing adaptation and I feel a triumph on the part of Burton for making a stage-to-screen experience that captures you from it's bloody introduction.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Butcher of Broadway,"After fifteen years in the Australian pokey, barber Johnny Depp (as Benjamin Barker) returns to his nineteenth century Fleet Street, London flat and assumes the name ""Sweeney Todd"". Wrongly imprisoned, Mr. Depp is in a vengeful mood. He learns his wife has poisoned herself, and left teenage daughter Jayne Wisener (as Johanna) in the clutches of lusty Alan Rickman (as Judge Turpin) and Timothy Spall (as Beadle Bamford). Depp's sailing companion, young Jamie Campbell Bower (as Anthony Hope) hears Ms. Wisener singing, and falls in love at first listen. And, she is similarly smitten.Meanwhile, acting like ""Aladdin Sane"", Depp showers himself with the blood of throat-slit victims. His new co-dependent companion, dark-eyed Helena Bonham Carter (as Nellie Lovett), sells meat pies made with the human carcasses Depp provides. ""And baby makes three"" when Depp and Ms. Bonham Carter ""adopt"" gin-swigging young teenager Edward ""Ed"" Sanders (as Tobias ""Toby"" Ragg), after making tasty mince meat out of his swarthy guardian, Sacha Baron Cohen (as Adolfo Pirelli).Subtitled ""The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"", director Tim Burton's ""Sweeny Todd"" is more horror opera than Broadway musical. The promotional material says it ""has been hailed as a masterpiece by critics and audiences everywhere."" Now, that's going too far, in this case - but, you know Burton and Depp are going to be attached to something visually arresting, and is certainly so. There is, at least, masterpiece-caliber work from the likes of Colleen Atwood, Dante Ferretti, Francesca Lo Schiavo, and Dariusz Wolski, who will hopefully continue to be seen among the outstanding Burton/Depp crews.******* Sweeney Todd (12/3/07) Tim Burton ~ Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Jamie Campbell Bower, Ed Sanders",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sublime,"As it happens more often than not, greatness is relegated to some obscure angle. In a year of brilliant opuses by the Cohen Brothers and PT Anderson, this Tim Burton film shines as the best from every angle. It's not just that Burton creates another superb, dark universe with Dante Ferretti's complicity or that Johnnt Deep breaks new ground, or that Helena Bonham Carter surprises us with a complex, marvelous realistic parody. The film touches visually a very private cord. Ed Wood managed that but Tim Burton with ""Sweeny Todd"" elevates it to the purest form of art. He will be punished for that, as Ed Wood was in its day. Disappointing grosses in a world that worship grosses will make it appear as a sort of a failure. My advise to you is run to see it wherever you can find it. Try to see it in a big screen with great sound. You will fly and dream and be taken away by the masterful hands of Tim Burton and the glorious faces of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gloriously Dark,"Tim Burton has gone beyond himself and anything he has ever done. ""Sweeney Todd"" is stunningly beautiful. Dark? yes, bloody? sure! but then we're in Victorian London where everything is what it appears to be no matter how turgid. The meeting of Mr Todd and Mrs Lovett is so scrumptiously conceived that I'm sure will be one of those film moments that are used whenever ""great film moments"" are compiled. Johnny Depp will never cease to amaze me. He is not just the beautiful boy with soulful eyes, but a great actor. How extraordinary that two talents like Burton and Depp should meet at the perfect moment in time. How lucky for us! Mrs Lovett is played by another extraordinary actor: Helena Bonham Carter. She is spectacular! Sacha Baron Cohen, Alan Rickman and in particular Timothy Spall add to the perfection of this film. Dante Ferreti, the production designer and Coleen Attwood, the costume designer, deserve all the kudos they are getting and will get. Glorious!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Johnny Depp's greatest movie!!,"""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is one of the best musical films ever made and probably the last truly excellent Tim Burton effort in directing. It's a romantic and enthralling vision of the dark perspective about life and death for the poor people controled by the privileged, cruel and envious society. It finds a inspired Johnny Depp in probably his best performance of this century. Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall compelte this luxury cast, which is one of the most talented one assembled in a musical!",,Anonymous,Horror
If Disney were Emo,"I enjoy watching Depp as he has honed playing disturbed characters at the level of Christopher Walken ,Jack Nicholson, or even Kinski. I enjoyed the dark humour and the murders were quite graphic although the first doesn't happen till nearly an hour in. The story of a wrongfully imprisoned barber set on revenge of the judge who sent him away hatches a devilish plan with a meat our baker. I enjoy thrillers and this film did deliver in that genre. However I have never seen a musical before and likely never will again. For me it didn't quite work and as a result had to give it a slightly lower rating. 3/5.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Johnny and Tim forever,"What an extraordinary treat this bloody dirty tale of vengeance and gore is. The exquisite way Tim Burton presents it to us makes it so. Stephen Sondheim's stage masterpiece becomes a film masterpiece of unequaled stature. Everything about it reeks of genius of magic. Once again, Johnny Depp fills, Burton's macabre universe with overwhelming humanity. He can slash as many throats as he wants if we look into Johnny's eyes we see the struggle, the human winning in despair. I know I'm not making too much sense but I just want to urge you, if you love cinema, to rush and see it as God intended, on a big screen and Dolby surround sound.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Attend the tale,"""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"" directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, is based on the Stephen Sondheim musical from the 1970s. I remember sitting stage right, down front, in the theater when I saw this musical with Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou and being completely, utterly blown away. As a stage show, it was jaw-dropping, with some of Sondheim's most beautiful music: ""Johanna"" is perhaps my favorite of all Sondheim's songs, but the score also includes the beautiful ""Not While I'm Around"" and ""Pretty Women.""Seeing the film is a different experience from seeing the musical. Burton does a marvelous with it, blending the macabre grand guignol with the cartoonish and also with reality, overall giving the movie a really murky atmosphere. ""By the Sea"" was, for me, pure Burton. Depp, Carter, Rickman, Ed Sanders, Jamie Bower, etc., are all excellent, Sacha Baron Cohen does a great turn as Pirelli. Sweeney can be a great singer, as he usually is on stage, but he really doesn't have to be, and Depp and Carter match well. The singers need to be Joanna, Anthony, the judge, and Toby if at all possible. They all sing very well in the film, and the orchestrations are fantastic, ""Johanna"" and ""Pretty Women"" being the highlights.The ""gore"" looked fake so it wouldn't be too off-putting; it off-put me anyway. More than that, the entire story is sickening - somehow the distance between the audience and the stage makes it more palatable. Plus, the original show has a much lighter touch and, in the character of Mrs. Lovett, a good deal of humor. Burton plays the story much darker. I literally gagged a few times. I would have been better off just listening to the soundtrack.In the end - not my thing, but this extravagant musical may surely be yours.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A refreshing and brilliant film,"Contrary to the many comments I have read and heard about the film thus far, I thought it was absolutely wonderful. After what some could term a ""dry spell"" for Tim Burton, it is such a breath of fresh air to see this new offering, Sweeney Todd. The movie showed Tim returning to his roots of the dark, the sinister, and the macabre. All were blended together in the setting he is so very well-known for, the dark streets of London.In addition, I thought the fact that he maintained the musical aspect of the film/play worked in the movie's favor. I know Johnny Depp has said that he can't sing, but he sang rather well if you ask me. Keeping the cockney accent, whether singing or not, it made the film that much better. While I was surprised to see Danny Elfman not included in this movie, I believe the music was performed and carried out beautifully, nonetheless. Indeed, the accents can at times make it hard to discern what is being said, but that's not always a bad thing, considering the circumstances. Were they to all of a sudden not speak or sing with their cockney tones, it may provide a problem with consistency. Overall, I loved the movie and have no complaints. A very refreshing return to the realms and themes that Tim Burton is so very amazing at capturing. Top notch!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dark Humor Done Right,"Despite the grim expectations from the story synopsis, the film delivers gore in a surprisingly tasteful way. There are no screaming teenagers running from a lunatic; instead we get a somewhat British blend of satire, slapstick and just ""wrong"" humor. Although I'm not much of a Johnny Depp fan, I enjoyed his performance as well as Helena Bonham Carter's. Even the portrayal of the common clients was stunning.Despite being generally familiar with the story, I fell into some traps expecting specific twists, yet something different (and better) being delivered. This is a model of how to do dark humor that filmmakers should and probably will follow. It is most refreshing. Don't read the story and don't read any spoilers until you've seen it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Since when? Since Mary Harron's ""American Psycho""(which had Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, the man of the dark nights, had become Christopher Nolan's Batman afterward). This way or another, every psychopathic killer is completely bewildered and is repented at the end. Yet before, there was no repentance. For instance, Beetle Juice was never repented, Addams Family were never repented, Reservoir Dogs were never either. Somebody please tell me: Who put this repentance law to psycho movies?Anyway, Sweeney Todd:The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a musical film-noir from Tim Burton with his original style of bearish and abominable bugs'n beetles movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tim Burton's most dramatically satisfying film so far.,"I approached Sweeney Todd with trepidation, having been underwhelmed with most of Tim Burton's recent output and every screen musical of the last decade. The biggest problem I have with Burton's films is that his screenplays rarely manage to pull their disparate elements into a satisfying whole. Here, despite adapting the material to his own sensibilities and shortening the play by an hour, he adheres closely to Sondheim's book, resulting in the most dramatically satisfying film Burton has ever made.I liked the adaptation of the off-off Broadway Hedwig and the Angry Inch, but have been left underwhelmed by all the recent big budget film musicals, so I'm glad to say that Sweeney Todd, wipes the floor with every major screen musical of the last decade, including the likable if over extended Hairspary. Most surprising is how shockingly gruesome the the film becomes in the second half. This must be the most blood drenched film since Shogun Assassin, with arteries spurting blood like like fountains as throats are cut, with the violence escalating towards the end leading towards a climax that is exhilarating, heartbreaking and satisfyingly bleak.Unlike the dreary dirges Danny Elfman supplied for Burton's stop frame musicals, Sondheim's score is a joy to listen to from beginning to end, its dark romanticism sometimes reminding me of Bernhard Herrmann, perfectly fitting what is both a musical and a horror film in equal measures.Depp and Bonham Carter are both excellent and it's down to their performances that I never quite lost sympathy with them in their descent into madness, blood lust and cannibalism.Musical haters may not be converted as 75% percent of the dialogue is sung, but this completely dispatches any notion of cloying sentimentally the genre is often associated with.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best musical in years!,"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is one of the year's most talked about films, it's getting big Oscar buzz and of course, what could be better than Tim Burton taking on this dark musical? With Johnny Depp starring along with beautiful Helena Bonham Carter by his side, this movie just screams terrific. My mom and I saw the movie today and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street lived beyond to my expectations. Tim Burton hasn't exactly released a classic lately that would be remembered for all time, but Sweeny Todd is sure to make it's way into one of the most memorable films of 2007. Johnny Depp and Helena both have incredible voices, they were so hauntingly beautiful and magical together, it's like these roles were made for them. Along with an equally strong cast as Alan Rickman and Sacha Baron Cohen who were also incredible, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a new memorable musical for years to come.Sweeney Todd has come to London on a mission, a mission for revenge! His wife was taken by the evil judge for his own pleasure's with her and Sweeney's daughter. Now Sweeney's daughter is grown and is being held by Judge Turpin and he has been informed by his lover, Mrs. Lovett that his wife has died. ""At last my arm is complete!"" Sweeney says as he raises his faithful razor and wishes to kill the vermin of the world as well. Mrs. Lovett comes up with the clever idea to create a tasty meat pie of the victims and makes quite the popular business. But Sweeney is determined to find his daughter who is being wooed by his young friend, Anthony, and kill the judge who has taken everything from him.Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was so beautifully shot. The reason why I love Tim Burton so much is because he knows how colors and contrasts work in a film. He knew how dark Mrs. Lovetts and Sweeney Todd are, in a picnic scene where everything is supposed to be bright, Sweeney and Lovetts are the only dark figures in the lovely setting. The music is triumphant, the songs were so memorable and almost hypnotic, I felt like was in a real Broadway audience. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is one of the best films of the year, I guarantee it, this was a terrific musical that was a bloody good time! Tim Burton is back and he's better than ever with Johnny.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Burton does better than anyone else  . . .,"""At last, my arm is complete again."" Sweeney Todd as he admires one of his efficient razors after a long absence.I'm not sure Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is ""grand,"" but I'm confident it's in the best Grand Guignol tradition of sensational stage horror given its name from that little theater in early 20th century Paris that specialized in sensationally ghoulish productions. I am also sure that no one in film is better able to play the titular butcher than the shape-shifting, ever-naughty Johnny Depp.The opening song ""No Place Like London"" hints to Anglophiles like me that it won't be my usual tour of West End theaters, rather a seedy, dangerous place where Mac the Knife would be more at home. Throughout the musical, Steven Sondheim's lyrics expressively revel in the amoral, throat-slicing world that Sweeney and his adoring meatpie lady, Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham-Carter), wallow in as he prepares to take revenge on the equally amoral Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who dispatched Todd to prison early on to get his beautiful young wife. Hence Sweeney's revenge inclination.Sweeney's lyric best expresses the wildly murderous world, hardly the usual province of musicals: ""Alright! You, Sir?/No one's in the chair come on, come on/Sweeney's waiting/I want you bleeders./You sir! Too sir?/Welcome to the grave./I will have vengeance./I will have salvation . . . ."" Yes, it's Sleepy-Hollow, Corpse-Bride Tim Burton's movie with blood spouting like red paint from a pressure gun contrasting the somber, almost black and white underside of London. When one of the children bites into a pie with a finger in it (shades of our contemporary law suits!), the audience doesn't even gasp, given the omnipresence of bloody bodies.There is no more interesting musical this year, even considering the enchanting Once. In the end, it is unsettling, unsavory, and unusual. Burton does better than anyone else in juxtaposing horror with innocence.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, but not perfect adaptation of the classic musical","Alright, I went to see the movie adaptation of 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' and thought it was amazing, but being a fan of the original Broadway stage versions I do have some complaints. The bloods levels were necessary is some parts, but some just ruined the moments. During the song 'Johanna' which is one of my favorite songs in the show, Sweeney will be slitting some throats. The thing that makes the stage version better for that song is that the blood isn't a distraction. You only see like a red line go across their throat, then down the chute they go. When the movie had blood flying everywhere in a real sort of way it was extremely hard to concentrate on the song. Another part was that they cut out some of the songs and lyrics to cut down the 3 hour musical into a 2 hour movie, another disappointment for a guy who loves the play like me. Now of course the big thing is how Depp was able to portray Sweeney and SING! Alright, shut up Depp fan-girls. He is not some sort of miracle singer. He's an alright singer, but a much better actor. His voice has menace, though pirate fans may have to hold back a snicker at the fact that when he says certain lyrics he sounds like Captain Jack Sparrow live on Broadway. I think in a movie musical he was well cast as the tormented barber who has lost everything near and dear to him, except his precious razors. Helena Bonham Carter did well as the sociopath Mrs. Lovett whose good idea is to turn Sweeney's victims into pies for her own profit. Sacha Baron Cohen who did well last year in his surprisingly critically well received 'BORAT' comes back to the big screen with a marvelous portray of the flamboyant street barber Signor Adolfo Pirelli, and I myself wouldn't have wanted to cast anyone else, the character seems like him. Finally Alan Rickman provided a truly menacing portrayal of Judge Turpin; Sweeney's nemesis and reason why he wants revenge. All and all the 1982 Broadway performance (On DVD) starring George Hearn and Angela Lansbury will always be my favorite musical version of this tale of revenge. Aside from me finding some parts a bit too violent I will give it a high rating. I give Burton's Sweeney a 10/10 instead of a 9/10 just because Sweeney Todd is my 2nd favorite musical, and the scenery, costumes, and atmosphere of the movie was brilliant.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Awesome, dark and funny. Classic Tim Burton stuff.","Good dark fun.I knew nothing of this movie except Tim Burton and Johnny Depp had something to do with it, and that, as the executive director put it, there was ""lots of blood"". I don't think of myself as liking musicals, although I should probably reconsider now.I had a moment of dread when the movie started and there was a mention of Sacha Baron Cohen being in it. However his performance was in fact quite good. While his acting has a few things in common with his over-the-top Borat character, it somehow fits rather well within the movie.Some elements of the plot are rather predictable, in a Greek tragedy sort of way, but it doesn't really detract from the movie. We get to enjoy the downward spiral even though we know its shape.All in all, the movie was awesome, filled with damned and hopeless characters that still made you laugh at every turn.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good when you don't compare it to the stage musical,"My love for Sweeney Todd started at the Muny in Saint Louis. It was an amazing production of Sweeney Todd, and I immediately got the movie so I could watch some form of the story more. I didn't expect it to be as good, and while I was comparing it to the stage musical it wasn't. My main complaint is that they took out the Ballad of Sweeney Todd songs, which is understandable because they would be hard to do in a movie setting. However, all the Ballads were the songs that really stuck out to me when I watched the stage musical. All in all, this doesn't hold up to a good version of Sweeney Todd performed on stage.However, after a while, I started to separate stage Sweeney from this movie. After I did that, I started to thoroughly enjoy it. I love how both Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter played their roles (although I believe Mrs. Lovett should be more unhinged). Their performances of the songs are very good, especially considering neither are really known for singing.If you haven't seen the stage musical, you'll have a better chance of immediately liking it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Conventicle of Geniuses Came Together Here,"And this conventicle has brought us a glistening and irresistible nightmare. There are delicious Dickensian overtones throughout, and the look of the film itself is poetically potent. The entire mix is shockingly seductive with an unforgettable ending. Burton's humor is part and parcel of his sheer brilliance, as always, and, as always, the great Johnny Depp is intense and positively unforgettable. All performances are electric, the pace and length are perfect, and the film draws us deeper and deeper with every moment into its stunning blend of the grotesque and the undeniably beautiful. Analysing the power of a film like this is no simple matter. The whole is dazzlingly disturbing. You don't want to miss a second of it, even though the film is merciless to us and to its protagonists. It sings, it glows, it enchants, it horrifies. I want to see it again. And again.

A fine musical... ruined.,"The duet of Tim Burton & Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to behold. Unfortunately, this time the creepy fairy tale for adults has gone too far with superfluous gore, blood, and neck-slashing. Wonderful cinematography, spectacular costumes and strong acting in the first part of the movie are eclipsed by the fountains of blood in the second half. The gore is hardly necessary, as it doesn't add anything to the movie, but it seriously detracts. More than once, we found ourselves turning our heads away from close-up shots of necks slit open by a razor, and with each time we were less inclined to look back at the screen. It's sad to see an old master like Burton caving in to what appears to be the norm in Hollywood with respect to graphic violence and high body count.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliantly executed but highly disturbing,"Sweeney Todd is an old story that is not based on a real 19th century murderer--despite some recent rumors that this legend is true. Though the original story has changed a bit over the years, the basic elements remain. A man is wrongly convicted and returns years later to exact revenge--slicing the throats of the wicked (and sometimes innocent) and then having the bodies disposed of in meat pies sold to the unsuspecting public!The movie is based on the Sondheim musical. Over the years, there have been other non-musical versions of the fabled story of Sweeney Todd, but Stephen Sondheim has truly popularized this grisly tale of revenge and madness. However, if you are used to the Rogers and Hammerstein or Lerner and Loewe style of musicals, be prepared for a wildly different sort of musical. This isn't just because of the very, very dark subject matter but also the style of singing. Unlike these other famous musical teams, SWEENEY TODD does not offer songs that you will quickly find yourself humming or will hear on an elevator. That's because this production isn't a traditional musical with catchy lyrics, but where the dialog is sung to music--somewhat like the wonderful UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG (wow, aside from this, you can't find two films more unalike). And since the emphasis is on dialog that is sung, the style may take a lot of getting used to. Plus, you probably WON'T find yourself tapping your feet and humming to the amazingly fast-paced and somewhat maniacal music. About the only really traditional style song is the lovely ""Joanna"".This style singing does take some getting used to, though this film adaptation of the musical is much more approachable to the casual viewer. That's because in the play, many of the songs are sung in a crazy and cacophonous manner--with many singers across the stage singing DIFFERENT parts that generally DON'T harmonize well with each other. This strange and sometimes painful style was done to emphasize Sweeney's madness and I understood the symbolism--I just didn't particularly like it and I was thrilled that these twisted chorusers were absent from the film. Instead, the music was sung by either individuals or in duets (which were ALSO often sung very separately but with much less cacophony than an entire chorus). My daughter, quite the purist and lover of theater told me she missed this aspect of the film--she WANTED the insane chorus. As for me and the average audience member, I am sure this change by Tim Burton is a welcome one. The bottom line is that the stage style was just too annoying and headache-evoking.While I am talking about the songs, I must point out that despite originally feeling very skeptical about casting Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in the leads (after all, they're NOT known for their singing ability), they and the rest of the cast did quite well. I am sure that the modern ability to make practically ANYONE a singing sensation (such as Hillary Duff or Ashlee Simpson) was employed, but it did work. Now this isn't to say that they or the rest of the cast have gorgeous and melodious voices--they don't. But, for this style of film, it worked perfectly. Had they been cast in a remake of THE SOUND OF MUSIC or some other more traditional musical, it probably wouldn't have worked. Oddly, despite their being more than competent in the roles, I have heard some snipes about them and I can assure you they DID do well and were well cast.Now as for the rest of the film, I must STRONGLY urge caution, as this is one of the most violent films I have ever seen. Sure, some films show many more deaths but the closeup shots of throats being slit and profuse torrents of blood is NOT for the squeamish nor is the sight of seeing the corpses splat onto the floor below as they are dropped through the trap door. I noticed several in the theater covering their eyes during the murder scenes--including my daughter. It's not for the faint-hearted and really is up close and brutal in how it depicts the killings. It worked--the murders looked very vivid and real--perhaps too real. With a little more left to the imagination with the killings, I really think the film might have worked a tad better for the average viewer. I have a very high tolerance for this stuff (probably partly due to my being a human biology minor in college), but most will cringe at all the carnage.Now as for the aesthetics of the film. As you probably would expect, director Burton did his usual marvelous job. The dankness and awfulness of a Dickensian England is vivid and convincing. The plethora of roaches and rats also heightened this awful realism as did the terrible dental work of the actors. Unlike many films set in this era that featured actors with lovely capped teeth, the actors here abounded with crooked teeth! What I particularly liked about the film and what really jumped out at me was the cinematography--how almost everything was done in sepia and gray tones. There were a few exceptions but these were wonderful and were designed as the occasional and shocking contrast (such as the blueness of Pirelli's clothes or the intensity of the blood). Additionally, the fantasy sequence was extremely colorful and this made it one of the most striking and funny scenes in the film--quite appropriate to the mood.So overall, apart from the intensity of the violence, this was a great film and a nice improvement over the Sondheim stage production due to its wickedly dark humor and style.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Sweeney has it's faults, but overall a good interpretation","Let me begin by saying I walked into this movie apprehensively. I had seen the revival with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone twice last year on Broadway, and had seen videos of Len Cariou, George Hearn and Angela Lansbury, so I had some expectations. That being said, this movie was definitely not as bad as it could have been. There were parts of it that were brilliant and parts that didn't work, but overall it was an enjoyable film.It did have its faults. In the beginning, the film itself seems a little confused as to whether it is going to be artistic and theatrical or realistic. There are moments where the characters are making grand gestures and acting in a big theatrical way, and then others that are very quiet, close shots making the film seem more real. Eventually it settles into a rhythm that becomes a balance between the two. There are some moments that I felt had so much comic potential that were not utilized, especially ""A Little Priest."" Sweeney and Lovett just didn't seem to be enjoying their plotting, which made the number a bit bland. The film doesn't really reach its full comic potential until the ""Johanna"" quartet (which is actually a trio) and ""By the Sea"", though we do see earlier glimpses, especially in ""The Contest."" Concerning the song cuts, I had a problem logistically with the cutting of ""Ah, Miss"" and ""Kiss Me."" It just didn't make sense that Joanna and Anthony never spoke to each other until the end of the film. Going into the film I was also upset at the cutting of ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" but Burton cleverly used this as an instrumental underneath the scenes where it would have been sung.Johnny Depp surprised me in his portrayal of Sweeney Todd. He was able to find both the blood thirsty monster and pained husband/ father in this character, and though obviously not a trained singer, his vocals are not bad. Helena Bonham Carter left something to be desired vocally, but acted the part of Mrs. Lovett beautifully, especially in ""By the Sea"" which I thought was the best number in the movie, darkly comic and sweet at the same time with stunning visuals. Regarding the other actors, Sacha Baron Cohen absolutely stole the scene in ""The Contest"" with his Pirelli, Alan Rickman (who has a wonderful voice!) and Timothy Spall are perfect as the villainous Judge Turpin and Beadle Bamford, and Jayne Wisener, Jamie Campbell Bower, and Ed Sanders as Johanna, Anthony, and Toby respectively provide a nice contrast of innocence to all of the madness surrounding them. Laura Michelle Kelly is an absolutely eerie beggar woman. Regarding all the blood, yes, it is a lot. And yes, it does spew absolutely everywhere (camera lens included). But its coloring, opaqueness, and great amount make it not so much disgusting as artistic, especially in the ""Johanna"" quartet.Overall this was a good film. It does have its faults, but it captures the mood and story of the Sondheim's originally musical beautifully.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody good!,"This movie stunned me so much that I could hardly move from my seat when it was over. The dark cinematography is brilliant and works so well to enhance the story. Johnny Depp has given us so many amazing performances in the past and you can put this one up there at the top of the list. I have to admit that in the past I have loathed Tim Burton offerings but he redeems himself in my opinion with a feast for the eyes and ears that is a triumph. I approached the movie with trepidation because actors put in singing roles seldom work, but not this time. The singing was not only terrific, it was mesmerizing. I have to warn you this movie is for movie fans that love music (Broadway, classical or opera) and have a cast iron stomach. I heard they used 70 gallons of fake blood filming it and I believe them. All I can say is you can see the bloody scenes coming a mile off so you have plenty of time to avert your eyes.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grim Musical OJ's the Audience,"Tim Burton's gleefully macabre adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical smash hit ""Sweeney Todd"" is the strangest holiday season Oscar bait to come out of Hollywood...well, ever. I'll be the first to admit I am not a fan of film musicals as they are inherently loud and full of paper-thin characters singing and dancing their way through horribly obvious and clichéd plots. However, every so often one comes along that I thoroughly enjoy, like ""Chicago"" with its hot-blooded dames committing cold-blooded murder during the roaring '20's. Here, bloody revenge is the topic, and Victorian London the setting. The stage was set for a bizarre juxtaposition of seemingly disparate genres: the over-the-top operetta and the over-the-top horror film. On both levels, ""Sweeney Todd"" delights and horrifies in equal measure.The film starts awkwardly with foggy CGI set designs and off-key singing covering a clunky exposition about a barber wrongly imprisoned (for, well, I never caught why) and looking for revenge against the judge who drove his wife to suicide (allegedly) and kidnapped his daughter. The film moves slowly until Sacha Baron Cohen (""Borat"") shows up with a gin-swilling moppet in tow (Ed Sanders as Toby, the best singing orphan this side of ""Oliver!"") adding a sense of color, humor, and heart to the film's bleeding core. Once the killings start, the set designs and gore seem to take on a life of their own as Burton paints his vision on screen with the rare wanton abandon of an auteur with final cut.It would be unfair for me to judge the music and the songs (they were adequately lively in my humble opinion), but the acting was far better than I expected. Johnny Depp was perfectly off-kilter in the lead role. His lack of expression during the ""By the Sea"" fantasy sequence was priceless. Meanwhile, Helena Bonham Carter performed her third successful evolution as an actress. She was once the darling of the Merchant/Ivory costume drama, then the cult star of ""Fight Club"", and now the Cockney-accented comic relief in the darkest movie musical ever made. I thought her facial expressions and timing where especially spot-on. I can't think of another actress who has such distinct groups of rabid fans. Alan Rickman is effectively creepy in the villain role, while the two young stars playing the whatever-the-heck-his-name-is-pretty-boy and Johanna were appropriately annoying and dewy-eyed.While the film goes through the requisite motions of an operetta, it succumbs to a fantastically grim and fitting conclusion that ultimately won over the audience. With more dark psychologically rich subtexts and better acting then you come to expect from a film musical, ""Sweeney Todd"" OJ's its audience with cartoonish gore and spirited song and dance. It's no masterpiece, but it's bloody good fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well....,"It was bloody, disturbing, gruesome...and I loved every minuet of it! Deep makes a awesome Sweeney but I think Helena Bonham Carter is my favorite performance in this film, she is VERY funny and makes the character her own! BUT for people who love the stage version (which I do!) try to erase every thought of it from your mind! If you keep comparing it to what it was on stage than you won't enjoy it as much! Go in to the theater with an open mind and embrace the film for what it is (very different then what it is on stage)! This is an amazing film and I recommend it to every one (except to people who have week stomachs)!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fantastic Performances,"A fantastic film, as I'm sure has been said many times and part of this was to due to the way music was incredibly well integrated within the events. Indeed, this was so much the case that the actors seemed to effortlessly switch between song and dialogue managing to portray the characters as well in singing as through spoken dialogue. The music itself was wonderfully composed with strong juxtaposition between the music and the lyrics behind which the character of Sweeny Todd was lurking.Jonny Depp was sensational and thoroughly, in my opinion, deserves an Oscar for his performance, enabling the audience to see the evil of the character, not to mention his deep desires. Helena Bonham Carter also portrayed Mrs. Lovett in an equally disturbing manner, creating an almost farcical world in which the characters live in, but, paradoxically involving the audience into what many think of 'old London' to be like.An incredible film that definitely makes it into my top 5 films of all time...worth several watches!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Slow and boring. Only for fans.,"This movie is awful.I went to see this movie because I liked past performances of Depp and I like the way Burton works, but this was a waste of time and money.To begin with, with few exceptions the actors can't sing. A lot of singers can't act, and the opposite is true as well. Depp should absolutely stick to speaking.Then they keep on singing the same lines. Over and over and over. They could have put a few more dialogues, soliloquies, or even more sung lines in the story, but instead they opted for boring people.The story itself could have been good, except that the plot is flat and predictable, dragged on by the incessant monotone singing. Every major plot point, including the final ""twist"" was so overdone that my fiancée guessed it about 15 minutes into the movie. This movie could have been done SO much better with a more convoluted plot.In truth, there are no twists, no poignant moments, no deep characters, and no story.Fans of the actors and of the director will love it for sure, but then again they are fans and that's what they do.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Burton does it again...wonderful!,"I went into this film very nervous. As a huge fan of Sondheim and the stage show, I wasn't sure that the film would measure up. I was pleasantly surprised. While it certainly does not surpass the stage show by any means, I think that Burton and his cast paid wonderful homage to Sondheim's genius. I almost wish that Depp and Bonham Carter had stronger voices though. However, having never sung before, both of them did wonderfully. I had zero respect for Sascha Baron Cohen before seeing this film, but he was a delight. Alan Rickman was fabulous, as always, and the new faces in the cast are ones I hope to see again. Visually, the film was stunning. A bit gory for my tastes, but the story certainly calls for it. The colors were fantastic, and the contrasts Burton made were eye-popping. Musically, it could have been a lot worse. They cut the opening number, which is one of my favorites, and seriously shortened A Little Priest, which is my all-time favorite song, but the cast really stepped up to the plate with the music, and they did a wonderful job. Helena Bonham Carter is no Angela Lansbury (the original Mrs. Lovett), but she was great. Not a film I could see frequently, just because of all the gore, but I loved it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Knows what it is and to its benefit it doesn't worry about being more than this,"Benjamin Barker returns to London with a hatred and vengeance in his heart that can only have come from lost love and false imprisonment. On his return he meets the crazed makers of the worst pies in London  Mrs Lovett  and a plan is hatched to use his barber show (now traded under the name Sweeney Todd) to extract revenge on those that ruined him. However as revenge evades him and his blood lust rises, his murderous rampage and his solution for getting rid of the bodies threaten to expose him or drive him to destruction  whichever comes sooner.It took me some time to get to see Sweeney Todd as it hadn't appealed to me in the cinema and I kept putting off renting the DVD. Whenever I finally did get round to it recently I was quite pleasantly surprised to find how well it worked. The reason for this is that it functions perfectly as a big dark musical. The musical numbers are all strong because they are the film rather than being things that the film launches into and they fit the dark, blood tone of the film as the music is constantly brooding and, even when it soars you get the impression that any hope or beauty in the music will soon be sucked back down into the mire. You can see what attracted Burton to this and his Gothic sensibilities are perfect for this. His crew deliver a great set and costume base for him to film in and around  it feels dark and awful but yet also has the sense of unrealism that the film needs because ultimately it is a dark musical fantasy and it has no business feeling ""real"".The performances match this as well because they are mostly very good ""musical"" performances, rather than dramatic performances built on small things. That said, Burton does use the camera very well to get closer to his characters and give you views (both physical lines of sight and also insights) that you would not get viewing this from the floor. Depp is impressive and he gets the ""dark quirkiness"" required  he looks the part, uses his face and body well while also delivering a great singing performance. Bonham-Carter is also good but her heavy ""cockney"" stuff is a bit distracting and did get in the way of me enjoying her in the way I did Depp. Rickman is a great central villain  although he has little time his presence does it all for him. Spall I was not so sure about  his character jarred with me and I didn't think his delivery fitted even though he was trying to do the same thing as everyone else. Cohen was a nice find and an enjoyable part of the film while Bower, Sanders and Wisener all deliver strong performances despite their ages and the cast they are starring beside. Special note to Wisener as well considering how infrequently I see people from the Coleraine/Ballymoney area of Northern Ireland show up in things.Local loyalties aside though, Sweeney Todd works much better than I thought it would simply because it knows what it is and it sticks to it really well. This same approach will put off those who do not like musicals and the bloody effects may put off those who are musical fans but overall it is a Gothic musical with a rich comic vein running through it and it delivers on this.",,Anonymous,Horror

Nothing to get into a lather about.,"Johnny Depp plays Benjamin Barker, a talented barber who returns to London after 15 years to wreak bloody revenge on Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) and his nasty cohort Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall)the men who imprisoned him for a crime he didn't commit, and took away his wife and child.As Sweeney Todd, the vengeful barber sets up business above a run-down pie shop (owned by his admirer Mrs. Lovett, played by Helena Bonham Carter), where he plans to lure his unsuspecting victims and cut their throats with his trusty open razors.After a practice throat-slashing session on a unscrupulous business rival leaves him with a body to dispose of, Todd develops a convenient working relationship with the infatuated shop owner below, who is always in need of a fresh supply of cheap meat. As the barber's seething hatred for mankind grows, and he proceeds to provide 'very' close shaves for all of his customers, so Mrs. Lovett finds herself with a never-ending supply of filling for her pastries.With plenty of practise under his belt, and a nifty tip-up chair for sending victims directly to Mrs. Lovett's basement, Todd concentrates his efforts on evening the score with Turpin and Bamford.Based on the Broadway show by Stephen Sondheim, Sweeney Todd is a violent, dark, and twisted musical about unrequited love and retribution, as seen through the eyes of Hollywood's resident goth director, Tim Burton. The result is a rather uneven offering: a very imaginative and visually impressive movie (as one might expect from Burton), but one unfortunately marred by the director's tendency to concentrate on style over content, poor casting of the lead roles (Depp and Bonham Carter look the part, but struggle to carry a tune), some occasionally leaden pacing, and not enough in the way of memorable songs.The film also suffers from too much coincidental plot contrivance and a rather long running time.But it's not all bad news: there are some great turns from some of the supporting players (Sascha Baron Cohen proves that once again he is a force to be reckoned with, as rival barber Pirelli; Spall is brilliantly slimy and loathsome as Beadle; and newcomer Ed Sanders gives a confident performance as Toby, the young lad who discovers the terrible truth about Mrs. Lovett's secret ingredient) and the bloodletting is delightfully juicy, with plenty of arterial spray to please the gore-hounds amongst us.6.5 out of 10, but not good enough to convince me to round it up to 7 for IMDb (at least until I've watched it a couple more times).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Dark and Bloody Tale of Revenge,"In the Victorian London, the barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) is married with the gorgeous Lucy and they have a lovely child, Johanna. The beauty of Lucy attracts the attention of the corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) that falsely accuses the barber of a crime that he had not committed and abuses of Lucy later. After fifteen years in exile, Benjamin returns to London under the new identity of Sweeney Todd, seeking revenge against Turpin. Sweeney Todd meets the widow Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) and owner of a meat pie shop that tells him that Lucy committed suicide with arsenic many years ago, and Turpin assigned himself as tutor of Johanna. He opens a barber shop above her store, initiating a crime rampage against those that made him suffer and lose his beloved family.""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is a dark an d bloody tale of revenge in a London with a corrupt aristocracy. Tim Burton uses his favorite actor and friend Johnny Depp together with his wife Helen Bonham Carter in a stylish musical, disclosing a series of murders committed by a deranged man blinded by the need of revenge after being separated from his family by an evil judge. The plot point in the end, when Sweeney discovers the identity of the beggar, gives the necessary element for a perfect conclusion.

Now that's a close shave!!!  Yeesh.,"I actually can't remember the last time I saw a musical; skipped Dream Girls, passed up Moulin Rouge, but this SWEENEY TODD: DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET seemed to hit a certain chord with me: the vocal cords! And they were slashed all movie long! Sweeney Todd is Tim Burton's horror/musical that looks as good as it sounds, with dark humor abound and open neck wounds wherever one looks. Sounds good? It is.I've never seen the play, and only knew slightly of its story, but the characters involved, all flawed and charismatic, do a great job singing and acting. The music is excellent even though Danny Elfman wasn't to be found, and Burton's directing style seems to really shine with his version of a barber whose lost it all.There were a couple things that bothered me: one being an ending that despite all its bloody grandeur seemed to lose sight of a couple characters, and some occasional predictable situations.But never mind such frivolous drawbacks, this film is just great entertainment. And boy can Depp and that Bower guy sing! Everyone does a great job(perhaps excluding the young statuesque Toby) and Helena Bonham Carter is as morbidly hot as ever. I love corsets!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Mr. Burton, I bow to you.","I first saw ""Sweeney Todd"" about five years ago when I rented the Angela Lansbury Broadway movie, after that I was hooked on Sweeney. So naturally when I found out that Tim Burton would be at the helm of a film version of the beloved musical I was ex tactic, now my favorite director would be directing my favorite musical. Then I found out about the cast. My favorite actors would be in the title roles. It seemed so perfect, then I remembered, this was a musical. Could they pull off the daunting signing ranges that Sondhiem so brilliantly penned? Yes, yes they could.I saw the midnight showing and when the film started I was left completely breathless. The cinematic scope of the film was awesome in every sense of the term. Depp and Bonham Carter were a perfect match for their roles. Regardless of the fact that many people have been commenting on Carter's wispy voice and how it isn't ""Lovettish"" I beg to disagree. The character of Mrs. Lovett (like any other character in the history of theater and film) can be interpreted in any way. Most people were comparing Carter's interpretation of Mrs. Lovett with that of Angela Lansbury's; they are completely different people! This time Lovett is an Innocent soul, and not in the pure sense. She is innocent due to lack of education and of illiteracy, she wants so much to be a motherly figure and a lover that she is this naive woman, until of course the subject of business and monetary funds come into play.You cannot go into this film and automatically compare it to the stage version. It is a film, plain and simple. Burton puts his signature on the film while it still remains the Sondheim classic that we know. Sondhiem wrote Sweeney's music not as enhancing songs to strengthen the plot (like most musicals do) but he wrote it to tell the plot. It is the closest thing you can get before you cross the line into the land of Opera. And the wonderful thing about this film adaptation is that Burton kept that sense about him, the music was telling the story. So everything added up with the song at hand, making the movie flow like it was an elaborate two hour waltz. The beat of the movements, the turn of the camera and the angles that it captured, the speech of the actors and the voices that came out of everyone of them was amazing. This film is amazing. So Mr. Burton, my heartfelt thanks to you. Finally I have a favorite movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tim Burton fans will love it. Fans of the original musical will enjoy it but be disappointed.,"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street - Tim Burton's adaptation of the classic Stephen Sondheim musical, a dark comedy with an ending bordering on Greek Tragedy. Tim Burton rounded up the usual suspects (Christopher Lee is absent though) and Johnny Depp is the lead as Sweeney Todd, a simple barber who once had a loving wife and daughter but they were stolen by Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman, wonderful as always) and Sweeney was shipped away. Years later, Sweeney wants revenge and resolves to cut as many throats as it takes to get to Judge Turpin! I have always enjoyed the stage version of this for it's dark humor and macabre style and Tim Burton was an easy choice to make as director. His noir style where black, white and grey are the primaries and color, when used pops out suit the show very well. Visually the movie is a treat.Now musically the film is slightly controversial. The most controversial choice is the casting of Johnny Depp. He has the character down all well and good. Some fans might object to the fact that he isn't a bass, like Todd was written originally. I'm torn, because I love Depp and he sang well, but I know that whenever a film version of a movie is made, that generally becomes the standard version by which future stage productions are based. Depp, like Jaoquin Phoenix in ""Walk the Line"" just doesn't have the lower notes. Depp is a bari-tenor. Still, he has the character down pat and sounds very good.Helena Bonham Carter will never be mistaken for a professional singer, but she does fine. There were probably reams of actresses who could have done better, but again she looks and acts the part of Mrs. Lovett very well. There isn't a bad singer in the bunch. I loved Sacha Baron Cohen's turn as Signor Adolfo Pirelli, and Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener both sounded lovely and Anthony and Johanna. Ed Sanders was adorable as Toby. Timothy Spall (the third cast member from the Harry Potter films) is great and weaselly as Beatle Bamford.Some songs sound a little different from the original scoring. ""Pretty Women"" in particular because of the juxtaposition between a bass (Rickman, who sounds quite good) and a tenor (Depp), while in the original it was two basses. I loved ""Worst Pies in London"" ""A Little Priest"" ""Johanna"" ""Epiphany"" and ""By the Sea"". I was disappointed, as will be most fans of the original musical, by the sheer volume of songs left out. I and several other patrons stayed during the credits to see if ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" was finally going to be played. I mean, it's only the catchiest and most iconic of all the songs in the show. All we get is a small instrumental of it at the beginning. Ridiculous. It should have been sung at the end because the film ending feels hollow without it. So much was cut for time. This is a case where a ""Director's Cut"" is most necessary. I loved what was there. I just want more.Tim Burton fans will love it. Fans of the original musical will enjoy it but be disappointed by how much was cut to appease mainstream audiences.B+",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
So disappointing,"I gave this a 6 because of the brilliance of Stephen Sondheim's music and lyrics . . . and the orchestration for the movie was wonderful. Johnny Depp seems to sleepwalk through a character who, on stage, has huge appetites for both life and vengeance. Because of the poor voices of all the actors, the characters seemed two dimensional. The duet between Sweeney and the judge should leave your mouth hanging open in amazement, rather than glazing your eyes over. And what was with the eye makeup? My husband pointed out that Joanna's boyfriend was prettier than she was. Personally, I'm going online to reserve my tickets for the Broadway touring company. If you want to experience the true Sweeney Todd, I suggest you do the same.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Polarities. Art as a lifeline. Where was his best director nom?,"Just five minutes in I felt a melancholy for how great it is making me sad it would finish. Its bipolarity shows both ends are 'us'. Losing your soul in aging, such works of theater are society's lifeline to feel. It's strange because of how American audiences are so puritan and usually despise theatricality, self-awareness or romanticism; it's as if the musical gives permission to partake.See how the shave is presenting dignity for 'appearance', being the cleaned face of the societal machine; even there's a rival barber, it's a 'cut-throat' industry to make people nice to service the rotting. The rot is hoisted up by the broken; so the craziness of this is how Todd integrates as a twisted functional. It even rewards him with a checklist of fulfillment, but he could not embrace it. ""The ghosts don't leave. They never leave.""This is because he is not real but a stand-in for Dante's London. See how he always creeps up, appears, or looks in the mirror as if surprised he even exists. The film brings this point home showing him as a stuffed figurine behind the window from afar, or as a mannequin in Lovett's fantasy. He is a symbol, a hero redeemer of this demonic ritual; an outgrowth of the dregs where the demon humanity run free for mischief. I like how early on the camera dances through the streets like an imp making sure every rat is still in its place, ""I'm home!""Those powerful gushings of blood show as feeling. We trade allowing this for the civility of living. The mad women ripping the asylum keeper apart, who kept a collection of crazies. There are hints of many different Sweeneys across this, difference being ours redeems, making his evil woke. This is the only Batman you're going to get here. Gotham wept.Depp; when ever do you get a vehicle for this sort of one dimensional purity of rage? The face as performance landscape. A complete reversal in Edward Scissorhands. ""My arm is complete,"" in both films. Both are these glam rock figures. There, goth within suburbia, here, musical theater within goth. Art as always is the great symbol; the hair cutting versus the shaving as creative and destructive tools for shaping the universe; Burton's paintbrushes.It's about the torture of certain kinds of men who seek control, and can't bear life not offering that, so seek it at all costs in other ways outside their failing. Its tragedy shows how fate is very much in favor of those with purpose; you realize if only Todd sought industry rather than murder he would rule Judge Turpin politically not violently, and with ease.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"about the juiciest, bloodiest good/sad musical time you'll have this year","With Sweeney Todd, one of the most notorious (and acclaimed) stories to come out of 19th century London England, and later as a much more acclaimed musical from Stephen Soundheim, Tim Burton crafts a masterpiece of the macabre, a work full of harsh, visceral drama, a sinister look to the picture which only once or twice takes an escape to brighter (more elusive) pastures, and even pitch-black humor, the kind that isn't fit for the gallows but a slice of a razor to a horrible demise at the meat-grinder. It's also a sad film, a deep sorrow that pulses in nearly every frame that Johnny Depp occupies as Benjamin Barker-turned-Sweeney Todd which pervades the wretched vengeance that he seeks following his inexcusable detachment from his wife and daughter via Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). Burton here, more than ever I might wager, deals with punishment and evil, as well as what it means to be an anti-hero (if one could call a ""Demon Barber"" as such), and as well what a real cold-blooded villain is.The latter might be considered, more-so than Mr. T, in the form of Mrs. Lovett, who runs the place below where Mr. Barker used to run his barbershop, featuring the ""Worst Meat-Pies in London."" Following a savage, quick death of a character, she comes up with the idea to hide the body, and thus also continue a lucrative profit- take the bodies that Todd slices open whilst getting their shave, and grinding them into meat pies for a whole new cult of a crowd, who end up flocking to for such bloody-good (some pun intended) culinary delights. Meantime there's a subplot involving the Judge, Todd's long lost daughter Joanna, and a young man who has fallen in love with her- and her with him- from behind the prison of her betrothed. And there's also a child, Toby (talented young Ed Sanders), who becomes quasi-orphaned and starts to work at the meat-pie establishment. Innocence, of course, is something so fragile it can break in an instant.Almost 80% of the film, I should mention, is sung by the actors. And while not in a kind of complete and utter show-stopping manner that is more common for Broadway, they take the completely superb songs, devilish, pondering, contemplating, scheming, and full of longing (there's much more in the lyrics than one would expect) and make them their own. It's a given the young Joanna and Anthony get the conventional song of young, forbidden love, but aside from that Soundheim breaks open the vein, so to speak, of the melodrama inherent in a horror story like the one here. There's even a bleak streak of humor to the proceedings, be it an extended song that distracts Pirelli (perfect comic timing by Sascha Baron Cohen as an Italian with a secret), or the juxtaposition of Todd's various killings and a touching tune, or just Mrs. Lovett's descriptions of which people to take for the kill. With music and word Soundheim's tale of tragic mayhem is not without a whole lot of entertainment value, more than one not familiar with the stage version would expect. I tapped my fingers whilst blood flowed and dark looks gleamed through the dark color palette.Now, taking into account Burton's knack at surprise (and precise) casting choices- Depp exceeds greatly in his first musical role, giving moments of subtly in just the deadened expression on his eyes while his two-dimensional frame consumes him; Carter has the best role to fill in the main lot of characters, as someone seemingly pleasant in her dirty Dickens way but also far more evil than she'll let on; Rickman, for ever little word he utters, is savage in having whatever he can by hook or by crook- it should be noted how superlative Burton matches technique with the source material. It's such good directing where, as with Nightmare Before Christmas (only here arguably more operatic), we get wrapped up in what should be an escapist experience of a musical with vast sets and beautifully grungy 19th century costumes and (typically) Gothic makeup. It's a twisted time and place of the slums of London, and Burton and his DP supplant that look of despair, where we'll see for an instant (satirically of course) a look at paradise on a beach in the future, or a glimpse into the past. But there's also a fully rounded human experience going on too, where it all fits in the context where it's set: realistic it isn't entirely, but everything emotionally feels on-target.One more note of the obvious, if you've already heard from critics: it contains the most graphic bloodshed of any musical I've ever seen, or even in Burton's oeuvre (and this is from countless beheaded folk in Sleepy Hollow talking). It flows as if Alexander de Large from Clockwork Orange were in charge of special neck F/X. And it's certainly not for the kiddies who flocked to Charlie and the Cholocate Factory or Pee Wee. Sweeney Todd is gruesome, but with a purpose: Burton and Soundheim have made a testament to the inescapable wrath of vengeance unyielded, where figures from the past, no matter how close, will get in the path of destruction, and terror is always up behind you, cleaning your face, giving one quick swipe as if by catharsis. I loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
AMAZING!!,"I absolutely love this film!! It's 100% in my top 5 favorites! Johnny Depp's performance, as well as the other cast members, is fantastic! I myself am not a fan of musicals, but I really enjoy that this is a musical! I give it a 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fascinating but definitely the sort of musical that is an acquired taste...,"Tim Burton gives us the dark side of Old London with cinematography that might just as well have used glorious B&W rather than drab color. Perhaps only the blood (of which there's plenty) could have been filmed in vivid tones of red and the rest in B&W, since this basically falls into the horror film category--with music.Some of Stephen Sondheim's lyrics are enormously clever and at the same time simple, except for certain songs sung by HELENA BONHAM CARTER as Mrs. Lovett, the infamous woman with a bakery shop on Fleet Street. She has some of the most difficult material to handle and she does it extremely well. JOHNNY DEPP manages to sing the part of Sweeney Todd without actually being a professional singer--so he's effective enough but one can sense how much more powerful this would have been with a real singer. Performance wise, he's fine.SACHA BARON CONEN is a surprise as Pirelli, demonstrating a good voice and an Italian manner that makes him sound like Stromboli from Disney's ""Pinocchio"". ALAN RICKMAN is as slick as ever as a cruel villain who gets his comeuppance from the devilish pair of Mrs. Lovett and Mr. Todd, as do most of the other members of the large cast.ED SANDERS as Toby has a nice boy soprano voice and does an excellent job of emoting, and JAYNE WISENER has a lyrical voice that suits the song she sings while gazing out the window at the film's start. All of the orchestrations sound strong and full-bodied but I can't say that any of the songs are the kind that stayed with me on a first viewing. Perhaps after a few more looks at the film, some of them will begin to stick.It's definitely worth watching for any fan of musicals, although you have to be prepared to expect all the blood letting--even if the gushes look a bit fake. Burton loves to depict horror with a wicked gleam in his eyes, or so it seems, and he runs the full gamut of horror right up until the final scene that has a rather shocking conclusion.Haven't seen the play but have heard Angela Lansbury do some of the songs from the Broadway show. The film's biggest drawback is the fact that all of the photography is deliberately dark and moody, with rarely a glimpse of sunshine, and after awhile this becomes a strain on the eyes. We get the dark nature of the story from the beginning, no need to hammer the point home with an Old London atmosphere that is drearier than anything Dickens could have imagined.Summing up: Sondheim's score doesn't rank with his best, nor is this Tim Burton's best film--but it's well worth a watch thanks to the very energetic work of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in difficult, very demanding roles.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very disappointed,"I suppose in many ways I should've found out more about this movie, rather than just thinking it looked good on the trailer and going to see it. Still, that's the way it went, so here goes the review.First thing I noted, just from the opening credits, was the Burtonesque style. This had me immediately concerned as I'm not a huge fan of his work. Why not? Well, I do find his work is very much style over substance. His films look good, but I've never been over enamoured with anything else. Burton films are like Windows Vista; looks good but ultimately you want to leave it alone. Okay, so I've paid good money, I'll sit it out and hope it's more Beetlejuice than Corpse Bride.Second thing I noted was that it was a musical. This surprised me. Not being the sort to frequent stage shows, I hadn't realised that there was a stage musical to base it on. Ah. Still, it might work, this sort of thing has been done before. I'll give it a chance.Well, it didn't work. It was very typically Burton style over substance, yet again. London looked gloriously slummy and very definitely suited the mood, in much the same way the Michael Keaton ""Batman"" recreated Gotham as a dark place. I didn't like that film, either, for much the same style over substance reason. After a few minutes of admiring how the mood has been captured, you're bored and want the film to entertain.But there was worse to come.For a start, Johnny Depp's cockney accent drifted into Jack Sparrow. Every time it happened - and it did so a lot - it grated on me, purely because Captain Jack is not a macabre character, and hearing that voice detracted from that required for Benjamin Barker's unstable mental state. I wanted someone who would be full of malice and ill-will generated by gross injustice, and I ended up seeing a hapless pirate with delusions of grandeur. Not good.Then there was Helena Bonham-Carter, playing the role of a slightly unhinged woman with mad hair and poor complexion. Ooh, what a surprise! I'm sure the point was that there was supposed to be a chemistry between Sweeney and Mrs Lovett, but there was nothing. Nothing at all. I know there's supposed to be a degree of unrequited love on Mrs Lovett's part, but in this she was moping round him like a lovesick teenager, getting nothing back.If this is based on the musical, then I don't want to see it. It seemed as though the songs were purely ""sung dialogue"" rather than actual music scores. In many cases, the songs didn't even seem to fit. Perhaps there should be more to them, maybe there is in the stage show, but on screen it was awful. And we can't even blame the medium either, as Grease transferred to the silver screen very well.Then there was the gore. Talk about obvious! After the first couple of slashings, it was very tiresome and unnecessary. Burton really could do with taking lessons from Tarantino on how to do gory violence; we all know the scene from Reservoir Dogs, where Mr. Blond cuts the ear off the police officer whilst dancing to ""Stuck in the middle with you"". We never see the act, just hear the screams, which makes it all the more sickening. The mind can do more justice to implied violence than the camera ever can with visuals.The film was too long, too. How much of it was entirely necessary, I wonder? There was one massive plot diversion which was just a complete waste of time. Making an audience invest in a substantial subplot and not follow it through to a reasonable conclusion is extremely irritating.And to cap it all, the cherry on the icing on the excrement cake, Alan Rickman wasn't even as good as he usually is as an arch villain. Granted, it's a change not to see him overact, but in this case the role positively demanded it.It gets a half star from me purely because there were a couple of lines which made me chuckle and because Timothy Spall played a good weaselly character. I score it a 1 as that's as low as I can go.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie is amazing,"When I saw this film for the first time, I was immediately blown away. I had never heard of the bloody story of Sweeney Todd, which is an amazing story about revenge. Honestly: this story is so great almost anyone could make an awesome movie from it. But Tim Burton has exceeded all expectations, if you ask me. The atmosphere of this film is just superb, it's all black and white and RED and beautiful.. the music and cast are perfect. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen are all great (and they can sing too!) The songs will probably be stuck in your head for weeks (most notably ""My Friends"", ""Pretty Women"" and ""No Place Like London""). This is, in my opinion, certainly the best musical that's out there.. probably one of the best films I've ever seen. And you're going to want to watch (and sing along with) it again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing can prepare you,"Speaking as an avid fan of the show and all of the major players involved with movie, this is the greatest musical adaptation. Period. It's faithful to the original work, only making cuts and trims where it's necessary, and captures the essence of the show and the many dynamics and layers that go with it. This show is no picnic. They don't call it the most difficult musical ever for no reason. To pull off a movie adaptation of this show even remotely well can be considered an accomplishment. To equal, and in some ways surpass, the greatness of the original work is unheard of, and it happens with Burton's Sweeney Todd. I can't sing this movie's praises enough (pun half intended). Fans of the Broadway show will be happy, fans of Burton will be happy, fans of Depp will be happy, fans of Carter will be happy, even fans of Sascha Baron Cohen will be happy. Burton somehow pulled it all off, with the help of a stellar cast and Oscar caliber technical staff.No, I'm not exaggerating in this review. The only excuse you have for not seeing this movie is if you're super squeamish about blood (even then the blood is pretty artistic and over the top, but not too much so) or you simply don't like dark material...and let me just say that you'd be hard pressed to find darker subject matter.A little NOTE to FANS OF THE SHOW: The first time you see this, don't be surprised if it flies by really fast. This happened to me, and I realized that it was probably because I wasn't used to a lot of the songs being trimmed and such. The second time I saw the pace felt MUCH slower and more coherent.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"You Sir, Too Sir, Welcome To The Grave.","A visually beautiful, very well choreographed & engrossing drama that is emotionally captivating, but at the same time very dark, violent & saddening to watch, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is, arguably, the darkest musical to come out in cinema history & tells the story of an ordinary man who had everything until a man of power stole his freedom, destroyed his family & banished him for life. And in his sorrow, a new man was born who returns to have his revenge.",,Anonymous,Horror
The City of Dreadful Night,"Sweeney Todd is sometimes, wrongly, believed to have been a real historical character, but he appears to have been the creation of an otherwise obscure Victorian writer named Thomas Peckett Prest. Prest was a prolific author of what were known as ""penny dreadfuls"", lurid and sensational novels serialised in weekly magazines which cost one penny each, and it was in one such novel, entitled ""The String of Pearls"", that Todd first made his literary debut.This film, however, is not based directly upon Prest's novel but upon Stephen Sondheim's musical adaptation. The action takes place in the London of 1846, the year in which the novel was first published but not the year in which it was set. (Prest set his tale in 1785). In this version ""Sweeney Todd"" is the alias adopted by Benjamin Barker, a barber who was transported to Australia after being framed for a crime he did not commit by the corrupt and evil Judge Turpin, who had cast his lustful eye upon Barker's attractive young wife Lucy. After fifteen years in exile Barker returns to London to discover that Lucy poisoned herself after being raped by the Judge and that his daughter Johanna, only a baby when he last saw her, is now a beautiful teenager and Turpin's ward.Maddened by grief, Barker swears revenge not only upon Turpin but upon the human race as a whole. (His rationale is that death is a just punishment for the powerful and guilty and a welcome release for the powerless and innocent). Using the name Sweeney Todd he once again sets up in business as a barber and starts to murder his customers by slitting their throats with a razor. Disposing of the bodies is no problem; after killing his victims Todd delivers the bodies via a trap door to his accomplice, the pie-maker Mrs Lovett, who bakes them into her tasty meat pies.In some ways this is an unexpected film; Tim Burton is not a director normally associated with musicals, and Sondheim is not a composer normally associated with the cinema. Despite the great success of his musicals on Broadway, only three of them, ""West Side Story"", ""Gypsy"" and ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"", have been made into feature films, and only for the last of those did Sondheim write both the music and lyrics. (For the first two he wrote the lyrics but not the music). The neglect of his work can partly be attributed to the decline in the popularity of the musical in the cinema (although it remains a highly popular form in the theatre), but it may also have something to do with the fact that his works are often dark and challenging, both in terms of musical style and in terms of plot. They have little in common with the warmth and lyricism of, say, Rodgers and Hammerstein.Burton, however, is a director whose films (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Sleepy Hollow"", his interpretation of ""Batman"") often concentrate on the Gothic and the macabre, and the bleakness which lies at the heart of ""Sweeney Todd"" made it a natural target for him. As one has come to expect from a Burton film (although ""Big Fish"" is something of an exception) the film is visually very sombre, with muted colours, a literal darkness reflecting the metaphorical darkness of the story. In his vision, Victorian London becomes the nineteenth-century equivalent of Burton's Gotham City, a City of Dreadful Night, a place of both physical and moral blackness.The two leading roles of Todd and Mrs Lovett are taken by those two Burton stalwarts, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter; this was Depp's sixth collaboration with Burton and Bonham Carters' fifth. (Both were also to appear in his next film, ""Alice in Wonderland""). Neither is an actor I would normally associate with musicals, and their singing here was criticised in some circles. To my mind, however, both have a quality of voice which, although it is not particularly polished, is well-suited to Sondheim's astringent music and his often cynical lyrics. (Their duet ""A Little Priest"", in which they discuss which types of people make the best eating, was the for me the musical highlight).On the acting side, Depp has given some of his best performances in Burton films, such as ""Scissorhands"" and ""Ed Wood"", and he is excellent here, coping brilliantly with the difficult task of bringing out the dual sides of Todd's nature- on the one hand he is a bloodthirsty villain, on the other a tormented victim who has suffered much through no fault of his own. In previous films, even those made after he turned forty such as the various ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" adventures, Depp's youthful, boyish good looks have been an important part of his screen persona. The role of the middle-aged, careworn Sweeney Todd is perhaps his first older man's role. Bonham Carter is also excellent, as is that splendid villain Alan Rickman as the wicked Judge Turpin. (The name was presumably borrowed from the notorious highwayman Dick Turpin, but it also carries overtones of the word ""turpitude"", meaning moral depravity). There are also good contributions from Sacha Baron-Cohen as Todd's pseudo-Italian rival Pirelli and young Ed Sanders as his assistant Toby.Burton is not always a great director, but is generally an original and interesting one. His work varies in quality, but he is capable of making some excellent films, and ""Sweeney Todd"" is one of his best; of those I have seen I would rate only ""Big Fish"" and ""Scissorhands"" more highly. It will doubtless be too gruesome for some, but for those with stronger appetites it makes a splendidly bleak and cynical horror-comedy. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant dark musical from Burton & Depp,"Tim Burton recovered from something of an iffy spell in style with an adaptation of the musical of the same name. Before seeing the film the stylistic choices were rather unusual. Johnny Depp as the haunted Cockney barber, half of the dialogue being sung and using Burton's usual gloomy visuals all seemed strange choices. As a non-musical fan I was also worried that the film might be a bit over-bearing on that front. Thankfully all my worries were dissolved from the beginning as Burton crafts possibly his most satisfying film to date, certainly since his earlier work, thanks to a great number of inspiring features.The plot sees barber Sweeney Todd return to London after being exiled for a crime he did not commit with intentions of gaining revenge on the Judge who wronged him. Todd sets up his barbers above Mrs. Lovett's pie shop and he begins killing off unsuspecting customers for her to put into pies. After he discovers that the Judge also has custody of his daughter, Todd will stop at nothing to get the Judge into his chair. The story is a really interesting one dealing with themes like revenge and moral corruption in a gripping way. I like how the film flowed well and moved along at a decent pace, but still took the time to develop the characters and let you know the reasons behind their actions. It was extremely engaging because it really made me care about Todd's plight and I was interested in where the story was going to go.But what about the main piece itself which is the music. I'll go out and say that all the music in the film is absolutely fantastic. There was not one bit of music that I didn't thoroughly enjoy and amazing all of these songs fit into the film perfectly. From the bouncy 'By the Sea' to the beautiful 'Johanna' to the serene 'Pretty Women' to the raw aggression of 'Epiphany', all of these songs where wonderfully composed and the different tones mesh well together in the grand scheme of things. The singing was also really impressive. Johnny Depp hasn't the best voice but for the pure emotion he puts into the songs it is impossible to fault him, while the distinct voices of Rickman and Bonham Carter fit really well.The acting is also superb, especially when you consider all the things the actors have to do. Johnny Depp does a splendid job of conveying the restrained rage and sadness that encapsulates Todd. Depp's understated turn gives the role added powerful and tinges of emotion that fit very well. He also does a rather good Cockney accent and, as said, his singing voice is quite impressive. Helena Bonham Carter is brilliant as usual as the opportunist Mrs. Lovett. It's a role that would be easy to dislike, but Bonham Carter adds such a down to earth tone and seemingly caring outlook that it always keeps your sympathy. Alan Rickman is simply a joy to watch as the crooked Judge perfectly showing off his seedy nature and Timothy Spall is wonderful as the horribly slimy Beadle, both creating unpleasant villains. Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener were effective, while young Ed Sanders does a great job as Toby and his singing is also rather good. Sasha Baron Cohen is also very convincing in a more serious role.The visuals truly are striking. Burton brings his melancholy palette wonderfully to the film, giving London a twisted beauty. The shady colours worked really well in creating a contrast to all the blood that the film lays out. Even the flashback scenes and those imaginary ones are beautifully lit which also corresponds the misery of their lives very well. Adding to the look all the other visual aspects are perfectly done. The costumes look very authentic and capture the period well. The make-up is fantastic, especially on Depp. The sets are also superbly designed which gives the film a much more intimate atmosphere than you'd expect. There is just something about the cinematography that really makes the film leap out at you.The gory parts are rather gruesome, but I don't think the film would have as much impact if they were toned down and it does have an important part to play in telling this story. There is no backing down on that front and at times it does become enjoyably over-the-top without becoming silly. The more humour moments are well placed. There is some really good understated humour especially from Bonham Carter that fits well and Ed Sanders gets a few funny lines as well. The contest between Todd and Pirelli is a lot of fun, while the 'By the Sea' dream sequence is very amusing simply for how cheerful it is against everything else. For me the ending was quite surprising just for how it didn't fall into the usual formula and gave a satisfying but oddly bittersweet conclusion to everything.Overall I really love Sweeney Todd. It is amazing just how good these songs are, the way they're all composed, sung and fit into the film really is something to be impressed by, I mean they're so good that you can happily listen to them separately. Johnny Depp delivers a powerful lead turn as well as some excellent singing, the rest of the cast are simply brilliant and the visuals are really stunning to behold. The film is effortlessly entertaining, the story on its own makes for a really strong set-up to events. Sweeney Todd certainly had me gripped throughout and showed that when Burton & Depp are on top from then they are very hard to beat.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
brilliance abounds,"Having never been a huge fan of Tim Burton's past works with the exception of ED WOOD and BIG FISH. I have usually found his work empty of what makes a film interesting for me. They are always full of style but totally void of anything resembling substance. Needless to say I was very skeptical of his taking SWEENEY TODD to the big screen.Glad to say how wrong I was. The film is stupendous from every department. Production Design,Costume Design, Cinematography, all hitting their marks with horrific beauty. As for the people claiming that the singing voices were weak, they have no clue as to the concept of the brilliant Lyrics and Music of Stephan Sondheim.The score was always meant to be Spoken/sung adding to the darkness of the story.Any other way it would have been down right silly. As for Johnny Depp, never has he been better. For an actor to take a role of a serial killer and manage to have the audience understand and feel his pain is to be admired. His spirit has so been destroyed,his revenge seems justified.There is however one last final betrayal that makes what has preceded even the more tragic. A truly great achievement for all.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Is This Music & Mayhem Pic As Bizarre As They Say?  Yup!,"If you haven't seen this film and are expecting something bizarre from the collaboration director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp.....well, you're going to get it! This is different......mainly because most of the dialog is sung, like an opera. However, at least half of that is half spoken-half sung so it isn't really operatic. Burton displays his usual dark visions and wonderful cinematography and Depp plays his normal strange, dark character. I can't say that all the singing appealed to me, but the actors did a credible job with it. In fact, Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and company surprised me how well they all sang considering they aren't known for that talent.One other major warning: some of the bloody scenes are pretty graphic. There will be a number of people who will turn their heads at a few scenes. That doesn't start for awhile, however, as the first third of film sets up the premise.What I found most appealing was the comedy. The wildest character was ""Signor Adolfo Pirelli,"" a guy pretending to be a famous Italian barber and played - incredibly - by Sacha Baron Cohen....yes, ""Borat,"" himself! I only wish his role had been a little bigger. The other guy who made me laugh was Timothy Spall as ""Beadle Bamford."" He was so bad, he was good! Some of the lyrics in the songs also were humorous. All the comedy is a mixture of dark and light stuff.It seems like most of the scenes in this film were either very dark and foreboding or filled with outrageous dark humor. There wasn't much middle ground. I suspect you'll either stick with the film and enjoy it or be tempted to toss it in the garbage can before it's over. Either way, you'll have a definite opinion of this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Big, bold and bloody but not that brilliant.","It's not that Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a bad film as much as it is a bad Tim Burton film. The film looks good visually and is very ominous in its cinematography and use of a grotty and bleak location but most of this is what we come to expect from Burton and is nothing more than a sheen on a surface when broken down and thought about. Most of Burton's films that do not contain a certain amount of substance really rely on the visual; Sleepy Hollow and Mars Attacks! are two good examples with Batman, Batman Returns and Ed Wood being films that looked pretty ordinary but actually felt as if they were about something; about people and predicaments and coming through in the end. Sweeney Todd is one of the former; iffy, visually attractive efforts but 'not much else going on' films.A few years prior to Sweeney Todd, Joel Schumacher made The Phantom of the Opera, another musical adaptation for the silver screen. There are connections between the two. Both are films about individuals whom have suffered in the past and have been scarred so badly, either physically or psychologically, they take it upon themselves to inhabit a certain 'space' in which they are able to remain, cut off from the outside world as they reflect their social misfit status. What's interesting about The Phantom and Sweeney Todd is their dwelling. Both the opera house and the barber shop offer members of the public a certain 'service'. At the time of The Phantom of the Opera, the opera house (along with the theatre) was very much a means of entertainment for a night out; a place that has since been associated with visitors whom are sophisticated or cultured.A barbers shop on the other hand can be seen as a place in which the tenants go in order to save themselves a job. There is something nonchalant about a man going to a barbers to have someone else shave him; a certain amount of risk about entrusting another individual with something as potentially dangerous as a razor so close to one's face. In this sense, the spaces Todd and The Phantom inhabit are somewhat associated with the upper class or the nonchalant and are spaces the respected anti-heroes turn into places of horror and terror with their anger and hatred born out of their own social role as a misfit. I liked The Phantom of the Opera slightly more; it felt more heartfelt and revolved around a romance more so than it did a tale of revenge as seen in Sweeney Todd.So if the unique selling point here is that Sweeney Todd is a revenge film, incorporating the genre of the musical and throwing in lashings of gore at the same time, does it work? The short answer is 'not really'. This hybridity of the musical, a casual and usually uplifting genre that falls into the non-realist sense combined with the gritty, realist revenge arc complete with lots of gore does not work here. The film sees Sweeney arrive back in London following years away after a conviction he was innocent of in the first place. This charge was related to the 'crime' of being in love with someone that someone else of a greater power was also in love with. That man is Judge Turpin (Rickman), the slimy Brit-cast baddie who has an equally slimy sidekick in Beadle, Timothy Spall doing what he did in the recent Harry Potter films to reasonably good effect once again, so we've seen it before.Johnny Depp's Sweeney Todd is a follow on from his 'funny' mumbling character Captain Jack Sparrow but less Keith Richards and more Charlie Manson. Todd is a changed man after his stint away from England for punishment of being with this other woman but he's changed for the worse and it's not long before he gets the blood lust that will drive him to his inevitable show down with enemy Judge Turpin. The film is very basic in its idea and set up and a lot of it is music and songs but while there's nothing wrong with that, it's the little things that niggle. The shaving show down with Pirelli (Baron-Cohen), who is a negative Italian stereotype in himself, acts as an introduction to Todd's barber skills and no more. There is also a particularly unpleasant 'joke' involving his child assistant and his constantly cut fingers.But Sweeney Todd is the sort of film that places young children in a position for the sake of laughs when one child is on the floor drunk later on and it just feels out of place. Amongst all the stereotypes and the using of Brits as the villains is an American playing Todd, complete with a white streak in his hair amongst a lot of black in a desperate attempt to visually show us there might be some good or 'light' in him amongst all the 'evil'. The sub narrative of Anthony (Campbell Bower) loving and chasing Johanna (Wisener) is daft and degrading, Johanna being relegated to the role of 'damsel in distress/locked in a tower' as her hero/lover stands, sings and watches her from below. Later, she is moved to an asylum of all places and that's the end of that mini-story.Additionaly, why does Burton shoot his wife Bonham-Carter in an objective fashion as she pours out of a corset? Similarly to Len Wiseman and the Underworld films, we're not watching the film to see your wife presented in a provocative fashion. If people being killed and served as pies as later on two potential kid killers roam the sewers searching for a lost boy sounds like fun then you might enjoy Sweeney Todd but it is a rather daft and lifeless film directed by a man that you expect better from.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Violent, yet mesmerizing","Here we have another dark Tim Burton film. After seeing several of his previous works, you can almost always expect violence and a grim tale. There is quite a bit of blood and gore in the film, so don't let the idea of a musical deter you. However, the acting and diologue are rock solid. The cast of this movie is magical. Of course Johnny, need I say more. Helena Carter, most famously known from Fight Club, also is an amazing supporting role. The story is a beautiful tale of revenge and love, which will keep you on the edge of your seat. If I would have to compare this film to previous Tim Burton films, I would say a mix of Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow. It has that dark and violent content, mixed with a strong central character. I am telling you people, you will enjoy this show. Not for kids though, obviously.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wonderful story ruined by a Hot Topic fever dream,"I recently revisited this movie and, wow, I really didn't see how ""Tim Burton"" this movie was.First off, the story of Sweeney Todd is a brilliant story of rage, revenge, and all-consuming hatred. It's chilling, macabre, and the music is hauntingly catchy. Years after watching this movie I still sing the songs to myself. The acting in this movie is also off-the-charts great. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, being the biggest celebrity names all giving astounding performances.But oh my god. This movie is ruined by Tim Burton, costuming and makeup. Depp and Carter are SO PALE. I'm sure they had their reasons, but they are dressed and colored so strikingly different from everyone else in this movie. There's a part that is supposed to be a big climax of the movie, where Johnny Depp is running around the streets of London. All tension and intensity in this scene is ruined when you realize he looks like a 7th grader who identifies as a vampire that just got a fresh fit from the Hot Topic at the mall. This mood almost completely ruins the movie, it takes it from an intense revenge story and makes it way too reminiscent of teenage angst. Sweeney Todd is not a vampire. So don't make him look like one when everyone else wears normal clothes and has normal skin color.I would love to see another adaption of this movie without Tim Burton. Alice in Wonderland is much better example of where his style shines in live-action.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
This isn't Edward scissorhands???,"Okay so this movie I'm very mixed about. First off the story is easily the best part it takes a revenge story and completely throws it on his head. Without giving too much away the story is about revenge slowly consuming a man but, it's also a lot more than that the story links in with the differences of class and how badly poor people where treated in the 1800s. The story also is about death, death is told through the score, the music, the story and the cinematography. It's about a city filled with death and evil and how it can consume someone. This movie is also a musical and I think that adds a very interesting detail to this movie making it very unique. That being said I personally found a fair amount of the musical numbers weren't great. Finally, for me personally I found it was hard to hear certain dialogue due to how loud the score was, this might just be a me thing but it's something I had trouble with during my viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The greatest film ever made?,"It's difficult to tell you what my favourite film is because I have so many that I admire and they're all quite different. Depending on my mood I might tell you that Black Swan is my favourite film, or that Kill Bill is, but mostly I'll tell you that Sweeney Todd is. I've lost count the amount of times I've seen Sweeney Todd and I can't tell you how much I was addicted to it when I first saw it. I'd be singing all the songs, always watching the film, quoting from it. Thankfully, I'm not quite so obsessed with it now, but it will always be in my heart.Now, I hate musicals. I thought I'd start off by telling you that because you might read that it's a musical and be instantly struck off. I find that songs drag the film down, slowing the pace and being just unnecessary! They're also unnecessarily cheery like in The Sound of Music or Dancin' in the Rain. Sweeney Todd is a completely different type of beast. Have you ever heard a song about cannibalism before? About vengeance and murder? I have and they're incredible! There's not one song out of place in Sweeney Todd and it's pure lyrical genius from Stephen Soundheim. They're also undeniably catchy and memorable, unlike Singin' in the Rain's songs for example. Some huge numbers really capture the scope of the film, whilst the smaller ones bring it down to a personal and more human level. You seriously do not need to worry if you hate musicals!Sweeney Todd opens with the greatest title sequence in history. It completely captures the mood of the film and lets you know that this is Tim Burton's work! Like all great films it the look of the film is utterly breath taking. Blacks are blacker than black and colour rarely shines through. It's completely moody and stylistic, capturing the tone of the film perfectly and casting a beautifully melancholic atmosphere over the film. The incredible sets are heart-stopping to look at at times and it never fails to give me chills when Sweeney picks up his razor, holds it to the huge window and says, ""At last my arm is complete again!""But this isn't Avatar! It isn't all visual and no brain. Sweeney Todd's story is absolutely masterful. Like all the best story's, it's about revenge, revenge on the evil judge who locked him up and stole his wife and child. Not many films can easily achieve making you sympathise with a serial killer, but here you can. He's a tragic character who you can't help but feel sorry for and want to see him get his revenge. It also thrives off of its wonderful characters played impeccably by everyone. Of course johnny Depp steals the show with his power house performance and surprisingly strong voice. Helena Bonham Carter adds a well-needed female touch and humour to the role, Alan Rickman is perfect menacing as the judge, Timothy Spall does his mincing incredibly well as the BEadle and Sacha baron Cohen shows that he really can act as the wonderfully extravagant Pirelli!Tim's directing is also as perfect as everything else in the film. Some breathtaking camera shots really propel the film into a league of its own. Equally the costumes are beautiful and highly memorable. The whole film is likely one you're never forget and never forgive yourself for not going to see! It all builds up to an incredible finale that tugs hard at your heart strings and has you gasping in shock. It's one of the best endings I've ever seen and leaves a very large print on you.With an incredible score bellowing throughout, Sweeney Todd is one of those rare films that are just perfect! If there was any justice in the world Sweeney Todd should've won best picture, best director, best screenplay, best music, best actor, best actress, best cinematography, best costumes, best set design etc. at the Oscars! It's a cinematic masterpiece which is spectacular to look at and to listen to. Pick this up on blu-ray and at last your arm will be complete again!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
not a fun musical,"I have been a big fan of recent musicals; however, this one goes away from the norm, and it's just not as fun. The music and lyrics aren't as good. While visual, Sweeney Todd is quite spectacular with the dark sets and moonlit lightning. However, musicals like Moulin Rouge had much better costumes and visual effects.Johnny Depp was only OK; he isn't a great singer. This movie was fairly violent. Lots of blood squirting from gashes. The mince meat pies were more in the background and that idea could have been worked in better in the movie. I just felt the script could have been written better.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but disappointing as far as musicals go. I only recommend it for Depp fans.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The thin line between genius and insane,"When I first heard that a new Tim Burton film was in the makings my ears perked. Doubly so because Helena Bonham-Carter and Johnny Depp would be starring in it, which had proved to be a winning threesome in the past. Then I heard the theme of the film would be just as grim as The Corpse Bride and my heart fluttered (for I love that one too). So, expectancies were high. Very high.The film then. The story is the one of revenge. A guy named Benjamin Barker is wrongfully accused and sent to exile. When he returns he wants his revenge on the ones that did this to him. Returning to his home town as Sweeney Todd he starts planning, taking up residence with a pastry maker. And from there it rolls.The setting of the film is dark. Grim colored scenes depicting a dark time to live in, and doing that well. Characters are picked with great care and played by actors that do it well. And, to make the grimness at the same time more and less intense, dark and twisted humor is added for good laughter, and most dialog is sung to add a sense of merriness. The totaling sum of all this is a rather morbid film that will bring a smile or a hearty laugh to anyone with a wicked sense of humor.Not that the film only works for those with that sense of humor. The settings are so wonderfully worked out that it is just a pleasure to watch the scenes as they pass by - everything adds together and just works, no gaps, no jumps.

I thought the sets and costumes were great, and it started out very well...but then quickly plunged into depravity and just pure evil.

And then, to burst into song about it.I mean, hello? We're supposed to find that entertaining?

He was an amoral, bitter man who lusted for money and was not averse to killing to get it.""Basically, he killed his clients, robbed them, and then they were made into pies. Wow. Why do people make these violent murderers famous, as though they are some great hero? And a musical about it, no less?I think Johnny Depp is a remarkable actor, an incredible talent...but I thought this film was nauseating.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Grimly Great, Marvelous Music","Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are wonderful. Alan Rickman is fantastic - what a great actor he was. The other actors/characters are also great, as well. The haunted sadness that Johnny Depp brings through his performance keeps it from being simply a cartoon.A few songs are missing here (and I missed them, but I do like it better without the chorus) from the stage musical but I think most are intact. And, of course, they're Sondheim songs, so they're magnificent.The bleakness that visually overhangs the film works wonderfully - Burton did a great job.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A film that could have been a lot better, had there been plot structure in the first half an hour.","Musicals are a funny thing; on paper they make absolutely no sense at all. The characters live in a world where breaking into song and dance while at the shops is completely normal and where not only do the bystanders accept this but the audience do too. Before really understanding musicals or liking the genre full stop, it always seemed to me that the songs were more important than the story, almost to the point where the story became irrelevant; it seemed just a device in which to have songs. However, after recently starting to really appreciate the style, I now understand that I couldn't have been further from the truth. Now, to say I am a Johnny Depp fan is an understatement. I also enjoy Tim Burton when he is on top form, so you can understand just how much I have been looking forward to this film. So when I say ""I am severally disappointed by Sweeney Todd"", I hope you get the gravitas of what I felt after watching it and funnily enough the cause of why it fails is because of the very reason that I didn't understand musicals at first. Before I go into its failures though, I will give you an oversight of the plot and what the film succeeds at.The story is essentially a revenge tale; Benjamin Barker (Depp) is sent away by Judge Turpin (the ever good Alan Rickman) after he sees his family at a market one day and decides he wants Barker's wife for himself. Skip ahead a couple of years and Benjamin Barker returns to London as Sweeny Todd, with only one thing on his mind - finding Turpin and taking revenge for ruining his life. When he returns to his shop, he finds Mrs. Lovett (played by Helena Bonham Carter) who supposedly makes the worst pies in London and begins a depraved killing spree, which can only end in tears. The first thing you notice about Sweeny Todd, as with most Burton films is the gorgeous Gothic set design, makeup, clothes and style. Some criticise him for his films always having the same look and design, but you can't argue the fact that even though he does use the style a lot, he's gotten very good at using it. His direction also stands out in this film more so than in his previous works. Whilst always having appreciated his directing and style, I never really thought of him as one who wants to experiment with the art of film itself. Whereas here some of his choices work very well, most notably the scene towards the start where the camera zips through the London streets, randomly noticing people as it flies by. Yet at the same time the direction is the reason why the film fails and it's all down to the first half hour.In my mind, typically speaking in a musical, a song is used to emphasise a certain emotion or important plot device. A good musical is when it understands this and doesn't just put songs in all over the place because it can. The best example of this that springs to mind is Moulin Rouge!; when a song was used in this film there was always a reason for it. It would give insight into the way a character was feeling but couldn't show in a normal expressive way, or if there were songs that weren't part of the story they were used in a realist manner, most of the time on stage. The problem with Sweeny Todd is that it completely forgets the most important and basic film element; plot structure. There is literately little to no plot for the first thirty minutes of the film; there's song after song with nothing for them to emphasise, because the characters haven't had a chance to explain why they are doing a certain thing or feeling a certain way. What the film tries to do is what Once did so successfully by telling the plot through song, but the songs that Sweeny Todd has, while catchy and technically sound, are not expressive or informative enough to do the job. This therefore creates the devastating problem of the audience only being able to invest and care about the character half an hour into the film, at which point you just don't feel part of the story. Instead you feel as an outsider looking in, which means you don't care what happens to the characters. The acting too, while good and serviceable is not what I've come to expect from Johnny Depp. His singing is fine and fits the film well, but unlike almost all his other films, I never felt like I was watching one of his new character creations; it was more like I was watching Johnny Depp do his 'From Hell' accent with a bit of Jack Sparrow. Due to this I never really believed in the character, or what he was feeling the majority of the time, because it seemed to me Depp wasn't comfortable with the part. Thankfully Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and Sasha Baron Cohen all provide good support, which stops it from falling on its face, but even they couldn't save a film which shot itself in the foot at the start.I think it is a true shame they couldn't have fixed the beginning's structure before releasing Sweeney Todd, because I believe it would have been great if a relationship with the character had been built from the start. This is not to say that the film is a complete and utter failure, because it does have redeeming qualities, such as the support acting, gorgeous production values and catchy songs. If you are going to watch Sweeney Todd simply for Johnny Depp though, I would suggest instead buying The Libertine, sitting down in your chair and watching him at his mesmerizing best, because unfortunately he doesn't show it here.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It was a good movie but it could have been much, much better.This is about a barber who comes for revenge to a certain judge because he stole his wife and child away from him.The acting isn't so bad. Depp and Helena Bonham Carter succeed in making people miserable. Most of the time, their singing were bad. This could have been better not as a musical.Overall, this is an okay film.

Worst Musical Ever...just might be.,"Let's start off, I have no experience with Sweeney Todd at all before this sham of a movie. And, judging by how awful the movie was, I'm glad I didn't. From what I've heard, the musical kills this movie, and I would agree with anyone that says that, despite the fact I've never seen the musical but anyway.This review is simple. What makes a musical a musical? Good music.What does Sweeney Todd have? The worst music I've ever heard in a musical. Besides the singing in this movie, which was embarrassing to hear. The music was completely atrocious. Couple that with a plot that tries it's hardest to be depressing and morbid but fails miserably. Throw in a bunch of obviously fake blood and by a bunch I mean a lot of fake blood. And you get Sweeney Todd!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

'How about a shave?',"A musical masterpiece draped in gothic splendour and an incredible experience! Based on the theatre musical by Stephen Sondheim, Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) is a barber who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 15 years after an evil judge (Alan Rickman) desires to rid of him and pursue his wife. On Todd's release, he seeks revenge with the help of Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) the local pie shop owner whose pies will be made of Todd's victims.... This film holds a very special place in my heart; for a good three years I was obsessed with it from the characters to the songs and the making of (the dvd has great features into the production process from the gorgeous costume design by Coleen Atwood to the perfect prosthetic effects!) It has a very unique style and dark beauty that is hard to capture but it manages to do it perfectly. Depp and Carter are absolutely amazing in the central roles and make for an engaging screen couple. Burton has always said it's in the eyes that performances really shine and if an actor can communicate something strong without talking, that's something really special. This is completely the case here; although it's a musical with grand numbers, there's also its fair share of more somber tunes and the revenge plot is riveting just through the look in Depp's eyes and the way he moves. The supporting cast are all just as important; from Timothy Spall's slimy performance as Beadle Bamford to Sacha Baron Cohen's scene stealing one as Pirelli, Todd's rival in the business. And the gore... wow! Just slasher spectacle at its very best! The first time Todd slits a throat is shocking, disturbing and a great horror moment. His subsequent murders are all equally as splendidly mad. Darkly comic, emotionally devastating and the best horror musical by far, this is a must for fans of both genres",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
All-time classic,"First of all, the plot of the movie was very interesting and I'm so glad that I have finally watched that movie. The storyline was very well written, everything was well-explained and poetic. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and some of them were kinda likeable. The filming location of the movie was really good and I really liked the dark vibe of the movie. The 1840's were portrayed really well, especially the clothes and the design of the houses. The casting was really good and their acting was descent (Johnny Depp was ICONIC). It wasn't a really scary movie, because there weren't any jumpscares. But, the killcount was really bloody and there were too many death scenes. The opening scene of the movie (first 20 minutes) was very well portrayed and it was really promising, I really enjoyed it. The ending scene was kinda unexpected and it was really tragic. Moreover, the soundtrack of the movie was really good and I enjoyed every song of the movie. In my opinion, only the blood effects weren't very well edited, but it's okay. Overall, it was an enjoyable dark musical and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
At last! My arm is complete again!,"It is a scene worthy of Charles Dickens: gray buildings, gray skies and gray-faced people, living and dead.

"Good, But Depp Can't Sing","""Sweeney Todd"" is actually a very well-made movie. Sondheim refers to it as the only one of his musicals that actually succeeds as a movie, rather than an opened-up version of the stage musical.Director Tim Burton uses shades of red and black almost exclusively in the film, from costumes to scenery to lighting. It adds to the film's overall effectiveness. He doesn't shy away from all the blood, which doesn't bother me.Johnny Depp delivers yet another fantastic performance. He is lacking one important element, though -- a singing voice. He sounds like he would be more comfortable singing a pop or rock musical (such as ""Rent"" or ""Rock of Ages""). However, the score for ""Sweeney"" is an extremely demanding one, almost operatic (indeed, the stage version has been performed at numerous opera houses). His acting saves the character - he is absolutely riveting.Helena Bonham Carter's voice suits her character well, but it could be stronger. She plays the character well, but she could have been a bit more scatterbrained.Of the other cast members, only Jane Weisner (Johanna), Jamie Campell Bower (Anthony), and Sascha Cohen (Pirrelli) have voices that suit the work.Musically, Burton has cut several songs, including the opening of the stage version, ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"". Sondheim purists should definitely see this, but their expectations should be significantly lowered.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Overall Satisfying Though Not Quite Full,"I love the Sondheim musical and the performances of the great Angela Lansbury, Len Cariou, George Hearn, and company. The music was breathtaking and every note had a purpose - not such the case in virtually every musical before and since. Tim Burton took on quite a task of bringing the three-hour epic musical to the screen. It was with trepidation and enthusiasm that I went and was overall pleased yet not quite satisfied. On the plus side I have always admired Burton and his vision in film. It is about as pure as it can get for this medium. He tackles what interests him for the most part just as his popular star Johnny Depp does as well. Depp always gives a good performance and here is no different. He even sings much better than I thought. The film is gorgeous with lush colour dripping in every scene, attentive detail given to set design and costume, and some wonderful lighting. Burton's London is almost surreal and yet breathtaking all the time. The blood flows generously - as it would in this film. Burton is not shy in showing the dark side of life. The performances are all pretty good. Depp was better than expected and manages to embody the skulking silence of Todd torn by thoughts of revenge and personal tragedy very nicely. Helena Bonham Carter looks th part of Mrs. Lovett(except for the plunging neckline I cannot quite remember seeing Miss Lansbury proffer) though the singing aspect of the role is quite honestly a bit much for her abilities; nonetheless, she is acceptable. Alan Rickman makes a formidable judge(though he cannot sing a lick), Timothy Spall makes a convincing Beadle(not asked to sing for the most part), and Sacha Baron Cohen really shines in a scene-stealing role as Pirelli. The rest of the major roles, Johanna, Tobias, and Anthony, are all played by newcomers who all out-perform the stars in terms of real singing talent however. It is important to remember that Sweeney Todd is 80% or more sung not spoken. The lack of singing ability from the stars does have to detract somewhat from the film especially for a fan of the original Broadway hit. But Burton's direction and the cast rise above these small problems and create a film that is highly enjoyable and entertaining. For me the biggest problem wasn't the lack of singing talent but the material that was cut from the original play. Whether for budgetary or time constraints or both, Burton shaved about an hour off the original musical composition: whole songs(at least four that I could count), bastardized lyrics(some songs edited heavily), and a frame story of storytellers telling us to attend the tale of Sweeney Todd MIA. I wish that Burton could have included these in the film and missed them sorely. But for the individual that is not familiar with the original at all or only briefly, this won't even be a minor consideration. So all in all I really enjoyed this production just wished I had more to taste.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The sombrest of massacres,"A story and setting that were practically suited for Tim Burton's direction and style. Hyperbolic gloom and contrast, with a macabre tone and characters that you can't describe in any other way but deranged. An unambiguous story of how the bitter pursuit of revenge will bring nothing but anguish is not going to leave you at the edge of your seat, considering that every plot device is overly transparent upon its earliest introduction and blatantly obvious that it is going to end in a river of bloody drama.None of it, of course, matters because it's a musical, and despite a few hiccups in the cast's delivery, the movie ambitiously succeeds in providing three-quarters of its story in songs. And unfortunately, the highlight for me was the Contest with Sacha Baron Cohen's hilarious delivery.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Johnny Depp gets to wear the white face paint .....again,"I know I am supposed to love this movie, after all its a literary masterpiece and it was Directed by Burton & its got Depp but um it was just underwhelming.What on earth were they thinking? I am sure that as a stage play that this would be quite enjoyable but as a movie it just did not translate too well, it would have been much better if it was not a musical. The songs were at times irritating and at other times just pointless. The story could have been presented as a great black comedy, which of course is what the Sweeny Todd story is. Instead it fell short, I smiled a couple of times as the corpses slid down the chute but overall it failed to deliver any real laughs.It seems as if this was nothing more than a vehicle for a potential award in the musical/comedy category for Depp. To be honest I am getting a bit tired of seeing Depp with the white face paint and blackened eyes, enough already its time for something different.For my money white face paint and deadpan delivery is NOT acting.I have no idea how this has rated so highly on IMDb, at best this is a 5-6/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
He served a dark and a vengeful god,"WARNING--the below contains SPOILERS, particularly for those not familiar with the original stage show.I'm not even going to try to be objective: I loved this movie. No, it wasn't the same as the stage show at all, but it succeeded much better than it would have had it tried to be another ""filmed play"" version. The decision of which numbers to cut to take an hour out of the show was judicious. Much of the love story between Johanna and Anthony is given short shrift, which is great--in most plays, the young lovers are the least interesting characters. I was a bit sorry that ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" was not sung in the movie, but although it's a great song, it is very stage-bound and was better left out. Burton did choose to use its tune as background music, over the credits and elsewhere. (Its ominousness/""Dies Irae"" riff means this decision probably worked as well for those not familiar with the show as those who are.) The fact that Burton made a movie rather than a filmed play also really helped the number ""By the Sea,"" which comes off as overlong and a bit boring on the Broadway soundtrack. Freed from its staging, the song is hilarious and doesn't drag a bit. In fact, it much better accomplishes its purpose--showing the contrast between Mrs. Lovett's feelings and imagination and Sweeney's attitude about it all--than in the play.Depp's Sweeney, of course, is pitch perfect, with equal parts pathos, psychopathology and comedy. Bonham Clark's Mrs. Lovett is very different from former interpretations, and I'm not sure something wasn't lost here--I missed, for example, the Angela Lansbury Lovett's seeming(?)love for young orphan Toby, which chillingly vanishes when convenient. Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall were brilliant choices for the judge and beadle characters, and Sasha Baron Cohen's Pirelli is both hilarious and effective. (He's the first character to die; thus the balance of comedy and our desire to see those who deserve punishment get it has to be established with him.) The singing is, well, adequate. It succeeds even though we're not listening to opera-quality voices because nobody sings much better or worse than anyone else. The problem comes with some of the numbers that are sung very fast and/or dialectically, as conversations with overlapping speakers. It takes amazing diction to sing such numbers such that every word can be understood, and Burton's cast wasn't always equal to the task.Like No Country for Old Men, Sweeney is a perfect marriage of director and subject matter. Burton's eye for dark but thoroughly imagined settings is a dead-on match for Sondheim's misanthropic, revenge-bent Todd and ""black pit"" of a London where children are executed and human bodies are baked into meat pies.A few caveats: This is a musical that contains so little spoken dialog it might as well be called an opera. If you don't like musicals, you'll have a hard time enjoying this movie--although Jonathan, who hates musicals, liked it anyway. Also, Burton gives every throat-cutting in the script (and there are many) a cadmium-red- spurting Grand Guignol treatment that's appropriate- -even funny when it ought to be--but perhaps a bit disturbing for some viewers.This film succeeds at doing the same thing the show does--attaining a perfect mix of horror, social justice, and comedy, but does so, as Sir Lancelot might say, in its own idiom.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Macabre and gruesomely entertaining revisionist musical,"""Bright, cheerful and fun"" are three of the words one would most commonly hear when describing the latest movie musical. Not coincidentally, none of the aforementioned words in any way describe Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, eccentric director Tim Burton's adaptation of Steven Sondheim's macabre stage musical. In many ways, Burton's latest serves to either deconstruct or blatantly oppose the conventions of most glitzy cinematic musicals, resulting in a uniformly pitch black, macabre, gruesome and undeniably entertaining film, the likes of which have seldom been exposed to mass audiences.In many ways, Burton's Sweeney Todd functions as the ""anti-musical"" - the notion of passing off Sondheim's gruesome but clever story of a nihilistic, vengeance seeking barber and his similarly deranged landlady under the guise of a mainstream musical is a subversive idea indeed, and Burton contrasts the typical musical flashy cinematography and stunning choreography with static camera movement and musical numbers sung with little to no movement - all the more unsettling but eerily captivating and fascinating. Burton is also given the opportunity to unleash his twisted visual genius upon the setting, and his atmospheric vision of turn of the century London is a gritty visual masterpiece, a world of deep greys, consistent shadows and even shadier denizens. With its slew of throat slitting, the film also stands out as one of the most visceral and outright bloody films in recent memory, proving equally effective as a Gothic horror thriller than as a movie musical. And while the film may occasionally feel unbalanced, rushed and underdeveloped in the same way which plagues many such grandiose stage adaptations, Sweeney Todd unfolds with an operatic flourish unseen in most of its contemporaries, and it is near impossible to avoid being swept up by the gruesomely enjoyable rush of it all.The film's eccentric and endlessly talented cast prove equally proficient singers as they are superbly capable of crafting a memorably deranged myriad of characters. Johnny Depp embraces the titular Sweeney Todd with a malicious relish just as laudable as his superb previously unheard singing voice. Depp's brooding presence drives the film, just as quirky, captivating and compelling a lead performance as ever. Helena Bonham Carter similarly brings her offbeat charm to perfect use as Mrs. Lovett, Todd's cheerfully sinister landlady. Alan Rickman is superbly classy as corrupt Judge Turpin, crafting yet another delightfully despicable antagonistic figure to add to his roster of them. His duet ""Pretty Women"" with Depp is truly an unmissable spectacle. Timothy Spall is perfectly cast as the grimy Beadle Bamford, Turpin's swaggering second in command, and Sacha Baron Cohen is tremendously entertaining in a far too brief role as faux-Italian rival hairdresser 'Signor Pirelli'. Jamie Cambell Bower feels out of place in the gritty surroundings as a more typical mainstream romantic male lead lusting after Todd's daughter, but his presence adds to the ""anti-musical"" aspect by being pushed to the side in favour of the darker, more compelling leads.Brash, bloody and gleefully disturbed, Burton's antidote to the mainstream musical proves brilliantly subversive of the conventions of its genre, while boasting a stunning spectacle of a variety unto its own. The chillingly brooding Depp and the rest of the cast are enough to bring Burton's dark vision to gritty life, and the excellent song numbers prove among the most memorable of a year fraught with many movie musical efforts. For all willing to stomach the admittably copious quantities of blood and thoroughly morbid content, Sweeney Todd may prove to be just the thing to counterbalance the syrupy glitz plaguing its musical contemporaries of late - unsettling, stylized and undeniably entertaining... in other words, exactly what one would hope for from a new Tim Burton film.-8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Closest of Shaves...,"This Tim Burton adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical is filled with the dark and twisted visions we have come to expect from the director, and this musical/horror is a rare example of the two genres working well together, largely because of a range of eccentric characters effectively interpreted by a highly competent cast.Johnny Depp leads the way as Benjamin Barker, once a barber with a young family but now transformed into the brooding madman Todd by false imprisonment imposed on him by the reptilian Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) so that he can get his hands on Barker's beautiful wife. As Helen Bonham-Carter's Mrs Lovett observes, the years ain't been kind to Barker and he is consumed by a rage against Turpin that, when frustrated in his attempted murder of the judge, he diverts toward any hapless soul who happens to sit in his chair. Rounding out the cast are Sacha Baron Cohen as a fake Italian barber who becomes Todd's first victim, Timothy Spall as Turpin's wonderfully odious sidekick, and a rather bland Jamie Campbell-Bower as Anthony, the young sailor who falls for Todd's daughter.Most of the dialogue is sung by the actors, and none of them appear to have voice doubles judging by some of the vocal performances, but this somehow manages to strengthen the technique rather than weaken it. The tunes, for the most part, aren't exactly tuneful anyway but the sometimes lacklustre stretches are counter-pointed by some wonderful flourishes from Burton. Depp, having just about mastered the English accent, gives a towering performance. He is the film and, too a large degree, whether it stands or falls rests squarely on his shoulders. Depp is versatile enough to carry it off with aplomb, however, and develops a nice twisted chemistry with Bonham-Carter. The pair play well off of each other and the perverse family unit they form with young tearaway Toby (Ed Sanders) serves to emphasise where Todd's and Lovett's ambitions part company.It has to be said that this film may prove to be something of an acquired taste. Musicals like this spend much of their time allowing characters to express feelings that couldn't be verbally expressed in a more straightforward narrative without losing credibility. Although I enjoyed it well enough while watching, I'm not sure I'd be particularly inclined to watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Attend the tale,"Every pitfall this film could have fallen in-and were there ever plenty of pitfalls readily awaiting Tim Burton and his devoted cast and crew-it skillfully avoids. It's tragedy about the titular barber (Johnny Depp), who teams up with a local baker (Helena Bonham Carter) to seek vengeance on a malicious judge (Alan Rickman). It's also a musical, and make no bones about it; everyone sings. I would venture to say that over 3/4 of the story is told in song. But if all you Broadway-haters can get past the singing, you'll find a brilliantly crafted movie with heart and wit to spare. The performers are all spot on; Depp and Bonham Carter both give their characters a complete makeover (vocals included), and it works superbly. Rickman tucks into a role only he could play. And the assorted newcomers in supporting roles will be the bigshots of tomorrow-especially the gifted Jamie Campbell Bower. Production design and editing are top-notch, too. Oh, and for the slasher fans; wait patiently; the stuff doesn't really start spraying until the corpse-tastic finale, and boy, does it spray.

Not Your Average Musical!,"The movie opens with what I can only describe as a classic Tim Burton style, as the camera zooms through the streets of Old London. With such a Burton ""signature"" you have to know that you're in for something of an unusual movie - and you get it. This is, in fact, a very odd combination of things. It's a musical about a demonic mass-murdering barber and somehow in the midst of it all it also has a few scenes that are actually quite funny - for humour I think right off of Mrs. Lovett's ""The Worst Pies In London"" near the start of the movie. Johnny Depp as the ""demon barber"" Sweeney Todd and Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett are excellent and performed well together, and the supporting performances were probably topped by Timothy Spall's go as the Beadle. The story of Todd's quest for murderous revenge against the judge who stole his young wife from him years before moves along pretty nicely (although I have to admit that it took some effort for me to get through the first few scenes for some reason) and most of the songs are well performed. As for weaknesses, it seemed obvious to me for some reason who the old lady who kept popping up was, so that came as no particular surprise to me and in all honesty I thought Burton went a bit overboard with the bloodiness of the murder scenes - although it is Tim Burton we're talking about. There was also that strangely off putting (to me) opening couple of scenes that failed to pull me in, although in the end I'm glad I stuck with this. For the most part it was a lot of fun. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is a strong recommendation.,"Wow!!What I think is most amazing about this movie is that it successfully uses all sorts of great contemporary artistic minds to produce one fine product. You have a commercial celebrity directed by an off-beat, visual genius, singing one of the greatest scores off all times. I love how the fluffy pop-culture types will be exposed to Stephen Sondheim and I love how the stuffy snobs will notice how fantastic Johnny Depp is. I think that's why Tim Burton made such a fine director: he was the most appropriate bridge between these two worlds as he himself straddles both the avant-garde and commercial worlds. Accessibility.Before starting on my review, I believe one needs to have an open mind and appreciation for (or better yet understanding of) musical theatre, melodrama, and old film noir/horror films and actors. This movie does not cater to the brutish. I don't mean this to sound elitist but the level of art going on here (visual, acting, music) is significant and requires participation by the audience. If you're passive you won't enjoy it.I won't bore with a synopsis as everyone knows it already so I'll focus on a few points:I will say that Depp makes the Sondheim anti-hero his own and provides a stellar, introverted interpretation that really delves into the emotional complexity of the character. His performance helps to articulate the kind of severe tragedy this ""penny dreadful"" is all about. He is truly a chameleon. A pillar to which all commercial, Hollywood actors should rise: a STRONG character actor who takes risk and has broad appeal.The other performers were great if not all obvious casting choices. Remember, this is a film interpretation of the stage musical not a filmed version of the musical. The fact that Sondheim blessed every decision of this put all of my worries to ease.The opening credit sequence underscored by ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" was excellent even if it was overly digitized. I thought this framed the film well and provided an appropriate prologue. You knew exactly what the film was about before the first words were uttered. It also shows how cinematic Sondheim's music can be. Many people believe that Sondheim's music is ""married"" to his lyrics and that they can't be separated. While I believe the former, this proves the later false and amazingly so!!!I thought that Burton did an excellent job in directing the film. He is truly one of the finest American directors. He made this play his own. This wasn't arbitrary. I love BURTON!!I thought screenwriter John Logan did an AMAZING job in condensing the source material. Even with the song cuts (as above), he allows the functions of these songs to be expressed in other ways so the story and motivation is clear.I was so surprised and impressed by this movie. I was initially hesitant given the cast and Depp's pop voice but this movie was absolutely phenomenal! This film accomplished a lot and proved to be an excellent collaboration of great artistic minds specifically Burton, Sondheim, Depp and Logan.Honestly, please see this film. It will thrill you!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
bitter delight,"Tim Burton. and Johnny Depp. and Helen Bonham Carter. a Gothic play from Broadway. and one of films who mix sarcasm, crime and crumbs from Count of Monte Cristo. result - a delightful discover of dark London, hilarious characters, songs and interesting performance of young Ed Sanders. a film like a strange dance. because, and Tim Burton does not exception in this case, the film has its rhythm and flavor and lights and shadows. Sweeny Todd by Depp not exactly a character from Brodway but a kind of Don Quijote . precise, full of desire of revenge, looking recuperate his past in large web of secrets. Helen Bonham Carter - perfect choice for a role who propose a sort of cynical pragmatism. short - a bitter delight.",,Anonymous,Horror
Depp is simply amazing!,"What a stunning movie this was. Tim Burton is a genius and johnny is amazing, along with the rest of the cast. Everything was seamless from the visuals to the musical bits. I have never been one for a musical but burton/depp pull it off in grand fashion. As many ppl have stated i walked into this movie not knowing much about it outside of the trailer, and i walked out still humming musical bits haha. This is a gorgeously artistic movie and I highly recommend it to anyone with any sort of taste for a GOOD movie (wich is hard to come by these days).Kudos to everyone who had a hand in this movie, and thank you Tim and Johnny cheers!So everyone go out, see the movie, and support depp i promise it Will be well worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
missing ingredients,"Stephen Sondheim's stage work has not, with one significant exception, fared well when transfered to the cinema. The exception is, of course, West Side Story, for which he is credited solely as lyricist. Gypsy, his other significant lyrics-only credit, is a magnificent show which became a mystifyingly mediocre movie. Whatever cinematic virtues Richard Lester's version of A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum may have, it wasn't well received. And the movie of A Little Night Music disappeared, almost without trace, in spite of the presence in the cast of Elizabeth Taylor and Diana Rigg. As a composer-lyricist, Sondheim's most successful Hollywood outing has not occurred in an adaptation of a stage work, but as the songwriter for Warren Beatty's movie Dick Tracy, his contributions to which won him an Oscar.Given the above, Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is probably going to be the movie-going public's abiding view of Sondheim's oeuvre. In this respect, even with substantial cuts to the stage show's score, it serves the songs well. The original orchestrator and musical director were on hand to provide their considerable combined expertise, and in a big cinema with a state-of-the-art sound system, it's a terrific aural experience. At least as far as the instruments are concerned...Vocally, it's another matter. I've heard people sneer at Johnny Depp's sound, but personally I think it's pretty good. For what Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall have to do, they get away with it, whereas Sacha Baron Cohen is splendid, as are Jayne Wisener, Jamie Campbell Bower, wonderfully bouncy Ed Sanders, and, in a sadly reduced role, Laura Michelle Kelly. Helena Bonham Carter is, unfortunately, little short of a disaster on this front: although she sings in time and mostly in tune, the sound is dreary and lacking energy.In fact, the main weakness in the movie for me is that Mrs Lovett is played so listlessly. I can kind of see where this might have come from: the woman is worn out keeping her business going etc etc. But her songs are full of life. Tim Burton can evidently feel the exuberance in the greatest of them, The Worst Pies In London. The camera-work and the film editing are very sprightly during it. But Bonham Carter's wispy tone undermines the comedy.Bonham Carter is not by any means a bad actress: her scenes with Ed Sanders are grounded and real, and she successfully conveys, in the midst of all the gore, Mrs Lovett's adoration of Sweeney Todd. But she is, essentially, and unfortunately, miscast.On the other hand, the romantic couple, on stage generally too old (and mostly deadly dull), benefit here from appropriate casting, generous close-ups, and the tightening up of their story (at one point inexplicably: when Anthony Hope comes bounding in to tell Mr Todd of his discovery of Joanna, we have no sense of how Anthony knows where to find Todd, since we haven't seen them re-bond since they went their ways at the start of the movie, Todd giving Anthony only the vaguest idea of his future whereabouts).Todd himself is the real centre of the movie that bears his name, which is also a welcome shift from what happens in the theatre. On stage, the sheer energy of Mrs Lovett's material works to favour her. It is no accident that while she has been successfully portrayed by a number of first-rate actresses, only journeyman George Hearn came near to making Todd his own. Johnny Depp has now stamped his indelible mark on the role. He is, as we all know, a fine actor. Although here he doesn't actually appear to have to stretch his acting muscles unduly, he is such a star presence that any film he's in will revolve effortlessly around him. The Burton/Depp partnership has given us at least two dazzlers - Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. Sweeney Todd is not in that category, but an interesting lesser work.In my view, the stage show is simply a piece of fun with Grand Guignol conventions. Its apparent dourness may stem from the political gloss on the Todd story in the play version by Chris Bond, which Sondheim took as his source material. Although Bond's play is anything but solemn, the sombreness of Sondheim's music undoubtedly darkened its tone, which has made mining the rich humour in it rather more difficult. The fact is that Sweeney Todd is not a work that requires much dwelling upon. Attempts to burden it with significance merely serve to show up its simple basis as an entertainment. It has been taken up by opera houses, where the fun has been duly taken out of it, and its musical limitations mercilessly exposed.Tim Burton goes some way to reinstating the dark humour of the piece with his nimble camera. I can certainly see why the material would appeal to him. It's the Burtonland of Nightmare Before Christmas, The Corpse Bride, and even Mars Attacks. Whether Sondheim aficionados will be delighted, I somehow doubt. Never mind: they can always go back to the video of the stage show, which features the great Angela Lansbury in one of her showpiece roles, giving some insight into what is missing here.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Who sir, you sir? No one in the chair, come on! Come on! Sweeney's waiting. I want you bleeders. You sir - anybody. Gentlemen don't be shy!","Bloody EXCELLENT. Sweeney Todd is the best film Tim Burton has created since Ed Wood (also an excellent film). Everyone knows Tim Burton has great eyes for visuals. His impressive resume just proves how talent his sight is: Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie and the Chocolate Factor, etc. He is without a doubt one of the best visual stylists of all time, films or no films. His style is so weird and good that he leaves his mark in every film he directed. They are dark and twisted, but very neat. They mesmerize you and they take you in different places. However, Burton has been often criticized for heavily depending on the visuals only. .Many critics doubt his ability to tell flawless story telling without the use of visuals. Whether I agree or not, it's true that sometimes he does go off and rely too heavily on visuals more than the actual story itself (ex. Big Fish).Now, let me be the first one to say this film will change anyone's mind who less think of him as a story teller. It will blow you away. Sweeney Todd is absolutely incredible beyond my words. There is everything people could look forward to in this haunting masterpiece (for the audience of 18 years and older. I wouldn't recommend this to kids or anyone underage) Plenty of gores, thrills, music, meat-pies (yuk!), horrors, BOOBIES and for ladies, plenty of Johnny Depp. He is nothing like you've seen before. NO MORE PIRATES! He will certainly have a chance in winning an Oscar for best actor this year. He is THAT good. Everyone else in the film is sensational, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, Timothy Spall and Sacha Baron Cohen of Borat fame.The recent musicals like Once and Hairspray were very good, and for musical fans, fantastic. In this typical case, you do not; I repeat DO NOT have to be a musical fan to enjoy this. People in the theatre were basically laughing when Johnny started singing (sing talking like West Side Story), but you get used to it quickly. You adjust to the film.In closing, Sweeney Todd is entertainment at best. This is a film that will be remembered years from now. I loved every minute of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Closer Shave...,"Director Tim Burton has pulled off a bit of a miracle with his version of SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET. While it is indeed a musical, it comes with the blessing of Stephen Sondheim, the man behind the original stage production. It also maintains the bonkers menace of the 1936 film with Tod Slaughter without being a self parody.Burton has added humor and pathos without losing any of the horror, even during musical numbers!Johnny Depp shifts into full darkness mode as the titular shaver of necks, and Helena Bonham Carter is suitably wicked as his pie-making cohort. Alan Rickman does his best Vincent Price as the morally corrupt Judge Turpin.Highly recommended for those who don't believe that a horror musical could possibly be disturbing or terrifying...",,Anonymous,Horror
Hammer Horror - The Musical!,"Benjamin Barker returns to London, years after being framed by a judge who lusted after his wife. Taking the name of Sweeney Todd, he plans revenge against the judge, while at the same time begins a killing spree that supplies fresh meat to Mrs. Lovett's pie shop.Based on the musical by Stephen Sondheim and with a screenplay by John Logan, Tim Burton has made a Gothic horror movie, that could easily be seen as a tribute to the Hammer Studio's movies. The mood is atmospheric, it's bloody as hell, and has an ending truly fitting with the piece.Johhny Depp is good as Todd, acting and singing the part well. Helena Bonham Carter gives good support as Mrs. Lovett, as do Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall and Sacha Baron Cohen. All the actors do their own singing, which means that the voices aren't always the best, but the movie is better for that. And for a musical there's no big dance sequences. I don't know, as I've not seen this on stage, if there are actually any in the musical but I'm glad there is none in the movie. It would have slowed down the tale, and in truth not really fitted in.As I said, Burton doesn't skimp on the blood, as it sprays across the screen during numerous throat slashings. Burton has admitted to a love of Hammer movies, and this shows through-out the movie. You could almost picture Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in the middle of all this! From a story point of view, there is a slight twist towards the end, which in truth is easy to see coming, but you don't mind little flaws like that.This is a great movie, and while not a great musical fan, I really enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Well, I liked it....a lot.","First, let me say that I was probably the first person in my home town to buy and listen to the Broadway recording when it first came out, and I have been a fan of this show ever since. I saw it on Broadway with the original cast (except for Anthony Garber), and saw recently the revival with Patti Lupone and Michael Cerveris. In addition, I am a professional in the opera world, and of course am a fan of really excellent singing.All that being said, this is a movie i will go back and see again. And purchase when it comes out. I found it a breath-taking experience, in almost every way.For one thing, i was once again struck by the truly transcendent brilliance of the musical score. Whoever posted above that we needed Danny Elfman ought to have his head and ears examined...and I am a fan of Mr. Elfman. There is simply nothing in the history of American musical theater to compare with Sondheim's score of Sweeney Todd, in combination with Jonathon Tunick's astonishing orchestration. In fact, one of my biggest complaints was constantly hearing the orchestra figure which introduces the ""ballad of Sweeney Todd"" only to be denied the actual melody. Despite that, I was reminded what a true work of absolute genius this score is.As for the performances, I would say there isn't a truly false note in the bunch of them - even Johnny Depp, who I have always loved but thought unlikely for this role - with special kudos to Timothy Spall (a favorite from Topsy-Turvy), Ed Sanders (as Toby) as clearly the finest singer in the film, and my buddy Sasha whose phony Italian barber is beyond priceless.Thank you to Burton and Sondheim - you have created something together that is unique in my not inconsiderable experience of cinema, and I will be forever grateful.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Back to Hearn and Lansbury!,"It's always difficult to highly rate a movie which has been previously performed as wonderfully as the stage version starring Angela Lansbury and George Hearn.The set, lighting and cinematography were magnificent. The music? As expected from one of the greatest musical writers of our time  Steven Sondheim. But for me the direction was spasmodic, especially in the first part of the story. It felt as if the audience were rushed into the tale itself and certain scenes were too short and 'staged' to maintain momentum.Best performance came from Jamie Campbell Bower as the love torn sailor  showing enough emotion required for cinema. Timothy Spall did a great job as the slimy Beadle, as did Alan Rickman as the perverted Judge.It seems that Burton tried to dilute stage expressions to such a degree that they were non-existent, especially from Helena Bonham Carter in the opening scenes. She appeared to be there only for the pay cheque.The boy apprentice, Toby, was also under-directed during his songs, but otherwise did a good job.Although the film is entertaining and Depp is an acceptable Sweeney, the overall flow is slightly disjointed for newcomers to this tale. It became a film to watch, not to really be absorbed by.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nightmare During Christmas,"Tim Burton is officially the Master of Dark and Delightful. In his latest goth-fest Burton once again makes black seem brighter than ever. Adapted from the musical Broadway play, Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet street, is a pitch perfect early Christmas gift. Burton once again teams up with Depp (this is his 8th collaboration with the actor) and Burton also reunited Johnny with his Corpse Bride (Carter). I went into the film with a preconceived notion that once again Depp would be quirky and in another of his ""Look at how strange I am"" persona. I'm glad he didn't disappoint. He was nothing short of brilliant.The film, which complements the musical, grows on you. The first hour is spent understanding the despair and demise of a once passionate romance (for the city of London and for Todd). The second act is a tale of vengeance, bloodletting, and tragedy. All this is set to music that is done in an almost Operatic fashion. Most of the songs fill in the story and set the mood of the film. However there are several numbers that you wont easily get out of your head. To make matters worse these numbers are set to a stunning visual reference that will haunt you each time you hum about mince meat pies.Todd is also filled with an excellent supporting cast. From new faces (Jamie Bower, Laura Kelly) to unforgettable ones (Sacha Baron Cohen and Alan Rickman). I have had several friends state that Cohen is a one-hit-wonder. I have to say that I'm wondering how he hits every note just right in this role. His duel with Todd is like High Noon on a bad Mushroom trip.Todd being released during the Holidays won't be a gift for everyone. Even though it is garnering some Oscar buzz; Todd it is still a morbid, dark and skanky tragedy, with pie! So if you're a fan of Depp, or you love Broadway, or even if the latter two don't account for your movie dollar, go see this film. However if you you like your music and movies a-la fast food style: Alvin and the Chipmunks is still showing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Johnny Depp Show,"Welcome to the darkest and most morbid film of Tim Burton's career entitled Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Starring Academy Award nominee Johnny Depp in the title role as the revenge seeking barber, wrongfully imprisoned and looking to settle the score with the man who put him there, Judge Turpin played by Alan Rickman.A side not before even diving into the review of the film; DreamWorks and Warner Bros. marketing department should be commended. As I sat in the theater with a lot of Johnny Depp fans, I heard many people say, ""this is a musical?"" as soon as the opened with Jamie Campbell Bower singing. Even though the trailer does have Depp singing a few lines from his strong musical number ""Epiphany,"" I don't think youths grasped the concept entirely, ""oh wow, this is a musical."" The reason I say this, the young men that followed these young girls were grumbling the entire time as each line was being sang. Morons.Back to the review: As stated before, Burton has created his darkest film of his career with lots of grotesque images and even darker set decorations and mood settings. Depp is as great as can be as Mr. Todd bringing great characterizations not yet seen before by the actor and surprisingly, a very good voice. Even though Sweeney is the one who is wronged, he makes some choices that don't agree with the viewer. You're pulling for Sweeney and feeling the tragedy for the character even though, you know you shouldn't be. That is Depp's greatest achievement from the character.Helena Bonham Carter as the Baker, Mrs. Lovett is great in energy and poise and brings a much needed humanity and sensitivity to this morbid tale especially with her scenes with the young Toby played by Edward Sanders. However, her singing leaves much to be desired and its her singing scenes with Depp we love because of Depp being in them.Sacha Baron Cohen in his brief appearance is adequate but with wardrobe distractions (those who've seen it know what I'm talking about) its hard to focus solely on his speech. Alan Rickman plays his villainous role as great as we've seen him before but weary of past performances in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and Dogma. He is an actor yearning for awards consideration one day soon, but needing the right role to do it.The music as far as musicals go is fair, not the best of any I've seen but it does have some moments. The art direction, make-up and cinematography is the film's true beauty and the awards magnet that is needed. As far as the narrative goes, Johnny Depp is the man of the hour like anything else we've seen of him before.Grade: ***/****",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tim Burton is Back in Full Force,"Sweeney Todd returns to London years after his wife was taken from him and committed suicide. Now, with the help of macabre friend Mrs. Lovett, he will seek his revenge on all of London... but specifically the judge who stole his wife from him. At the same time, the judge has a new captive, who is the love interest of Todd's young comrade.I have had my doubts about Tim Burton in recent years. He was always amazing and had a good way to mix the dark, Gothic themes with wackiness. All through the 1980s and 90s he was unstoppable. Then, ""Planet of the Apes"" came out and was a knife through my heart. After this, he was hit and miss. ""Big Fish"" was great while ""Corpse Bride"" was bland. Now, with ""Sweeney Todd"", Burton finds his groove: the dark blossoms here under his command.If you don't like musicals, you won't like this film. There really isn't much dialog in the film at all. And if you don't like blood, you may not like this film, because there's plenty of it. And I have to give Burton credit for the use of computer animation here: the blood is very fake, as are several shots of the streets of London. But he presents them in a way where I feel he tried to make them look how they look, rather than presenting rubbish and calling it art. So I didn't mind.Johnny Depp shines, and this is a nice role for Alan Rickman. I think Sacha Baron Cohen was especially notable, being humorous but also coming across very professional. And the singing was quite good. I mean, it was actually quite good. And the songs were a good mix of Broadway and dark humor... much better than the same old point of view from ""Rent"".I recently watched a BBC production of ""Sweeney Todd"", and the differences are striking. The BBC had a darker, more nihilistic Todd, whereas this one was more vengeance oriented (and there was more of a love story). I like how they varied, and they co-exist nicely -- being so different, one is not ""better"" than the other, just a different angle. I strongly suggest both are watched by people who love the story.I don't see this being a film I would watch often, as it is a musical and one must be fairly involved to follow the story (at least for the first few viewings). But it is exceptional, and I think Burton was the right man for the job.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Works!,"Although critics have been unanimous in their praise, many fans of the show have been quite harsh, chiefly for two reasons  the principals are not great singers, and the deletion of roughly 50% of the score. I am in neither camp, although either of these factors might heretofore have caused me to pronounce most film adaptations of almost any Broadway musical a failure. Instead, I am thrilled beyond my expectations, but might not have been, had I not had so much respect for Stephen Sondheim, who says that he is satisfied with the film, and I have followed him long enough to know he would not give praise to this project if he were not satisfied. I have listened carefully to Mr. Sondheim in recent interviews, and now understand why so many stage musicals transferred to celluloid don't work. Time passes very differently in a theatre than it does on film. What takes several minutes in a Broadway theatre (a full-blown production number) is apt to seem like a small eternity on screen. Therefore, the very thing that keeps most live theatre audiences clamoring for more is apt to make many movie audiences run screaming from the auditorium. Also, in real life, no one ever bursts into song during one of life's dramatic moments, and many moviegoers who are accustomed to a certain amount of reality therefore find musical films particularly hard to take. Thanks to some of the theories voiced by Mr. Sondheim in the past week or so, I finally understand why so many film musicals fall flat - the theatre and film are two entirely different mediums, with two entirely different audiences. Many theatre lovers, me included, would be happy to sit through a musical transferred to screen exactly as done on stage, but most movie audiences wouldn't.Tim Burton has said that he has always been a fan of Sweeney Todd. As disappointing as it is for fans to accept how much of the score has been cut, it was probably even more agonizing for Mr. Burton to decide what to remove. The original ran over three hours, and at least 75% of the story was sung. The film runs only 117 minutes and, judging by the length of the soundtrack CD (72 minutes) easily 40% of the score has been removed, mostly the ensemble pieces. Mr. Burton apparently judged (probably correctly) that the choral numbers which worked so well on stage, and contained some of the wittiest lyrics, would be clunky and ponderous on film, and he made the difficult decision to let them go. This is likely to be the sorest point for many fans of the show. Had I not been paying careful attention to Mr. Sondheim's recent interviews, I may not have been able to get past that point myself.But what has been excised is compensated for in Mr. Burton's sumptuous visuals and attention to detail. Although Sondheim made subtle changes to the lyrics, actually improving it, it's amazing how much of what is left of the score is faithful to the original. Though it's a tragedy, Sweeney Todd remains in essence a dark comedy, and many of Mr. Burton's finer touches, especially the staging of the musical numbers, have enhanced the story to the point where I hardly miss the deletions, and I am someone who has loved this piece in most of its previous renderings.Although he has never been a particular favorite of mine, Johnny Depp is a revelation. Without detracting from previous interpreters of the role (especially Len Cariou and George Hearn), Mr. Depp's evocation of the character is so fully fleshed out, and so filled with genuine pathos and sympathy, that I was able to excuse the fact that he is not a seasoned vocalist. To reiterate, this is not Broadway, and there is no need for his voice to reach the back of the house. If anything, the fact that the principal characters are not great singers actually enhances the realistic feel of the film. It is also a pleasure to have Toby, Joanna and Anthony played by actors of the appropriate age, and hear accents that actually invoke pre-Victorian London.But the real star (to me, anyway) is the score by Stephen Sondheim. I am not amazed that some feel that there are no ""memorable songs"" in the score. Good music should be subtle; the absence of ""catchy tunes"" that one will whistle on the way out of the theatre is only indicative to me of the high quality of the score. Anyone who is previously unfamiliar with Sweeney Todd who doesn't ""get it"" is urged to purchase the soundtrack (the version with the complete libretto included) and follow the words as the songs are sung. The first thing you will realize is (as with any Sondheim's works, whether they be in a film or the theatre) how incredibly witty and sophisticated his lyrics are; on first listen you are apt to miss most of his delicious wit. His use of the language, his clever rhymes, and above all, his intelligent, deft semantics will amaze anyone who cares to take the time to listen. There are reasons why so many consider Sondheim the foremost composer of the theatre, and so many intelligent theatergoers hang on his every word. But just as important as his words (and I have always admired Sondheim's ability to use words above all else that I treasure in the world of musical theatre), you will find, if you listen long and hard enough, that his delicate, subtle music will work its way into your heart and conscience as some of the most beautiful music ever composed. This is NOT top-forty pop music, the type that is so often mistaken for excellence in theatre these days. Sondheim writes genuine, heartfelt, real music. Once you open your heart and mind to Sondheim's glorious words and sumptuous airs, you may just become a fan for life.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A tragic painting in music and shadows,"I saw this yesterday. I'm a HUGE fan of the stage musical. I was a little worried that the brilliant score would be shoved back for the shock effect of gore and outrageousness . Oh. My. God. I have never seen such a perfect translation of a stage musical to film. It flowed seamlessly. Every person was perfectly cast. It was a visual feast. It was stylized, keeping the ""melodrama"" aspect, but still managing to paint an emotional, poignant portrait of people so broken by circumstance that you know they cannot be fixed and yet you follow willingly into their insane world. I could have sat and watched it over again immediately. I will definitely be seeing it again, probably at least twice before it leaves the big screen. Hopefully your theater has state of the art sound, because every bit of this should be heard. If you are familiar with the musical, you do have to accept that The Ballad is there only musically, because it's purpose is as a device for theater, and, IMO also to in some ways alleviate the horror of the story. Here, you don't have that, nor do you need it. It's unapologetic in any way about the tale being told. But it is not unsympathetic, which is the brilliance of this musical in any form and I think heightened in the film. Unlike the stage play, the humor is not there to break the tension, but unfolds naturally to underscore the madness. If you can accept that this is a painting, of a tragic story, in music and shadows, you will be in for a real experience, not just a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One Bloody Gothic Fascinating Experience,"'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' is perhaps Burton's darkest movie to date. He masterfully combines two genres: musical and horror, with a tablespoon of humour and makes what is a grizzly and yet fascinating experience for the viewer. It clearly ranks as one of the finest musicals of all time. Shot beautifully, using washed out colours, Gothic art direction and dark lighting, London is portrayed as gloomy, sick and depressing but darker than that are its inhabitants. The film is high on violence but for me the most disturbing scene was the rape. It was rather suggestive than graphic but the idea of raping a woman and putting it on show in a party while the public cheer on left a more horrific feel. The songs are very amusing and the cast do quite a good job at it. Coming to the performances, now who better to play Sweeney Todd than Johnny Depp? Depp is transcendent and he defines Todd. With a cold quiet intensity, rage and vulnerability and a hunger for blinding revenge is all displayed to excellence by Mr. Depp. Even though many were not happy with her interpretation, Helena Bonham Carter too does a stupendous job. Alan Rickman is no stranger to evil characters but all of them pale in comparison to Judge. Sacha Baron Cohen and Timothy Spall do an equally convincing job. The only flip side for me was the Johanna-Anthony love story which could have done without so much screen time but this is more than made up for. 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' only proves that Burton is still one of the best directors today and 'Sweeney Todd' is the cinematic experience one wouldn't want to miss.",,Anonymous,Horror
Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's Darkest And Most Satisfying Outing,"I have been a fan of Tim Burton's for years and have just recently grown to admire Johnny Depp to the point of calling myself a fan of his too (not that I did not respect him before I just never paid him a lot of attention outside of Tim's work, and seeing the trailer for this film inspired me to explore his body of work a little deeper.), and for me to claim that this is their best outing ever is hard since I am such an Edward Scissorhands fan, but alas Sweeney is a cut above that, pun most certainly intended. The story of a barber, sent to prison on false charges and returning home to seek revenge is indeed an intriguing and dark one that suits both in a way that it's a wonder they hadn't done this before.Sweeney Todd is an enchanting piece of musical darkness that grabs you and pulls you in from the first moment until the last. Johnny Depp is as always the perfect choice and disappears into his role seamlessly. His singing voice is adequate, if not erring on the side of good, but it is more so his acting in the scenes that really conveys the emotions in the songs. What makes the movie so much more effective than a play in some ways is the way Burton can shoot the musical numbers and make them feel more personal and the actors can do more effectively in front of a camera. Johnny Depp and Tim both utilize this and it really gives the musical numbers something extra that some might feel is lacking without the powerhouse vocals.I will admit to being skeptical about Ms. Bonham Carter. Even after hearing a few of her song clips I was turned off, but she plays the role in a way that is tender, sweet, looney and endearing. I found the Lovett character annoyingly chipper in the stage version though I love Lansbury's portrayal. This Lovett is darker, and more longing than the other incarnations but there is something about her you connect with even though you can see how hopeless her desire for Sweeney's love is and how sick their twisted cannibalistic way of disposing of Sweeney's corpses (almost a mating dance for the two). Bonham Carter almost makes Lovett sympathetic while proving she's diabolical in the same way. Her singing is perhaps the weakest but she makes up for it in screen presence IMO.Rickman is diabolical as Judge Turpin and his singing is adequate though I think Johnny Depp's outshines his during Pretty Women (an enchanting number indeed) and Spall is delicious as the Beadle.The teen characters perhaps have the best singing voices, but they have little to do and you find you care very little about them, but this is not a weakness of the movie as I cared little about them during the play as well.Sacha Baron Cohen is a scene stealer for certain as the barber Pirelli and his singing voice is adequate. It was very refreshing to see him in a more subdued role.Edward Sanders was outstanding as Toby. His performance song wise and acting wise shows a lot of promise for a bright career in the future one can only hope.And Burton's direction is amazing, the sets are stunning and the make up all help to really enhance the film's tone and add to the film's dark humor as well. One would be humorless to not giggle at certain gags especially Lovett's ""By the Sea"" fantasy sequence.All in all Sweeney Todd is a complete musical adventure which will be pleasing to anyone with a wicked sense of humor and an appreciation for the uncannily beautiful.

"Burton, Cohen and Depp are firing on all cylinders!!!","Great TragedyI knew nothing about this movie except Tim Burton and Johnny Depp had something to do with it, I cant believe how many cylinders they fired at the movie, it was truly amazing and, as the director put it, there was ""lots of blood"". I felt my stomach drop when the movie started and there was a mention of Sacha Baron Cohen being in it. He Don's out the whole movie and his performance was in fact mesmerizing. Bruno is coming to theaters very soon so this was a tune up of things to come.Also I can't wait for Edward Scissorhand's 2 to come out. .......................",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Leave a bad taste in your mouth,"This is like ""Saw: The Musical"".Don't get me wrong -- I'm not squeamish. Murder + humor + music = fun for me.I'm a big fan of Sondheim's ""Sweeney Todd"" -- have seen 2 professional theatrical productions. Couldn't wait to see this movie.Started to chuckle at ""The Worst Pies in London"" (which is a very funny song) -- but the laughter dried up when we were shown close-ups of cockroaches. Lots and lots of cockroaches scampering across Mrs. Lovett's filthy countertop. Too realistic.Dark humor has to be done with a very deft hand. You can't show the murders too clearly. Yet Tim Burton shows us EVERY slit throat, arterial blood pumping and gushing all over the place. Then down the trapdoor it goes and SLAM! lands on its head. He shows this again and again and again....Well, nobody felt like laughing after that.Johnny Depp is gloomy and glowering throughout. Not a good showcase for him. If you love Johnny Depp -- well, go rent a ""Pirates"" movie instead.This is a very non-fun and depressing movie. And I think popcorn sales will be down.

My review of the movie adaptation of Sweeney Todd.  (From a long time Sweeney Fan Part),"They took out ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"". This is my first complaint about the movie adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney Todd  The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, directed by Tim Burton. Secondly, pretty boy Johnny Depp could not sing bass so they raised the key, talking away from the true majesty that comes with the deep, dark voice of Sweeney. Helena Bonham Carter, Who played Mrs. Lovette was no Angela Lansberry, by any means; and furthermore, to add to the insult of the tragedy that is this movie, they took out half of the funniest puns in ""Have a Little Priest""!Sweeney Todd is a Dark COMEDY; however in this adaptation, they took out most of the comedy. Mrs. Lovette's first song, which starts off saying, ""Wait! What's your rush? What's your hurry? You gave me such a fright, thought you was a ghost..."" was by far one of the greatest disappointments yet in this film. While Johnny's silent performance in this song was commendable, the execution of the song was not, by any means, as comical as it was intended to be in the play form. The actress lacked enthusiasm, charisma, and cleverness!To anyone who knows the musical Sweeney Todd, it is an indisputable fact that Mrs. Lovette is the comical relief of the show. She is the fun light hearted, yet twisted, entertaining character. She is the heart of Sweeney Todd. Without her in the show, Sweeney would just be to dark, and depressing. The performance, or the lack there of, by Helena Bonham Carter was just that, to dark and far to depressing. Instead of creating comical relief in the gloom of Sweeney's tragedy, she added to the miserable tone. Mrs. Lovette should be the meddling, gossiping, slightly insane, yet somehow lovable character that we all know and adore, even though it is well understood that she has several screws loose. She is the Ying to Sweeney's Yang.As far as Tobias goes, he was probably one of the best performers there. Though I may have a few quarrels with some of his facial expressions during the performance of his songs ""God that's Good"" and ""Mr. Pirelli's Miracle Elixir,"" his overall innocence (in appearance) and charm made up for any issues that come from being a young actor.For once, I have finally seen the love story between Johanna (Jayne Wisener) and Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) done correctly, even if they took out the song ""Kiss Me."" There was an innocence in Antony's love for Johanna that had been severely lacking in many stage adaptations I have seen.While the love story may have been done well, the sub plot of Antony and Johanna was under played. Not to mention, the fact that by taking out the song ""Kiss me"" it eliminated some of the empathy felt for Johanna. The song describes how she would rather die than marry her adoptive father Judge Turpin.Speaking of Judge Turpin. The casting of Alan Rickman was a splendid choice. Rickman Commanded any scene he was in and stole the show. His understanding of the character and execution of the role was astounding. Rickman is a truly amazing actor. He does not just play the role he owns it and becomes it. I could not have casted the role better my self. He was remarkable.The beggar woman was completely PG rated down. In the play she is a beggar, but also a prostitute. In the first scene with the sailer, she solicits her self to him in a very crude manner and Anthony tells her to get lost; however, in the movie, there was no such reference.I have a bone to pick with director Tim Burton. While the set and technical aspects of Sweeney Todd where amazing, some of the choices he made still baffle me. The elimination of the choirs was one of the biggest mistakes he could have possibly made. The creation of a narrative choirs helped explain what we may have missed in the songs, and also, shed light onto the ""hard times"" mentioned so often by Sweeney and Mrs. Lovette. London, England at this time in history was not all spic and span. Times were indeed hard, and the poor were many. Though, Tim Burton kept the music of the choirs in the movie, by eliminating the choirs' presence, he took away any explanation that was needed for the audience to have closer at the end of the movie. Not to mention the effect it had on songs such as: ""God That's Good.""Another choice that was painful to me as a lover of Sweeney Todd, was the fact that Sweeney built his own chair. By talking away the anxiousness of Sweeney awaiting his chair, it made the fact that he had listened to Mrs. Lovette and waited, a bit less obvious; not to mention the fact that it hurt the song ""God that's Good."" In the play Sweeney Todd, the song, ""God that's Good"" is the opening of Act II. The beginning and end of an Act are supposed to be the most moving and stimulating songs of a musical performance. The choices Tim Burton made in ""Have a Little Priest"" and ""God that's Good"" made it so the audience was left hanging, and not in a a good way. To all Sweeney lovers, the quote ""How 'bout royal marine... With or without his privates?..... With is extra."" was taken out, along with other puns which made the rip roar laughter of this song vanish.For the entire Review, go to http://www.myspace.com/theatrefreak4276 and look at the bog entitled ""My Review on Sweeney Todd- The Demon Barber of Fleet Street""",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tim Burton does it again!!,"Sweeney Todd has become another classic of Tim Burton's! Despite the blood and darkness that devours London, Tim Burton always has a way of turning movies into beautiful, magical and hilarious creations! If you enjoy how his movies, tap deep within your imagination then this movie is definitely worth watching! Every single character is absolutely amazing! Johnny Depp is simply wonderful and very sexy although his obsession with his razors keeps him astray of seeing the big picture. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen add so much light and humor to the story its almost hard not to laugh! Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall define the meaning of evil and every time you see them you cringe with anger! The musical aspect of the movie is wonderful, the songs are so beautiful and haunting they leave you singing right out of the movie theater! If you ever bump into Sweeney Todd, I would advise you to replace his razors with butter knives and whatever you do, Don't eat the meat pies!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A well-crafted though simple film,"Tim Burton provides us with another of his Gothic comedies, darker than most before and with a subtle humor that might pass you by if you're not listening carefully. Johnny Depp delivers a solid performance, though less lively than you might expect from his recent films. His role is simple, his mission clear and the life of the characters - and the movie, by extension - is in spite of Depp, rather than centered around him.Though perhaps only personal taste, I found the music to be fairly conventional and the lyrics bland. Despite a couple of notable exceptions, the characters are frequently singing about things that you've probably already worked out yourself, leading to a double-dipping of plot elements as you see an event happen only to be reminded again by the next musical number. It doesn't help anything that a few of the songs themselves are repeated in the film.The plot is simple, the characters morally extreme, and the events often coincidence-driven. If you're able to look past these elements, you'll find a dark and beautiful experience that will pull you into its black humor and bleak setting. That said, it stays well within the box Tim Burton has created for himself and probably won't win over many new fans.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely Terrific,"I saw and loved the original show. But what's done on a stage has to be rethought for the screen, and Burton and company have done so marvelously. On stage Sweeney and Mrs. Lovet have to stand front and center and sing with a force that will let the last row in the upper balcony hear every word. They don't have to do that here. Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett are in her shop and upper apartment conspiring with one another most delicately. The result is a singing horror movie. Easily puts all other recent musical films in the shade. It's the real Sondheim deal. And that means, among other things, it's a full press homage to the great Bernard Herrman. Be sure to see ""Hangover Square"" -- Sondheim' primary inspr iration -- after this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A generally par adaptation.,"I just saw Sweeney Todd, and seeing the message board, I realize that I could argue for hours about this movie. Most people seem to have loved it. I however, disagree. Though it was enjoyable, I don't think, for me, there's a version of Sweeney that couldn't be. I first saw the show at 11, and I fell in love. It is by far my favorite musical. Learning that Johnny Depp was the titular character wasn't even that disheartening. Today, I was very excited. I entered the theater with high expectations. I feel slightly cheated. I'll start from the beginning. The singing is superb. I especially love Johanna and Toby's voices. There were a few flaws (WHY OH WHY CAN'T JOHNNY SING DOWN THE OCTAVE?!?! AND WHY CAN'T HELENA USE HER CHEST VOICE?), I felt, all things considered, the voices were great. Next - casting. I felt that Johnny, though a given in almost any Burton film, just wasn't right. His pensive, pouty face was employed the vast majority of the movie, and someone needs to tell him that lowering your voice to a whisper and then randomly inserting ""Trekkie Monster""-esquire grunts does NOT equal instant drama. Next, Helena. Also a given, but i felt like she stole the show. She really, really was terrific. Antony, on the other hand, just was not built for the part. Wiry and bug-eyed, he did not fit the picture of a young sailor infatuate with love. Rickman, who I was looking forward to, proved to be frail and unconvincing (possibly brought on be the cut of ""Johanna""). The beadle was just right (though his singing could have been improved). Toby and Johanna, as previously stated, were terrific. And Sacha, fittingly dressed up like Princess Leia with a codpiece, was perfect. Burton, I felt, was not the right director. I simply hated the stylism. The blood looked like paint, not effective, more laughable. Many directorial choices were rather ridiculous. The fast motion pans of London early in the film looked exactly like an interactive DVD menu. Besides those main points, the set and costumes, makeup and hair added to the feel. Though it seems like I don't offer very much criticism, the amount I did give was important. Directing and main characters need to be perfect for me to enjoy a film. And though Sweeney, one of the hardest characters to master, can often be accepted as the way Depp portrayed him, I was expecting more. The black humor seemed a bit more fan service then actually clever. My final word: though impressed, I was disappointed that it turned into a Burton/Depp movie instead of what it was meant to be, a Sweeney movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The cleanest shave you'll ever know,"This is the third musical by Burton I've seen, and I've thoroughly enjoyed all three. This is the first live-action(I shall leave you in suspense no longer: the other two are The Nightmare Before Christmas(granted, he didn't direct it, but still) and The Corpse Bride(which may be the only other two musicals he's done) of his I've seen, and it's by far the best(but all three are of high quality, and very much worth watching). The themes are interesting and there is food for thought(meanwhile, you may not want to eat close to your viewing of this, in fact, you probably shouldn't). The plot is well-written and well-told. I'm not usually up for musicals, and had Tim's name not been attached to this, I doubt I would have granted it a second glance. I cannot deny that this was spectacular. The trademarks, his style, are very much present: the Gothic visuals, the stylized and at times comical violence, the grotesque, the macabre, and so forth. There is little, if any, gore, but there are bucket-loads of blood... it is too red and doesn't come off as horrifying as that of other films(this would appear to be entirely intentional). The pacing is marvelous. The acting is flawless, as is the singing... in both cases, the performances are quite simply excellent for every actor-singer. The characters are fleshed out expertly. The songs are well-written, and composed well. The cinematography and effects are magnificent, and the editing is as sharp and effective as one of Todd's razors. As the FAQ suggests, pay attention to the lyrics, not only will you miss out on delightful word-play, but important, perhaps crucial, details will also evade your attention if you do not. The humor is black, at times pitch black, and any potential viewer should consider if they can take all the contents. There's no actual sexuality, but some is implied. Language is not pervasive, and what little there is really isn't as strong as it easily could be. I recommend this to any fan of Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and possibly of the play(I haven't watched it, but hey, the composer of it not only was involved with this, he's since said that he likes the movie, a lot, even). 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A gorgeous and cold monster's story,"Before I start writing about this film, I have to admit that I have a bias against musicals. Granted, this doesn't include all musicals and there are plenty that has slipped past my bias. I suppose the musicals that I have the greatest issues with are the ones that hold most dearly to the comedy offshoot tradition, including a number of classics.That said, I have no problem with Sweeney Todd as a musical. The musical element isn't actually very compelling as I don't remember a single song from the show. What I do remember is the story and the visuals. First of all, this is clearly an excellent piece for Tim Burton to helm as his odd dark way of seeing things melts very well with the wicked version of London present in Sweeney Todd. From the very opening of the film, you know that you're in for a grisly tale.Burton doesn't pull any punches and almost matter-of-factly treats the series of murders that occur with gross detail. Not a pleasant sight, but certainly in line with the spirit o the work. If you've seen previous Burton works, you'll immediately recognize the almost-Gothic tone that all of his works contain. In terms of production, the film is spectacularly lensed, marvelous in its grotesqueness. The acting and casting are right on the spot.The story is rather simple, a man, falsely accused and sent away for a decade and a half by a lecherous judge returns and exacts his revenge. He was a barber before and now he's a barber again, but he does a little more bloodletting than he used to in the past. He's aided by a woman who sells the worst meat pies in London. And there's a side story about Todd's daughter and a sailor who loves her (and also happened to have rescued Todd at sea).Broken down, this is a tale that focuses on how obsession with revenge leads to tragic consequences as well as a narrow field of vision where mistakes can be make. On top of the emptiness of the act. In some ways, it's similar to Park Chan-Wook's revenge trilogy, being visually stunning and focused on the problems of revenge.I suppose, I have to admit, the mystery elements are telegraphed a little too early (if you want enough mysteries and revenge films), but I suppose it would remain well obfuscated for those less experienced with such genres. Although, I'm aware that the blood and guts are part of the story, I was very discomforted by the quantity of up-close dissections witnessed, but this is appropriate to its new medium.One quibble that I had with the film was in no way its fault. For parts of the show, I kept having flashbacks to Kevin Smith's less than spectacular Jersey Girl, as the musical also appears in that film. And trust me, you don't want Jersey Girl in your head when you're watching another film. The other quibble that is a little more serious for me, is that it was very difficult for me to sympathize with Benjamin Barker. The only points where we see him as human is the little wistful moment at the beginning of the film that sets up his revenge and then at the end of the film when he realizes the cost of his obsession. Unfortunately, with so little humanizing, I could only see him as a monster and found myself unable to root for him. And since I couldn't sympathize with the central character, I found myself rather detached from the work and thus more aware of how the film was made. The spell failed to cast on me.Ultimately, that weakness really threw the experience for me. As such, it's an extremely potent vision realized with all the powers of artistry, but for me, even a human monster's tale needs to connect with the human part of us. Failing this for me leaves Sweeney Todd a gorgeous but distant work. One that I admire but cannot love. It's good though and you might likely enjoy it more than me, if you can take all the blood, guts, revenge and violence. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Powerful Combination of Sondheim and Burton Makes the Demon Barber Come to Bloody Life,"It's been nearly thirty years since a Stephen Sondheim musical has been translated from Broadway to the big screen (the last time was 1978's dismal ""A Little Night Music"" starring Elizabeth Taylor), and judging from the previews of this dark 2007 musical, the producers don't seem very anxious to publicize the fact that most of this film is sung in verse. That's too bad because it's really Sondheim's evocative and powerfully haunting music that drives and ironically humanizes the chilling storyline. It also helps to have director Tim Burton's visionary talent guiding this audacious venture since the horrific and heartrending subject matter ideally suits his idiosyncratic film-making style. I was fortunate enough to see the original 1979 Broadway production with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury, and screenwriter John Logan does an admirable job of streamlining the original musical to the core story of Sweeney's relentless vengeance.Sondheim-loving purists may balk at the fact that certain characters are gone in the screen version, as well as several songs with some of the remaining score switched around from one character's voice to another to serve distinctly different purposes in the story. It's also true that Burton does not hold back on what is an uncompromising gore-fest, but luckily, he doesn't dwell on the barber's bloody acts. Instead, he fixates on establishing the moody, nearly colorless atmosphere of nineteenth-century London and how the key characters become entrenched in the pervasive grayness of an urban purgatory from which no one can escape. All the production values on display are top-notch with stellar work from cinematographer Dariusz Wolski (all three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films), production designer Dante Ferretti (""Gangs of New York"") and costume designer Colleen Atwood (""Memoirs of a Geisha""). The technical virtues of this production are undeniable even if it does become somewhat wearing to experience the constant dankness.Burton did not venture far in casting the leads since his frequent leading man Johnny Depp plays the title role and the director's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter is the smitten Mrs. Lovett. Both make their roles work within the contours of their recognizable screen personas. Depp lends his almost feline-like brand of menace to a role more often played by more robust, operatic-style actor-singers a decade or so older, while Carter eschews Lansbury's comically buffoonish performance for a more sinewy, cynical approach. Their singing may lack range and nuance, prerequisites for mastering Sondheim's complex lyrics, but they perform with vigor and certainly within character. Alan Rickman is his usual villainous self as Judge Turpin, whose act of jealousy provides the impetus for the blood-soaked plot; and in genuine callow fashion, Jamie Campbell Bower plays the aptly named sailor, Anthony Hope, the devoted suitor of Johanna, Sweeney's long-lost daughter now Turpin's ward. Orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick, the soundtrack does not suffer for the marginality of the star voices, as he brings the full potency and epic grandeur of Sondheim's music to the fore.Several of the musical numbers are quite effective. There is ""Pirelli's Miracle Elixir"", which introduces Sweeney's preening competitor, Adolfo Pirelli (a nice bravura turn by Borat himself, Sacha Baron Cohen), at a medicine sideshow accompanied by a gin-loving orphan named Toby (affectingly played by Ed Sanders), who becomes intractably involved with Sweeney's and Mrs. Lovett's affairs. Bower sings the ballad, ""Johanna"", with proper yearning as the purity of his intentions is contrasted sharply with Sweeney's murderous deeds. Depp gets his moment in the sun with ""Epiphany"", in which he spells out the inevitably tragic fate of London under his switchblade, and he duets with a tentative Rickman on the haunting ""Pretty Women"". My favorite ballad from the show, ""Not While I'm Around"", has been turned into a lullaby Mrs. Lovett sings to Toby, and while Carter sings with conviction, she is actually at her best on the lighter numbers like the self-effacing ""The Worst Pies in London"", the deceptively coy ""A Little Priest"", and the sunny ""By the Sea"", which cues the film's only splash of life-affirming color. But above all else, this film is a triumph of Sondheim's musical genius and Burton's craftsmanship.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A true master piece,"I would have to say that this is by far one of the best movies of 2007. Being that I am both a Johnny Depp and a Time Burton fan I was predisposed to liking it, but I have to say that this film will please even the harshest of critics. To start the cast was wonderful. Although many of them were not trained in singing (although some were) they do an amazing job with one of the toughest scores on Broadway. Their voices may not be the best out there but the flavor that they bring to an already wonderful score is wonderful. Both Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter bring new life to character that have been portrayed so differently in the stage version. The art direction and costumes in this film were well worth the academy awards nominations and wins. The costumes are so beautifully done that they capture the essence of the character while still remaining true to the time period. The set and art direction bring you into a world you could never imagine. The dreary colors show the true emotion of the story and the set allows you to feel as if you are sitting there with the characters and you were part of the story If you are a fan of the Broadway musical and are looking to capture what has been portrayed on stage you may want to rethink your approach to this musical. It is not a duplicate of what has been done on stage. It is a whole new vision that should be appreciated for its uniqueness. Props to Tim Burton and the entire cast and crew of this film. You did a wonderful job at taking something already wonderful and making it that much better!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Shaved Fish,"I guess I am glad that Tim Burton is alive and making films if only to keep Depp working and encourage him to take chances. I think it is even worth a ticket from time to time to watch the old boy do something weird that isn't intended as a joke. But Burton's work as a whole seems to be in a rut. He knows how to appear to take chances without actually doing so.This time, we have large singing instead of small. Operatic blood instead of human-sized. Long shots instead of simple frames.I may skip the next couple. Email me to tell me if Depp gets interesting again.For me, all the cinematic effects, though large, are tired and ordinary. All the songs big empty balloons. What fascinates me is the love story between Burton and one of the most interesting women in film: Helena. She's earned a place in my imagination just on ""Wings"" and ""Fight,"" possibly ""Novocaine."" She matters as a template now and probably will for generations.Its why it is so interesting the way we have her now: written in, made up and photographed by a man who plainly loves her as deeply as he knows  and shares that with us because the deepest he knows is how to make her real on screen. Its not just a love story we peer into, its one we participate in.Hey, I guess I've talked myself into watching the next Burton project, huh?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody Brilliant,"A stellar ensemble delivers a cinematic delight as Director Tim Burton delivers his trademark unique twists to this traditional tale. The dark cinematography, and cartoon like CGI, creates a wonderfully chaotic, and grim 19th Century London. The music and lyrics are the work of veteran songs smith Stephen Sondheim, in a production where a significant part of the plot is sung through, which may put some people off. However I found it a joy to have a high quality musical score underwriting a good story, well told.Johnny Depp plays the eponymous role and is fast becoming the leading actor of his generation. His London accent is quite good, if alarmingly close to that of Jack Sparrow, from Pirates of the Caribbean. His charming, but deranged Barber is a wonderful creation, which he has much fun with. His Mistress is played by a sleazily over the top Helena Bonham-Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen has a marvellous cameo as a cod-Italian travelling snake oil salesman. Judge Turpin, the ""baddie"" is inevitably played by Alan Rickman who excels in a small role, ably assisted by the portly Timothy Spall, his sidekick.Essentially a Musical Horror film, Burton revels in the blood drenched plot with plenty of humorous visual gags to assuage the slaughter which unfold before us. The macabre and gory detail might be too much in less experienced hands but the artificial dreamlike quality of the Cinematography steers the audience away from the verite which if portrayed in a realistic setting would have been very uncomfortable.A fine effort from one of the most original and imaginative Directors working today.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the darkest comedies out there, you will find yourself laughing hysterically, hiding your face in your hands. cringing at the bloodshed (body count is, i believe, 26 or something like that) and crying for the emotional depth this film attempts and succeeds in digging. This film dares to go where very few others have gone, and it was absolutely stunning! On top of that Depp and Carter's performances were stellar (as is per) and could sing pretty well.

A perfect marriage of cinematic creative team and source material,"The film is one of the greatest recent examples of a perfect marriage of cinematic creative team and source material. It is only fitting that Stephen Sondheim's dark, macabre, horrific musical be adapted to the screen by none other than Tim Burton, who if anything excels at the dark and the macabre. Although Burton's greatest cinematic preamble to Sweeney Todd is his equally dark and nearly equally gory Sleepy Hollow, incidentally also starring Johnny Depp, with its de-saturated colour palette and gloomy, shadowy, other-worldly atmosphere; the fact is that most of Burton's work belongs to a more childish, fantastical type of macabre. Most of his movies are rated PG, and although claiming to be a stranger to the genre, it's important to notice that some of these films also contain musical numbers. Although not directed by him, The Nightmare Before Christmas was a full-fledged musical, and the same goes for the similarly stop-animated Corpse Bride, this time directed by Burton himself. Even his Charlie and the Chocolate Factory contained a few musical numbers in the form of the Oompa Loompa songs, but one can truly look at Sweeney Todd as a confluence of many of Burton's previous themes and subjects, coming out in full force with guns blazing.At the center of the film is Stephen Sondheim's musical work, which is so intensely complex and fantastically intricate it's even more of a wonder that it all works so well. Indeed, considering the immense complexity along with the dark, serious nature of the story and the ultimate tragedy of the tale, one can liken Sondheim's work far less to the classic Broadway musical revue and more to a full-fledged modern opera. With songs featuring multiple characters singing and overlapping one another only to occasionally synchronize to incredibly complicated note transitions, recurring themes, lines and elements throughout the entire work, recurring and winding sets of rhymes and rhythms, it is indeed an epic, complicated, majestically elaborate work that deserves credit on its own. And while Sondheim's full, 3-hour musical is more than worth a viewing (or at least a listen) in order to appreciate the beauty and complexity of the entire work, Burton's film adaptation adequately and delicately condenses the musical to make it work more as a film and less as a stage show and retains the complexity and beauty of the original musical work.But this is also a Tim Burton film, and that also carries a series of characteristics and complexities unique to the director. Burton is indeed a wonder, a perfect example of a modern-day director who didn't break onto the scene through independent film but rather through the traditional studio system with which he has always managed to work with and prosper in. Burton's signature dark, macabre style comes in full force in the film in which sunlight is rarely glimpsed and the scenes are almost always drenched in a gray, de-saturated, colour-less palette  except when doused with the occasional blood splatter. Also in step with his previous works, the film retains an unreal, fantastical, otherworldly feeling to it. It is a highly stylized, darker, fantastical twist on our real-world reality, as much of Burton's films are. Frequent Burton collaborator and costume designer Colleen Atwood, along with extremely talented production designer Dante Ferretti and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski do their utmost best to evoke the dark, macabre atmosphere the film revels in. The fantasy genre is almost cheating when it comes to costume and production design, because quite literally everything goes, but I'm sure those who work in the field get the most pleasure out of projects like Sweeney Todd in which their creative minds can truly go wild and create wondrous works evoking fantastical emotions. What's for sure is that like Wes Anderson, Tim Burton's films are unmistakable and instantly recognizable based on his unique visual style alone.It is a wondrous and fulfilling experience to have your expectations met, and even exceeded. Everything was going for this film and it certainly didn't disappoint. A more than fitting addition to the Tim Burton canon, it is, on its own, a beautiful and exciting film; dramatically rewarding with its overtures of false imprisonment, evil, revenge and tragedy; its amazingly complex, operatic musical score and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim; top-notch performances from Burton's major players and a superb visual style and production value. Fans of the musical genre will rejoice to see such serious, dark, menacing subject matter getting the revue treatment  though the film knows just when to pepper itself with sly, appropriately black humour  and while those who dislike the genre may find the film's almost entirely-sung dialogue difficult to ignore, they may still find more than enough to enjoy in what is one of the most satisfying events of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The best translation of a Broadway musical to film, ever","The best translation of a Broadway musical to film, ever The film differs on many points from the brilliant original stage version--most noticeably the absences of choral numbers and the running metatheatrical commentaries of the Ballad of Sweeney Todd. Yet the film perfectly captures the spirit of Sondhiem's ferocious masterpiece and presents it in a film, not a filmed play. Tim Burton weaves together the music and an equally expressive visual style to create the film of his career. From the devilish opening credits to the final image, the film astounds, entrances, mortifies, and entertains like nothing else that has hit the screens in a very long time. Yes, it is graphically gruesome. When Sweeney dispatches his victims, we clearly see their instant transformation into meat. What happens after the razor frequently is more disturbing than the juicy slice. The film also contains a chilling undercurrent of violence directed at children. The younger characters in this film, Johanna, Antony, and especially Toby, are played by very young actors--in fact, Toby is just a child (which adds historical accuracy and unnerving queasiness to his character).Sounds pretty grim. But the film is a spectacular entertainment. It's wickedly funny, visually breathtaking, and filled with excellent performances by every single actor who appears on screen. Everyone, not just Depp (who gives the performance of his life with his eyes in one moment, when he asks ""How about a shave?"") soars in this effort.This has been a great year for film. Eastern Promises, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, Gone Baby Gone, The Assassination of Jesse James . . ., Michael Clayton, and American Gangster all share a place beside The Departed as great films. But this twisted, bloody meditation on the consuming nature of revenge goes up there with the best of the best.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Thankfully Not Interchangeable With a Theater Production and Distinctly Cinematic, Atmospheric and Voyeuristic","At this point, I feel Tim Burton has redeemed himself after Sleepy Hollow, Planet of the Apes, Big Fish, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It's certainly his best movie by far in almost a decade. It has a spectacle-centeredness that is better tamed in this Burton film than his last few. And that's because it does something very surprisingly rare in movies, which is deliver truly, deeply, savagely satisfying revenge. Seeing the film being my first time experiencing the story of Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber, the film's story is a very pleasant surprise. Most bloody revenge films are anemic when it comes to the pay-off, like Carrie or The Prestige for instance. Burton does not disappoint in his handling of this material. Sweeney Todd gruesomely goes for broke. It does not hold back on the bloodletting. The blood's theatrical color in giallo style has an excitingly insatiable effect.Being an adaptation of a Broadway musical, it thankfully doesn't detach me with the expected light and prancy demeanor. Its tone is very gritty, it's historical London atmosphere a masterpiece of art direction, and it does with an adaptation what I think is truly effective, which is stand on its own without the source material by making it inextricably cinematic. Dante Ferretti's Victorian London is, like his L.A. in De Palma's The Black Dahlia, a city of the consciousness, space tinted by disfigured perceptions. The musical numbers are very tightly directed, a lot of them very voyeuristic in a way that a stage production could not be.Johnny Depp's performance is a very convincing one, further severing the tendency for Burton's films to have a detachment that makes them less compelling and more forgettable. He oozes dominance, a more imposing Depp than what we normally see him do. Alan Rickman matches his emboldening presence with another intriguingly infuriating villain.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Burton's Sweeney Todd with Depp is an excellent adaptation indeed,"A few years ago, I watched on VHS the television version of the Broadway musical Sweeney Todd with Angela Lansbury and the Emmy-winning performance of George Hearn. I enjoyed it very much so I was psyched to see the movie version starring Johnny Depp and directed by Tim Burton. Despite, or maybe because of the deletion of many of the chorus segments, I thought this was an excellent version of the bloody Stephen Sondheim horror musical. Depp brings a David Bowie-quality to his singing in the title role. Helena Bonham Carter brings a creepily romantic vibe in her role of Mrs. Lovett, Todd's accomplice. Alan Rickman brings a crafty charisma to Judge Turpin. Timothy Spall, who I had just seen in Enchanted, brings a droll goofiness as Beadle Bamford. And Sacha Baron Cohen makes a humorously insolent Signor Adolfo Pirelli. Also compelling are Jamie Campbell Bower as the sailor who accompanies Todd back to England, Jayne Wisener as Todd's grown daughter-Johanna-who Anthony the sailor is smitten with and she in return, Laura Michelle Kelly as a beggar woman with a secret, and Ed Sanders as Toby-Pirelli's and, eventually, Mrs. Lovett's boy servant. Most of them provide compelling singing voices. Kudos to the Golden Globes for awarding the Best Actor-Comedy or Musical-statue to Mr. Depp (too bad, because of the writer's strike, he couldn't accept it in person). And congratulations to Mr. Burton for providing such an excellent movie of this most entertaining Stephen Sondheim horror musical.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Bloody Marvelous!,"When I went into Sweeney Todd this evening I admit I expected it to be brilliant, I adore every single Tim Burton movie, yes and I do mean every single one in their own way. Burton is a very acquired taste in my eyes, you either love or loathe his movies. In fact I am the only member of my family who love Burton movies, my mum actually made me turn Mars Attacks off because she despised it so much. I on the over hand will lap any Burton movie up, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Corpse Bride, I love them all. So I went in today, sat down and prepared to be amazed. And I came out of that cinema more than amazed, I was practically in love with the movie. I am a huge Burton fan, but this might just well be his very best work to date! Sweeney Todd is just amazing, the music, the performances, the storyline, the ending, oh they are all so wonderful. I think I have already seen the best movie of 2008! However despite this being a Burton movie through and through, if you despise his movies this isn't for you, the movie is also surprisingly dark for him. In fact its quite easily Burton's darkest film to date. Johnny Depp excels in this movie and Bonham Carter is a true joy to watch. The movies songs are also amazing, while none of them are happy and foot tapping like they were in Hairspray, they are superb to listen to and each and every one is memorable.Tim Burton's favourite actor and actress both appear in this movie as the leads, Johnny Depp being the infamous demon barber, and Helena Bonham Carter as equally as infamous Mrs Lovett. Johnny Depp recently won a Golden Globe for his performance, and in my most humble opinion I think he should take the Oscar as well. Sure he was superb as Captain Jack Sparrow, but in this movie he possesses such emotions, such a great voice and such a complex character that he really does a better performance in this movie. When he sings ""My Friends"" that's when I truly appreciated his performance. Bonham Carter also delivered her very best performance in this movie. I've started to find her a bit overused in Burton movies, I mean what was the point in her being cast in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? However in this film she is spectacular. Sure her singing voice isn't the best, it seemed oddly high in ""Worst Pies in London"", but she does deliver in terms of emotion. Her scenes later in the film are simply put amazing, and she like Depp deserves an Oscar as well. Alan Rickman is on fine form as the villainous Judge, its a shame he is underused, but there are a few scenes where he is amazing. Sacha Baron Cohen makes an amusing appearance as a rival barber, a shame he too underused. But the biggest surprise comes courtesy of Ed Sanders playing the young boy, Toby. I cannot spoil the character for you as he is important, but the performance from the boy is simply stunning.A lot of the reviews for the movie I have read have claimed that Sweeney Todd is a surprisingly violent film. Well obviously it was going to be a bit violent, the whole meat pies scenario hardly meant the film would be good for the squeamish. But its nowhere near as violent as people have made it out to be, the neck slicing isn't too bad, its only when the bodies go down the trap door I found a couple of moments a bit nasty. Anyway this movie is not about the violence at all, anyone who went to see this for their gore dosage deserves to be shot. This is a musical, in fact about 80% of the film is singing, and you know what I wouldn't want it any other way. Every song is amazing. By the Sea, My Friends, A Little Priest, they're all just so perfect. And the score itself is brilliantly grand and suits the movie superbly. When the organ kicked in when the Warner Brothers sign popped up I knew the score was going to be one of the best in a Burton movie for a long while. The movie also has a killer ending with a twist I actually didn't see coming, I knew nothing about the movie before hand and so wasn't even expecting a twist! Anyway the ending is pitch perfect and had me gripped. Even my Burton hating friend I saw this with fell in love with the movie just because of the ending. The movie also succeeds because despite its darkness, the film is also quite funny. Mrs Lovett has some great lines, and Depp reactions in By the Sea are priceless to watch. While this is extremely dark and hardly for the little kiddies, I guarantee you will still smile in the movie.Sweeney Todd is a true masterpiece of cinema that I actually don't expect to be topped this year. It's the best musical I have ever seen and features such stunning songs and performances it left me speechless. Go and see this movie as soon as possible, you will not regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly good but I had some problems with this movie.,"First of all I love Tim Burton and the dark style he always manages to put in his movies but I feel that he somewhat overdid it this time, which perhaps is not as much Burton's fault but more the story's.For me the main problem with this movie was its story and then particularly its characters. There just is no good character within this movie. All of the characters are evil in a way. Sweeney Todd is supposed to be the main 'hero' but he isn't much of a likable character, since he's a person who slices innocent people's throats. There isn't really a person to sympathize for within this movie. It's like you're watching all bad people, which in a way also somewhat makes this a depressing movie to watch. I know this certain darkness suits Tim Burton well and is part of his trademark style but I just feel he overdid it this time and it doesn't work out as well as it does in most of his other movies.He perhaps also overdid things with the movie its visuals. The movie is so stylish and done mostly in gray and black & white tints that the movie looks fake at times, as if it came straight out of a computer. The fairytale like feeling and dark Gothic atmosphere Tim Burton is so well known for is mostly missing within this movie and perhaps Burton too much tried to make this movie like an old horror movie from the black & white era. Also some of the computer effects within this movie feel pointless, mostly because of the reason that they look like they come straight out of playstation game cut scene. It's pointless and it doesn't add anything to the movie. It instead only lets the movie look even more artificial and fake then it already does.Nevertheless the movie turned out to be in a way also better than expected really. I mean a dark violent musical? Sounds like a real odd and bad thing on paper but it's a movie that works out surprisingly well and knows to combine it's violence, images and musical moments nicely, even though I wasn't that impressed by its musical moments and not a too big fan of the movie its visuals. The story did worked out well and surprisingly, despite of its earlier mentioned flaw of not really featuring any likable characters.I must also say that out of all the Tim Burton and Johnny Depp collaborations, this is probably the least. Why? Because Johnny Depp doesn't really feel like Johnny Depp in this movie. Perhaps it's because of the style of the movie or all of the make-up he has to act underneath but there are only a handful of great Johnny Depp moments within the movie. It's as if most of the time he is restrained, which is probably also due to the fact that he has a lot of singing to do in this movie. Sacha Baron Cohen on the other hand was really great and perfectly cast. In a way he plays more of Johnny Depp type of role than Jonny Depp played within this movie. Cohen's role is quite small though but nevertheless memorable and entertaining. Alan Rickman is also fine and so is Tim Burton's girlfriend Helena Bonham Carter, who always perfectly fits into his movies and style in particular.So, it's a movie that works out surprising well and I can also recommend it but this doesn't take away I had some problems with the movie its style and main characters.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A great film, but know what you are getting into","I just saw this last night on a bit of a whim and I am glad that I did. As someone who has never seen the musical, this movie has inspired me to want to go and see it. I am listening to the soundtrack right now. However I should point out that for those whose only experience with Depp is Pirates of the Caribbean, this might not be for you. It contains a lot of animated, exaggerated blood (kill bill levels). And while there are parts that are laughable, it is a serious movie. This is by far one of the best movies of the year, however it's hard to compare to something like American Gangster or No Country for Old Men since Sweeney Todd is such a unique flavor. If you enjoyed Depps earlier work, or enjoy grim stories with fascinating characters, or even if you enjoy musicals and have an open mind, you should go see this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"How would you like your throat cut, sir?","The films of Tim Burton are always a gift from the heavens (the mediocre ""Planet of the Apes"" being the one notable exception), especially for horror fanatics, since they always strike a happy medium between mainstream production values and availability and yet always revolve on sinister topics. And if there ever was one story that literally begs to receive the typical Burton-treatment, it has got to be ""Sweeney Todd"". The gloomy Victorian setting, the continuous moody atmosphere, the depressing decors, the mentally tormented main characters and the unhinged depiction of shocking murders  all these aspects simply have Burton's name written all over them. Sure it's a musical, and this generally isn't considered to be die-hard horror fanatics' favorite genre, but even the smallest detail featuring in ""Sweeney Todd"" makes it damn clear the movie is primarily a genuine horror effort, and even one that is more revolting and macabre than most. Benjamin Barker once lived a life of true happiness. He was married to a beautiful woman with whom he had a cherubic baby girl and he was the most promising young barber in the whole of London. But then the malicious eminent Judge Tulpin spotted his wife and promptly ruined his whole existence. Barker got exiled and Tulpin literally claimed ownership of both his wife and daughter. Now, 15 long years later, Barker returns as a thoroughly embittered person going by the name Sweeney Todd and with only vengeance on his mind, particularly when he learns that his beloved wife poisoned herself and his daughter still lives imprisoned in Tulpin's house. Sweeney forms a diabolical alliance with the eccentric Mrs. Lovett. He cuts the throats of unsuspecting clients and she processes the bodies into meat pies unique in the whole of London. Naturally his rising stardom fetches the attention of Judge Tulpin and soon Sweeney Todd will be able to extract his long-anticipated blood vengeance, but in the meantime a whole lot of new complications arise. ""Sweeney Todd"" is a truly masterful accomplishment and I don't mind admitting I stared at the screen with my eyes, ears and mouth wide open throughout the entire playtime. I'm usually not a big fan of constant singing myself, but it never once bothered me here because the lyrics of the songs are as grim & disturbing as the plot itself and, moreover, the film is just breath taking to look at. I just found out ""Sweeney Todd"" won the Oscar for best art direction. This has got one of the best well-deserved awards ever handed out during this ceremony, as Burton's movie is almost like a Gothic nightmare coming to life on the big screen. The London streets and alleys never looked so ominous, the people never looked so uncanny and the political corruptness rarely appeared so convincing. Admittedly it takes a while before the blood starts flooding from random throats, but until then there's always the nightmarish atmosphere to keep you thrilled and, besides, the gore-soaked second half widely compensates for everything. The way those bodies came crashing down hard in Mrs.Lovett's cellar after having their throats slit wide open from ear to ear.... that's a real horror film, singing or no singing! The acting performances are flawless and perplexing, even though nobody really expected them to be. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are regular Tim Burton choices, but not at all obvious musical stars, even in spite of their semi-musical roles in ""Corpse Bride"". But still they both leave a big impression and also the (even less obvious) supportive players deliver stellar performances as well. A masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A bloody great Gothic musical,"Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have made many films together, some good and some bad. Sweeney Todd is definitely one of their better collaborations.Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is the story of Benjamin Barker, also known as Sweeney Todd, who sets up a barber shop to get revenge on Judge Turpin.Apart from La La Land, musicals aren't really my thing but I was pleasantly surprised with Sweeney Todd. I think the film's biggest strengths are the songs and performances. It never came to my head seeing Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter sing before but they actually did a great job. There are many songs in the film and they're all well done. Not only are they catchy but if you actually listen closely to the lyrics then you may spot hidden details about some of the characters to help you get a better understanding of them. Alan Rickman gave a great performance as the antagonist and was able to sing surprisingly well.I've known Tim Burton for making kid friendly films but Sweeney Todd is definitely the most violent one yet. However, the film is pretty dramatic hence why the violence looks more cartoonish than realistic. Apart from the serious tone it maintains, there is a fair amount of comedy involved. Much of the comedy comes from Sacha Baron Cohen who delivers an excellent performance once again. His accent and expressions made his character so much fun to watch. The film looks very beautiful overall. It has very dark and dreary look to it which brought a Gothic atmosphere to its world that felt suitable for its characters and the tone it was going for. Some of the computer animated sequences don't look that great but apart from that, this is one of Burton's most gorgeous looking films.Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was a solid musical. With great performances from all the actors, the catchy songs and amazing production design, I think this is one of Tim Burton's best works.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Burton's Todd gets a vat of venom, and deserves it.","It would have been nice had Tim Burton produced a ""Sweeney Todd"" that did a certain amount of justice to Steven Sondheim's masterwork. Unfortunately, what Sondheim wrote and Burton put out bear only the most casual resemblance to each other  namely, they have a lot of the same words and much of the same music  assuming that you prefer Shakespeare's witches acting like Wagner's norns (Anna Russell: ""this dreary set of women""), or prefer Beethoven's 5th taken at the tempo of Chopin's funeral march. Blech!It should be noted that there are already available 2 other versions of this opera (yes, I know it has spoken dialogue, but so does Carmen when it's done properly). Both star the talented George Hearn as Sweeney. One is the 1982 fully staged version with Angela Lansbury grasping immortality as Mrs. Lovett. The other is the 2001 concert version with the great Patti LuPone. Ms LuPone does an undeniable star turn in this role, but fails to achieve Lansbury's high orbit. Hearn is a tremendous Sweeney, although in 2001 he's showing the 19 elapsed years since the last recording. I would recommend either of these entries, although my recommendation of the 1982 version is unqualified, enthusiastic, and excited.And now Tim Burton tackles the Demon Barber. Burton is an erratic director who often hits the heights but here sinks to a new low in this thing that is less a performance than a travesty.The reader may notice I mention none of the other performers. This is done mostly to protect the innocent. They do well enough, but their quality is still leagues from the 1982 version. As in nearly everything that went wrong with this Sweeney, I blame the director.Somebody must have told Burton that Sweeney Todd is a dark comedy. He seems to have forgotten about the ""comedy"" and concentrated on the ""dark""  to great excess, alas. Practically everything is filmed through blue filters  which may have been considered clever technique 50 years ago but is now just a strain on the eyes.On first viewing the film, and assuming you know the score, the first thing you will notice is the complete absence of the chorus. Considering the deep relationship between Sweeney and Greek theater, this omission is akin to dropping the witches from Macbeth. It is this omission that robs the work of its dimensionality and causes the ending to fall flatter than last week's soufflé.Aside from the directorial murder of the chorus and its music, this performance contains a number of omissions, truncations, and abbreviations. The flagellation scene, as I recall, is gone. The Todd-Pirelli contest contains only the shaving part, not the tooth-pulling half. (This omission is fairly common in performance, alas). The Beggar Woman's part is excised by about 50%, including most of the best bits. The ""God, That's Good"" number is foreshortened to the point of being seen on edge. The wildly funny lead up to Beadle Bamford's murder is gone. And so on and on. Somebody should remind Burton that this is a recipe for hash, not honest roast beef.Burton's directorial aim seems clearly to rob Sweeney of almost every ounce of its considerable humor. He fails, and there's enough left to cause us to go into deep mourning for the rest. ""Hello, my name is Tim. I'm here to make sure you don't have any fun."" He seems to desire the players to be a funereal in their acting as possible.As a result, a great actor like Johnny Depp is converted into somebody you'd never want to see or hear again. Depp, clearly too young for the role, is made up to look like somebody in a 1930s horror flick instead of someone who's spent nearly 2 decades in the penal sloughs of Old Australia. He plays Sweeney as if the man were loopy, which he isn't. He has a detached, dreamy delivery and never, NEVER catches fire. I suppose this approach may be considered interesting in a sort of abstract way, but mainly it's boring and tedious. Despite all the cuts, the film is only about a quarter-hour shorter than the 1982 and 2001 versions  yet it seems to drag out a lot longer. You do the math.Perhaps the weakest link in the whole cast is Helena Bonham Carter, who is manifestly too young to play Mrs. Lovett. Her makeup may be intended to age her, but merely gives her a tired and haggard appearance. Lovett's first appearance should wrench the viewer's attention onto her relentlessly. Bonham Carter's first appearance gives us time to see if there are any pictures on the ceiling. The less said about ""Have a Little Priest"", probably the better. There are a few clever moments, but only in the sense of a convergence of a visual clue to the lyrics  a technique that doesn't hold up well with repetition. Bonham Carter's motherly effusions over Toby wouldn't convince a 3-month-old puppy.Speaking of puppies, the staging of this dog omits the original wonderful mechanistic set in favor of a more realistic presentation of London. This can be understood, since films generally try to transcend the limitations of the stage. In this case, however, the relationship of staging with plot is too organic to be so lightly dismissed.Look, guys  if you buy this you'll regret it  maybe not now, but later and for the rest of your life. (Thanks, Rick.) Try the Lansbury.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Masterful Direction, Acting, Cinematography, Set, Lighting, Has it all.","Those who happen not to have a musical theater affinity may likely be surprised by the ease and inclusiveness of this masterful musical film creation. Perhaps, because I do love stage musicals it was natural to anticipate this film on the one hand, but on the other I wondered and worried about how successful the director and crew would be at transferring the Sondheim genius on to the big screen. I was not disappointed!Burton and Logan supremely translate the stageplay on screen into the thrilling unfolding of the tale of the Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, offering brilliant and authentic sets with eery lighting and once the viewer gets passed the first ten minutes or so of lyrics in lieu of lines, even the anti-musical enthusiast will either become a convert or at the least - in this particular instance - easily make the leap into the genre for the next few delightfully thrilling hours.Of course, the Sondheim tunes are fabulous, the cast talent stellar and Depp's musicality surprised and impressed. Not only with his debut singing abilities but honestly, in his never-ending labryinth of character development and genius. This film, more than any other to date(and he has a lot), shows how incredibly gifted and willing to take risks he is,despite what is or is not kosher in Hollywood or even with public.The hallmark of a gifted actor is one who can really take on the whole spectrum of characters and therefore not a typecast. This man is an actor's actor.Helena Bonham Carter was hysterical and developed character in a way that mesmerizes you when she's on screen. I could not wait for she and Depp to be back on screen. That said, Alan Rickman was stupendously evil and loved his portrayal of Judge Turpin. Timothy Spall - OMG, he could not have been more deliciously smarmy as Tourpin's sycophant. Sacha Baron Cohen was seriously funny and showed his skills as a dramatic actor. Kudos for Jamie Campbell Bower as perfect Anthony Hope and really enjoyed the performance of Ed Sanders as Toby; worked great with Bonham Carter.Set design, lighting and cinematography is a dream and in large part is what helps to make the translation from stage to screen so great and enjoyable.Burton and the entire cast and crew is spot-on and I plan to see this film again and again.

"Burton's ""Sweeney"": a delightfully fresh spin on my favorite Broadway musical","I had to sit through two screenings of ""Sweeney Todd"" to erase my memories of the Broadway cast (I saw the New York stage company in 1979, with the magnificent Anglela Lansbury and Len Cariou in the leads.) But I came to appreciate the unique approach of Tim Burton's cinematic ""Sweeney Todd"" and to judge it on its own merits. It's a delight. Depp and Bonham Carter are superb actors, and their untrained, light singing voices somehow suit the intimacy of the silver screen. One thing I wish the film had is a greater sense of fun with the waltz number, ""A Little Priest"". The Broadway Todd and Lovett were clearly entertaining themselves with their macabre speculations in that song, laughing and smirking their way through Sondheim's fiendishly funny lyric. But in the film, that song lost much of its ""black comedy"", merely retaining its ""blackness"". As if to atone for draining ""A Little Priest"" of its lightheartedness, Burton has discovered new levels of comic relief and irony in the song ""By the Sea"". About Helena Bonham Carter  She won me over. Her Mrs. Lovett was a sexy corpse of a woman. Whereas Lansbury had provided a sort of burlesque comic-relief in the role, Bohnam Carter's Mrs. Lovett had much more pathos. Hers was a woman who obviously had been beaten-down into a state of malaise by years of hard-scrabble struggle to survive. And, although the superb young Ed Sanders out-sang Bonham Carter in the achingly beautiful duet ""Not While I'm Around"", the tears in Bonham Carter's anguished eyes, at the end of that song, haunted me as I left the cinema. Overall, the bombastic Broadway incarnation of ""Sweeney"" and the new, intimate screen version of ""Sweeney"" are vastly different animals, but each one roars like hell!",,Anonymous,Horror
Shocking,"When I saw the original poster of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, before I knew it was Johnny Depp or Tim Burton, I thought to myself, ""I have no idea what it is but, hey, it looks interesting."" Finally I saw a trailer and I realized that it was Johnny Depp as a murderous barber and then I thought to myself, ""Wow, freaky. But still interesting"" and then Depp opened his mouth and started singing whilst wielding a sharp razor...my friend and I immediately busted out laughing in the theatre.Now don't get me wrong, I like musicals, I thoroughly enjoy them. Nonetheless, that was a shock I didn't expect. I can't say that I anticipated this movie more than I anticipated say...Lord of the Rings perhaps, but I was definitely excited to see how this movie did.As far is acting is concerned I expected a lot from Johnny Depp (there's no reason why I shouldn't) and for the most part, he met my expectations. I hear people constantly talking about how Helena Bonham Carter deserves an Oscar for her performance in this movie but I fail to see it. The movie is a dark and gray and her face is gray, and her voice is monotone through and through. So except for ONE sequence whenever she was on screen she sort of blended in with the environment and I faded out.Music is obviously a big factor in musicals and while the music in Sweeney Todd wasn't necessarily bad, it wasn't very strong and that's big hit in a musical. Johnny Depp talk-sings through most of the movie; fans of the original on-stage musical disliked that because the original man who played Sweeney had a very operatic voice, but I liked it I personally thought it fit the character. There's a young boy in the movie, I forget his name, but he amazed me! When he started singing I was so shocked, I didn't know a little boy that size could possibly have vocal cords that strong. Also, the song between Sweeney and the Judge ""Pretty Women"" is one of my favorites and I thought it was well done. But save that one song, no songs TRULY excited me, rang in my head, or really stuck out.Cinematography and directing was astounding as expected with Tim Burton. The dark tones and splashes of red have been used before but he pulled it off with flair. There's a song in this movie and during that sequence the cinematography changes to dreamy scenery with very bright colors that contrast with Depp's and Carter's pale Halloween-like faces. It's possibly my favorite part of the whole movie, that entire sequence is fantastic!You can bet on seeing a bloody movie when you see this film. Bloody is actually an understatement, try the bloodiest movie I've ever seen. It's filled with sliced necks, crushing skulls, and grinding bodies and it's honestly nauseating. Some say that it's just necessary for the movie, and while they're mostly right I still believe certain things were unnecessary and could have been toned down.One redeeming quality is the theme of the movie which is actually the main theme of the original musical which Tim Burton kept perfectly intact. That theme is: revenge is evil and it will consume and destroy everything including yourself. Still...after seeing the movie there were a couple scenes that I could have definitely been just fine without seeing entirely! Tim Burton and Johnny Depp actually made a mistake in my opinion, they made Sweeney Todd way too ""attractive"". His slicing executions eventually became so stylized, so choreographed, and so graceful that you almost anticipate his next killing RATHER than trying to yell out, ""Stop the madness!"" which is the whole point of the story.The movie is entertaining, enticing, thought provoking, and well made but there is still one problem. The ending left me feeling hollow (much like the characters themselves). I won't tell you the ending, but I'll tell you this: when I walk out of a movie I want to feel entertained...not drained. But then again, maybe that's what Burton intended.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sweeney Todd is most likely the goriest musical you'll ever see.,"""I'll steaaaal youuu Johaaaaanaaaa"" *slashes an innocent man's throats* ""Johaaaaanaaaaaa"" *stabs neck with razor*! The unusual blend of yearning for love and slicing necks vengefully, yet oddly it works. Based on the infamous musical, an English barber returns to London after being exiled to seek revenge on a Judge who took his love away from him. How does one cure vengeance you might ask? Well, murder customers with a razor and process their cold bloody corpses into meat pies. Simple really, duhhhh. To recreate the Victorian melodramatic musical, you need someone who can visually entice you with gothic imagery. Someone who can balance gore and whimsical musicality. Obviously one candidate for the mighty task: Tim Burton. His notorious gothic and dark fantastical mind was perfect in adapting the musical. He is able to recreate specific stages that both replicated the musical production and created an entirely new cinematic edge. Whether it be Sweeney melodramatically singing to his razor blades or Mrs Lovett picturing her perfect life whilst grinding corpses, it all works as a surreal nightmare. Excessively gory which, again, sets itself apart from others. Depp and Bonham Carter both had strong vocals and gave committed performances that separated this from your typical cheesy musical, particularly the former's singing ability which really suited the role of Sweeney. A hint of 'Oliver Twist' with all the ""Laaaandaaaan!"" accents and a splash of ""Sleepy Hollow"" for the veil of darkness that shrouds Victorian London. The songs were enigmatic, particularly various renditions of the same song, however weren't really memorable. The second act unfortunately dragged due to the extensive melodrama and thin plot. Then the ending was far too rushed and concluded abruptly. Yet somehow, somewhere...it's one of the stronger entries in the genre (and I hate musicals). Dark, moody and edgy, serve me up a famous Mrs Lovett meat pie now because I'm taking a bite!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Greatest Horror-Musical Ever!,"My girlfriend turned me onto the stage play of Sweeney Todd last year, and I became a big fan. When I heard it was going to be made into a movie, I cringed. Then I heard Tim Burton was going to be directing, I felt a little better. Then I heard Johnny Depp was going to be Sweeney Todd. I felt a lot better. But once I saw that it was actually going to be rated R for strong bloody violence, I was sold. This to me meant that they were going to keep it faithful to the original story.This is by FAR the best horror musical ever and one of the best movies of the year. People initially get turned off of it when they hear it's a musical. I'll be the first to tell you, that you won't notice it after the first 5 minutes. Johnny Depp makes this picture, and has a great supporting cast around him. He goes from being a funny, adventurous pirate in PotC, to becoming a homicidal madman out for blood and revenge. The one thing I didn't much care for was the character of Toby, as he irritated me, but the rest was superb.Another thing I will mention is the violence. When I heard it was strong bloody violence, I couldn't really picture it since it was a Tim Burton film. But this is also one of the most blood soaked mainstream movies I've ever seen. Many throats are slashed and we are treated to glorious showers of blood spray each time. The ending is one of the most disturbing I've ever seen. It's a hell of a twist, and it's just sad as hell.So whatever memories you have of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow or any of his other characters, throw them out the window. This is a new, vicious, violent, and vengeful Johnny Depp who further makes his case as the best actor of this current generation. He along with Tim Burton, and this fabulous cast, has made Sweeney Todd one of the best movies of this year.And please don't ignore it just because it's a musical. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tim Burton is Back and Better than Ever,"I just got back from the theaters after hatching one of the most Interesting films I've seen in a long time. Before seeing this movie I had pretty standard expectations of what this film would be like. I actually didn't really know much of the plot or story of the movie before seeing this. All I knew was that it was a Tim Burton movie and we haven't seen one of those for over two years. Like most Tim Burton movies this one stars Johnny Depp who did a fantastic job as Sweeney Todd. Now the plot to the story is hard to describe without giving anything away but I'll explain as best as I can. A barber is seeking revenge for a cruel act against his wife, and he's doing so by killing people and having them ground down to meat with the help from Mrs. Lovett a mysterious and eccentric baker. This story has interesting views of morality and a dark presence that you can identify as a Tim Burton. It also has a humorous look on death were you might find you and the person nearby you laughing at something that is disturbing( Think of any horror movie that over exaggerates the amount of blood a person has. like Dawn of the dead or evil dead.) Some might find the deaths cheesy and silly but I enjoyed and I thought they were awesome. The camera work and digital effects were stunning to say the least. The entire movie the environment is dark and old looking almost black&white (which is a theme for Tim Burton) and when you see that red blood for the first time it's beautiful. Pirelli played by Sacha Baron Cohen(Borat) is one of the greatest characters in the film keep an eye out for him. And one thing I would like to add were was Danny Elfman? This was the first Tim Burton movie I ever seen without Elfman composing the score WTF? So basically go see it but don't take your kids. Its to long and gory for any child to withstand.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Weeny Sweeney,"When the ensemble harmonizes the unsettling baritone with the glass-shattering soprano parts of ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" at the opening of the stage production, SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET, the tone is not only announced but adamantly affirmed. You are in store for a truly bizarre tale that is the epitome of madness and you are being introduced to man burnt by an unjust system, robbed of everything and everyone that ever meant anything to him, who has now returned for his due vengeance and has brought with him a very unhealthy bloodlust. It would seem that there could be no one better suited to translate this haunting story to film than master of the dark and champion of the disenfranchised, director, Tim Burton. Burton begins by hastily deciding to skip the ballad and go straight to what he knows best. Bright red blood drips down walls and slips between the gears of a giant meat grinder, Stephen Sondheim's potently explosive score driving everything forward. But just as the ballad foretells on stage of unbelievable vocal histrionics to come and amaze, Burton's decision to remove it in favour of score and visual gore confirms that he will be relying on what he knows in fear of the daunting music he has failed to grasp.For a director who has built his entire reputation on his creative visual style, it is genuinely surprising to watch SWEENEY TODD unfold in such an unimaginative fashion. It does not seem so at first. In fact, it is quite a twisted treat to dive in to the cobblestone streets of yesterday's London, tainted blue and gray by cinematographer, Dariusz Wolski, to a saturation point that makes the patrons appear as though they are just waiting, if not begging, for their dull lives to end. Who can blame them really? The light of day rarely seems to rise on London as it is constantly shrouded in heavy cloud. And while the camera hints at the scope of London by weaving from the picturesque rooftops to a dizzying maze of streets, it quickly ceases to a halt on one particular street corner, home to Todd's barbershop. Despite having so much room to move, Burton traps us here and allows the claustrophobia to set in. This is a fine way to make people uncomfortable but it also makes for some rather limited musical staging. Burton rushes through the musical numbers by slicing lines out (unfortunately some of the more hilarious ones) so that he can get to the action because he knows that their stunted staging slows the pace. Subsequently, he leaves us with nothing more than a bloody mess on the floor.Further proving the unimportance of technical mastery in this musical is Burton's decision (with the perplexing blessing of Sondheim himself) to cast untrained singers in the demanding leads. The character of Sweeney Todd requires a voice so powerful and fierce that it resonates fear through the bodies of all who hear it. Johnny Depp surprises with how well he can handle the material but his capable performance never ignites the passion of a mad man. Meanwhile, Todd's counterpart in scheming evil, Mrs. Lovett, a woman so conniving and desperate that she will say or do anything to make sure her man is content and by her side, is played by Helena Bonham Carter, a woman whose voice is so weak that she is barely capable of communicating any of the colour in the character. Each actor carries the same drab expression on their face throughout the film as though they are bored or just completely unsure of themselves. They each have their moments but neither successfully demonstrates the depths of their treachery or the heights of their dark wit. As they watch each step, careful to avoid each other's toes, Burton guides their performances into characters with soulless shells that barely frighten each other, let alone the audience.In his first (and hopefully last) musical outing, Burton breaks a golden musical rule. The musical numbers should never be rushed. That's why we're there  to appreciate the beauty of Sondheim's layered and dense masterpiece. Only that isn't why Burton is there. Clearly, Todd's penchant for slashing throats is what most fascinated the man at the helm of this horror story. And while the blood gushing out and splattering against the camera and the walls is both disgusting and exhilarating at the same time, it amounts to very little more than gorgeous torture porn. Who knew that SWEENEY TODD would be so maniacal that even the insane genius of Tim Burton could not fully comprehend the man himself?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Burton's Gothic horror visual feast.,"Although this is a Stephen Sondheim musical, the film adaptation is truly a Tim Burton work of art. Sondheim provided wonderful material to work with and Burton took his twisted, perverse sense of style and bravado to create a lasting impression on the senses that is sure to be remembered for years to come.Even more impressive is the fact that the entire crew sings its own parts. This makes Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter's roles all the more astonishing, especially since neither of them had sung professionally prior to this. But natural talent they have and their on- screen chemistry is as good as need be; they are the perfect oddly admirable yet terribly creepy couple.Still, it is Burton who leaves the biggest impression on this film; his use of blood alone is worth your time. The sets are gorgeously bleak and dank, the costumes almost reek of decay and dirt, and the camera swoops to and fro as we witness a man completely consumed with revenge so as to blind him from everything the world still offers. Definitely not for the faint of heart, but people should realize this is pure fictional fantasy and great entertainment as well. The blood flows freely, almost aesthetically, symbolizing the release of Sweeney Todd's pent-up anger and disgust with humanity. Tim Burton's visual style was never more perfect for material than this; the result is nothing less than remarkable.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
There's one place I'm never getting a haircut or shave,"Tim Burton loves to take well-known stories and turn them into his own personal freak show. Sometimes, like with Sleepy Hollow, it works. Sometimes, like with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it does not. With this movie, it definitely works.When I read an article in a newspaper that described Sweeney Todd as a movie with ""oceans of gore,"" I thought I knew what I was in for. By the end of the film, I could not think of a bloodier film. This movie was more violent than Eastern Promises. The shock factor was a huge part of making Sweeney Todd an intense ride.I am no musical expert, and I know Johnny Depp is not the ideal singer, but he along with everyone else seemed to stay on note, which is enough for me. Some of the songs, like the one by the Hanson-looking boy singing about Joanna dragged on a little too long. Other than that, I liked the music.Cool style, terrific acting by everyone, funny moments followed by extremely emotional ones, and a basement with a meat grinder and a furnace with a floor of blood pouring into the city sewers. Who could ask for anything more?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tim's New Ghost's Eye,"Oh lovely day! Here is a Hollywood romance that I hope lasts.Two aspects of this production: the magical triangle of Burton, Depp, Carter, and the music of Sondheim. The latter I'm not familiar with, outside of those Madonna-sung torch numbers in ""Dick Tracy."" The music here is fine, I suppose, but the musical is just canvas, anyway. It's that first aspect that excites me.It's easy to accuse Burton of being more a production designer than a valid film director, but when compelling visions of alternate worlds in the cinema are so infrequent, need that be a bad thing? He's a man whose work I decided to follow from early age and it's a film-going relationship that's been peppered with a few successes and some appealing failures (his low point was ""Planet of the Apes""). With his design-first mentality, his cinematic approach is one that appeals to me: matters of story and character are secondary to the development of engaging film environments, ones worth the consideration of our time and our willingness to enter.Yes, it doesn't always click, as he hasn't consistently integrated movement and coherence with his elaborate set-work. But he's getting better, and this is his most accomplished film since the two Batman movies, anomalous achievements considering he neither matched nor topped either in the last fifteen years.I think partner Carter and friend Depp are instrumental in this evolution. Helena's always been a lively and intelligent actress, and her collaborations with Burton find them seeking out meat worthy of her supporting talent and his artistic growth. Added to this is the allure of watching a filmmaker construct loving visual tributes to his significant other. See the way Helena is photographed here, exuding that unorthodox but undeniable sensuality of hers, quite apropos for the Burton style but not a grotesque transformation of her image. Rather, he draws out a beauty heretofore muted, even when she was being similarly appraised through the lens by ex-boyfriend Branagh.Depp is here in all his introspective glory. He's usually been the one at the forefront of Tim's ventures down the more intriguing paths.Together, the three of them descend on Sondheim -- highly melodramatic, quite predictable -- and turn it into a feast of multiple projections of reality. Depp as barber and as actor who invents a past idea of the barber as anything but the vengeful ghoul, tangling with Carter as lovelorn vamp who secretly controls and motivates actions in the plot. Burton assuming the stance of Depp's imagined ghost (that of the tormented ""dead"" wife), always in the odd corners of every scene, observing from all angles, freeing the theatrical environment from the limits of its stage origin, and then intruding at the climax with the driving hammer of fate. We as audience have the option of moving anywhere among these multiple vantages, all pooled into a coherent world of Victorian goth, probably Burton's most coherent evocation to date. We can be predator or prey. Rickman, Cohen, Spall, the young lovers, the boy -- all simply the prey.Burton's eye here is highly architectural, very Langian. If you've never attached yourself to this man's work, now may be the time. I anticipate great things from here on.Blake's rating: 3 (out of 4)",,Anonymous,Horror
Seeing 1982 version raised the bar too high.,"I saw Sweeney Todd at the Wadsworth Theatre yesterday.The scenery, special effects, music and mood of the movie were great.It would have been a lot better if the 2 main characters (Johnny Depp & Helena Bonham Carter) could sing. Some of the supporting cast sang very well. The actor that played toby (Ed Sanders) & Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower) sang exceptionally well. They should have dubbed Depp. He sang the words but not much emotion behind it.A few of the songs were cut but it was from Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) & Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall) who couldn't sing well anyway so it probably helped the movie.There was no chorus singing in the background or the ballad about Sweeney Todd, in the movie maybe it will be on the DVD version.See the 1982 Angela Lansbury & George Hearn version for the songs and the 2007 version for the special gory affects.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Swing Your Razor Wide, Sweeney","""Sweeney Todd,"" Tim Burton's big-screen adaptation of the classic Stephen Sondheim musical, was faced with the nearly impossible task of meeting the expectations of both Burton and Sondheim fans alike. So if it falls a little short, I'm willing to forgive and forget. I think Burton made probably the best film that could be made from Sondheim's musical, but his movie also confirmed something I already suspected: ""Sweeney Todd"" is inherently theatrical, and though Burton mostly succeeds in reinventing the musical as a film, he doesn't totally succeed in justifying the necessity of doing so.I felt during ""Sweeney Todd"" the way I so often feel watching screen versions of stage musicals: the medium of film only serves to highlight the weaknesses of stage shows. Things simply work on stage that don't work on screen and vice versa, and that's the case here. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Sweeney Todd"" the movie, but I've enjoyed live performances of the show much more, and despite all of my efforts to forget the stage productions while watching the movie, I couldn't help but compare the two.But let's talk about the movie. It's a deliciously macabre and dark story, and Burton deserves great credit for resisting the urge to make it more palatable to mainstream film audiences. Indeed, his interpretation of the tale is darker and bloodier than any stage version I've seen, and the film's final moments left me chilled and disturbed. Johnny Depp plays Sweeney, a vengeful barber who declares war on humanity for the wrongs he has suffered at the hands of a malicious judge and beadle. Helena Bonham Carter plays Mrs. Lovett, whose meat pie business becomes revitalized when she starts using Sweeney's victims as, ahem, ingredients. Carter and Depp have tremendous chemistry together, maybe because they look so much alike. Depp does a good job with Sweeney, but he's limited from the start because Sweeney is a one-dimensional character. Depp delivers an intense and frightening performance, but aside from the interest inherent in whether or not he'll be able to pull off Sondheim's notoriously difficult music (which he does just fine, thank you very much), I didn't find the performance itself that interesting. Carter, however, if a weaker singer than Depp, does wonders with Mrs. Lovett. This is the first version of ""Sweeney Todd"" I've seen where I actually felt bad about what happens to her character. Carter balances the role beautifully between ruthless accomplice and maternal caretaker. She doesn't play the role big and blowsy like Angela Lansbury did in the original stage version, or like Patti LuPone has played it, and she'll probably be criticized for taking too meek an approach to the material as a result, but I think her's works wonderfully as a film interpretation of the role.Sondheim's score sounds glorious, but I was disappointed at the many cuts made to it. A few songs are missing altogether, and there's hardly one left that isn't at least shortened. My one bit of unqualified praise goes to the film's visual style, which is magnificent. The production design couldn't be improved upon.""Sweeney Todd"" might get better with subsequent viewings, once the automatic screen-to-stage comparison is flushed out of the system and one can watch the movie for what it is. As it is, I liked the movie a lot without thinking it was one of the best of the year.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Blood, some blood, a bit more blood and some singing...","Sweeny Todd is a musical. I know that may seem an obvious statement to make given the years it has been on Broadway (and my school theatre when I was 13) but I think some people in the audience hadn't quite realised that. It reminded me of the time I went to see the South Park film a group of kids kept tutting all the way through when the songs started. Singing a story is a bit too high-brow for some people.Another obvious statement to make is that this is a Tim Burton film. So naturally it has to have Johnny Depp in it, which is fortuitous as he makes the perfect Sweeny Todd - anger, despair, hatred with a very small slice of humour on the side of the glass. And it also has to have Helena Bonham Carter too, and again, she's perfectly cast as the loopy, rampantly amorous Mrs. Lovett.Other fantastic performances grace the film. The excellent Sasha Baron Cohen plays 'Signor Adolfo Pirelli', a rival to Sweeny Todd. His performance is flawless and his foreign accent so much more convincing than 'Talladaga Nights'. One of my favourite actors, Alan Rickman alongside Timothy Spall, who must be best buddies by now from Harry Potter, cast a perfect target as the menacing and corrupt duo who destroyed Sweeny Todd's former life.And then back to Burton. Sure, it's a Burton film and by now, we should all know what to expect. He doesn't let you down. The scenes are sinister and dark, the sets are brutal and unforgiving and the images of London and its surroundings are relentlessly depressing. Even when Sweeny whips out his blade and carves his victims across the neck, Burton makes sure we bare the brunt of the shock with oodles of oozing blood. The Mrs. Lovett dream sequence about marrying Sweeny is just classic Burton in every aspect.The only things that let this film down is the score, and the singing. Yes, Sondheim's music is renown, but the film lacks the punch of one or two blockbusting and memorable songs - something that could bring a climax or two to a scene, and really illustrate the emotion in the characters. And unlike a musical like Moulin Rouge, Depp, Carter, Spall, Rickman and even Cohen, are not the strongest of singers by any means necessary - a fact that really stands out when child actor Ed Saunders, playing Toby, opens his gob and starts a duet with Carter, blowing her off set.But you can get over this because the film is so visually stunning, and to be honest, you'd rather have Depp in this role with a so-so singing voice than seeing someone else who can sing cock the whole character up.2010 is the estimated release date for one of Burton's next projects - Alice in Wonderland. Hopefully, it'll be as warped and disturbing as Sweeny Todd's world. Although, obviously with less blood...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Non-Conventional musical wins you over,"I went and saw Sweeny Todd tonight at the movie theater. I am a pretty big fan of musicals, like Grease and various Disney movies. Musicals are generally really cheery and bright. This movie put an interesting twist on the idea of a musical by putting a dark perspective on it. I initially did not want to give it a shot because I did not like the idea of a dark musical. However, it was the only movie I had left to see in theaters so I went. It was surprisingly awesome. The music and lyrics were well written and sung terrifically. The composer did a great job mixing the music to the action in the movie. Also, the plot was well devised, although a bit predictable at the end in my opinion. The colors in the movie are also done interestingly. The contrasting darks and lights are very intriguing. It was all very well put together and a great movie. ""A must see,"" especially if you like musicals and gore.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"You wouldn't (I hope) watch a movie on a 3"" screen - why watch musical theatre in the cinema, sung by people who can't","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp make a lot of good films together. ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Ed Wood,"" ""Sleepy Hollow,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""  I loved them all. Sweeney Todd displays another impressive blend of their talents. And I hated it. Let me tell you why.Don't get me wrong  it's a very good movie. Very cleverly done. But for all the hundreds of thousands that enjoy it, there will be some that find it nauseous, pointless, superficial, and much better left undone. In case you are likely to be one of those people, let me tell you enough about it to save wasting your money and a couple of hours you could better spend doing something else. Like watching the rain or staring into space.Firstly, Sweeney Todd is a musical. This is very important, because the trailer makes a hash of telling you what it is. Is it a fairy tale? A horror story? Something weird with a song or two? No, it's a full blown stage musical  one of those where they sing nearly all the words rather than having dialogue and songs.There's nothing more I enjoy than a good trip to the West End of London or New York's Broadway. There's the excitement of the legendary venue, and they will have the cream of the crop of performers who can sing extremely well, act enough to project stage presence, and dance as well if required. By the time the show gets to the provinces, the good singers have usually been replaced with people who can yell. Not a massive problem perhaps if you are doing Rocky Horror or Sound of Music  shows with good singalong ditties. But if I have to focus on the raucous attempts of a second rate 'singer' for over two hours, invest a second rate plot with meaning it barely deserves, and feel my wallet suffer for something that is neither art nor entertainment: then I get fidgety.Like the similar travesty, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Sweeney Todd forces me to endure something that could be palatable in a top theatre and is execrable on film. And it gets worse: Hunchback used people who had good singing experience  Sweeney has a failed pop singer who can act. Let's add the director's girlfriend/spouse. She can't sing either, but close-ups of her expressive face will help to take the heat off Johnny. Watch out for the Depp kiss. ""I was being paid by my boyfriend to kiss his best friend,"" she told reporters.As it's a 'musical', let's add a couple of people who really can sing and stick them in minor roles. With all the big names, we won't see or hear them very much. It's a minor love story while Bonham Carter slavishly follows Demon Barber Johnny so he can work out his frustration at losing his first love. Johnny works out his frustration very well  by slitting throats. Not just his intended, but many others, for practice and pies. It's all done to more ridiculous warbling, so is more about adding colour than horror.The one bit I enjoyed was Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Adolfo Pirelli, a competitor barber. He was doing what he is best at  being funny. Now if they had left Depp and Carter to do what they are best at, decided whether the sets and lighting were meant to be realistic or fantasy, and left the venerable Mr Sondheim writing musicals for the stage . . .It could have been good. I could have enjoyed it instead of wishing it would hurry up and end.Of course, I can't give it one star because I recognise that both existing fans of the stage show and would be fans are going to love it. It appeals to the people who want a stage show with a bit of an adult theme, dressed up with top stars (Depp's performance is stellar). And to many more who no doubt see something I don't. So now you know what it is, you've probably read all the glowing reports, and you can decide whether you might like it or not.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The ""Demon Barber"" slashes and sings me to sleep.","Everyone is going crazy for this movie, but, honestly, I hated it. I've only walked out of two movies in my entire life (Nutty Professor II: The Klumps and Burton's last misguided offering, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), but I was very tempted while watching this slapdash piece of crap. I ended up dozing off a couple of times instead.First of all, Johnny Depp is fantastic, and his singing is excellent. However, even he can't carry this mess of a film. Tim Burton has simply lost his gift, and his visual style here is bland and lazy. Burton's classic work seems to have stunted his growth as a filmmaker, and everything in this film seems recycled from earlier, far superior films. Even the flat where Depp's Todd carries out his work looks exactly like the dwelling that housed Edward Scissorhands. Nods to Sleepy Hollow are very apparent as well, and at times, it almost looks like Burton reused sets and costumes from that film.The much-hyped gore is, indeed, shocking... The first time you see it. However, Burton repeats the grisly bits of Todd's work so frequently, and with such banal non-zest, that by the third repetition, the impact of these rotely executed scenes shifts from ""Oh, that was awesome!"" to ""Oh, that again?"". Burton even uses the same camera angle for each session, so these morbid snapshots of Todd's madness become interchangeable and unmemorable.With a film this unattractive to look at, the length becomes a factor, and this is especially frustrating since Burton devotes a large chunk of the film to a subplot that never gets resolved. It's highly manipulative to waste significant runtime getting your audience invested in characters, only to leave their plot thread dangling when the credits roll. Adding another layer of needless filler, we have the presence of Mr. Baron Cohen, whose character in the film is essentially worthless, and whose lone contribution to the affair is padding out the running time even more. Further muddling the cast is Burton's nepotistic placement of his lover in the leading female role. Helena Bonham Carter does a fine job, but she doesn't bring anything to the film that scores of other actresses couldn't have pulled off.While the ending has a nice punch because of the twists that unfold (I'll spare you the spoilers), we can't hold anyone here responsible for that, since the story is not Burton's creation. He chose great material, but a less self-derivative filmmaker would have done so much more with such a gruesome and delightful tale.The lone piece of true interest in the film is the fine work of the brilliant Alan Rickman, who plays a villain better than anyone in the business. However, even here Burton falters, and Rickman's screen time is disappointingly short, especially considering the importance his character occupies in the overall story.I've read so many positive reviews of this film that I felt the opposing viewpoint needed to be put out there so that others who felt like they wasted valuable time enduring this laborious drivel wouldn't feel alone.Burton's body of work is unquestionably impressive, but he's clearly stuck in the past. Since he's obviously looking backwards, I urge you to do the same instead of wasting your time here. The running time of Sweeney Todd could much better be used revisiting Ed Wood, Beetlejuice, or even Mars Attacks, all of which are much better examples of what Burton is capable of as filmmaker.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

An excellent Masterpiece by the genius Tim Burton,"Sweeney Todd is perhaps the best musical in the last 20 years. The direction of the film by Tim Burton is perfect. Burton commands the screen with every aspect possible, with beautiful music and excellent production designs. Johnny Depp gives his best performance to date in my opinion. He excels at showing true anger and lust for revenge perfectly, with only showing few expressions. But I think the most memorable performance is given by the lovely and talented Helena Bonham Carter. She is not a very trained singer, but I thought the way she commands her voice, even though it is not great, her emotions and feelings come through very obviously. Her tones of expressions, her comedic timing, her dark presence, I thought she gives one very amazing performance, one that was greatly ignored at the time of the film's release date. It gets better with each viewing. Alan Rickman does a great job as always, but the more professional singers, who play Johanna and Anthony, are the weakest in the film, but that is not saying much.Overall, a truly great film. It is filled with amazing designs, great music, perfect acting, and shocking plots and twists. This is a film that has to be seen. Tim Burton's best film in my opinion.

This unique take on the Broadway musical is to die for!,"For starters I like Tim Burton. He has been hit and miss this decade(Planet of the Apes being his worst), but when he is good(Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Ed Wood, Vincent, Beetle Juice and Big Fish) he is good. While not my personal favourite of his films, Sweeney Todd was very well done. Is it as good as the Broadway musical? No, the Broadway musical is a true masterpiece so this movie had a lot to live up to. And is it as good as the 80s stage version with George Hearn and Angela Lansbury? Personally, again I think not. These aside, Burton's take is one of his better works not only this decade but in his career.Sweeney Todd is a very unique film and very deftly realised. Few musicals have tackled such a dark theme or have boasted such a distinctive look, but this works extremely well. Burton directs wonderfully, and the script is deliciously macabre. The production design won an Oscar, and deservedly so, as it is astounding with all the palette of blacks and greys that contrast perfectly with Sweeney's cut-throat razor. Likewise with the music, Stephen Sondheim's songs and score are simply magnificent though I was disappointed at the omission of Sweeney's ballad which is superlative. The story is just as macabre as the script with a suitably grotesque and over-the-top last act and the murders are very, very bloody.Last but not least the acting. What can I say? Nothing wrong as far as I can see. Johnny Depp is a wonderful and charismatic presence, and Helen Bonham Carter matches him perfectly as Mrs Lovett. Neither are trained vocalists, but they get into their songs with gusto and also tackle cockney accents and do an above-average job there too. Plus Alan Rickman's(who I love) Judge Terpin is the epitome of evil. All in all, an atmospheric and deliciously dark film and one of Burton's best. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
It managed to turn me to the dark side for a little while there...,"I am not a big fan of either Tim Burton or Broadway musicals, so a combination of the two sounded VERY unappealing to me and I avoided this film for a while. Just a as expected, when I finally sat down to watch it, for the first twenty minutes or so I could hardly stand it, and was very tempted to just stop the DVD player and forget about it. But I decided to hold out until my beloved Sacha Baron Cohen showed up (I'm a big fan of the guy), just to see him, and then the plot started to kick in, and slowly but surely I found myself having to admit I was being entertained (apart from Cohen's appearance, the mid-movie song about the various professions was another high point). The movie indeed gets better and better as it advances to its tragic, macabre climax, and that final image before the credits was rather haunting. So, still no masterpiece in my book, but I'll concede I'm glad I saw it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Burton creates Masterpiece from Sondheim's Classic,"It's impossible for me to fathom somebody not liking Sweeney Todd, although I know there will be plenty who can't appreciate pure genius. Listen to this idea for a movie: Sweeney Todd is a man set on avenging his wife and daughter by killing Judge Turpin. Along the way, he slits people's throats and his neighbor, Mrs. Lovett, grinds the bodies up and bakes them in her popular meat pies. It's a horror movie, but it also has a dark comedic edge to it with a fair bit of romance, drama, suspense, and with about it. Oh, and it's a musical.Sweeney Todd is done in the style of old 1930s monster movies. The color is mostly drained from the film, leaving it looking like a black and white, which is perfect! The only color that does pop up is bright red. The movie feels like a classic, with bits of 'The Count of Monte Cristo' and 'The Avengers' added in, the story truly becomes gripping and the characters more complex. I've often criticized Tim Burton for lack of character development. With this film, Burton shows that he truly can dive into a character. I haven't seen characters this intrigueing in a long time.The plotting and pacing is ingenious, the acting is superb. Johnny Depp gives a brilliant performance as always, but Helena Bonham Carter truly outdoes herself. She plays a woman desperately in love with a psychopath. She knows that he could endanger her life, yet she follows him blindly. Tragically, she chooses him, who doesn't love her, over somebody with true genuine love and protectiveness over her. Alan Rickman is remarkably cunning as Judge Turpin, Timothy Spall, engaging as always as The Beadle. Sacha Baron Cohen makes a great turn as Pirelli, a rival barber, and the two newcomers, Jamie Cambell Bower as Anthony, and Jayne Weisner as Johanna are romantic and thrilling. Laura Michelle Kelly also give a terrific performance.Sweeney Todd is Tim Burton's best film. There's not one loose screw here. The ending is tragic, and rightly so. Sweeney will not be what some people expected, but for many it will be a thrillingly new experience that will forever touch them emotionally. Sweeney Todd is the best film of 2007.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well done dark humor film that's carried by bloody graphics and music. Thumbs up for one of the masters of skewing(Tim Burton).,"Again one of the masters of dark graphics and sharp edged humor Tim Burton has scored again with his latest ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"". Crafted brilliant for the way it appeals to a viewer from everything from the dark sets and the graphic special effects really skew one's view of the world. To top it off this was at one time a stage play in London, and the music and singing during the film makes it seem about as real as Broadway could be. Burton once again delivers in his zany and creepy ways by showing the crazy and odd shaped makeup faces of his characters. And the bloody scenes and use of a lot of red show that Tim is really paying homage to old classic horror films.The story theme is really revenge based set in London on a street called Fleet Street. Sweeney Todd(Johnny Depp) returns after being sent away wrongly to find the town has been turned upside down as he's lost his old love and he still sees the same people of royal power in charge. Yet help is provided along the way upon his meeting of the strange but wicked beautiful Mrs. Lovett(Helena Bonham Carter)as a new idea springs to mind that Sweeney will be the town's new barber. The plan is to bring revenge on the entire town as he will give haircuts and shaves that will be straight, sharp, and a cut above the rest! The performances of the cast is good, yet Johnny Depp's stands out as a real showcase for talent as displayed by his vocal talents of singing in this dark musical. ""Sweeny Todd"" is well done in a dark and bloody humorous way that it will win your heart over with a vengeance because it just skews your world and imagination so well.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A little too much Tim Burtonish.,"A movie with strong performances by Alan Rickman and Johnny Depp. A lukewarm one by Helena Bonham Carter. But the real stars were the sets and costumes. However, the mood of the film was too strongly flavored by the spice of Tim Burton. For Burton fans, it's a great film. For those of us who have seen two other films of this story, and numerous stage versions, it was rather difficult to adjust to so much of Burton's influence.If one dosn't mind the really horribly bloody gore through out the second half of the film, then ya might enjoy it more than I did. Funny thing is, there wasn't all that blood in any of the other venues I saw it in and it came across just as scary. Or even more so. It's said that the less you see a monster, the more frightening it becomes.DotyinCA",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ummmmmmm...well OK,"OK...so I've spent a fair amount of time in pit orchestras, and I had to check this out. When one makes one's living in a pit orchestra, one often ends up despising any musical one plays. Night after night of endless repetition of the same story with the same music eventually inflates every flaw in the wretched sing-spiel to the level of Chinese water torture. That is, in most cases.You see, Sweeney Todd is one of 6 musicals that I'll play anytime. (If you care, the others are Fiddler on the Roof, Into the Woods, West Side Story, Cabaret, and Street Scene...only one of which has a good movie made from it.) The almost operatic intensity of the music and story is compelling, and after having been in the pit for Sweeney Todd...well, I don't really know how many times I've done it, but it exceeds 100...I still like it a lot. If you hated this film, give the 2001 live concert performance with the San Francisco Symphony a look before you write it off. It is nothing short of great. It's short on stage effects and other theatrical devices, but the performance is, nevertheless, staggering.This film, though. Well, I did not hate it. My previous experience with the musical may have something to do with that. It may be that I am allowing my love for the original material to color my thoughts on this film. It certainly has problems.Most of the dark humor has been sucked out of it, particularly in the number ""Try a Little Priest"". I'm so used to it being played with an hysterical mood, that the Gothic nihilism with which this film executes it does nothing to break the mood of what is, let's face it, a very disturbing story.There are also some cuts I didn't much care for, although I may not have cared for any at all to tell the truth. The musical runs a good 3 hours, and unless you're doing a Tolkien story or something, most movie studios don't want to do that. Still...the musical flows so beautifully in its uncut form. A superb musical sequence involving a gorgeous counterpoint of themes and action between one scene with Anthony & Johanna talking excitedly about eloping and another where the Judge & the Beadle discuss a barber on Fleet Street is reduced to just part of the Judge & Beadle scene. Its absence mars a later number as well. I missed it keenly and played my DVD of the above mentioned 2001 performance as soon as I got home.OK...a few words about casting, and I'll shut up. From a musical standpoint, Depp is really wrong for this role. Throughout I kept thinking ""Edward Scissorshands"". His voice is simply not up to the singing part the role demands. The rant song, as I always think of it, loses a lot because of it. When I first heard he was playing the title role I remember thinking they must have gotten a stunt voice for him, but they didn't. The movie suffers for it. Carter does OK. Again I think it suffers for an abandonment of the maniacal in favor of goth sensibilities, but that could be a personal problem. The big surprise for me was Rickman, who, though not great, rose to the role of the judge very nicely. As for everyone else...adequate...I guess.So...as I said. I didn't hate it. It could have been far better.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
I can't believe I will love this bloody film,"I am not a type of persons who like Horror or Thriller film and I have rarely seen ones(Most of them were starring by Depp). However, this film is different, it is a combination of Comedy, Thriller, musical, Drama and tragedy film. And it is well enough to be watched again and again without boring. The music is impressively wonderful. It fulfills all the meaning of what they want to say and also the emotion. The voice of Depp is good and compared to the stage play(without bias indeed) I think he can show more appropriate feeling of the songs. Everyone else's singing is great, too, except for Mrs. Lovett's. Her voice is quite thin and makes the songs less sweet, but still acceptable. And it is good to shorten the songs, or else they would be too long and I would have been boring like some other musical film. The humor of the film is fabulous especially the contest scene. The performance of all the actors is good and I am not surprise to see Depp in the list of Oscar's nominee though I do not expected him to get that award. In conclusion, this is an enjoyable film, good enough to see it twice. (If you can tolerate the blood)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant and Twisted,"What a messed up, yet brilliant movie ""Sweeney Todd"" is, Oscar-worthy also comes to mind. Though because of the extremely dark subject matter, it might not do as well. Based on a play by Stephen Sondheim it's about a barber played by Johnny Depp is living the good life until evil Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) wrongfully throws Sweeney into prison and takes his wife and child for his own. When Sweeney gets out, revenge is the only thing on his mind, so he opens a barber shop but instead of shaving faces, he slits throats in preparation for when the Judge sits in his chair. But what does he do with the bodies you may ask? He lets his tenant Mrs. Lovett, owner of the worst pie shop in London; make the bodies in pies, which sell like wildfire.So as you can see, this is a truly messed up movie, even more so because it's a musical, and a comedy. You may think it sounds disgusting, it is, but not as bad as one would think since everything is over the top and done lightly. The genius who is Tim Burton puts his signature Gothic stamp on the film and makes 1800s London look like a bleak, almost black and white city. If it gets no other Oscars it should get Best Art Direction and Best Director for Burton who is long overdue. And oh-my, the actors, almost all of them are superb. And yes, Depp can sing. It's about time he gets an Oscar as well, especially for making us care for a mad, crazy, slightly demonic barber. Now that's tough. Alan Rickman is brilliantly creepy and evil as the horrible judge. Sacha Baron Cohen as Sweeney's rival Signor Pirelli is hilarious. The one weak point of the film is Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett. Her acting chops are great as always, but her singing is on the weak side. And one wonders whether Burton cast her simply because she's his wife. Otherwise ""Sweeney Todd"" is an engrossing, Gothic, twisted, fun, and just plain weird movie, much like Burton's other films. Though this is my favorite, second only to his masterpiece, ""Big Fish"". I highly recommend this, but the easily queasy should definitely not see this, in fact, stay far away. Fans of musicals, Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, or weird movies will be enthralled and delighted by ""Sweeney"".",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Up for an Oscar, do me a lemon.","Johnny Depp. I just don't get it. What was the great film and outstanding performance that makes him the darling of Hollywood. His (9 hour)pantomime turn in ""Pirates"", his laughable accent in ""Chocolate"", he egocentric takeover of ""Willy Wonka"". Or is it that all he has to do is apply eye liner and suddenly he's seen through the soft focus of dewy eyes by critics whispering ""Oh Johnny"" into their pillows at night.Anyway another Johnny Depp film, based around a zany performance by Johnny Depp with other actors but they don't really count as long as Johnny is centre stage, doing his thing.For this please read another one dimensional performance from the old hack. And he can't even sing, nor can Mrs Burton for that matter. Not that the songs were memorable in anyway. Yes it was gory and I did feel quite sick but I think that was more to do that Johnny D's more cockney than the cockneys accent.Obviously I blame myself. I also paid to for and see Benny and Joon, and I wanted my money back too then. Up for an Oscar, please!",,Anonymous,Horror
"Should be called ""Swee To""","Burton's film probably should have been called ""Swee To"" since he left out about half of the songs/music. His choice of songs to delete or truncate does not seem inspired--leaving out ""Ah Miss"" arguably one of the best songs/arrangements in all musical theater. And Depp and Carter should have killed off Ed Sanders, the kid who plays Toby--the kid has got real Broadway pipes and serious acting chops--he makes the rest of cast look pretty mediocre. Sander's apparently thought he was in a serious musical. Burton, Depp and Carter were making Edward Scissorhands with music. Depp and Carter look, or rather sound like they were channeling Liz Taylor (A Little Night Music) for their musical inspiration--not off-key but just a little thin and reedy compared to Sanders.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Johnny Depps Finest Performance,"I've always liked Johnny Depp, and have always loved musicals. When I heard about Sweeney Todd, I was very excited to go see it because it was something new and different. I really liked him in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and Jack Sparrow was his greatest character until this came along. I was very glad that I saw this movie. His performance is superb, along with the other actors. I thought the singing was beautiful, it really puts you in the mood of the movie. I think the violence also made the movie. Most people think that the blood was over the top but it just wouldn't be as dark or as much of an impact with less blood. Overall I think this is Johnny Depps finest performance.A MUST SEE!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Excellent and Brilliant, with a few undeniable flaws","I'm a self-professed Sondheim fanatic. I have seen nearly all of the shows he has ever written and own all of his recordings, including songs for shows that have almost NEVER been performed, (i.e. Saturday Night, The Frogs). I was lucky enough to see Todd onstage twice in Repertory and then ultimately seeing the newest Broadway version with Patti Lupone and Michael Cerveris. Although I'm no one special, I think I can at least safely step away from my own love for Sondheim and be completely honest and truthful about the screen version of Todd. I'm not writing this to praise or bash the movie. I've seen it twice now and believe I can accurately and fairly assess its short comings and its triumphs. A lot of my own personal predictions came true. I knew(and everyone else did considering Burton got Dante Ferretti to design) that the sets would be fantastic. Also, the costumes and cinematography were excellent on all levels. That being said, let's get down to it. I knew Depp wouldn't be able to sing it full out like Hearn, Cariou, or Cerveris, because hell, he smokes like a fiend and he's just not a trained singer. And for those who don't know it, Sondheim music is not only extremely difficult to sing, I also do musicals and at some auditions they won't allow you to try out with Sondheim music! The one thing that Depp had going for him was that he is brilliant actor. And he used that to his advantage. AND, as an added bonus, he CAN SING! Sure, its not pretty, and die hard fans' hearts sink just a tad when he doesn't hit those awesome notes that Sondheim has written, but who cares? If he can't hit it, at least he's acting the crap out of the material, that, I have to admit is enough for me. Helena, Helena, Helena...how I loved thee in Fight Club, Big Fish, Wings of the Dove, etc...but it just didn't work. I'm being absolutely honest here. I think I know exactly how she decided to work the part. She realized that Lansbury's performance is VERY big and VERY in your face. So she tried to humanize the character AND make it more subtle. LOVE her, but big mistake. The problem is, her weird, breathy sing-song voice was at times a tad annoying, but more importantly, I think it was actually negating the very essence of her character. The things that she does in the movie are unspeakable, yet she feels like such a weak character compared to the force of nature as written. I just didn't like her singing. Sorry to say it, wanted to very badly, but I just think that Burton shouldn't have let her do it. When I found out it could have been Annette Bening or Toni Collette, it just kills me. Especially Toni Collette, who was excellent in The Wild Party. Alan Rickman, for a role VERY much reduced in the movie version, is solid. No great singer, but haven't we heard that before concerning this movie? Echo...echo... Anyhoo, he was fine, but for me, it was Timothy Spall who stole his thunder. Big fan of his Mike Leigh work, and is he not just the nastiest, greasiest mofo on the block? Just so nasty and awesome! Perfectly embodied the character. Casting Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli luckily served two purposes. Uno, it gave him a great part that he played with aplomb(we even get to hear his real voice! which is a rarity, since I don't count his Ali G voice as being completely real when he does it), and the other purpose is to lift the film up, not that it sags, but people need a lift after such a brooding opening hour, so it helps. The young lovers are cute. Anthony is far too pretty and really doesn't make me think he wants Johanna. I think she was good. The kid who played Toby could sing, but man was he stiff. I mean, really, sell it kid! Sell it! But for me, I will forever be indebted to Tim Burton. He did it right. He remained faithful and even improved on some things. He did an awesome job and I hope he's nominated.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
'Ow 'Bout A Shave?,"Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd His skin was pale and his eye was odd He shaved the faces of gentlemen Who never thereafter were heard of againThe long-awaited adaptation of ""Sweeney Todd"" from stage to screen has finally arrived and Tim Burton is reaping rave reviews, Christmas cheer and the joy of the birth of his first child with longtime girlfriend Helena Bonham Carter. With an already extensive body of work, Burton has most certainly completed his largest project to date and not only is it his magnum opus, it is Oscar bait as well.Returning for his and Burton's sixth collaboration, Johnny Depp shoulders the role of the title character, a barber of good repute whose beautiful wife Lucy is stolen away by the conniving Judge Turpin (Rickman). Returning to London from a 15-year exile, the woeful and bitter Benjamin Barker (Depp) assumes the moniker of Sweeney Todd and in cahoots with the wily Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter) begins slicing men's throats en masse with his prized razors. He soon discovers that his daughter Johanna (Wisener) is a virtual prisoner in Turpin's home and is determined to exact his revenge, all the while providing the main ingredient for Mrs. Lovett's re-popularized meat pies.Depp looks like Beethoven on crank (or Edward Scissorhands if he'd gotten a perm) and Bonham Carter is a Raggedy Ann doll from hell. Both give admirable performances but singing-wise, they're sub-par. Yes, yes, I know that Depp never got a single singing lesson and coached himself and he's to be commended. Bonham Carter did get singing lessons and even studied baking to prepare for her performance as Mrs. Lovett but she still manages to do nothing more than carry a tune, and that's my assessment of most of the other castmates as well. I found myself more than once thinking, ""No, no, noSING, DAMMIT!"" To hear these songs sung by the 1979 original Broadway cast has Depp and Bonham Carter PALING in comparison to the likes of Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou. The only voices that rise slightly above mediocre are Jamie Campbell Bower as Anthony (""Johanna"") and Ed Sanders as Toby (""Not While I'm Around""). Broadway material most of these people are NOT, especially when trying to bring to life the music of Stephen Sondheim but their acting makes up for it, thank goodness.Of course, most of the youth who will flock to the cineplex are fans of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films and they won't be disappointed. Depp faithfully emotes with utmost excellence and gives Sweeney a snarling intensity worthy of another Oscar nod. Bonham Carter brings a certain sweet psychosis to our dearest Mrs. Lovett and Alan Rickman makes us smile as well as squirm with his portrayal of the perverted Judge Turpin. My personal favorite is Sacha Baron Cohen as the flamboyant Signor Pirelli  he'll get many chuckles as well as ovations with his overwrought Italian accent and surprising operatics.For those who are fans of Tim Burton's dark and Gothic vision, you will salivate over his version of 19th-century London. He paints a fantastically dank and dirty metropolis awash in smoke, fog and pestilence. Renowned costume designer Colleen Atwood (Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands) joins Burton's crew once again, draping Depp in frills, thrills and leather and appareling Bonham Carter in playfully daring couture. Hair and makeup are superb and the violent nature of the story has not been sugarcoated in the least  ""Sweeney"" is fully saturated in gore, blood literally spraying from people's throats and corpses plunging into the dungeon-like basement of the pie shop with a sickening thud.On a scale of one to ten, ""Sweeney Todd"" rates an 8. Had it not been for the notably average vocals, it'd be a real scream in my book.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's OK,"Film version of the play. Based on fact it tells the story of a man (Johnny Depp) who is jailed (for no good reason) for 15 years. It was done by slimy Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) because he wanted his wife and child. 15 years later he returns, adopts the name Sweeney Todd and sets out for vengeance. He's helped by Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who uses the meat from his victims to put into her meat pies which become VERY popular.I saw the play back in 1980 with Angela Landsbury and George Hearn. I remember loving it and the acting was superb. This version just doesn't match up--it can't! Tim Burton correctly shoots it in seriously drained color and he gets a superb performance by Depp and young Ed Sanders (as Toby). Everybody can sing too. Also the murders are shown with blood gushing out--once onto the camera lens! Still it's impossible to take them seriously. Still this has its drawbacks. Carter is terrible--she can sing but her acting is pretty dreadful. Rickman has done the evil act once too often--and it shows. Also it's depressing! It wears you down running on for two full hours. Some songs were cut out too--I really miss ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"". So--it's not a disaster but it could have been so much better with a different leading lady and not cutting ANY of the songs. Depp really puts this film across though--for him alone I give this a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Disappointing,"Contrary to all the enthusiastic reviews of this films, I have to strongly disagree (as would most of the people I know who have seen it!). OK so I assume it's fair to say that usually you can take the winning combination of Burton and Depp and be guaranteed a hit. I had expected so before I gave my cash to the Odeon... but no. This film was a vast disappointment and I left feeling quite angry. The problem? The ""singing"". Are there any clearly defined songs? Few. Memorable ones? None. It's almost like a 3 year old's tapped something out on a xylophone and then Dad's written lyrics to be spoken randomly over the top in a hurry because he wants to watch the game. It feels pointless, tedious, unskilled and just plain never ending! This is the first time for a long time that all three of us in the cinema were sitting there tapping our feet and sighing as the soundtrack would not give us a break through the entire nightmare. Looks were exchanged after about 3/4 hour that clearly said, ""Let's go and find some food instead? I can't believe we just paid for this!"" Then a small smattering of actual dialogue and you can exhale and smile and all's OK, until thirty seconds later you're back smacking your head against the chair in front as Todd's wailing about his blades and holding them aloft again. We are not with you on this one mate...This said, it does not denote the quality of the visuals, production or cast itself. The trouble is is weighs heavily over it. Visually this is Tim Burton at his best, the world created is stunning and pleasurable and certainly does not disappoint. The casting is fine, getting a little tedious perhaps but perfectly acceptable and enjoyable. The acting is unquestionably good and the effort put in to the musical side of it is also clearly given on their part. The ending was not good (no spoiler) and not even vaguely accurate to what the story is 'believed' to be, which in a way was a shame because it would have improved the conclusion vastly!BUT (and this would be by summary sentence on this film) this should NOT have been turned into a pseudo-musical. If Mr Burton had stuck with what he had known it may not have been so err... Oscar-worthy in pretension terms but it would have been thoroughly enjoyable and i'd now be giving it an 8/10. A real shame.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
At Last - The Razor Swings Wide...And So Does The Musical!,"First of all, a note to the ""Sweeney"" purists among us, of which I thought I was one. A movie is NOT a Broadway musical and vice versa, so if you are coming to Tim Burton's rendering of SWEENEY TODD expecting to see a slavish recreation of the live theater version, go buy the DVD of the George Hearn/Angela Lansbury revival from the Eighties and stick to it. You'll be much happier than you will be with this version.Having said that, now let us ""attend the tale."" I came away from seeing this a lot happier than I thought I would, and here's why: no one else could have or should have done this film except for Tim Burton. With his proclivity for all things Gothic and macabre, the material is a perfect fit, and he doesn't waste one iota of the opportunity. I can already see that this has a firm lock on many technical Oscar awards, because everything from Dante Ferretti's production design to Colleen Atwood's costumes are darkly scrumptious. The grit, grime and grue of Victorian Era London only hinted at in musical pieces like OLIVER! (and barely mentioned in MARY POPPINS) gets the 'full monty' here. These are the same streets that would also give birth to Jack The Ripper...Employing the talents of musical director/conductor Paul Gemignani and arranger Jonathan Tunick from the original show is probably the second best move from Burton and the producers, because the orchestrations are as lush to the ears as the visuals are to the eyes. Another musical may be made that looks and sounds this good translated to the screen, but it won't be this year, and probably not in the next one, either.Now for the songs: at least a good third of the tunes are missing, and many will lament the absence of ""The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd"", although the theme is played over the stunning main title sequence. All of the ensemble pieces have been excised and many of the core songs have been shortened, but it's all for a very good, logical reason. These tunes set the stage, the tone and drive the narrative, drawing the kind of pictures the audience in live theater would need to be transported to this time and place with these characters. With movie-making this meticulously good, this is unnecessary. You can almost smell the mud and slime on the cobblestones, hear the racket coming from the many pubs and peer into the dark back alleyways...the time and place are more than firmly established. Unlike the stage version, it's all about the characters and here we get to know them more intimately than ever before.The vocal performances don't need to be as bombastic as they are in previous versions...When you're dealing with a ten-foot wide screen, there's no need to project back into the ""cheap seats."" So, with that in mind, who comes off best and who doesn't?Johnny Depp, as would be expected, leads the way as Sweeney. He sings in a register much higher than the part calls for, but he acts the living hell out of the part, so this is a minor quibble. His is a Sweeney who wears the ravages of injustice and betrayal like an overcoat, one that is only discarded once his ""friends"" are finally in his hands. He's said that he will never do a singing role again. More's the pity, but even if he doesn't, he can consider this turn as one of the best of his career, if not THE best.Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs. Lovett is good enough to hold up in this production, but it seems as if all the loopy, twisted, sanguine JOY has been sucked out of the role. Mrs. Lovett is the love-starved, amoral and more-than-slightly bent comic relief, and it's a pity that Carter couldn't access that more. I was much more concerned with that than her singing ability or lack thereof.Sacha Baron Cohen knew EXACTLY what to do with Adolfo Pirelli, and hits his comical and sinister turn dead on. If everything else about this movie had been dreadful, he would've made it all worth it just by himself.Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall are my new heroes. Spall is every bit as foppishly, fawningly nasty as Beadle Bamford should be. And I expected no less than perfection in villainy from Rickman, who's re-written the book on it in the past two or three decades. But SINGING? I wasn't expecting that, and what a wonderful surprise it was.Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener as Anthony and Johanna, respectively, are refreshingly winsome in their roles - innocents just trying not to get devoured by darkness. It's a pity that most of their meatier numbers are cut, but here it makes sense. They are nothing more than convenient cogs in Sweeney's malevolent machine of vengeance, and as such are required to do little more than serve their purpose.One of the main performers that will have tongues wagging is Ed Sanders as Tobias Ragg. A stunning combination of both Mark Lester's and Jack Wild's characters in the movie version of OLIVER!, he is age-appropriate, but hardened, seasoned and wise beyond his years, like many of the real children described in the writings of Dickens, and the unfiltered account of Oliver Twist softened by the Broadway version. His delivery of ""Not While I'm Around"" may be one of the most poignant yet, and the dramatic arc of his character feels exactly right up to the shocking, bitter end.I hereby pronounce multiple viewings of SWEENEY TODD as essential, if only for myself, because I know there's a lot I missed the first time, as I'm sure Tim Burton planned. And I won't mind uncovering even more of the details and dark pleasures of this bracing reinterpretation of Sondheim's career-defining work.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

In the guise of the city's most promising barber, he claims vengeance against all of his 'customers' and directs his wrath toward a callous judge responsible for his downfall. Burton's penchant for rich set design isn't a surprise, yet the film still leaves you in awe with its vividly arresting scenery, exquisite wardrobe, solid casting, and terrific songs.

"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street (Tim Burton, 2007) ***","I knew of the gory exploits of the Demon Barber via the 1936 barnstorming vehicle for British ham extraordinaire Tod Slaughter, though I haven’t watched that particular film itself; on the other hand, I was vaguely aware that Stephen Sondheim had turned it into an unlikely but, by all accounts, successful musical.Tim Burton is a genuine but somewhat erratic talent but, whenever he joins forces with one of today’s finest actors – Johnny Depp – he seems to be particularly inspired, and this one’s no exception. As ever, the film’s visuals (of a seedy and forbidding 19th century London) are impeccable – and SWEENEY TODD deservedly emerged the Oscar winner in the art direction/set decoration category last Sunday night! Interestingly, Depp had never sung on film previously but he does extremely well and, indeed, figured prominently – somewhat surprisingly (this is a horror musical, after all) but rightly so, in my opinion – among the year’s Best Actor nominees; his brooding good looks are perfect for the character’s mix of pent-up emotions and cool viciousness. He’s matched by Helena Bonham-Carter, the director’s own mate, as the pie-shop owner who decides to spice up her traditional recipe – and is delighted to see the formerly dormant business flourish (with the helping hand of revenge-seeking barber Depp)! The supporting cast is headed by reliables such as Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall and newer star acts like BORAT (2006)’s Sacha Baron Cohen as a pompous traveling barber/charlatan (and, hence, a rival/victim for Todd).SWEENEY TODD has been criticized for its vigorous blood-letting, and I do concede that Burton should have restrained his predilection for these grisly scenes – since they tend to become repetitive and, eventually, lead the film towards overlength at almost two hours. A local critic whose opinion I usually respect and value was underwhelmed by the film and only gave it **; he was also unimpressed by the songs or the actors’ idiosyncratic rendition of them; I personally found Sondheim’s score quite effective and rousing at just the right moments…though, admittedly, it could also be grating i.e. whenever the actors have to sing separate choruses on top of one another. Similarly, Mrs. Lovett’s fantasy beach scene comes across as a distraction – as if we’d been suddenly thrown back to the environment of Burton’s own BIG FISH (2003)! The narrative’s overwhelming Gothic bleakness remains unrelieved till the very end – with events leading to the inevitable frenzied climax tinged with a tragic irony; we should perhaps have been allowed a ray of hope by being shown the young lovers united but, since the film is really about the plight of Depp’s character and his luckless wife, it’s appropriate that we stick with their fate.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Burton Crafts a Thrilling, Dark Tale","""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is a quite simply a masterpiece. Every aspect of the film is top-notch. The music thrills, the acting is tremendous and the look of the film dazzles. It is hard to put into words when everything in a film comes together, but I left the theatre immediately wanting to see it again.Much has been made of the gore in the film and I think that talk is largely exaggerated. The film does have its share of bloody scenes but it isn't a wall to wall blood fest. Everything is so stylized that it's really blood and brutality as high art so I found it easily tolerable and I am a squeamish person.Helena Bonham Carter is extraordinary. She brings humor and a kind of pathos to her wonderfully wacky Mrs. Lovett. Then there is Johnny Depp. He simmers with rage and aches with pain all while singing with a vocal quality that is rich and tremendously pleasing. His body language and eyes tell a story all on their own. I have always thought him to be a magnificent actor and this performance does nothing to betray that. Both Depp and Bonham Carter were up to the task and succeeded beyond my grandest expectations.",,Anonymous,Horror
It's a 'style' movie...,"I'm very thrilled about this movie, I hadn't watched anything so entertaining for a very long time.Opposing to what some people say, the drawbacks from the original story in this movie is exactly what was needed. Todd being simply a mindless murder (a.k.a 'The bad guy') just doesn't keep you entertained. This movie goes a bit deeper, trying to explore the mind of the murder, leaving space for one's own thought, not artificially trying to put on assumptions.Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is definitely my favorite movie of Year 2007. I am no big fan of either Burton or Depp, but this movie just takes you away with it's style. I'm am not even fan of musicals, but putting melody in the conversations just makes it a tad more interesting and entertaining.I hope people would more often rate movies as a piece of filmography, not conformity to some actor's usual roles, or the accordance to original story.

hmmmmm,"firstly, i hate musicals. i thought, going into this that it would have much more dialogue, and less singing, which was incorrect. there were many songs, often one after the other. i do not see what all the fanfare is about this film that everyone has been making. the singers in the film are not top notch singers, heavily hampering any enjoyment of the singing. the plot is nothing noteworthy, since it is along the lines of the count of Monte cristo, which is one of the all time greatest novels. at times, the film can lag on in some parts, and others are predictable. it is nothing out of the ordinary as far as film history is concerned and does not deserve a place on the list of the IMDb.COM 250 greatest films. all in all, though, it is a film worth seeing, but not one which deserves such high praise. it is enjoyable and an experience, as with all Burton films.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"The darkest, bloodiest, and most disturbing musical ever","The darkest, bloodiest, and most disturbing musical I've ever seen, that's one thing for sure. This is the musical material that suits best for Tim Burton. The musical and the surrounding sets are really blending well. It creates an experience only Tim Burton can offer. This is what ""The Phantom of the Opera"" should have looks like, but unfortunately didn't because it falls into Schumacher hands.The movie is not without flaws. Tim Burton trimmed down 3 hours musical into 2 hours. The result is obvious in here. Johanna (Jayne Wisener) and Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower) in this movie is nothing more than an additional character, while the relationship between Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) and Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) in the beginning is never well explained. Even Sweeney Todd motives in this movie besides revenge were not well explains. If he knows that Johanna still alive, why it seems like he never try to find her?But despite the flaws, there something great in the movie that makes me want to watch it again. This is definitely not a movie for everyone. For a person who doesn't like musical, this movie might pretty hard to digest. For a person who can not stand gore, this musical might be to violence for their taste. But if you are a musical lover that still can stand with the gore, this movie is the one to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Visually stunning, shame about the singing.","I know a little about ""Sweeny Todd"", but I haven't seen any other films/TV Shows or read any books based on the legend, which makes this my first experience with it; and I'm highly disappointed. The disappointment grows further because this story and Tim Burton's directorial style are clearly a match made in heaven - but for some reason, a terrible decision was made on how the film would work and it's spoilt something that could have been great. I would write a song about this film's main problem - but I'd prefer to clearly state that it's the musical elements that spoil it. The plot is rich with horrific elements and should be a great base for a gory Gothic horror film. We focus on Benjamin Barker; better known as Sweeny Todd, a barber returning to London for revenge against all those that have wronged him. Upon his return to the capital, he meets Mrs. Lovett, the owner of a pie shop where ""The Worst Pies in London"" are made. If I made the worst pies in London, I'd keep my mouth shut about it - but she sings songs instead and unsurprisingly her shop isn't doing very well. Anyway, Sweeny Todd opens up a barbers shop upstairs and his lust for killing soon combines with her need for meat to put in pies.I have to say that the film looks great. Tim Burton has his own directorial style and it translates to the screen very well here and aesthetically, every scene is a joy to behold. The good points continue with the cast; Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to watch and he clearly relishes this role, while Mrs Tim Burton; Helena Bonham Carter, does well starring opposite and the director has also done a good job recruiting some good British talent to fill the supporting roles. The film is also rather graphic and Burton provides the viewers with some real nasty sights including a spate of throat slashing that result in blood spraying everywhere, a succession of corpses falling through a trapdoor and hitting the ground with a brutal thud as well as a machine that grinds Sweeny Todd's victims into pie meat. This is all well and good but it all comes down to the execution, and the musical elements really spoil it. Many reviewers have said that the horror and musical elements bode well in this film; but for me it really doesn't work. It comes off as being almost cringe-worthy in places and constantly forced me to ask myself WHY they made this a musical (I know there was a musical version of this story, but there's also several none musical versions). Another problem with the music is that it all sounds very similar and the songs are not very diverse. The first hour or so is really rather boring anyway and the constant singing soon starts to grate. Things improve massively towards the end and despite a couple of songs; the final half hour is really quite good. Overall, I love the atmosphere and the gore of this film - but I can't get on with the musical elements at all, which unfortunately means that a film which could have been a masterpiece is sadly not much better than passable. A shame.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"still makes the ""cut"", even after twelve years","Tim Burton has taken everything to the extreme with his adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"". I saw the stage production back in 1996 when it came to Portland. Obviously, the movie version had to remove a few things, but they still did a really good job with it.Johnny Depp is just great as Sweeney Todd/Benjamin Barker: with ghostly white makeup and jet black hair - except for a white streak - he looks like something out of a 1930s horror flick (many of which had the same setting as this movie). Equally menacing is Helena Bonham Carter as his partner-in-crime, pie maker Mrs. Lovett: looking almost exactly like her role as Bellatrix LaStrange in the Harry Potter movies, she's the perfect cross between scary and sexy. Alan Rickman -who seems to be channeling his role as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter movies - turns Judge Turpin into one nasty dude: it's hard not to wish that corrupt thug ill. Sacha Baron Cohen...well, although it's hard to imagine him as anyone other than Borat, he plays Adolfo Pirelli to a tee. Timothy Spall, as Turpin's assistant Beadle Bamford, creates the same kind of weaselly character that he played in the Harry Potter movies and ""Enchanted""; you gotta admire this character!Yet another character - so to speak - is the setting. We see London as an ugly, dark, nearly pestilent place. All in all, this combination creates a very fine film. Not Burton's best in my opinion (I consider ""Ed Wood"" his best), but a true accomplishment. And remember: desperate times require desperate measures.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007),"Directed by Tim Burton. Starring Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Ed Sanders, Jamie Campbell Bower, Jayne Wisener, Sacha Baron Cohen, Laura Michelle Kelly. (R)Dark but dazzling adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim/Hugh Wheeler musical infuses the Grand Guignol with toe-tapping melody, an operatic tragedy with the cold steel of a slasher and the pounding heart of a hopeless romantic. Burton didn't seem a likely candidate to ever helm a snazzy song-and-dancer, but who else but him could bring this deliciously sordid story to life on the big screen? By dropping much of the dancing and group choruses and focusing on intimate musical performances driven by the plot, emotions, and inner thoughts of the characters, Burton does what few movie musicals ever have: near-total immersion in the (heightened) reality of the narrative. Strong production values (set designer Dante Ferretti already knew a thing or two about infernal urban slop of the 19th century with ""Gangs of New York"") and top-notch casting of the leads--not to mention a memorably flamboyant turn from Cohen as a rival barber--make up for the occasional lull and a few too many unvaried throat slittings. In both their performances and the characters they play (equally insipid), Bower and Wisener's would-be-lovers spoil the ghoulishly glorious fun almost every time they show up, but it's a small price to pay for the opportunity to see Depp show more affection for shiny straight razors than for Carter's aroused meat pie vendor downstairs. Per Sondheim, the only film version of his work that has his approval.81/100",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
There's a Hole in the World,"Greetings again from the darkness. Upfront admission ... I am a huge Tim Burton fan. I think he is a film genius. Unlike many, however, I don't believe this is his best work. Still, it is incredibly creative and stylish. It's just missing something.For a musical, the lead voices are mediocre at best. Rickman is barely passable. Young Ed Sanders who plays Toby had far and away the most impressive voice, while newcomer Jayne Wisener (Johanna) has such a high pitch that it made me wish for her parakeet to chirp instead. Depp and Bonham Carter are OK, but one expects stronger vocals for a Stephen Sondheim production.Be prepared for an overdose of spurting blood, but there is enough comic distraction to offset. Sacha Baron Cohen has a funny bit as a con man/ competing barber and Timothy Spall is just so funny looking that you can't help but chuckle whenever his ugly mug hits the screen.Still not sure what was missing here, but I felt it falls short of greatness despite the amazing visual feast of Bonham Carter's dream. Of course it goes without saying that the great Sondheim songs are pure brilliance. His talent is so unique when compared to most Broadway production numbers.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I really HATE musicals!,"Yes, I really do have a strong distaste for musicals. Ever since I was a young boy way back in the 20th century I could never get my head around people bursting into song at seemingly random points throughout a film. I couldn't have cared less if a spoon full of sugar helped some medicine go down or following a road made up of yellow bricks.I remember feeling disappointed that Mr Depp was starring in a musical when this film came out. I mean, why couldn't they just make a 'normal' film about Sweeney Todd sans all the singing!?Anyway, years later curiosity and a a bit of maturity (only a bit mind you) got the better of me and after seeing some clips on YouTube I decided to purchase said film.Well, today it arrived and today I did watch and I can't quite believe I'm about to say this but - THIS IS SUCH A DAMN FINE MOVIE!

A Close Shave,"I enjoy Tim Burton for a few reasons, mostly concerning his style of view, he is very Gothic and dark and his newest movie Sweeny Todd is no exception. It has the very same tone and coloring as Sleepy Hollow and the same musical numbers as Corpse Bride or Nightmare before Christmas. The story tells of a barber whose wife is stolen by the town's judge, while he was sentenced and banished. Upon returning back to the town, he seeks revenge on the judge and befriends a woman who makes horrible meat pies. But he later starts killing just for fun. This movie has the Burton feel that I was looking for, the makeup, including blood, was excellent, as well as wardrobe, the acting was okay and so was the musical numbers and the murders were very.awkward. I enjoyed this film, not the best Tim Burton can do, but a great film nonetheless.To kick it off, the art direction, as well as the makeup and wardrobe were outstanding! Like I said, this movie had the standard Burton feel of being dark and gloomy, with many shades of grey and white. There were some musty tones and some bright sunny tones, just like Sleepy Hollow. The architecture of some of the houses did not have the Burton feel like crooked framework, weird designs and awkward shaped trees. The makeup was amazing! Each person had the pale-faced look with dark shadows under the eyes, they had that really Gothic look but at the same time they accomplished the feel of 18th or 19th century look. The wardrobes in this film were really good, better than Sleepy Hollow, and they seemed more complex in look. The three costumes I really enjoyed is Mrs. Lovett's, Judge Turpin's and Pirelli's. This movie has to win something for Best Costuming if not Art Direction.The acting was okay, as was the musical numbers. Depp's performance as Sweeney Todd was pretty good and seemed like a sober Jack Sparrow, however, I did not think that his full acting abilities were met in this film, but it still was pretty great. Helena Bonham Carter, who plays Mrs. Lovett, was, sad to say, better than Johnny. She really brought depth and feel to her character. Her character also seemed to have the better one-liners too. There were great performances by Timothy Spall, Laura Michelle Kelley, Ed Sanders and Jamie Bower. Alan Richman had a small part, but for a small part, he seemed pretty good, a bit too ""light"" though. Sacha Baron Cohen, actually seemed creepy and disturbed, but I can't pass up the fact that he is Borat. The musical numbers were.interesting. The lyrics were very well written and the way that each is played out was great, but the actors and actresses who sand seemed as though they were trying not to laugh. I don't think that Depp, Cohen or Richman can sing, or Spall. But the manner in which they carried out, I enjoyed.The horror in this film was very Burton-like. However, this movie does not have any ""jump-out"" scares but rather the goriness and the implied horror approach. Gore: Tim Burton has a nack for gory movies and this movie is no exception, with extremely bloody throat slitting, blood letting and neck breaking, this movie accomplishes its fair share of red colors. The blood is his ""trademark"" blood, from Sleepy Hollow, as in, thick, red and viscous, rather than what blood should look like. The implied horror is there, especially when it involves its own musical number and the meat pies. Another great example of implied horror is the whole idea of a tragic hero turned murder, almost poetic in the sense of a man who lost everything. But other than that, it is not as scary as some of Burton's other work.Overall, this movie is a pretty good movie; it has everything that a horror musical should have; gore, implied horror, murder, music and Tim Burton. Even though the character could have put a bit more effort in this film, they did a pretty great job with what they had. This film was a very interesting film and something different for Tim Burton. I honestly think that this film was not as big of a hype as many people and web-sites made it, but it did not let my faith in Tim Burton disappear, but it wasn't an epic musical. I would recommend this movie to horror fans, but with a warning that the musical number can be a bit distracting. As for musical buffs, the gore might steer you away from this film. As for me, I enjoyed it because I'm well rounded and it really gave me a close shave.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Do you like cheese with your crackers?,"One could honestly say, that Tim Burton is a legend in film making. His dark approach to films, that gets you under your skin and doesn't hold back. Quite often he's attempted to try his hand at other things, such as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""The Corpse Bride"", which do the trick, if your a goth. Unfortunately, even the best have their off days, and this shows why you should stick to what you know, rather than be a jack of all trades.With Johnny Depp playing really vital roles in the majority of Burton's films such as ""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"", Burton continue's his tradition of plonking the main role for Depp as Benjamin Barker. Judge Turpin (played by Mr. Bad himself, Alan Rickman) deports Benjamin Barker for a crime he did not commit, leaving Turpin to Barkers wife and daughter for the taking! With his wife dead, Barker returns to London to find salvation and seek revenge on the Judge.With this, the story itself is brilliantly portrayed, Burton sprinkles his dark, moody, bloody self all over it. And thats brilliant.What kills the whole film for me, and I didn't realise this upon entering the cinema screen, was the fact it was originally based on a Broadway musical. Way to go Burton! You've just made me pay £7.50 for what can only be described as your brilliant dark and dirty mind (which is what I love about Burton) ruined with the Broadway cheese wiped all over a pretty decent excuse for a film! From start to finish, you get cheese, cheese and more cheese. Actors who wouldn't really sing, trying to sing with dodgy cockney accents. Its been tried and tested before, and it didn't work. Oh, and abit of over the top blood for the sake of blood.The only salvation in this film, is the fact that the supporting cast do really well to pull the film back on track. Sacha Boren Cohen shows how much of a multi talent he is as the mischeivous Pirelli, Timothy Spall also, shows how much of a talented actor he is, by being the dogs body for Judge Turpin, but it just doesn't hide the fact, that these actors should not be in a god damn musical. Even Depp, who I do hold high in esteem for his acting, can't face the music for this poor excuse of a role. At points, he even seems like he doesn't care. Like a bad Jack Sparrow.To be honest, people who are voting this film extremely high 8, 9 or 10's, should be ashamed of themselves. This isn't Pirates folks, its Tim Burton picking at genre's he shouldn't be touching.If you do like musicals, you will love this, and you will love it even more because Johnny Depp is in it, and you obviously like Andrew Lloyd-Webber. If you don;t like musicals, simply avoid this movie, you won't like it going in, and you won't like it coming out. Even if you TRY and cover up the fact its a musical, it still won't work.

One of Johnny Deep's best performance.,"While I've never been a die-hard fan of musicals, especially those with a theatrical flair, something about Tim Burton's 2007 film 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' sets it apart. Thanks to its unique elements and Burton's signature style, it's one of the few musicals I've genuinely enjoyed.What can I say about this movie that has yet to be said? Johhny Depp is incredible in this, and his performance is so magnetic you can't help but feel the energy he resonates on screen. I sometimes wanted the movie to cut back to him whenever it focused on Jamie Campbell Bower's Anthony character. Don't get me wrong, he's not bad in this, but this movie belongs to Johhny and, secondly, Queen Helena Bonham Carter. These two make this movie. They carry it on their backs. The rest of the cast is fantastic, including the late Alan Rickman.While the film has many strengths, I must admit that I found the love story between Anthony and Johanna a bit underwhelming. It seemed to lack the depth and substance that I was hoping for, and I found myself less engaged whenever the film focused on their story.The movie looks great, and the visuals pop alongside London's vivid and gloomy backdrop. The costume design by Colleen Atwood is excellent, and the score and music are captivating. I enjoyed this movie and its twist in the third act (although predictable).I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Tim Burton, the cast, or musicals. This film is a treat for all enthusiasts, and it's a must-watch for those who appreciate the unique blend of Burton's style and the musical genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sacha Baron Cohen was quite bizarre. The first half of the film was rather stylish and moving, with barely any on-screen violence, but the second half was just an all out blood feast, littered with spraying arteries, broken bones, and sliced flesh. It's all rather foul, but the film still feels alive despite having a lot of washed out colors and pale skin. If you don't mind A LOT of blood and gore, it's probably worth seeing.

"Good, but. . .","I'm in the minority, but I actually didn't like it as much as I was expecting to. It was good and well-done, but I went into it expecting the amazing movie that I'd heard so much about and left feeling disappointed. Maybe if I were to see it again I might appreciate it more. It's hard to finger exactly what disappointed me, but I guess it was just that everything could have been done better, at least to me. In one review I read it stated that the show had been cut from over three hours to just over two without losing anything. I disagree. I felt that a lot of characterization was lost and that everything moved very, very fast. I know Helena Bonham Carter legitimately won the part of Mrs. Lovett, and she was very good, but I couldn't ignore that nagging feeling that other actresses might have been better. And I love, love, love Johnny Depp, but I couldn't help but feel his performance was a little...one note. Yes, it once again displays his chameleon talent and yes he nailed the part, but there wasn't that much to nail. There are several scenes where he's very good, but several where he gets easily overshadowed by others on screen. He also hardly speaks, Mrs. Lovett had a bigger part than him. Judge Turpin's lecherousness could have been fleshed out a lot more.On the whole, it was very good, the style was great, the actors as an ensemble were great, but I guess to me, once I start examining the separate parts, it suffers.I still say it is definitely worth seeing, but I'm not sure I would name it the best movie of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better Than I Remembered,"I first watched this film with a few of my friends in high school after they spent a good hour or so praising the picture, and mostly wrote the whole thing off as nothing special, alike to 'Sleepy Hollow.' I must not have been paying much attention because this is a cult classic for a reason.Tim Buton was the only real choice to make this picture as his trademark style lends super well to this kind of story. The way he keeps the film mostly dull with the notable exception of the spectacular and visceral scenes of blood is amazing. Other beautiful shots include when Todd looks through the furnace toward the end of the film, fully transforming into the demon barber of the title. I remember finding the vocals grating on my first watch, but the entire cast does an amazing job especially given many of the main cast had never sung before.This is pretty much universally accepted as one of the best broadway adaptations and I have a hard time arguing. The poetic irony of the finale and the unique setting provide it a free ticket to live in one's mind rent-free, permanently. A picture I simply have to revisit every October.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"good adaptation, but a little stagey","Tim Burton and his collaborators did a fine job translating the essence of the Stephen Sondheim's stage musical to the big screen. The grim story and haunting music seem tailormade for Burton, and the casting was dead-on, from Johnny Depp as the revenge-bent barber, to the trio of young unknowns in the supporting cast.My main gripe is that the adaption doesn't really advance visually from the stage production. As in the play, there are only a couple of sets, but given the drab color palette, relatively ordinary shot compositions, and somewhat banal character design (Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter are made up like stereotypical Burton goths), the aesthetics never truly transcend their stage roots. The adaption succeeds because the source material is rendered faithfully and skillfully, but as a movie it still feels a bit like a filmed play. With a more expansive set design, and perhaps a few inspired twists and innovations with the characters and musical arrangements, the movie could have taken the play to a more cinematically expressive level. Nonetheless, it works as an effective (and bloodier) version of the play, while exposing a new generation of fans to Sondheim's eerie and clever songs.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rubbish,"I had high hopes for this film but was bitterly bitterly disappointed. A quick word to Tim Burton just because everything is a shade of grey does not make it atmospheric, it's lazy film making. It shows you couldn't be bothered to express it in other ways. The film should've been great but thanks to one miserable dirge after another and pretty much nothing happening for forty odd minutes I was wishing I could get in the film so he could slit my throat! I only watched the film last night and can't remember a single song, despite the fact they are almost always singing. Johnny Depp gives his jack sparrow act another dust off, the only difference being the wig and make up, seriously the voice and accent is exactly the same. the set pieces are all so bland and the characters are never fully developed that it is hard to care what happens at all. a very very poor film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a brilliant musical horror movie!,"This was a first time watch for me and this was my first time hearing about Sweeney Todd, when if you exclude that one episode of The Office. Regardless of that, I just got done watching this movie and it was awesome.Positives for Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007):
The production value and setting design of this movie is looks gorgeous from start to finish, but then again that's one of Tim Burton's greatest strengths as a filmmaker. The musical numbers in this movie are spectacular and catchy. The performances from the entire cast are phenomenal from Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Sasha Baron Cohen and even Jamie Campbell Bower in his feature film acting debut. And finally, the gore effects in this movie are spectacular.Overall, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) is a spectacular musical horror movie and that's saying a lot given that there aren't a lot of those movies out there.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Johnny Frickin Depp,"Horror, humor, bloodshed, music, and Johnny Depp all in one movie. In Sweeney Todd, Evil Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) lusts for the beautiful wife of a London barber (Johnny Depp) and transports him to Australia for a crime he did not commit. Returning after 15 years and calling himself Sweeney Todd, the now-mad man vows revenge, applying his razor to unlucky customers and shuttling the bodies down to Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), who uses them in her meat-pie shop. Though many fall to his blade, he will not be satisfied until he slits Turpin's throat.It finds a remarkable Johnny Depp in one of his best performances ever alongside Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, and Timothy Spall who complete this luxury cast, which is one of the most talented casts assembled in a musical. Tim Burton brings this cast together to create an amazing adaptation of the 1973 play. The amazing visuals, motion picture, astounding music, and many other factors contributed to making this film the masterpiece that it is. With that being said, Tim Burton and Sweeney Todd truly deserved the Academy Award for Best Art direction.I normally always try to predict what's going to happen next in many movies, but I failed to do so in this movie, as something different (and better) than my expectations was being delivered, showing how well written this movie is. The movie is a musical; however, you just don't feel like it is. The lyrics are perfectly written in a way to make the songs seem like they're a normal part of the script. Depp and Helena both have incredible voices, and they were so hauntingly beautiful and magical together. It's like these roles were made for them.To sum up, this movie is just a joy to listen to and watch from beginning to end. Highly recommend.Score: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent,"The beauty of this movie is impossible to phrase in words, it truly encapsulates the purity of the play. Johnny Depp's performance is exceptional, as-well as the other talented actors & actresses who not only embodied the role but also have truly given it a new light. Tim burton, as always gave this movie the touch it needed to become an absolute classic, with the dark tone that is bestowed through the movie you truly feel sympathy to the barber of Fleet Street. The characters are engaging, detailed and have true essence behind Their act. A definite classic, a class movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Agree, Good but","I admit never seeing the play Sweeney Todd so I guess I was a bit naive going into this film; I thought the play was a comedy and so I thought the movie would be the same- murder and mayhem with humor. Sadly this isn't. Yes Johnny Depp is his usual good, somber self and Helena Bonham Carter matches him and get the few laughs there are. But the movie leaves you as cold and the many slit throat bodies that pile up and it gets very tiresome very quickly. In fact what could have been a great love story, Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett, Sweeney and his former wife, Anthony and Johanna is reduced to slick blood and blank stares. Tim Burton is too much in love with his one sided view of Johnny Depp. He needs to look a little deeper and he should have looked a little deeper into this story as well. Then he could have made a great movie and we could sure use one this year.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Somber, fun and unique","I'm not partial to musicals or Tim Burton's style, so this was a new experience for me. And I have to say, I liked it. It kept me off my phone and I was really engaged in the story. Johnny Depp did his thing. If anyone knows how to play a kooky whimsical character from a dark fantasy, it's him. I loved the gloomy visuals. They captured what anyone would envision a sad, polluted 1800s storybook London to look like. I loved how the characters were styled. Vintage and detailed. Helena Carter looks beautiful. Despite both her and Mr. Todd making some poor decisions, you can't help but feel sorry for them both. This movie ends in tragedy, but despite that, it has its funny, ironic moments. I've never seen a horror combined with a musical, but I loved it. Certainly far from childish as it's very macabre. But the violence is theatrical, it kind of reminds me of Kill Bill almost. So I didn't flinch too much. The story was interesting too, with some engaging twists. The characters are not heroes. Mr. Todd is a sick man consumed by his inability to move on and he hurts the people around him in the process. It's certainly a memorable flick and I think anyone would be entranced by its charm. I mean, I enjoyed it and I don't even like musicals!! It's a fun time, give it a try. Overall a really cool, absurd adaptation of an old legend.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tim Burton's dark opera,"Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) returns to London with friend Anthony Hope after being falsely convicted by Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). He returns to his shop above Mrs. Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) and her worst pies in London. She tells him that Turpin lusted after his wife Lucy and abused her to death with his henchman Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall). Turpin has taken his daughter Johanna Barker as his charge. Anthony falls for Johanna who is imprisoned in her gilded cage and is beaten by Beadle. Benjamin takes on the new identity of Sweeney Todd. He wins a battle with traveling barber Adolfo Pirelli (Sacha Baron Cohen) and reopens his barber shop.It's a cold, brutal, dark musical. The performances are brilliant especially Depp. The coloring, the dreamlike visual, and the brutal style are all compelling. The blood-splattering slices are wonderful. The whole movie has a dark menacing beauty about it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"i prefer the stage production, but this is good too","Upset that they didnt add the ballads that the choir does throughout the show onstage.

Deliciously Grim,"Let me say from the outset that even I - as a self-confessed aficionado of music - was unprepared for the sheer volume of songs in this movie. That said, everyone acquitted themselves well, and yes - at times, Johnny Depp did produce shades of Bowie in his voice. For me, Helena Bonham-Carter was equally as good as Depp, if not the best thing in this movie. She seems to have come a long way in her range of characters since hooking up with Mr. Burton. Both leads clearly enjoyed themselves in what turned out to be a memorable and thought provoking film. People have said that this is a musical, but I actually felt that it was verging on opera. A couple of beautifully delicious twists at the end made for an experience as memorable as one of Mrs Lovatt's world-famous pies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Film,"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007)*** (out of 4)Horror-musical about the one and only Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) who slashes throats as a barber and sends the flesh downstairs to Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) so that she can make her meat pies. All of this so that Sweeney can seek vengeance against the man (Alan Rickman) who stole his wife and child. I've yet to see a review who mentioned the 1936 Tod Slaughter film but I'll do so right now. There's no question this is a better version but in the end I've never hated a film that I loved so much. There's so much brilliance in this film that it's a shame I didn't enjoy it more but the first thirty-minutes were somewhat brutal for me. I really wasn't enjoying any of the songs nor was I enjoying any of the build up of the characters. I thought the songs were rather weak and the film took way too long to get to the build up, which finally happens when Sacha Baron Cohen's character hits the screen. This is when the story of the vengeance starts to unfold and this is when Burton and the cast really starts to shine. I'm not sure what it was but this is when the film took off for me and Depp really started to shine in what has to be one of his greatest performances. Yes, he's not much of a singer but I think he actually did great during the songs that deal with anger. When Depp let his voice go in anguish screams I thought the songs were very powerful. Carter can't sing that well either but I think the songwriters and Burton did a nice job of hiding this by giving her songs some nice comic touching, which the actress nailed perfectly. The ending of the film is highly dramatic is quite beautiful as is most of the visuals in the film. I hate CGI but thought Burton used it very well here in this fantasy world. I was also shocked at how bloody and violent this film was with all the throat slashings. Burton lets the blood flow very deep so I'm shocked so many people were going to see the film. Perhaps a second viewing will let me enjoy the start of the film more but there's still plenty of stuff here to love but I couldn't help wish that I had loved all of it.",,Anonymous,Horror
Stunning Nightmare of Humor Filled with Bloody Revenge,"As I have heard of this movie, I went to see it on the big screen not so much due to the story but foremost because of Johnny Depp whose latest performances have occurred to me as outstanding. His dark role in THE LIBERTINE, his moving depiction in FINDING NEVERLAND or his interesting portrayals in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN result in pretty successful movies. Therefore, for me, SWEENEY TODD was, I could say, a true vehicle for a celebrity. And I was not disappointed: Johnny Depp does a terrific job as Benjamin Barker - a riddle man, with almost a demon-like spell whose new shop trembles the London of his time. Yet, what else is there left in the film that one could find worth seeing?It is true that SWEENEY TODD is a very macabre story, which is executed in an explicit way. It's for sure not a film for youngsters or sensitive people who easily get into changeable moods. Since there are lots of scenes when the main character simply cuts the throats of his customers and throws the bodies into the ""cellar kitchen"", it's naturally harmful and not easy to bear. How can the blood spouting from the throats be not disturbing and disgusting? Considering this aspect only, I certainly do find the film harmful. As I have discussed this aspect in many of my comments, I could again ask the same question: What is the idea of showing such terrible acts and, moreover, making fun of murder? However, if you look at this movie from a different perspective, then you will notice something captivating. Therefore, let me skip the moral side in the content and try to analyze SWEENEY TODD solely as the movie.The film will stun you as a very well managed direction with marvelous cinematography, perfect camera-work, wonderful shots, breathtaking reconstruction of London and, to my great surprise, good musical features. If you consider the scenes in the streets of London, you realize that attention is being paid to every single detail. The mood supplied by cinematography and shots is unforgettable. As for musical, SWEENEY TODD can boast something many musicals lack nowadays - genuineness. Sometimes, musicals are filled with fake moments that discourage many people. Consequently, they claim to detest musicals. This one, however, is valuable. It has all the convincing themes a good musical should have: love, revenge, sorrow, a bit of sentimentality and a visual aspect enriched and embedded by music.But the true advantage of the movie are many leading performances. Except for the aforementioned Johnny Depp, I very much liked Helena Bonham Carter in the role of Mrs Lovett, Alan Rickman as the villain Jugge Turnip (does he always have to play the villains?) and deliciously beautiful Jane Wisener in the role of Johanna. Who can forget the moment Jugde Turnip visits Mr Todd for the first time? The expression on the face of Johanna while Anthony sings ""I feel you...I'll steal you"" is also memorable. But, indeed there are also performances that leave much to be desired. I did not like Jamie Campbell Bower in the role of Anthony. He should have put more heart into his performance. It seems that he does not feel the role whatsoever!All in all, what to think of SWEENEY TODD? After seeing the macabre and unpredictable ending, you may have mixed feelings about particular scenes and about the movie in general. What is it? a horror? a thriller? a dark comedy? or just a movie meant to shock and entertain at the same time? It is, for sure, a bloody revenge and a nightmare, perhaps, but a stunning one with a dark sense of humor. Strange mix, indeed but worth a look.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Wonderful, but not quite satisfying","I just got back from the midnight showing, and being a HUGE fan of Sweeney Todd prior to seeing the movie, I was prepared to be awed. While I loved it, I felt it was lacking in a couple of areas.Maybe I am overly-used to seeing the character of Mrs. Lovett played by Angela Lansbury, but I felt Helena Bonham Carter was lacking a bit of the energy and sparkle that I think is necessary in that character. The story, though dark, needs a bit of comedy.I was also disappointed that there were a few scenes/songs missing. Perhaps I'm being too nit-picky here, but I think there were valuable scenes of Anthony and Johanna left out.I would like to say, after my criticism, the film was wonderfully directed and photographed. It was a true Tim Burton piece. So, if you love Tim Burton and have a slightly twisted (or very twisted) sense of humor, go, enjoy the film. You will be glad you did.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another Burton masterpiece.,"A Burton work in the truest sense. Sure it's an adaptation but it feels like something he actually created and his direction is flawless. It's filled with everything he brings to his best films; dark, poetic beauty and aesthetically gorgeous but haunting visuals. His style is at an all time high as he perfectly crafts this dreary London and all of the characters within it (the costume design is also some of the best I've ever seen). All of the songs are so phenomenal combining vocal power and intensity with wonderfully unique and fun rhythm, while having sometimes hilarious and always dark lyrics.The performances all combine to be one of my favorite ensembles of the year. Depp is as good as ever. His raspy voice is perfect for the vengeful, murder-driven mind of Sweeney Todd. Likewise, Helena Bonham Carter's exhausted voice is the perfect embodiment of Mrs. Lovett's internal anguish while her adorable appearance is so cute. She was absolutely perfect for this role (just as Depp was for Todd) and perfectly captures the love that Lovett has for Sweeney, which makes the ending that much more devastating. The rest of the cast is exceptional. Rickman and Spall have a lot of fun with their characters. Jamie Bower and Laura Kelly bring some of the best vocals I've ever heard. But the real surprise of the film was the young Ed Sanders who creates one of the most sympathetic and warm characters I've seen in quite a while. The power of his voice is truly stunning. Of course Sacha Baron Cohen is also there and Burton took the best approach possible with him. Cohen is funny in the time that he's there, but Burton was wise and gave him the axe (erm, knife) before he was on screen long enough to become unbearably annoying.Of course behind every film I love, there is a story that I adore. On the surface, basically none of the characters are likable but somehow the story makes Todd and Lovett two of the most sympathetic characters I've seen in quite sometime. It makes their actions perfectly understandable, however absurd and sinful they are. I was behind Todd every step of the way and wanted him to succeed in every aspect of his murderous plot. A phenomenal film in every way that truly lived up to my original expectations.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd...,"Sweeney Todd, the film version of Stephen Sondheim's critically-acclaimed 1978 Broadway play, is perfect in every way imaginable. Tim Burton's best film so far, Sweeney Todd is a movie-musical unlike anything you've ever seen. Its Gothic tone, its dark grays and blacks, its massively creative cinematography, and its beautiful lyrics, songs, and acting are a welcome treat to the amazing year of 2007. Sweeney Todd is directed by Tim Burton and stars Helena Bonham Carter, Johnny Depp, Alan Rickman, Sasha Baron Cohen, and Timothy Spall.Years ago, a barber by the name of Benjamin Barker and his lovely wife and their child were torn apart when a wicked judge sent Barker away for life on ""a fool's charge."" Judge Turpin was simply a jealous monster who craved the attention of the beautiful wife. Now, almost fifteen years later, Barker returns to London under the alias Sweeney Todd. It is virtually unknown as to how he escaped, but the audience doesn't need to know: the story is captivating, and the movie relies a lot on your imagination, putting a previously unforeseen amount of faith in the audience. Sweeney returns to his old residence to find it utterly abandoned, apart from a wise and suspicious figure known as Mrs. Lovett, who tells him from the moments she sees him that she has ""the worst pies in London."" The two of them make for an unexpected duo when Todd starts killing off some of his old rivals with the sharp blade of the barber's razor.The movie is undeniably bloody. That's the first thing that everyone has to know. The blood is over-the-top, though, on purpose. The blood isn't supposed to gross you out, it's supposed to be a character all its own. With all of the dark hues and blacks everywhere, the blood serves as a frightening contrast with Sweeney's spiraling madness. The bright colors are so noticeable that it's no wonder the upbeat number ""By the Sea"" works so well; it shows viewers a world different from this one, where everything is bright and pretty and colorful. Mrs. Lovett has fallen so completely and totally in love with Sweeney that when we finally glimpse what she's thinking, it is beyond beautiful in some strange and twisted way.The thing that makes this film work so well is the poetic and tragic story that unfolds in front of you. Underneath all of the beautiful lyrics and songs lies a completely enthralling journey into madness. It seems that by the film's end almost every character is driven completely insane. The ending is so perfect in its beauty, but it's definitely a very strange ending.The acting in Sweeney Todd was absolutely phenomenal. Obviously Johnny Depp was spectacular, and I was particularly surprised by his vocals, which were extremely rough and reminded me of a rock-type voice. His performance as Sweeney Todd was my favorite by him; it was even better than his absolutely groundbreaking performance as Edward Scissorhands. Helena Bonham Carter was the best surprise; her vocals were sugary sweet and amazing, her acting was perfect, and Helena herself is quite stunning. Baron Cohen was hilarious as Pirelli, and it was great fun seeing him in that role. The scene where he sang was laugh-out-loud funny, and his character was quite a monster! Ed Sanders was fantastic as Toby, and he can really carry a note! Alan Rickman was just as deliciously evil as I was expecting him to be. His singing voice sounded exactly like his talking voice, but it worked well enough. Timothy Spall just annoys me; I don't know what it is exactly, but he just really annoys me. When he started to sing, I literally gasped aloud.While I have never seen the play on Broadway, I think that Sweeney Todd was absolutely incredible. Tim Burton was the perfect director to helm the film, and the cast couldn't have been more perfect. The soundtrack and all of the songs were sensational, and the ending was simply poetic. Sweeney Todd was not just one of the best movies of 2007, but one of the best movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tough one; Depp may just save it,"OK, I've written a few reviews for IMDb but this may just be the toughest one yet. Basically, the plot follows the story of wrongfully convicted Benjamin Barker, returning to London under the assumed name of Sweeney Todd to exact revenge for his conviction. I will leave it at that so as not to give much away because the plot of the movie is definitely worth seeing.I am a HUGE fan of Depp and while I thought a musical may be stretching things a bit I decided to see what one of my favorite actors has done with the role. I suppose one benefit I had was that I hadn't seen the Broadway production the film is based on so I can thus judge it as it is. I found Depp to be positively chilling. The menace and danger he exudes are obviously necessary to portray Benjamin Barker adequately however only an actor as good as Depp can deliver such traits with a sense of style. Helen Bonham Carter also throws in a good performance as Mrs. Lovett and in fact most of the supporting cast do a good job...apart maybe from Sacha Baron Cohen with whom for some reason I couldn't quite get Borat and Ali G out of my mind whenever he came on screen which, thankfully, was for a short time.The movie's plot is intriguing and gripping however, as this is a musical the stand out feature should be the music and I'm afraid in this instance it isn't. I may not be the biggest fan of musicals but I have seen and enjoyed a few but I'm afraid the music here just doesn't satisfy. I didn't have much of a problem with the singing; actually I thought that was pretty good, it was the lyrics and the musical choices that I found inadequate. Nonetheless, it is not the best musical but it is far from being a terrible one; it is fair.The film is very gory especially at the end and at some stage you just think to yourself ""enough already!"". It is overly gory and the same effect of obsession and menace in Barker/Todd could have been achieved with a lot less blood. The level of gore is about the only definite negative point on this movie.Depp yet again shines brightest and proves once again why he should be considered one of the best and most versatile actors! His performance for me dragged the movie/musical out of mediocrity but another kudos should go to Burton's wonderful portrayal of Fleet Street and London as dark and sinister with characters to match.This is turning into a rather lengthy post so I will wrap up now. As I said in the title this is a tough one. From a musical point of view this is average, however, Depp's performance and the plot do elevate this movie slightly and as such, instead of 5/10 I will give it 7. I would recommend this movie unless you have a problem with bloody, graphic scenes though also note not to expect much of the music. See it for the plot and for Depp and Carter's chillingly good performances.Oh, just one final thought, there are many reviewers here giving this movie 1/10 yet the overall rating is still an impressive and accurate 7.7/10. This should tell you that people who didn't like it are in the small minority. Heck, if Roger Ebert can give this movie 4/4 it is definitely worth a see!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Eye-Rolling Insult To Sweeney Todd,"Goddammit Tim, must you ruin *everything* that's good? The original Broadway production and score of Sweeney Todd are brilliant and nuanced, balancing subtle notes of humor and horror, tenderness and savagery, lightness and dark, often within singular characters. Burton just suffocates it all in black tar and stage blood with all the sophistication and discernment of a 13-year-old suburbanite giggling at slasher comics in his basement.It is clear that Burton didn't really want to make a musical in the first place and thus all the numbers come off as reluctant obligations rather than the vital organs of the film. Additionally, if you are going to make a musical, it is important that your actors can actually bloody SING! Depp employs a bad alt-rock whine while Helena Bonham Carter deadpans/talks her way through what are supposed to be giddy, effervescent, and funny songs with the bored resignation of a corpse bride waiting for her paycheck. Considering the heartbreaking beauty, dynamism, and texture of the original score, this rendering comes across as merely a self-serving insult to its source.It is thus difficult to call Burton's Sweeney an ""interpretation"" when it is such a tone-deaf butchering on so many levels. As suggested earlier, Mrs. Lovett was originally written as a goofy, overeager, dim-witted bubble of a woman who counterbalances Sweeney's brooding menace. Here, Carter squelches her into the iron bodice of her austere ennui and creates just an equally brooding bedhead who glibly tosses Mrs. Lovett's $100 lines into the toilet as though the whole point of her character and the script were boring her to death. Depp's performance seriously lacks depth as well, coming across as Mr. Mean Looney-Pants the entire time rather than a suffering man with a deadly secret who has any real vengeance to seek. The sailor, who is supposed to be an embodiment of virile safety and valor, was for some unidentifiable reason cast as a twelve year old-looking boy rather than a capable man who could actually ""steal"" Johanna away. Plus, his and Johanna's songs together were cut, neutering their relationship and the urgency of their union. Johanna sits and sings her liberation-desire song while sewing and looking bored. The judge is rendered Mr. EvilEVilEVIL rather than the cluelessly gross man who actually thinks his adopted daughter would willfully marry him. Nearly every decision made, casting and otherwise, was amateurishly wrong and undermined the integrity and effectiveness of the story.If you want REAL Sweeney Todd, see the Angela Lansbury production on DVD and listen to the original cast recording (or find a capable live production, such as the excellent one currently at Barrow Street Theater in New York) and let this dumb, ham-fisted, kiddie-goth misfire rot in the dollar bin where it belongs.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

A gothically twisted and darkly satisfying musical epic,"In Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Johnny Depp plays the title role of a barber sent to prison for a crime he did not commit, losing his wife and daughter. After fifteen years, he returns to London to seek revenge on the man who helped send him, Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). But to lure him in, Todd needs to become a barber again, albeit one who slits throats now too.It may have been hard at first to imagine the film being true to the Broadway show, but Tim Burton has helped craft a Gothic and darkly satisfying version that is all his own, but still does the original musical justice. Every set piece, every costume and every minute that passes breathes an authentic stench of old 1800's London, only matched by those recreating the work of Charles Dickens (and in many cases, Burton's vision tops those too). The painstakingly detailed art direction is simply marvellous, and even with the film's graphic content, is enough to make just about anyone feel the need to see the movie.The cinematography and editing (stylistically wise) are also very well done, capturing quite a few great angles, and giving the sequences just the right amount of exposure that they need. They also help showcase the grand set pieces rather well. The cast is fairly small (speaking wise anyway), but everyone helps make the film exuberantly capture the murky and lurid feel of Burton was obviously going for, and also help to allow the film to fit neatly in with his twisted visions in his older films like Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice and Batman Returns.Depp plays Todd brilliantly, leaving behind his over-the-top Jack Sparrow persona and tapping into his decades old emo-style he helped perfect in his previous work with Burton. He is quietly menacing throughout the entire film (and frequently frowning when he is not yelling at the top of his lungs), and his brooding sense of destruction only helps to make this another one to add to Depp's list of best performances. He outshines everyone, musical number or not, and never once does he allow let up in his intensity.Supporting turns by Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett, the baker who works under Todd's barbershop, and Rickman as Tirpin are both very well expressed, and help complement Depp's performance beautifully. Carter has genuine chemistry with Depp, and plays off him very well (even when his character is not giving into any of her advances). Their musical numbers together are probably the best in the entire film. Rickman, while a little underused here, does very well in the scenes he does have and has a great singing voice. His twisted malice is used very well here, and further makes him a shady icon in the film world. Sacha Baron Cohen and Timothy Spall do very nice work in their small roles as well, further proving their use as great character actors.I was really impressed however with the rest of the cast, including Jamie Campbell Bower, Laura Michelle Kelly, Jayne Wisener and Ed Sanders. Despite their relative newness to the film scene, all four of them do fantastic in their roles, and work fabulous with the more commonly known actors. Special mention must go out to Sanders' work, who goes above and beyond the needed maturity for the role, and nearly steals every scene that he is in.Anyone who felt the all too important element of Todd's throat slittings would either be trimmed down or cut out entirely will be very surprised to see quite a few moments here, in all of their bloody glory. While some of the blood may look slightly excessive, Burton has amped it up to truly express the rage Todd is feeling, as well as the sheer violence of it all. I was intrigued and disheartened by how bright red it was at first (and how it resembled the geysers spilt in the likes of Kill Bill: Volume 1), but it slowly grew on me. It just felt right to have it so vividly expressed, and it helps lend a darkly comic touch to more than a few of the throat slittings. What is even more intriguing is how the blood is actually the brightest element in the entire picture, and that says a lot about what Burton was obviously focusing on rather deeply.What brings the film down from true greatness is how it feels every minute of its near two hour running time. I loved every moment of it, but I think the film really dragged in the middle section, and even near the beginning. There is just no fair balance for the film, and even at its best moments, it still feels like it is kicking its feet and delaying its eventual ending. I realize that quite a few songs were trimmed or completely taken out of the film (whether this is good or bad, I have yet to decide), but the ones that were left in do not make the film feel any brisker. I also did not like how the film did not attempt to correct a few of the woes of the original show. Tirpin's character is still not developed enough. The emotionally bleak finale still feels a touch rushed. Fans of the original show will pick up on these details rather quickly, and while they do not make the film any worse, it just makes it so that the film cannot be any better.It may be the darkest and most graphic musical ever put to celluloid (at least, until Evil Dead: The Musical graces the big screen), but Sweeney Todd is also very authentic in its capturing, and is packed with great performances and even better musical numbers. It is not perfect, but it is a step in a much better direction than Dreamgirls made last year.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Musical with blood,lots of blood!!!!","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a 2007 musical horror film directed by Tim Burton. It is an adaptation of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's Tony Award-winning 1979 musical of the same name and re-tells the Victorian melodramatic tale of Sweeney Todd.Unjustly sent to prison, a man vows revenge, not only for that cruel punishment, but for the devastating consequences of what happened to his wife and daughter. When he returns to reopen his barber shop, he becomes Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, who ""shaved the faces of gentlemen who never thereafter were heard of again."" Sweeney's amorous accomplice, Mrs. Lovett, creates diabolical meat pies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
HIGHLY Recommended,"I waited for this movie for nearly 3 years, and I burst into tears with excitement the first time I saw the trailer. I have shamelessly promoted this movie to anyone who will listen for 2 and 1/2 minutes, and I went to school dressed as Mrs.Lovett for 2 days leading up to the release. When I finally saw Sweeney Todd, I was not let down. This movie is amazing. It is beautiful and dark and perfection at the highest. The songs are beautiful, and sung, while not traditionally, the best I have ever heard them. Johnny Depp is great, but who would expect any less? Helena Bonham Carter was perfect as Mrs.Lovett. This was easily the greatest, goriest movie I have ever seen. Go watch it. Now.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Average at Best,"First I would like to comment on what was done right in this movie. Tim Burton certainly knows how to create a ""dark"" film. ""Sweeny Todd"" reminds me of a cross between ""Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" Johnny Depp sure gave a fantastic performance as Sweeny Todd. As a matter of fact, all the actors/actresses did a great job both in acting and their singing. The story was pretty solid as well. Like I said it reminds me of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" because Todd goes after revenge on all who had wronged him in the past. However, the way he takes his revenge is truly out of the ordinary.Not everything about this movie was great however. I had a problem with all the singing. Not that I don't like musicals, I'll be honest musicals aren't my favorites, but you couldn't really ""get into"" the songs. What I mean by that is take ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""The Phantom of the Opera"" for example. These are musicals where you can sing along and the songs really add so much to the story. Outside of the song about his arm being complete I really didn't feel that the songs had much of a purpose. I also didn't care for the ending, although I'm not going to give anything away.Finally I wan't to close by disputing the 8.3 rating on IMDb. I highly disagree with this film being one of the 250th best films of all time. A raking of 6 or 7 makes since to me but 8.3 is far to high.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Instant Classic! Depp and Burton are at the top of their game!,"I don't really know what to say except that I hate musicals. I have always hated musicals, and I will probably always hate musicals. And yet I loved The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. How can this be? I don't know, and I don't care, this movie was truly stunning.The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is pretty much as close as you can get to real art in the film medium in this day and age. It was beautiful and horrible all at the same time. The music lent the movie a tempo that allowed it to flow in such a way as I have never experienced before. The movie goer will feel like they have only been in the theater for 30 minutes when the credits roll. You will be riveted to your seat while this story unfolds before you!This movie is a MUST see, it is bloody fantastic (literally). Go see it, right now!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Extremely bad - SWEENEY TODD,"Very disappointed, such a bad story and worst movie ever from Tim Burton, I doubt he knows what he wants in this movie, so bloody and disgusting, an stereotype story, no surprises, and characters are all dark and boring, singing part is also killing me.Story doesn't work is the main reason that shut me down, sure Sweeney has the right to revenge, but the slater all innocent people for what? Duh, and it is so stupid and so many holes in this weak story structure, don't have the stomach to finish it, especially in the end, he let his own daughter go, and not even realized that it is his own daughter, killed his own wife and got killed by who? You tell me, unbelievable. the whole thing doesn't make any sense, and just make you feel gross and uncomfortable through out the whole movie.All the great talent from Tim, artistically and his vision of story telling, has been wasted on this one, very disappointed, also screwed John Deep good. can not compared the joy, surprises, and fun to Edward Scissorhands.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good!,I thought this movie had everything i expected. Tim Burton is a directing genius. The fast paced action and the darkness of it really set the mood for the audience. I loved the musical and i was very impressed. And who knew that Johnny Depp could sing???Im in love with this movie!Helena Bonham Carter did a superb job and i couldn't find a flaw in sight except maybe talk-singing. Its my own personal peeve. I cant stand it. Songs are good but i just hate it when they sing in a conversation. Yuck!4 stars =]],10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Sort of works, sort of doesn't","Out of all Tim Burtons movies I've seen, Sweeney Todd has to be my least favorite. While everything works perfectly fine, such as the music, cinematography, and casting, there's something off about how all of these elements come together to create a film.As surprised as I am to say this myself, almost every character in Sweeney Todd is unevenly portrayed. Johnny Depp gives a very bipolar, angsty portrayal of the titular character, appearing raving and bloodthirsty one minute and as a brooding teenager the next. Helena Bonham Carter is so monotonous in this film that she's a pain to watch (and listen to, because by God, her singing voice is nowhere near as good as what I was lead to believe. Neither was Depps's, but more on that later). Johanna, played by Jayne Wisener, gives the film some grace but her acting is sub-par and doesn't offer anything to the viewer. I can only conclude that the most memorable performances come not from our leading actors, but from the supporting cast, such as Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin and Timothy Spall as Beadle. Even Sacha Baron Cohen was more engaging on screen than Depp, even though he has an unfortunately short amount of screen time.The biggest problem I have with Sweeney Todd is the fact that it's a musical. Don't get me wrong, I adore musicals, but I also think that if a story could be told perfectly well without musical accompaniment, that's the way it should be done. I feel the music in Sweeney Todd distracts the viewer from the tragic story, and it would've been much more interesting if it were just a regular movie. As much as everyone I know loves to go on and on about everyone's singing in this film, I need to put myself out there and say that no one in the movie can actually sing. When I hear the term musical, I expect to see actors who can really sing out of the depths of their hearts, much like in Singin' In The Rain or Phantom of the Opera, because the story is mainly told through music. What I'm not expecting is someone to meekly speak their lines with occasional melody (cough cough, Depp), or whine them in a voice that tells the audience that they're definitely trying, but more practice is needed (cough cough, Bonham Carter). I was also annoyed as Hell at Ed Sanders, who played Tobias. His voice is like nails on a chalkboard.Overall, Sweeney Todd isn't all bad. It's a fun, Gothic ride we've all come to expect from Tim Burton, who really is a wonderful director who has made amazing films. My final verdict is; yes, see this film. The music is beautiful, the visuals are stunning, and while the acting isn't the best, I've seen a whole lot worse. However, it isn't worth more than a single viewing. After that, all the little things really start to bother you and you've exhausted yourself in trying to enjoy the movie a second time.",,Anonymous,Horror
The music is ridiculously good.,"Sweeney Todd tells a great story with good characters and fun gore, but in this review I want to focus on the most important part of the show and film, music.The music in Sweeney Todd is phenomenal, yeah some of the song writing and performances could be improved, especially Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman. Their line delivery was sometimes awful, but mostly decent. The music is amazing despite these two problems, it is so complex and was obviously planned out from the start with the use of dies irae playing such a prominent role in the films storytelling and character development. Dies irae is a piece of music that has been used to represent death since the 13th century. From 15 leitmotif 13 of them have some correlation to dies irae showing that Sweeney can't escape death, it's all around him everywhere he goes. There is a fantastic video about the music in Sweeney Todd by ""Sideways"" on youtube I would recommend checking out. I would explain the things he explains myself but trust me you don't want that, plus he does an infinitely better job.I've heard this is a brilliant adaptation of the stage play but I have never seen the stage play so I cannot confirm this for myself. Apparently there is a lot of 4th wall breaking in the play which I'm not a fan of a lot of the time.The practical effects are really good and satisfying but CGI is used some of the time and it looks significantly worse.I would highly recommend you check out Sweeney Todd: the demon barber of Fleet street, I think it's pretty amazing and I love music so this is kind of a no brainer for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Doesn't ""cut it"" for me","I'm not a big fan of musicals unless the music isn't typically that of a musical if you get me - for example The Blues Brothers, O Brother Where Art Thou and Chicago are amongst my favourites in the genre.What do I not like about this movie - I felt that it was poorly paced, spent too long on certain plot points that could have been covered more efficiently and the character setup was a bit slow. The music I found wasn't particularly memorable and conflicted with the dark tone of the story and characters too much to pull me into the universe. I did notice that some themes were reprised at different points to make an emotional and musical mark, which is good musical practice, but a day after having seen it I can't recite a single bar from it.What does it have going for it then? Well it looks fantastic, very grim and dirty. Performances from the leads - Bonham Carter, Depp, Spall, Rickman, Baron Cohen - were good and committed. It was also a good choice to have the actors do their own singing, to make it a bit more believable. The killing scenes were disturbing, which is a good thing as that is what you'd be looking for in this kind of deal, and sometimes they were dealt with a bit of black humour, also a good thing. I thought that the final frames, even though they were grisly, were beautiful and poignant.All in all a mixed bag for newbies. If you like musicals, worth a watch. If you're already a fan of the musical, worth a watch. If you're not fussed on musicals, there's probably still something in it to make it worth going to see.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliance,"This, personally, is one of my more favorite Tim Burton movies to come out. Not only does the story line follow the play fairly well but Johnny Depp is a fantastic singer, something that not many people have found out in past movies. Though the blood looks extremely fake, it still gives the effect Mr. Burton was looking for. Although this movie is rated R for gore, blood, and violence there is not much difference between this and an episode of CSI, but I would not recommend it for a child under the age of fourteen. Both Mr. Depp and Ms. Bonham Carter portray their rolls very well. From what I saw it was an amazing movie and I highly recommend it to Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""I can guarantee the closest shave you'll ever know.""","Only director Tim Burton could possibly contemplate producing a Gothic musical about a murderous, serial-killing barber. 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007)' is one of the bloodiest movies that you'll see all year, but there's something about the juxtaposition of murder and music that makes his film utterly irresistible. The screenplay was adapted from Hugh Wheeler and Stephen Sondheim's 1979 musical of the same name, which was based on the already-prevalent Sweeney Todd legend from the nineteenth century. Johnny Depp plays Benjamin Barker, a happy family man who is falsely arrested and deported to a penal colony in Australia after the lustful Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) covets his beautiful wife (Laura Michelle Kelly). After an arduous fifteen years, Barker  now named Sweeney Todd  escapes from imprisonment and returns to the dark, sinister streets of London, where he learns that his wife committed suicide and that the malevolent Turpin has claimed their daughter (Jayne Wisener) as his own. As he strikes up a peculiar romantic relationship with Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), the owner of a meat pie store in the shop below him, Sweeney begins to plot a gloriously bloody vengeance.The vast proportion of A-list actors, however Oscar-worthy their talents might be, fail miserably when asked to sing a single line, and so it comes as a surprise that the entire cast of 'Sweeney Todd' does an outstanding job. More than three-quarters of the screenplay is sung rather than spoken, and Depp and Bonham Carter, in particular, reveal themselves to have considerable musical talent {the singing voices you hear are all those of the actors you can see on screen}. Johnny Depp, with a prominent white streak through his stylish black hair, is superbly brooding as the titular character, and his uncontrolled rage during the sequences of bloody throat-slitting is both invigorating and rather terrifying. Also delivering excellent performances are the menacing Alan Rickman, a dangerous and unforgiving representation of corrupt power, the indispensable Timothy Spall, singularly grotesque and unforgettable, and Sacha Baron Cohen, a hilariously supercilious ""Italian"" barber of some repute. Of the younger actors, Ed Sanders is the most impressive by far, threatening the steal the limelight on more than a few occasions.Tim Burton's primary trademark as a director is his incredible visual style. 'Sweeney Todd,' set in the dimly-lit streets of a crumbling and uninviting London, successfully evokes the style of David Lean's 'Oliver Twist (1948),' and other Charles Dickens cinematic adaptations. Sweeney's bloodshed is completely uninhibited, and, in a similarly-stylised move to Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill (2003-2004),' graphic spurts of intensely-red blood from the jugular vein are a common occurrence. The violence is extremely cartoonish rather than realistic, and Burton was adamant that such explicit acts of brutality must be included in the film's final product: ""Everything is so internal with Sweeney that {the blood} is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing."" The film's all-important soundtrack was sampled from Stephen Sondheim's stage version of the story {one of the few occasions in which Burton didn't employ the services of Danny Elfman}, and it is suitably thrilling and epic. As 'Sweeney Todd' arrived at its devastating tragic conclusion and the credits began to roll, my two friends alongside me  both possessing a staunch aversion towards musicals  announced their greatest enthusiasm for the film. If there's any loftier praise than that, then I really can't think what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sweeney Todd: Bloody Damn Good Christmas Gift,"If you were to talk to people knowledgeable about Tim Burton and Johnny Depp films, most of them would tell you that such movies are often dark and unique in subject matter. However, they would also concede that the movies are normally whimsical and yet not so heavy at the time. ""Edward Scissorhands"", the tale of an outcast rejected by society? It ends on a somewhat happy note. ""Ed Wood"", the biopic of one of cinema's worst directors? It glorifies Wood as a legend, not as a failure. ""Corpse Bride"", the story of a man torn between his love for a living woman and a ghoul? It was rated PG! Perhaps ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is not the best Burton-Depp collaboration in existence (its up against some formidable siblings: ""Corpse Bride"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Ed Wood"", and ""Edward Scissorhands""), but it is the darkest and a generally great movie. As can be expected, Depp takes his character, and truly becomes him. Not only is his acting top-notch, but it's his looks of contempt and fury that perfects his character. Depp doesn't act like Todd; he is Todd.Depp may be the most noticeable actor of ""Sweeney Todd"", but the movie also boasts a legion of other high-quality players. Helena Bonham Carter is impressive as Mrs. Lovett, especially considering how she models her character as deluded and foolish. Alan Rickman is villainously heinous as Judge Turpin, and makes his character easy to despise. Sacha Baron Cohen, despite having a limited on-screen presence, stands as one of the highlights when playing the flamboyant Signor Adolfo Pirelli. Timothy Spall as Beadle Bamford is tremendous; everything about him from his dwarfish frame to his sneering face to his naval tone is hideously wonderful. And do not get me started on Ed Sanders, who nearly steals the show with his awe-inspiring talent. Jamie Campbell Bower, Laura Michelle Kelly, and Jayne Wisener round out this incredibly talented cast.Similar to other Burton films, ""Sweeney Todd"" utilizes brilliant cinematography to emphasize its singularity. In this case, the imagery drives the point home about how depressing the whole story is: the central location of London is portrayed as cold, hard and callous, a concrete jungle where no sun shines and where a shadow always seems to be cast. However, London's look is completely contrary to the movie's short beach sequence, in which suddenly everything is bright, vibrant, and bursting with sunshine.What also remains vivid in my mind is the wardrobe and costumes, and how they blend so well with some of the characters. Todd and Mrs. Lovett are twisted creatures, and so they look as such. Turpin is a narcissist, compassionless judge , so his character is covered with drab, unaffectionate colors. Bamford is short and repugnant, and resembles a perverse Mad Hatter. What is most astonishing though is the transformation the Toby character undergoes; he goes from looking like a harmless young man to something much more different later on.I will not give the image away, but it is truly haunting.The bloodshed of ""Sweeney Todd"" is the proverbial nail in the coffin, so to speak. In other words, it is what helps Sweeney Todd to be the awesome movie that it is. If you are a gorehound such as myself, then you will be smiling from ear to ear as neck are split open to the tune of beautiful ballads. An efficient amount of the red stuff is used; not too little to disappoint fans of violence, but not too much to be over the top.Of course, ""Sweeney Todd"" is a musical, and what would a superb musical be without superb music? Though many of the actors are not professionally trained singers, they all share the same talent, although some more than others. Depp, in particular, can hardly keep himself from exploding with emotion, and he works wonderfully well with Rickman, whose scraggly voice lends itself to a powerful yet elegant tone. Cohen, even with his few lines, is hilarious. However, as previously stated, Sanders is the surprise hit of the film. His lyrical skills will blow you away. The lyrics of ""Sweeney Todd"" are the work of a maniacal genius, and the score is tragically poignant.It's a shame that ""Sweeney Todd"" hasn't become a box office hit because it deserves to be. ""Sweeney Todd"" is one of the few films that doesn't follow an established formula, and it does so brilliantly. All who worked on ""Sweeney Todd"" gave cinema patrons a worthy Christmas gift; if only the rest of the country realized that.RATING: ****/*****",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ehh,"I liked it and didn't like it. Ms. Carters acting and singing were really on point, and so for every one else especially that kid. Then on the singing, I know that it is a musical, however I do believe that there was little bit to much singing, you know there could have been more dialogue instead. However the story was really good and interesting. Mr. Cohen could have had a larger part in it for i think he is very talented. The Romance was kinda stupid to. Not to mention Mr. Rickman was freaking creepy as all get out. For a dark film it wasn't hard to see, which is nice because usually in a dark film its hard to see everything. That is all I have to say.Your Average Movie Guy,-Trever",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A brush dipped in blood and soot,"Here's a great Christmas idea for you: a movie about a man who as revenge against a cruel judge in Victorian London kills dozens of people, whom his wife grinds up and bakes into meat pies that she sells from her shop to a satisfied and unsuspecting public. And you will lose count of how many times you see this hero sit customers down in his barber chair and slit their throats, with the necks opening up and the blood spurting out in bright red fountains in the dim gray room.That doesn't sound very festive, does it? But this is a sophisticated modern musical, by Stephen Sondheim, adapted to the screen by Tim Burton with the assistance, among others, of his male muse, Johnny Depp, and his wife, Helena Bonham Carter (as Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett, his landlady, then wife, and baker of the pies)not to mention that arch-villain, Alan Rickman (as Judge Turpin, the villainous magistrate) and that facetious bogeyman, Timothy Spall (as Beadle Bamford)with a newly notorious comic scoundrel, Sasha Baron Cohen (as the mountebank Signor Adolfo Pirelli) thrown in for good measure. And they all sing, even though they're not singers by profession (though a couple of the cast members clearly areor so you'd think to hear the lusty boy soprano of Ed Sanders (as the workhouse orphan, Toby).Burton is an artist of hermetic imaginary worlds. Fortunately. Why there has to be quite so much blood, why there must be so many gleaming silver razors (they themselves key players, featured in the film's publicity) drawn across exposed throats I don't really know, but we grownups are well aware none of it is real. What it has is not the crude horror of some kind of numbingly endless snuff flick, but a unified vision, a world whose look has awesome artistic validity. And it's a vision whose artificiality, thank God, is further underlined by the prevalence of music and by how often the dialog is sung, not spoken. But more than a world of sound, it's a world of image, and if anything makes this a great film it's the fact that nobody west of Prague has ever painted so beautifully on film with a brush so heavily, voluptuously dipped in blood and soot.The dark, gloomy, overcast, oozing, perfectly hopeless London is the real star of Burton's new film. Everything else is of a piece with it. It's remarkable even how much the faces of Depp and Carter grow out of it, like the face in Edvard Munch's The Scream, and grow out of each other. They have the same cheekbones, the same white pallor and grainy dark raccoon eyes. Without being digitalized or rotoscoped or motion captured, Johnny Depp's face becomes a thing as grainy and drawn-looking as an image by Edward Gory or Charles Addams. But this is a world more fanatical and obsessive than theirs. It's not whimsical; it's driven. It's not spooky; it's horrific. I guess maybe Depp has always had the gift of negative capability, of being the more impressive for being not quite there, as much in the William Blake of Dead Man as in Edward Scissorhands. One of his gifts is that he's so powerfully present and conscious in every frame, and yet at one remove. His character is not a personality but a creature possessed by one object: annihilation, of others, and chiefly of his arch-enemy, and then of himself.Burton's achievement is that his work has never seemed less fussy. He has always been a master of detail, but it all fits into the whole here, as if everything happened inside a dark boxexcept for the wonderful short looks outside at the long vistas of narrow streets and the dark skies. (And it is said that the movie otherwise ""opens up"" the musicalwith the insane asylum scene, for instance.) Anyway, what makes this a great movie is its focus, and its utter lack of distraction. And when the camera moves back a long way, those are the best, the most surprising, moments, freezing the scene into a painting. The final shot of Sweeney has been justifiably called a Pietà. Those are self-conscious tableaux, but the movement is swift, the editing is sure.This is a Victorian costume show--a horrible permutation of the Dickensian vision of the workhouse, the orphan, the perversion of justice, the greed of the powerful, the dominance of the wicked man, the long suffering of the weak, the reversal of fortune. I'm not clear why Sondheim is reckoned such a superior writer of musicals, so original. Is this original, or just a logical extreme? Isn't every ugly thing turned into a musical now; haven't musicals been dark from The Threepenny Opera to Les Miz and beyond? Sondheim's lyrics sometimes seem prosy and repetitious, his tunes lightweight. Is it a sign of sophistication that Sondheim's tunes aren't catchyor just a sign that he hasn't the gift of writing catchy tunes? None of that finally matters though, because whatever failings Sondheim may have as a pure maker of musicals all the better enable Tim Burton to make Sweeney Todd his own: Sondheim's music does not overwhelm his film but simply blends into it.There isn't much more to say. Why do I like this? I don't. It's horrific. Like another of the year's best American films that's also ugly and violentNo Country for Old Menit's just wonderfully crafted. Cocteau said Art produces ugly things which most of the time become beautiful; fashion produces beautiful things that most of the time become ugly. Which is Burton's Sweeney Todd? Perhaps a work of art; and so even its horror in our topsy-turvy world may become beautiful.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

It works quite well up until a rather grotesque and over-the-top third act,"All of the movies by Tim Burton that I have seen have either been so quirky and bizarre that they were entertaining (or in the case of his 1994 masterpiece ""Ed Wood,"" brilliant) or so quirky and bizarre that they were over-the-top and too unusual to sincerely enjoy. Here, he makes a film that is both. For up to two-thirds of its running time ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is a bizarre, humorous, and oddly delightful gem by Hollywood's most creative and innovatory auteur. And then the movie, which is based on a musical, takes a drastic swing into the really bizarre with an over-the-top third act that seems alien to the nature of the previous two acts, leaving me as a critic and reviewer feeling a little mixed about my reactions.Tim Burton and Johnny Depp make a superb team and they prove that once again in this movie, for both are undeniably the right choice for their roles. Depp is Sweeney Todd, a seemingly lifeless barber seeking revenge on the judge (Alan Rickman) who prostituted his wife, kidnapped his daughter, and exiled him. Now Mr. Todd, brandishing his glimmering razors, with help from a Gothic baker (Helana Bonham-Carter) and a few others, makes plans to give Rickman a shave...A really deep one.What's most likable about the first two-thirds of the movie is that it seems to revive a genre that has been neglected by Hollywood: the musical. There are numerous surprisingly well-written and interesting songs. The filmmakers and cast have done a superb job at telling an entire story using mostly musical numbers. What's more, there is also a very interesting chemistry between Johnny Depp and the always enthralling Helena Bonham-Carter. In the midst of these songs, there are also some moments where Depp practices the shaving technique he plans to use on Rickman, in which he sticks the razor deep into his victim's neck and lets the unnervingly bright red blood spray in torrents.Well, these work in their isolated moments. I liked the first hour and a half of the movie. But then, in the third act, when it deviated from this course and became really just a bizarre slasher flick with cannibalism mingled in, the movie started to distance itself from me as an audience member. I know that it is based on a musical play and that it is probably just being faithful to its source material. However, that is a clear indication that I probably would not enjoy the last third of the play, either.I'm not going to spend too many words riffing on ""Sweeney Todd"" because I did not hate the movie; I just can't honestly recommend it because of how it loses its way toward the end. Before that, it is very interesting, beautifully-photographed, well-directed, has many good numbers, and solid performances. But as a critic, it is my task to communicate my personal opinion; how I saw it. And I must treat you as my friend and give you my honest analysis. In the end, I thought it was a hit-and-miss. On the pass/fail scale, it's teetering on the negative end. Too bad, because I was really rooting for it most of the way.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Love, revenge, madness and... human pies?","Sweeney Todd has been a notorious character in English urban myth. So notorious in fact, that he got a musical named after him and now a film as well. Sweeney Todd: the demon barber of Fleet Street is a horror/musical film that centres around a barber that goes by the name of Benjamin Barker. Falsely accused by a judge who was after his wife, he was sent away to Australia, but returns after fifteen years with the help of a sailor boy. The years in prison have changed him, or rather: they made him, no pun intended, barking mad. Benjamin Barker has changed from a loving husband and father into Sweeney Todd, an emotionally unstable man with no empathy, whose only goal is to take revenge on Judge Turpin; the man that took Todd's old life away. He rents his old shop above the pie shop of Mrs. Lovett, who recognises him and tells him what has happened in the years that passed: Judge Turpin has raped Sweeney's wife Lucy, after which she poisoned herself. Due to her mother's death, Sweeney's daughter Johanna was adopted by the judge and now lives in his keeping. Mr Todd takes up his old profession as a barber, but with only one goal: to lurk judge Turpin into his shop and slit his throat, which he wishes to accomplish with the help of Mrs. Lovett. Along the way, there are more throats to take care of, and the bodies somehow end up in Mrs. Lovett's meat pies. From the summary, it might already be clear that this film is not for everyone. There are some horror elements in there, and it is quite certain that everybody who greatly dislikes musical films could better get as far away from this one as possible. However, the film does manage to entertain because of the convincing characters, some catchy songs and quite a twist at the end. Did the plot line about humans chopped into meat pies convince you? No? That is because the plot itself isn't too strong. Of course, the film was based on an urban myth and therefore they couldn't leave plot points such as the meat pies stuffed with human limbs out, but it cannot be called truly convincing. The first body that disappears down the meat grinder still has some plausibility attached to it; Sweeney killed him because the man tried to blackmail him, and now they need to dispose of the body. Mrs. Lovett could use the meat, and there-fore they put him into the pastry. The people that follow were not killed for these convincing reasons, in fact, Todd's next victims were all killed so Sweeney can hush his lust for blood. This could be forgiven, were it not for the horribly fake blood squirting out of arteries. To be honest the blood appeared to be orange rather than red. After all of this, though, it must be said that the two cons stated above could very well be the only two. True, if you hate singing with a passion, this might not be the film for you. And yet, the singing itself cannot be blamed for this: everybody's singing abilities range from reasonable to great and the songs are catchy. Either way, the singing doesn't distract the viewer from the plot, which cannot be said for each musical film out there (looking at you, Les Misérables). The acting in itself could be called superb: Mr. Depp and Mrs. Bonham Carter have a certain chemistry that works out really well. Helena convinces as a woman with little empathy but deeply in love with someone who she knows is everything but stable. Johnny doesn't just impersonate a madman driven by nothing but revenge: he becomes said mad-man. This becomes rather clear in the scene in which Sweeney had his hands on the throat of Judge Turpin, only to lose him before he can slit his throat. He takes out his anger on Mrs. Lovett, who after all of this still stays with him and even tries to comfort him. The décor, make-up and costumes only add to this: there is a sharp contrast between the almost candy-coloured past and hopes for the future Mrs. Lovett cherishes, and reality, which consists mainly of black and grey. As a plus, the décor is often broken and rooms are empty. You only need to take a look at Sweeney's shop to find an example of this: it contains only the chair in which he kills his victims, and a mirror smashed to pieces. The unhealthy living conditions and the unhealthy motivations of the characters manifest itself in paleness and dark spots under their eyes. The film itself gives you a kind of eerie feeling, a bit as if you are descending into madness as well. For example, in one scene Sweeney bashes someone's head in with a pot filled with boiling tea. Immediately after, he and Mrs. Lovett happily waltz through her shop while singing about what different people will taste like once put into pies. All in all, this film is quite enjoyable, even though the special effects look rather fake at times and the plot itself is not always able to convince. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, together with the rest of quite an impressive cast, manage to keep the viewer interested with their amazing acting skills. The décor, costumes and make-up only add to this. The singing is quite alright and should not hold people back from watching. Is this a film that will stick with you for a long time coming? No, it probably won't. Does it provide some quality entertainment for two hours? Yes, it certainly does. So if you enjoy films with singing and strong acting, and you won't be bothered by a weaker plot, this could very well be the right film for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Another humorously, horrifying film masterfully executed as only Director Tim Burton can.","In a shark's feasting frenzy, instincts take over and attack becomes more intense, their prey swiftly turns to a cloud of blood. During this carnal mêlée, the shark is so consumed with death that nothing will draw its attention away from the attack. It continues to kill until the killing is over. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a frenzy of brutal murder fueled by the revenge of a man destined to destroy the lives of those who broke his family into pieces. It is a London-based bloody musical, true to Stephen Sondheim's 1979 musical-theater production, with elements of deception, destruction, bloody throat-slashing and cannibalism that left me thinking, ""Sometimes, death wins.""Benjamin Parker (Johnny Depp), once a happily married man with a beautiful loving wife and gorgeous baby girl, was stolen away from his family destine to live the rest of his days in prison, all so Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) could assume his place in the once blissful family. Returning 15 years later under the assumed name Sweeney Todd, Depp seeks his revenge upon Turpin, destroying everything in his path, liked to Quentin Tarantino's main character in Kill Bill who sets out on a mission of cold hearted, bloody revenge and doesn't stop until the blood does. Unbeknownst to Todd, his accomplice Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) is the most deceptive person of them all. As the rage for revenge grows, so does the body count, as Todd becomes increasingly consumed with his passionate hatred for the liars and sinners of London.Burton's use of high-key lighting and vibrant colors filled the screen during flashbacks of time spent with Benjamin's family, to emphasize happy times and a sense of blissful peace  only for the film to transform into dramatically low-key lighting, setting the stage for the death and destruction Sweeney Todd wreaks upon the city.The roles of Sweeney Todd and Nellie Lovett could not have been so magnificently executed by any other actors. Although they are not trained singers, the two pull it off with uncanny ability. Depp and Carter have a history of portraying dark vengeful, mysterious characters in such films as Pirates of the Caribbean, Edward Scissors Hands and Fight Club, to name a few. In Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Todd and Lovett compliment each other in personality and appearance with their hatred for humanity and desire to condemn those who clutter London with lies and deceit. Todd and Lovett's appearances emphasize the dark, vengeful tone of the film with their pail skin, heavily contrasted by dark eye makeup  emphasizing the hatred in their eyes toward London  massive, curly, black hair  emphasizing their incomprehensible state of mind  and drab clothing  Lovett wearing hints of scarlet, foreshadowing the deepest evils within her.Their presences sent chills up my back, with the look of vengeance in their eyes and shown on their saddened faces. Adapted from Stephen Sondheim's award-winning musical thriller, Burton's directing style of humorous brutality makes this a masterpiece of revenge any Tim Burton fan will admire  especially those with a gory appetite in films.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Dark, Twisted, and Totally Johnny Depp","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is definitely not your usual musical, and that's exactly what makes it so unique. Being a Johnny Depp fan, I had to watch it, and he did not disappoint! That mix of dark humor, revenge, and his brooding intensity? Classic Depp. Plus, he even sang, and while he's not a professional singer, his voice fit the vibe of the movie perfectly.Pros:The visuals are stunning-those dark, gothic sets and costumes really pull you into the grim world of Sweeney Todd.Johnny Depp as the vengeful barber is brilliant. He balances rage, heartbreak, and that eerie calm in a way only he can.Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs. Lovett is a great mix of quirky and creepy. The chemistry between her and Depp is perfect for this kind of story.Tim Burton's signature style shines. If you love his dark, quirky aesthetic, this movie is a treat.Cons:It's very gory, so if you're not into blood and over-the-top murder scenes, it might not be your thing.The musical numbers are hit or miss. While they fit the tone of the movie, some songs felt a bit repetitive.The story is straightforward and a bit predictable. You can pretty much see where it's heading from the start.Overall, if you're a fan of Johnny Depp or Tim Burton, this movie is a must-watch. It's not perfect, but it's got a charm that stays with you. For me, Depp's performance alone makes it worth it. I'd give it a solid 7/10. A dark, bloody revenge tale with some killer (pun intended) performances!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Black and White and Red all over,"It's the story of some one lost in their grief and not able to engage in the world around them. It looks like Batman, with a dark comical twist, but with very little goodness on show.The story feels quite thin, not many characters and no real travelling, it feels like it has come from the theatre and has the constrains of the medium, without the buzz of a real person in front of you. The other problem is that I do no think that the Sweeny Todd character changes much through the film, there is a sudden realisation at the end, but the shock of what that means and what he has done are not shown.It looks like a Tim Burton film it is well dressed and well shot, but I think that people with poor eye sight will actually struggle to view parts of the story because it is so darkly shot.Helena Bonham Carter is very watchable and gives the film a human strength.It's HDTV not 35mm, which it should have been.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Incredibly unremarkable,"I've seen the overwhelming number of glowing reviews of this film, and what they tell me is that people who are fans of musicals, Johnny Depp or Tim Burton will gush about ANY of their efforts that actually make it to the big screen. The songs were okay, but this movie suffers from the fatal flaw commonly found in movie musicals, in that the songs are just padding for a story that would otherwise take about 12 minutes to tell. Come to think of it, that is a flaw shared almost universally by films directed by Tim Burton, who has been exposed since his early breakthrough efforts as a director who is clearly more comfortable with style than any sort of story structure. A couple of actors were brought in for a bit more singing talent, but none of the songs really required much in the way of pipes. Burton is well-suited in his typical role as a decent director (as long as the film in shot in blue-and-white) who makes bad movies. Depp again sacrifices doing watchable fare in favor of being what he apparently considers an ""artist,"" and Bonham-Carter does the yawn-through she usually does in roles donated to her by whoever her latest fling is. And as is also typical, a cast filled with actors many of us really like gives us a pedestrian effort, apparently believing that our affection for them is enough to keep us blindly attending sub-par fare. There's really just nothing to recommend about this flick, and if it's at the top of your list of movies to see, you'd really be best-served going with your No. 2.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unforgettably Brilliant: A True Masterpiece,"This is perhaps the best motion picture of the past decade. Tim Burton has created a grotesquely beautiful masterpiece based on an English folk tale that will be cherished forever. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter have come together stunningly in this nightmarish tale of human despair and beauty in a theatrical and dramatic manner that has not been seen in decades and will leave you breathless begging for more. The entire cast is unforgettable and performs with heart and the rawest of human emotions. The performances increase in intensity and usher forth the next moment with grace and building anticipation until it concludes with a sheer touch of brilliance that left me stunned, horrified, saddened, and wanting to see this picture many more times.This motion picture is relief in a time where drama, theatrics, and simple beauty have been long forgotten in digital rendering and overly dramatic special effects. This is a true masterpiece that enchants, horrifies, and illuminates the depth of raw human emotions and horrid resplendence.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An Intense, Mature Musical","25 December 2007. Less than either Moulin Rouge (2001) and Chicago (2002) but more than Evita (1996), Sweeny Todd incorporated dialogue in much less quantity than most musicals except for Evita which was exclusively sung. This dark musical fused dark humor in the beginning and was photographed in dank and black colors. Sweeney Todd based on the musical of the same name, did not take as much advantage of the theatrical film format as did Mouline Rouge or Chicago and many sequences seemed more like a Broadway production. Except for the subject matter and its R-Rating presentation of blood and gore, this musical while entertaining, compelling didn't forge new ground. The beginning of Sweeny Todd was reminiscent of Mouline Rouge in many ways...the look, the presentation, the setting. The songs themselves while eerily appealing had by the end much of the same tone, same flavor, same blend of sound unlike other musicals. Johnny Depp was exciting and compelling to watch, his expressions, his performance delivery. Perhaps, this musical is one for our times, reflective in an age of death, war, and torture. It is also a reflects on the demise and moral ambiguity of revenge and its descent into the furnace of hell. It is the the naiveté of the youth and the unfortunate abuse of youth that has made some of the have to grow up and take up responsibility far too early. Whether or not this strong social message is sufficient to survive time to maintain this musicals status as a great musical remains to be seen. Otherwise, it will descend itself into a period piece as a good but not classic movie. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's Oscar Worthy!,"Johnny Depp stars in the best movies ever, and Sweeney Todd is one of them. Based off the 1979 Broadway musical, Depp plays a man named Benjamin Barker, who was removed from his family and taken away to prison for a crime he didn't comment. 15 years later, he returns as Sweeney Todd; the demon barber of Fleet Street. When he comes back to London, he encounters Mrs. Lovett played by Tim Burton's wife Helena Boham Carter and slits out the throats of innocent men who come to his shop for a shave so he can get the revenge he wants truly badly on the judge who ruined his life.I won't spoiled the rest of the movie for you, not even the ending, but I will tell you this...Sweeney Todd is one hell of a serious good movie, and it's got a little bit of humor of it. But the best part about the movie is it's a musical. I'm a fan of musical movies but I strongly dislike horror films, but this one was more than I expected. Johnny and Helena's singing was truly remarkable and the fake blood they use in the movie was outstanding, you can't tell whether or not it look real. To me, it took too bright to ever look like blood. You'll be stunning amazed once you watch the movie. If you're a fan of Johnny Depp, Tim Burton or just like musicals or horror movies, this one is for you.The movie is nominated for best actor, best director and best actress. Johnny Depp totally deserves to take home the Oscar!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Memorable,"Based on Stephen Sondheim's hit Broadway musical, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a classic revenge story ala Zorro or Count of Monte Cristo (DOM steals humble hunk's wife and child) but told in bloodthirsty gory, er, glory.Wrongfully accused barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) goes back home to London with vendetta on his mind as Sweeney Todd, barber extraordinaire. Somehow, the townspeople don't seem to find his and fellow tenant Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter)'s ghoulish looks any stranger than her meat pies. Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) is the insidious old geezer who steals Barker's wife (Laura Michelle Kelly) and now has evil designs for his daughter! The rest of the supporting cast gave memorable performances. Sacha Baron Cohen adds a fun albeit short stint as Todd's competitor, Signor Adolfo Pirelli. Timothy Spall (who once more plays the villain's sidekick as in Enchanted) is the judge's disgustingly evil lackey Beadle Bamford. Ed Sanders as the poor orphan boy Toby is an incredibly bright and talented surprise. Jamie Campbell Bower as the lovestruck sailor Anthony Hope appears in the very first scene with Depp and even as the film unravels, his tenor voice and effeminate looks has the audience wrestling with his gender. He looks a lot like Claire Danes or Hanson's lead singer, especially when he does the trademark Danes facial expression of the furrowed forehead. Jayne Wisener plays the 15-year old Johanna, Barker's daughter all grown up. Despite her satisfactory acting chops, she is shockingly blond with an annoying soprano voice that it's hard to see her as the beauty she is supposed to be.Even with Hollywood's latest character-role fave Johnny Depp as the star and one of my fave directors Tim Burton at the helm, musicals even in film form is still unsavory for me. But Burton succeeds in sneaking Sweeney Todd into your thoughts long after you've left the cinema. It's good to confirm that I have not been desensitized after seeing so much gore, and I'm even happier that violence was not glorified in this film despite gory images being the staple in each scene.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Depp at His Darkest, Burton at His Best","I've never seen the actual Sweeney Todd largely because I despise the great majority of musicals excluding Singing in the Rain. However, I decided to give Sweeney Todd a chance because the Burton-Depp duo is rarely set to fail. The darkness of the film is offset by the up-beat music and fast paced lyrics, but the story is actually heightened by the poetic slide from dialog to tune. I don't share the same level of reverence for Burton that others may hold because it is hard to forgive his destruction of the Batman series, but Depp's continued phenomenal presence is that of a god on film. I was impressed with his shift into character as I was of his surprisingly pleasant singing voice. In the knowledge that S. Todd is a villainous Brit, I half expected Captain Jack Sparrow to come about. Depp slapped me with the reality that he is a genius in his art. Depp reminds us that he hit the entertainment industry first as a musician, but the surprise really comes in the realization that he started as a guitarist, not a singer. Then, we have to remember that Depp is not only singing, but he is doing so in an infallible yet false accent. Johnny does not stand alone in the array of talent throughout this film. While the movie would not be the same without Depp, Helena Bonham Carter was more than a supporting role. She was pivotal. She was Mrs. Lovett more than an actress playing a part. If I had a tumor, I would name it Marla Singer; not out of spite, but as a mark of permanent notability. In essence, I found this movie appeasing. It is odd to say considering the amount of disturbing blood shed and deviant behavior throughout, but I can say that Tim Burton's adaptation of a show that I had no true interest in seeing has since become my favorite musical. It is to the point that I will not likely see this show in theater because no performance will top that of Depp and Carter. Leave the kids in the other room, sound check your equipment to make sure you don't miss a note, and enjoy rooting for villains roughing it out with villains. This film is one worth watching several times over just to make sure you absorb all details available.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Brilliant Movie, but songs just not good enough, unlike Oliver Twist","I loved the visual aspect of this movie. I thought the casting and acting was perfect. This is truly a perfect movie but only deserves 7 out of 10 because the songs are just not good enough. If we look at all the really big musical movies, Oliver Twist, The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady and so on and so on, there are always one or two songs that you'd remember from those films. With Sweeney Todd, there is no memorable song at all, not even a melody to hum on your way home. There is also only one scene where the actual musical moves out of the reality of the situation; what I mean by this is that the character Sweeney Todd actually sings in the street with the street patrons not taking any notice of him, a scene of disbelief within disbelief. This is a trait which has worked in many a musical movie and which actually doesn't work here at all as it's a lone scene of this type of singing on the street. This, you'll notice, happens a lot in Oliver Twist and with 60 years between these movies, Oliver Twist is a far more superior movie than ""Sweeney Todd"".",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

To Shavee-Da Face...,"After a second viewing I enjoyed this a lot more, the first time around I was so caught off guard, it was a bit alienating. I hadn't expected the wall to wall classical musical theater that I got here, but for what it is, it works. Tim Burton does a good job of mixing in plenty of violence and black comedy, to keep the story moving along, but there are a few too many scenes that seem better designed for the stage than the screen.I'm sure on stage signing in a solitary dilapidated building has a great emotional impact, on screen though it just gets kind of repetitive and boring. The songs translate best when at their are most onieric, whether Todd is fantasizing about running through the streets blades in hand or Mr. Lovett dreaming of their house by the sea, Burton's imagination is at it's most engaging and the film is too.But aside from that it was good, it's a musical about a murderous barber slicing people's throats and his assistant baking them into meat pies. The film is at it's weakest when it goes for melodrama, I enjoyed it more than most musicals and I can see how fans of theater will get a definite kick out of it, but for me the campier ""Little Shop Of Horrors"" and ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" will always hold the gold standard for musical horror/comedy theater.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Don't see this film, please don't listen to the Depp/Burton fanboy/girl reviewers.","Simply put, in 4 words : Don't watch this movie.I can see why all the 12 year old girls are raving about this. They always want what they can't have, which was a clever trick on the producer's part, I'll give them that. Making the film an 18 really did boost sales. If it wasn't for Johnny Depp's appearance in this film, I may have been inclined to give it another star. If you ask me, Tim Burton is far too over-rated. I feel that I should tell all potential watchers not to waste their money, and go see a better film out in the cinemas right now, such as Cloverfield or In The Valley of Elah, the one thing that makes modern cinema worth being given the title ""modern cinema"" is innovation, and/or allowing the audience to reminisce, and this was a terrible mix of the two. The use of the star system to market this movie, Burton's ""If I build it, they will come"" approach appalls me, the fact that people will pay just as much to see a sold-out Johnny Depp as they would to buy a DVD from a bargain bin is beyond me. I'd much rather watch a $5 copy of an old early classic, than waste the same amount of my lifetime on this pile of nothing. I would call it something more obscene, but that would imply it meant something to me, which it did not. If you're looking for a good adaptation of Sweeney Todd, try the 2007 version which was a straight to DVD feature made almost completely independently. Or just see the play. This movie makes a mockery of the original writer, and if I were Thomas Peckett Prest, I would be spinning in my grave.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Faultless!  A work of genius,"Let me prefix this short review by saying that, I'm no fan of musicals so was somewhat apprehensive about this movie. I am, however, a long time big fan of Burton's work.True to form, Burton's latest looks absolutely stunning. Every single camera angle is imaginative in a way that most directors could only dream of accomplishing. The desaturation of the color frames the mood perfectly, and of course there is Burton's usual contrast with this macabre scene to the brightly lit dreamworld of the pie lady.The performances are outstanding. Depp and Bonham-Carter are perfectly cast (I wonder if Burton knows there are other actors out there!), and pull off their roles superbly. All support cast are tremendous too, although I must say I'm getting a little bored with Spall's performances - very much a one trick pony.I'll be first in line when this comes out on DVD. In fact, I may just buy an HD/BluRay player to see this at its best.(One issue: the picture at my local cinema had a very strange shake throughout, most noticeable when there was a bright area contrasting with the dark around it. Very strange - anyone else see this?)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Miscasting,"This film is badly miscast. Helena Bonham Carter is too young to play Mrs. Lovett and Johnny Depp is too young to play Todd. Actually, Alan Rickman should be playing Todd and someone like Jane Lapotaire should be playing Mrs. Lovett. I can't believe that nobody seems to know the least bit about the original Broaday musical, in which Angela Lansbury played Lovett (later also played by Patti Lupone) and Len Cariou was Sweeney Todd. I suppose casting younger actors is supposed to be some way to pull in what the studios consider a saleable demographic or some other idiotic thing. This is a brilliant musical, one of the best Sondheim ever wrote, and miscasting like this makes me sick.I thought Bonham Carter was completely wrong for the Harry Potter movie, too. But then, the casting for those films NEVER matches up with either the author's descriptions or my imaginings.",,Anonymous,Horror
A Faithful Adaptation of a Mediocre Play,"I saw a school play of Sweeney Todd a few years back and wasn't very impressed, as far as I can tell this film adaptation remains fairly faithful to it's source material which I feel is the problem, the acting is all good if not great but apart from that I don't think the film had much going in it's favour. The CGI is poor the cinematography pretty plain and the story feels half hearted, very predictable and disappointing. Similarly to when I watched the play I felt the story could have gone in so many more interesting directions instead of the dull path it picks, none of the characters feel fleshed out with just some thread bare backstories, the music is all mediocre, fine but not catchy or interesting and overall the film just feels a bore. I will take into account that the play is pretty popular so I may be in the minority with my opinions but Sweeney Todd lacks any of Burtons usual charm and feels like a pretty underwhelming six out of ten. Would not recommend.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Many spots of brilliance, but falls short of the Lansbury/Hearn theatre version","I'm a huge fan of Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter is one of the most versatile actresses in the business - - - but I still came away from this film disappointed. Carter, I thought, was good but miscast; Mrs. Lovett, I think, works best as an older character. Angela Lansbury, after all, was Stephen Sondheim's and Hal Prince's personal choice to play Mrs. Lovett on Broadway, and there are hints in the libretto as well, such as "" . . . a woman alone, with limited wind. . . "", that strongly point to an older Mrs. Lovett.
Depp, I felt, was not so much miscast as misdirected. His Sweeney is a humourless man, which deprives many of the songs of the flashes of savage fun that George Hearn brought to the part. (""A Little Priest"" and ""Pirelli's Miracle Elixir"" are the most obvious examples.)
I saw Lansbury and Len Cariou in the original Broadway production (damn, I wish I still had the Playbill!), and my opinions are certainly coloured by having seen the stage version and the Lansbury/Hearn film first, but still - - - despite being a thoroughly effective production, with some screen effects that do improve on the original, this film remains a distant second to Broadway.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A wonderful adaptation of a very bizarre play.,"Who better to direct a musical about a barber who slits his patient's throats than Tim Burton? Who better to star as the lead role than Johnny Depp? Actually, quite a few people could have done better in the singing department for Depp's title role, but he still gave a marvelous performance otherwise. The movie was all around really great.Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) was a happy man with a wife and daughter. Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) takes his family away for his own. Benjamin returns 15 years later under his new name Sweeney Todd, and he wants revenge on those who wronged him. He meets Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), who runs a failing meat pie shop and he opens a barbershop up right above her. Violence, murder, cannibalism and catchy tunes ensue. The acting was good, but the real standout was Helena Bonham Carter who managed to play a murderous character who still managed to be sympathetic. Sacha Baron Cohen plays a small, hilarious over the top the role, and was a great addition to the cast. I had heard that Johnny Depp talk sings all his songs, but that is not true. Even if he isn't the best singer out there, he does actually sing several songs. The music is strange, but catchy, and it fits well with the tone of the movie. As a musical, there are better ones out there, not to say this isn't a good musical. One positive to the film, was the smooth transitions from comedy to drama and violence. The London town looks great, and the dark sepia-toned colors didn't get annoying, and I thought they would.Overall, I think Sweeney Todd is a bizarre musical, but it made for a great movie that I'd see many more times.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 120 mins. R for violence.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
My rating doesn't mean it's bad.,"The movie is bold in most of his scenes and sometimes shocking. Johnny's performance was very magnificent though the character it's self has not got much to present even in it's past. Helena was pretty good too and both were drawing a picture with their performance, but the movie isn't too powerful and the songs were at ups and downs. Overrated and predictable plots too and scenes with blood were neither convincing nor horrifying just sometimes shocking.

Burton aims and misses again,"Tim Burton perplexes me. I should like him. He's dark and quirky with a childlike view of the world. But somethings usually missing with his films, an intangible thing that's hard to nail down. Sweeney Todd should have made me feel something, I should have cared. Stephen Sondheim's brilliant modern opera is heart wrenching, a Greek tragedy set in bleakest Victorian London. The characters are broad, yes, but still we should understand the nuances and subtleties. Burton's version doesn't allow us to do this. It doesn't let us in. The view is beautiful, filmed in a kind of dream reality where nothing looks quite right. The colors and CGI environment pulse with life, more compelling than the action itself. There is much music and singing, some very beautiful, but it never reaches any heights. Johnny Depp plays Sweeney and I'm always glad to see him. But, in this Burton makes him a cartoon of the character, sweeping a huge shock of white through his hair and directing him in a ridiculously subdued way. Bejamin Barker/Sweeney should grimace at Heaven, curse God with gusto, hate the world like no man ever has. Depp does none of these things. Helena Bonham Carter plays Mrs. Lovett, a role originally written especially for Angela Lansbury, a role that requires equal passion, desperation...and pipes. These are both great actors who are miscast. Depp and Carter are too young, too pretty, too surface. Alan Rickman, way past stereotyping himself as a meanie, channels Potter's Snape throughout the film. Many character actors could have eaten this role up and it's a shame someone else wasn't given a chance. There are no bad performances here, just misplaced ones, too familiar to be unique. This is a gory story, but I grew annoyed at the tedious graphic view of...what happened to many of the victims. Not to have any spoilers, I will just say I didn't have to see it over, and over, and over. I got it with the first one. Blood is almost a character itself in this. Gushing, spurting, flowing in as many ways as it can, Buton goes too far with the Grand Guignol distracting us from the drama we should be immersed in. I love horror movies, but this should not be SUCH a horror movie. Ultimately I was as disappointed in this as I was in the way too over the top Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and excuse for toy merchandising, Planet of the Apes (which only made me love the original more). It's highly watchable, entertaining and worth seeing, just not what it could have been.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Gorgeously Gruesome,"Sweeney Todd is gruesome almost beyond belief. Even to the point of being gross. But it worked well with the subject, so I found the grossness effective. I think it is an excellent adaptation of the stage musical, though it does lack a chorus. But the chorus probably would not have worked with Tim Burton's conception of the film anyway. In one way the film is better than the stage production. It is more tightly knit, probably due to the elimination of the chorus.The cast was outstanding. Depp's portrayal of Todd's transition from a simple desire for vengeance against Judge Turpin and Beadle Bamford into an insane desire to kill anyone in the upper classes is marvelous.If you can stomach the gore(I think it is the most gruesome film I've ever seen), I recommend it highly.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't listen to your sisters(if you'll really not scare),"My sisters used to watch me this movie when i was in third grade saying like ""It's an enjoyable musical there is nothing to scare come on"" and the only thing i remember is my screaming, shouting,crying and couldn't sleep alone for couple of months😖😫. But now scenario sounds nice to watch. (Unless you're under 13!). Or maybe under 18 cause there were really scary scenes. But the songs are really successful and there is something that you don't expect and maybe even cry in the end. If i tell the end that would be bad for you cause it's really something that you don't expect throughout the story. Like usual Johny Deep plays awesome also Helena Bohnem Carter plays silly women(usual). Briefly don't watch if you don't want to see peoples head and necks on ground.

Strange but Excellent,"At the beginning I thought this was going to be a strange and bizarre experience that I would not like. It was strange and bizarre, but developed into a fascinating story that I thoroughly enjoyed. The blood didn't look real, but more like watered down red paint. The blood was plentiful though. I turned my head more than once. Beyond that, I would recommend it to anyone. Johnny Depp has a surprisingly good singing voice as does Helena Bohnam Carter. the children in this film are terrific and my applause to the casting director in their choices there. The sets are dark and gloomy, but perfect for the era and locale in England. Anyone want a meat pie? I'll be Marie Calendar meat pie sales go down after seeing this movie. ha-ha-ha",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty good.,"This is like some sort of weird little Gothic love fairytale, and it's actually not the nu-crapola I expected previously, being quite an endearing tale. Johnny Depp isn't a good singer, but he makes up for that with stunning theatrics, the same way he did as Jack Sparrow in the Pirates films. Helena Bonham Carter's performance is great, too, and the supporting cast make for quite an entertaining viewing.The main problem with Sweeney Todd is just that it feels pretty campy and jovial compared to its subject matter, and it would've been a much better movie if the aforementioned camp had been turned down a few notches. Regardless, this is a fun watch, and I'd recommend it to people who aren't afraid of musicals.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wonderful,"I read some of the negative reviews and I'm wondering WHAT FILM did they see??? The film I saw was absolutely wonderful! I've seen many live productions of SWEENEY TODD and I'm a huge fan of the Sondheim musical. I'm telling you all, this is an excellent production that had me riveted and thrilled until the very end. It's a dark and richly woven tale of love in all it's complex and unforgiving nature. Johnny Depp was AMAZING. I completely disagree with those who say that he was dreadful in the part. Oh, no. To the contrary. He played the role well and carried that film like a master. The cynicism in some people can be a real barrier sometimes, so DON'T FALL FOR IT. If I did, I would have missed out on one fine film. Thank you, Tim Burton for a great time in the movie theater, which is a rare treat these days...just go see MAMA MIA! Now THAT is a complete mess!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Was A Close Shave...,"I had to admit that Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street was one of the best musicals that I had seen in the past couple of years. It really showed me the great talent that Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter possessed. I only have a small amount of musicals in my personal DVD collection and would not mind adding Sweeney Todd to it. Revenge could drive any man to do any number of items, but the individual would have to understand the control of it. If revenge is not controlled, it would take over and then come back to haunt the individual later on in life. Revenge could give an individual a sense of relief and have the means to kill too. I am going to stay away from meat pies and be very careful of whom I have chosen as a dance partner.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disney movie in disguise.,"I should love this movie. I've enjoyed almost all Tim Burton films I've ever seen, and this is really more of the same, right? But... It's so insipid. Maybe I'M the one getting boring, maybe Tim Burton is losing it, who knows. Fact of the matter is that this movies made one thing painfully clear to me. Tim Burton is a director of edgeless mainstream movies if I ever saw one. Sure, there's blood, and people with black hair, and sort of crooked set designs, but it's concocted to fit a perfect formula, just like any blockbuster studio movie, and it doesn't seem to have the slightest intention of ever challenging that formula. No hint of anything truly disturbing, truly gritty, truly weird, or truly anything at all. Just a perfectly slick, formulaic, safe movie for a safe audience.I enjoy mainstream movies a lot, all they have to do is pretend to have substance and edge, and I'm willing to forgive so many flaws. But I don't think Burton ever considered challenging himself. Which to my mind makes him a very boring artist. I'm sure he's a very free spirited film maker, who makes his movies just the way he likes them, and how lovely and genuine of him that is. I'm sure Michael Bay makes movies just the way he likes them too. Doesn't make it interesting.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Sweeney"" and Burton form a beautiful marriage","If there is anyone that can do justice to Stephen Sondheim's sadistic musical on the silver screen, it is Tim Burton. ""Sweeney Todd,"" the director's latest, is an all around marvel of a film and Burton's most award-worthy project in a long time.""Sweeney"" stars Burton favorite Johnny Depp as the vengeful demon barber and of course Burton's wife, Helena Bonham-Carter, accompanies him as the strangely romantic accomplice, Mrs. Lovett. All that needs to be said about the plot is that it is based on vengeance, there is little dialogue not done in musical verse and it is very, very dark, insanely so.Depp delivers as the crazed, murderous Barber with a performance that after about thirty seconds could make anyone forget he uses the same exact accent for Jack Sparrow. Even his singing voice reaches levels that provide a dark yet beautiful quality for his deeply disturbed character. Bonham-Carter is not the best singer, but she gives the role an eerily humorous quality that works nicely. All the supporting roles prove excellent including Alan Rickman as Todd's nemesis, Timothy Spall as Rickman's despicable assistant and even ""Borat"" star Sacha Baren Cohen proves his ability to impersonate another nationality in the role of an Italian rival barber.From beginning to end the direction is superb and with Tim Burton's stamps all over it. The art direction, cinematography and costumes are all incredible and add a quality to the musical that the stage simply cannot. The dark palette (which accentuates the blood that Burton is clearly a big fan of) with specific color choice in parts truly brings out the strange beauty that Sondheim's music brings to this chilling tale.If you don't have a sensitive gag reflex, ""Sweeney Todd"" is a worthy film for anyone with the maturity to sit down and appreciate the nuance and the beauty of very dark tragedy. It is definitely not a film to watch when you want to be highly entertained, but it is an incredible story that is in the best of hands if one is ready to view it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Dark and Sinister Masterpiece,"Upon seeing Sweeney Todd, I had not seen the play, but was informed a little about the story. It sounded a little absurd, but I decided to give it a chance anyway. After leaving the theater I was more than satisfied. The film was great. Although the film was a musical, the music never feels forced or unrealistic and I actually enjoyed some of the songs. The singing was done very well by all actors especially by Depp who claims he has never sang publicly in his life and even more especially by Helena Boham Carter who had some very challenging songs to overcome. Acting was great and a great performance by Depp who shows how easily he can scare you by just glancing at you. The script was well written and all the characters well casted. We even get to see Sacha Baron Cohen who gives a brief but great performance as well. Overall a great film with great songs, acting, script, a great ending, and probably the only musical where you get to see someone get their throat slit. Another great Burton and Depp combination.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Tunes Don't Ring,"The story is fantastic and morbid/grotesque, the settings and production is well done, the cast plays well, and obviously Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and the others had their fun making this one, but still just a rate of 6!?My trouble is the music and as Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a musical this falls heavy into account. I even won't say that the voices are bad but still the songs and tunes don't ring to me like e.g. the songs in Moulin Rouge.Without the music and just as a regular fantasy/horror movie Sweeney Todd would get a rate of 8 from me, but as a musical the rate must be lower, so 6 it is. Yes, still a good watch, but either Sweeney Todd needs better tunes or it needs a transformation into a ""regular"" movie to be a really good one.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nutshell Review: Sweeney Todd,"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was slated to have been released end of next month. Then came the relatively strong opening in the West late last year, followed by nominations and wins in the Golden Globes, that it has now been bumped up for release this week, prior to the 3-way fight that the Asian movies will put up in the upcoming Lunar New Year week. I thought it was a no-brainer having to release this early as Johnny Depp is already a household name here thanks to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, and here he dons eye shadow and retains the bad teeth to play the titular character.One can imagine the troubles that a beautiful wife may bring, especially when people in positions of power find it easy to abuse that authority in order to covert her. Benjamin Parker (Depp), as he was originally known, was a naive young barber with a beautiful wife and kid, but corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) felt some strong stirring in his loins, enough to banish Parker for years, and taking a leaf out of Mask of Zorro's villain Don Rafael Montero, adopts Parker's child Johanna, only with plans to make the beautiful girl his wife when she comes of age (shades of Kim Ki-duk's The Bow too).So Parker returns with bad attitude and probably bad breath as well, to sing his way (you do know it's a musical, don't you?) into implementing his scheme of revenge on those who had trespassed him, and does so with the help of a lousy pie baker Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter). He slices and dices with his collection of silver blades, while she bakes and she cooks using ingredients on the cheap, and regular on supply, with a unique taste to boot.Based on the West End musical by Stephen Sondheim, this film adaptation by director Tim Burton have re-teamed his virtual cast from Corpse Bride with Depp and Carter in the lead roles of Sweeney Todd and Mrs Lovett, complete with pale skin and a Gothic wardrobe. They are no strangers to Burton, with Depp having collaborated with Burton since the days of Edward Scissorhands, which puts him in good steed as he now wields the barber blades, and 5 more films thereafter. Helena Bonham Carter, well, is his fiancée, so nuff said about that too. Together they share familiar chemistry already established, and chew up scenes especially when they sing their duets, and you'll feel somewhat sad for Mrs Lovett as she pines for Todd's love, which isn't forthcoming as he's so obsessed with trying to find opportunity to get close to Judge Turpin and exact his revenge.Tim Burton seemed to have been influenced a bit by the Asian ketchup director Chang Cheh, as blood get spilled by the bucketloads in similar style, and this time, done in very tongue- in-cheek manner with the spurts shooting quite exaggeratedly sky high and the drips emulating volumes from a waterfall. But there's no denying that it is wonderfully photographed, and is something you'd come to expect each time you watch a Burton film, complete with dark humour, and plenty of dark elements and themes. Being a musical, the songs are top notch, and the lyrics really classy, bringing out the emotions felt by the characters without unnecessary pomp, getting straight to the point.In fact, everyone in the movie, right down to the supporting cast like Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall had lines to sing, and I'm quite surprised to see (and hear) Alan Rickman's piece, together with Depp's, which was, though short, quite wonderful. Alas, and I think I'm getting quite anal here and hopefully I arrest this problem soon, the romance between Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) and Johanna (Jayne Wisener) seemed a little too contrived and emotionally empty, and I rather disliked the way their love developed, or left hanging - even though we could've guessed the likely outcome, Burton decided to end the movie in the best possible way it could without dwelling too much on the obvious. Which means the final act zooms past a tad too fast after a deliberate, measured build up.Oh, and watch out too for Sacha ""Borat"" Baron Cohen in a small supporting role as Italian tout Pirrelli who sells magical hair elixirs, which was well worth its moments. But if there's one thing I'd take away from the movie, is that to beware the barber's blade. Somehow Eastern Promises had started it, and now Sweeny Todd highlights the dangers. Hope it stays in movieland, and not inspire anyone out there who'd think they're the fastest, cleanest shave in town! Recommended for the songs, which lifted the ho-hum story.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Fine Adaptation of the Phantasmagory of Theatre,"Grimly stylised with Burton's usual level of gothic flare, the film's stark contrast and unnatural visuals help to create the illusion of a Broadway show on screen, suspending the element of disbelief well to its favour. Sondheim's music is well adapted, if somewhat let down by the singing ability of the cast who were clearly chosen for their skills with dialogue more than song, but somehow this also adds to the movie's surreality and gives it the lasting feel of a musical adaptation of Hammer Horror; boasting all the quirks that fans of classic Sixties Horror love with just a dash of modernism.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A primarily loyal adaptation,"Sweeney Todd is one of my all time favorite Broadway shows, and I had full trust in Tim Burton's ability to faithfully adapt Stephen Sondheims masterpiece. He did this except for a few problems.First and foremost; the shows framing ""Ballad"" number was replaced with an instrumental. It was disappointing to me to see the signature song cut. Also, although the cast put on great performances, they were nothing compared to the original Broadway cast. Finally, the amount of blood was way over the top.Now on to the good parts. The sets and orchestrations were brilliant. Truly great cinematography. Also, the shining performance came from Beadle Bamford, as portrayed by the gifted Timothy Spall. He is just plain incredible.good reasons to see the movie: If you love the musical, are trying to get interested in musicals, or have a good sense for dark humorbad reasons to see the movie: Don't see it expecting a slasher flick (it does have a lot of blood, but it is still the brilliant Sondheim musical)Overall grade: 88%",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

more fun going there than getting there,"The Tim Burton signature style is in place and there is a lot of wit on display though not much laughter in the audience. This is likely as good a movie as could be made of Sweeney Todd, however. I was restless during the daughter/ward's light little song at the window and eager to see the partnership formulate between Barber and Cook, a moment which feels long in coming when it arrives. I miss the a few chorus bits from the play, including the title which puts one in the mind frame of opera and also the lyrics ""God that's good"" although the scene and song associated with it remain. It seems they just made a choice to let individuals do the singing and eliminate any chorus. The movie is more about a kind of dark, giddy anticipation of fun nastiness until the tragedy of ""idiot plot"" elements is revealed, what the late Gene Siskel used to call the questions that might reasonably have been asked which would have stopped the movie in its tracks. Despite the fact that the material both celebrates rage and revenge while at the same time preaching indirectly that it is married to indiscriminate evil. . . the film is diverting. It hasn't got the sweet or underdog core of Edward Scissorhands or Sleepy Hollow, but it is fun. If you hate musicals it may not turn you and it's not as kitchy fun as Grease or Little Shop; it's in the middle, slamming the elite while selling them tickets for years and giving them a close shave.",,Anonymous,Horror
Tricky,"This is strictly Tim Burton's take on the stage musical ""Sweeney Todd."" As such, it is almost surrealistic in its retelling of the legend of the Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Johnny Depp as Todd has returned to London after 15 years away, having been shanghaied so that the local judge (Alan Rickman) can have his way with Todd's comely young wife. Todd keeps to the shadows as he plots his revenge, with the aid of a pie maker, Mrs. Lovett (Helena Carter), who remembers and adores him. The two are soon turning into meat pies all who enter Sweeney's chair, as Todd broods on how to get his razor around the judge's throat. The songs are imaginatively staged and sung, and Depp is as usual completely immersed in his character. He's a razor-wielding, hollow-eyed maniac with a mission. The throat cuttings are plentiful and shown in extreme closeup. The bodies then fall head-first with a sickening thud onto the cellar floor three stories below. This is more intense and realistic violence than Burton exhibited in SLEEPY HOLLOW, so those of weak constitutions beware. And definitely keep the kiddies away!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"gory, showy, black comedy, good performances","Long-awaited and presented as a musical gore-fest, this 'Sweeney Todd' is excellent and does full justice to the Sondheim musical. Who would have thought that Johnny Depp could sing and put across the songs (Epiphany, Pretty Women, Johanna, etc.), albeit in a slightly higher register than some previous Sweeneys and with more than a nod to the vocal style of Anthony Newley and other Broadway greats? Who could have imagined the English rose, Helena Bonham-Carter, as Mrs Lovett, maker of 'The Worst Pies in London'?Johanna and Anthony, smaller characters,are soppy cyphers on the side but some other clever casting (Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli, Timothy Spall as the Beadle, Alan Rickman as the Judge - his duet with Depp is a delight) makes this film extremely watchable. Yes, there's a lot of blood and the violence is graphic and realistic, more so than any stage production. Dark and brooding, this London is one of shadows, broken hearts, bitterness, and mystery.I miss 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd' though - theatrical though that song is, it sets the tone and acts as a chorus throughout the drama, and if you know the stage play well, you instantly notice it has been cut. However, there are more than enough Sondheim songs remaining, done well, and fitting perfectly with the way the film has been shot. The opening credits are also well done and appropriate.Maybe this is the first 18 rated musical, but it is a mix of genres which works well.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing Short of a Masterpiece,"As a director, Tim Burton has made a collection of eccentric and altogether different films that have been greeted with mostly positive praise. He has legions of devoted fans that think him the most brilliant man in the world. His skills have always been considered something special, and altogether different.Sweeney Todd is the crowning achievement of his career. If this film does not sweep the Academy Awards, they are some seriously bad judges.Everything here is done to perfection, creating a world unlike anything you've ever seen. Visually, the film is stunning. Everything from set design to costumes and make-up is done wonderfully. Then there's Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in two of their best roles, giving Oscar-worthy performances. They are also surrounded by a very talented supporting cast. All film-making aspects are put together perfectly.But in the end, it's the amazing story that makes it something truly incredible. As someone who has never seen the stage show, Sweeney Todd literally took the wind out of me by the end; this tale of the evil of humans and the blinding power of revenge and greed is something you'll never forget. Apart from the leads of Sweeney (Depp) and Mrs. Lovett (Carter), there are two smaller characters who work their way in as contrasts to the anti-heroes. They show the desperate hope that people hang onto amidst the evil of men, a hope that can scarcely survive. This is a story of a man blinded by rage and driven to madness. It is at the same time both terrifying, disgusting, and heartbreaking. Not to mention darkly funny.Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is probably one of the finest creations ever put on film. The only thing that could hold it back from Oscars is that it is based on previously written material. If it were an original motion picture, there would be no competition. Do yourself a favor and see this masterpiece on the big screen, but don't take the kids: It is, at heart, a horror film. 9/10 stars!Jay Addison",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Flawed, but not a bad flick","I wrote a review of Sweeney Todd immediately after I saw it, and ranted about how embarrassingly terrible it was.Well, I've since changed my opinion. The film is flawed in several ways, but not nearly as bad as I initially thought.Depp and Carter do an excellent job in their roles as Sweeney and Lovett, however, I stand by my initial statement as far as their vocals go - they're just not good enough, particularly Carter's. I would think that with his millions of dollars, Depp would have been able to get at least some basics in musical theatre singing. Carter's performance of ""worst pies in London"" bothered me more than anything in the film. Not only weak vocally, it lacked the energy that it was written to have. But excellent acting on not only Depp and Carter's part, but Rickman and Spall do an excellent job in their roles as Judge Turpin and the Beadle as well.Anthony and Toby (Bower and Sanders) were not good. Anthony was also very weak vocally, and Toby was just too young and inexperienced to really live his role. I would much rather have seen Toby played by an older, yet petite tenor.Cohen was funny and charming as Pirelli, though I think he would have been better off incorporating more of his ""mock"" opera voice - that's the way the part was written to be sung! It's not supposed to be particularly pretty.So while the film was lacking on the vocal end (Sondheim is not for singers that don't know their stuff!), the solid performances on the acting end come close to making up for the vox.Oh, and some scenes were overtly gory. It got distracting. And while I understand Burton's cutting of the opening ""ballad of sweeney todd"", It would have been nice to hear it at the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sweeney Todd Was Beautiful!,"Beautifully filmed and stylized. Very dark but that is to be expected as it is based off a very dark legend of Sweeney Todd.

I hope to see more of Sonheim's musicals coming to film, such as the amazing musical Company.Very bloody which is very interesting to see having seen the stage production where gruesome blood is slightly harder to pull off with such a vivid outcome as Tim Burton's interpretation.Overall one of the best movies I have seen this year and my favorite Tim Burton film to date with the exception of Nightmare Before Christmas.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Tim Burton: One of the worlds foremost directors ignites the screen,"Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please!? Growing up we become accustomed to what our parents and our elders take part in. In most cases, it is almost as if we are given traits, post-birth. My family, in particular, oozed of theater. So, you can see where I am trying to lead this comment. I came across Sweeney Todd when I was about 9 years old. I have been used to all of the ""campy"" and ""happy"" productions such as: oliver, The Kind and I, and many others. So, after hearing the story and seeing it live a few times, I immediately and helplessly fell in love with it.Fast forward 11 years. I have been pursuing a career in the arts and entertainment industry for about 3 years. With film-making, we look up to our favorite directors. Mine being Tim Burton, for instance. Movies let us escape into the mind of the director. It is as if we are the directors themselves. Sweeney Todd, is most definitely one of biggest and most challenging projects Burton has come across. I came on opening night, with songs from the Broadway production, clear in my mind. Upon walking into the theater I felt an uneasiness that continued on toward the first song, ""No Place Like London."" I thought, ""Oh dear, another butchered adaptation."" But let it be known, as the film continued, the voices - which at first were tempting me to walk out - began to suit the film. Johnny Depp's voice suited his character very well, and his performance was nothing less than his best.Sweeney Todd is a feast for the eyes. With dark, eerie, and beautiful sets, we are emerged into Tim's world of Sweeney Todd. It is a refreshing take on a once beloved theatrical masterpiece from one of the worlds greatest play writers.

"Sweeney Todd:Burton and Depp together again, a cut above the rest","""My one true friend!"" as Sweeney Todd sings this line, leering into the mirror, viewing the reflection of himself, in the polished silver, straight edged, razer he holds tenderly in his hand, close to his demonic face, once again after 18 years of incarceration, a sardonic smile appears. The audience knows that blood will flow, and lives will be lost, in a revenge driven musical, based on the original play by Stephen Sondheim. Johnny Depp takes on the persona of the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, with such ease one would almost imagine he was not play acting at all. Joining Mr. Todd is the lovely (sic) Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who joins him in this lively but deadly, duet. Mr. Todd and Mrs. Lovett make a handsome couple, although their facial colors are a bit ashen, and the circles about their eyes are rather dark, non the less they seem quite appropriate, for working class folk in the mid-1800s, in London, England.This 'R' rated opera is lavishly funny, with ghoulish glimpses, of blood curdling buffoonery, and musical merriment, although, it is difficult to hear all of the wonderful lines, in the verses in the songs, while one is laughing, from the previous lines,while listening to the quick witted phrases currently being sung by our favorite, devilish duo. Mrs. Lovett runs a bakery, specializing in meat pies on Fleet Street. She allows Mr. Todd to use the room above her Estblisment to ply his close cutting trade. This gives rise to a fresh supply, and a new ingredient, for Mrs. Lovett's now fiendishly good meat pies, and an increase in business. Special notice must be given to the performances by, Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Ed Sanders. Be forewarned; this is not everyones tea cake. Sweeney Todd does get carried away while shaving some of his customers, too closely!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"There is so much singing, you actually get used to it.","The only reason i would give this movie a six and not an 8 is that i am not particularly fond of musicals.

Jonny Depp is excellent in this movie. I believe he didn't ever attempt to sing before this film, i could be wrong but in any case he does a good job. Alan Rickman is his usual convincing self as the ""bad guy"". I really enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter's character as well, very darkly portrayed. I reckon the mixture of Musical and Horror isn't a bad idea at all and gives the film a very surreal feeling which helps you maintain interest in the film.

I mean the music is very good and Johnny and Carter have some of the best voices I have ever heard and I did not expect that.This is the typical revenge story but and feels very different and that singing just made feel that it was more personal. The visuals are stunning and just breathtaking and this film really shows what kind of a film maker Tim Burton is.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
You Won't Want To Leave Your Seat!,"From the moment those dark, blood-soaked gears began turning to it's bloody and epic conclusion, I was hooked. Tim Burton truly delivers in this big-screen adaptation of one of America's classic musicals. From the get-go, there is a classic Burton-esquire theme, from the drab streets of filth-covered London to Depp's shroud of hatred for those around him. Depp performs unlike any other with his dark musical numbers and his pairing with Carter (Mrs. Lovett) works out perfectly, with just the right amount of secret admiration on Carter's part. Sweeney Todd is one movie that you won't bring yourself to get popcorn during!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Old Chemistry Of Burton And Depp Do Not Work Always,"Tim Burton is a great filmmaker. He can really shine in his warped, wry, painfully gory movies. Johnny Depp is a very deep and mature master of acting. He is the star. But sometimes, something wrong happens. Like in this much hyped movie. Sweeny Todd starts very well, then it gets sickly sick, then simply gory, then unbearable, then horribly terrible. No, this ain't about singing. After all, Depp sings much like David Bowie, Helen Carter Bonham boasts of quite strong falsetto, and even Alan Rickman is not devoid of depth and imagination. The songs are sometimes too banal and prolonged, but this is not so bad. What is really poor is the plot. You never feel sorry for poor Todd and his wife's fate, as well as his daughter's future. The situation balances between complacency and stupidity. And then, all of a sudden, Sweeny starts lacerating throats of many innocent men, with all that blood gushing so thick that Burton comes closely to Quentin Tarantino with his total lack of any taste. Depp is vapid, miserable and extremely poor all throughout the film, as well as Bonham who simply is laughable. The same may be said about wholly weak part of Sasha Baron Cohen and his character. All this is forgettable, as well as the line of Johanna, Todd's daughter, and her future. This part of the script is hugely underdeveloped and thus begs wanting. Blood is all galore, no real script, no deeper efforts, no persuasive performance  the movie is a large waste of your time, your money and patience. It only proves that great men often fail and flop most miserably.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Unbelievable Movie, with few faults","This was a great movie, from start to finish. Every character was fit to play their role even Timothy Spall (Wormtail from Harry Potter series) fit his role well, except for his musical parts which truly were outrageous. Johnny Depp, however, sang beautifully, it was unbelievable, he really made you immerse yourself into his character, and sometimes even feel bad for him. Tim Burton also prospered with this movie. The dark, and melodramatic mood is rightfully Tim Burton's strong points, and trust me, this movie contains a lot of darkness. Though humorous, I believe that the true genre of this film is drama. Many battles for love and vengeance take place, which are humorous, but dramatic all the while. The main fault with this movie was it was overly gory. So gory, that the audience could tell it was fake, which is good in a sense, yet still quite stomach quenching. Other than that, the movie was perfectly adapted from the revered musical. The storyline captivates, the characters move you to tears, the twists and turns thrust you left to right, and the music was tremendous. I highly suggest that you watch this movie. Don't take your kids though. 9/10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Completely Unique and Different!,"First of all the Sweeney Todd script is unique itself being a musical. Burton's vision was perfect for it. So dark with some vivid colors at times.The whole plot of Sweeney getting his revenge because the love of his life was taken away was so touching. And all the little quirks throughout the movie with all the different characters was so much fun to watch.I went into the movie knowing it would be a great movie, but it exceeded my expectations by far! There was humor, a lot of emotions, incredible music, and so much talent from the actors. It was also weird and creepy at times, but I loved it anyway! I highly suggest you to see this if you want to see a movie so different from any other movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wonderful Music With Poor Singing,"The script for Sweeney Todd has taken a few liberties with the original material, but that's not the biggest issue. The main issue is casting non-singers such as Depp and Bonham Carter in the lead roles of a musical. Thankfully, they're not horrible enough to go out of key, but their voices lack the power and dramatic heft needed to play these roles. Depp does better than Bonham Carter whose teeny tiny whisper of a voice doesn't convince as the bombastic chatterbox of a pie shop owner. Director Tim Burton shoots the murder sequences with a nice eye for operatic violence, but he's not a very musical director and removes a lot of the gallows humor from the piece.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Dark, Brutal, Poetic and a Classic","I usually don't like dark movies but this one impressed me. I was stunned.

Very much to my surprise....,"I am one of those Sondheim devotees. ""Sweeney Todd"" is up there with my favorite Sondheim works. I've seen it a number of times on stage including some very fine productions.I have never liked a single film I ever saw by Tim Burton, not one. I have always thought Johnny Depp the most overrated actor of his generation. In the light of this I was not at all pleased to find out that Tim Burton would be bringing Sweeney to the screen and with Depp in the title role.I thought that I would give this movie a miss but my curiosity got the better of me. Despite my justified misgivings, the film simply works and surprisingly well at that. Burton's cinematic treatment comes closer to the core of the story than any stage production seems able to do. It does this at the expense of the music. In the theater the music dominates in all it's brilliance and beauty. In the movie with its under sung performances, the music serves its function without overshadowing the elements of story or the characters themselves. Depp (sounding much like David Bowie) and Bonham Carter, while vastly different from any Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett you've ever heard, do make it work by giving character driven performances rather than musically informed ones. Mrs. Lovett, indelibly stamped by Angela Lansbury's whackiness becomes far more real with Helen Bonham Carters more nuanced treatment which still manages to maintain a certain comic edge.It might not be my ideal screen version; I still believe stronger voices are required, (Alan Rickman in particular barely makes it), but its a well made very forceful piece of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Get Ready for a Bloody Good Time,"My wife and I saw this 12/21/2007 with a full audience. This movie involves highly-rated actors singing instead of highly-rate singers acting. As such, singing is fair-to-good, but the acting and drama is first rate. Dreamworks/Warner Bros. could not have picked a better director than Tim Burton, a quirky leader for a quirky musical.The costumes and sets truly take you back to London as it was in 1785. My hats off to the art and set crew.Johnny Depp is wonderful as the obsessed barber of Fleet Street bent on revenge. Helena Bonham Carter is crazy good as the pining-for-Todd Mrs. Lovett. Indeed, I was strongly reminded of this choice of actors as a kind of Pirates of the Caribbean meets Harry Potter, with their heavy use of eye shadow, and the use of Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin (Snape for H.P. fans) and Timothy Spall as Beadle (Wormtail for H.P. fans). Truly, an Oscar-winning team if I ever saw one.However, this film, true to the nature of the musical, is dark and bloody. Tim Burton takes Stephen Sondheim's musical and up's the gore to the Nth degree. This is not for the squeamish.I hope that when the DVD of this film is released, the production will have the good sense to offer a ""sanitized"" play track on the disc so that my family doesn't have to see the blood over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Burton + Depp = Greatness,"I don't usually like musicals, they are not my favorite genre, but I like Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, so yes, I gave it a chance, I'm not familiar with Sweeney Todd but after seeing this now I know his motives of doing the things he did. The movie was decent and maybe I'm saying this because like I said I'm not a big Musical movie fan. I liked the dark theme scenario on the entire movie, Sacha Baron Cohen singing wattttttt he was good, too bad he got killed early in the movie. In my opinion besides Johnny Depp delivering a good performance, I think Helena was freaking great in here, I like a lot she can played this weird villain characters so well, Tim Burton did a great job on this movie, I see why people liked a lot this movie, if I liked Musicals maybe I would of liked it more, but Liked the story, how it develop and men Alan Rickman was good too, with great twist at the end that is really well deliver and reserve, that's why I liked the movie. I like Tim Burton I like Johnny Depp and there is not a movie that won't stay in me they work great together.

Stylish and macabre musical that effortlessly entertains,"Tim Burton is a master of style and he brings all of his experience and talent to bear here. Supported by brilliant performances and impressive music, Burton's ""Sweeney Todd"" is a really fine piece of cinematic entertainment.It is a masterclass from Burton as a director. He toys with the audience's feelings, sympathies and ideals, all the while immersing them in world that is grim, unforgiving and twisted. He shocks and entertains and creates humour out of horror. The film looks fantastic, makes you laugh and is pumped with violence and shock-horror. The make-up and the costume are brilliantly monochrome, but the Gothic design of the film as a whole is ingenious, all, ultimately, down to Burton's skill and imagination. From the bloody title sequence to the bloody end, Burton is always in control and never puts a foot wrong.The story of a wronged man's descent into madness and murder is a classic fable that requires a central performance that has to be entirely believable and Burton gets this from Johnny Depp who is, quite simply, superb. His performance remains human, even through Todd's darkest moments, and this is crucial, as an inhuman Todd loses all sympathy. Depp holds that sympathy. He is pitch-perfect and every shot that focuses on him is filled with interest.Depp is brilliantly supported, chiefly by Bonham Carter who is excellent and has tangible chemistry with Depp, both of whom eek out humour at any opportunity. Then there are the trio of established English thesps, Rickman, Spall and Baron Cohen. Rickman is a convincing villain, though you get the sense that his usual venom is somewhat subdued, though he is still entertaining. Timothy Spall is chillingly creepy and Baron Cohen is hilarious in his small but memorable role. But mention must be made of the young Ed Sanders, as the workhouse boy who has a difficult role which he pulls off extremely well.All of them sing well, with Sondheim's music, beautiful and engrossing, filtering into the film effortlessly. Some of them sing brilliantly (Depp and Bonham Carter especially), bringing humour or emotion to the songs whenever required, which is essential. The music is also brilliantly orchestrated, emphasising the tone.All of these elements build up the brilliant climax in this wonderful, macabre and entertaining piece of work; more than solid, darkly comic and pretty satisfying fare. I urge you to see it  not for the squeamish, but utterly enjoyable.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Blood, gore and a cracking tale!","If you have a taste for a dark tale, with lashings of blood, an unquenchable sadness, that leads to terrible deeds, then this is the film for you. The singing was wonderful, and there is so much humour in the lyrics; thank goodness that the actors took so much trouble learning to sing. Helena Bonham-Carter is fantastic as Sweeney's partner in crime; her singing is astonishing, as her words don't get lost in a warble of sound, but rather trip across the ears to amuse the audience.Johnny Depp is dark, completely focused of his awful quest. His singing is also a revelation, strong where it needs to be, with a menacing undertone. He wields his razors with the grace of a flamenco dancer, but they leave a lethal trail right across the story.I adore Tim Burton's touches of humour, and his dark, Victorian vision makes this film a fitting companion to his back catalogue. The other actors all fitted their characters like a glove, with Ed Sanders and Timothy Spall deserving special mention for bringing a comic touch to their horrible creations. Can't wait for the DVD and all the extras!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""A Little Priest"" wasn't religiously carried out, but otherwise...","Apart from the ""A Little Priest"" scene, which was wasted, as the perverse humor that should have prevailed was completely missing, along with one of the stanzas, this was a gem of a movie. Depp's Sweeney Todd/Benjamin Barker although a bit one note and lacking in dimension was still compelling and who knew he could carry a tune? The duet he sang with Bonham Carter, in particular, was quite nicely done, in fact. I think a more boisterous and lusty rendering of Mrs. Lovett and an uplifting ending, with Anthony and Johanna escaping together, would have fared better and wouldn't have detracted from the overall Grand-Guignol theme. But, still, I enjoyed the film and most of the music, which is more than I can say about the majority of Broadway musical film adaptations.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Excellent Movie Version,"Many times the movie adaptations of the stage tend to seem almost desperate in attempts to break free from the restrictions imposed on the original productions by live theater. Cinema is truly a different art form, as the early silent greats discovered when trying to film the stage hits of their day. Burton does a marvelous job of opening up the stage production and making it truly a movie.I have to admit, being a huge fan of the stage show, every edit & change in the music was jarring. However in looking back the only part that I thought wasn't an appropriate edit was in the song ""God that's good."" Sweeney, true to any Tim Burton character (Pee Wee, Edward Scissorhands, Batman), is fascinated with gadgetry in this movie, eliminating the need for a new chair to be delivered and eliminating ""is that a chair fit for a king?"" song. The patrons of Mrs. Lovett's pie shop no longer smack their lips singing ""God that's good."" I did find the elimination of the Greek chorus from the story appropriate for the movie. A movie can condense story exposition quickly in a few images, making the chorus redundant. This makes the story zing along with almost as much speed as the frenetic camera movement from the docks to Fleet street. The violence is much more graphic, but suitable for the macabre comedy it is intended to be.As far as performances, I found Depp to be an astonishingly good singer and effective Sweeney. Rickman is superb, as always. Cohen was a surprise as Pirelli, singing well and mining the comedy deftly without being over the top. The young lad playing Toby was a revelation and one can only hope he is cast in a remake of Oliver! Carter, on the other hand left a lot to be desired. She was adequate, but no more than that. If anything the movie suffers due to the lack of a talent comparable to Lansbury from the stage version.Overall the movie satisfied me greatly. I had felt that many of Burton's latest efforts were sub par. Sweeney Todd reaffirms my belief in his talent as a top notch filmmaker.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dark Humor Over the Top,"Sweeney Todd has some marvelous scenes and great acting. It is highly entertaining in parts, particularly the first half. However, it seemed to go over the top with disgusting and unnecessary scenes.Johnny Depp was well suited to this role - he is always at the top of his game. His facial expressions, in particular, added great depth to the character. He was at his best in Helena Bonham Carter's romantic day dream of the beach and marriage. That said, the voice he used will take viewers back to Captain Jack in Pirates. Several expressions could have fit that character equally as well. Such are the minefields, I suppose, of doing movies back to back with British accents.The beauty of this movie is that it's a musical. The lyrics and music create a seductively funny elixir. Depp, Carter and the rest of the crew were exceptionally entertaining. Sasha Baron Cohen was perfect for his role. In fact, the casting for this film was as good as it gets.The one negative was the gore. I understand the nature of the film and the need for it. However, I think that it could have been pulled off with a bit less in parts. The second half of the film became a bit too disgusting. He dwelled a bit too long on the gore in some camera shots and I think would have accomplished his purpose equally as well without some of that. I understand, as well, that this is part of Burton's style. But, in terms of entertainment, the film could have been improved with a bit more subtlety an innuendo in parts. It is reminiscent of Fargo with it's dark humor; however, while Fargo had some gore, it was not unnecessarily ""in your face"" with it. That's not to be hypercritical of Burton's work here. But, he's done better without this.Overall it has great entertainment value, but I know many will stay away from the film due to it's incessant over the top gore in the second half of the film. Midway through - I was thinking, my wife might actually enjoy this ... I may need to call some friends and tell them to go see it ... by the end of the film, I thought, ""there's no way."" Some will like it, as I did, but I know many who would not. It's a shame as they would enjoy very much the singing, the humor, the darkness, and the acting, but will be a bit turned off in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
a work of art on all levels,"Tim Burtons adaptation of the Broadway musical thriller ""Sweeney Todd"" is nothing short of genius. Johnny Depp scowls, sings, and slashes his way stunningly throughout. Whilst Helena Bonham-Carter as Mrs.Lovett provides the perfect delusional partner in crime, disposing of his victims by baking them in pies and serving them to the unsuspecting London public, for love.Stephen Sondheims masterpiece first opened on Broadway in 1979 starring Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou. Audiences were stunned and thrilled by the ground breaking score and titilated by the gruesome story based on the old London legend of ""Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"". The films main cast are not Broadway vocalists, however this does not detract from the work, indeed it suits it well in this form as not to put off anyone not familiar or comfortable with ""muvicals"". The young supporting cast Jamie Campbell Bower, Laura Michelle Kelly, Jayne Wisener and Ed Sanders do have theatrical voices however which brings a nice touch to the more tender if uneasy moments of the story. Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall are delightfully demonic and loathsome as the villains who are responsible for Sweeneys cataclysmic character change into the murderous revenge seeking barber. I particularly liked the extra scene (not in the stage production) written for Judge Turpin ( Rickman) which enphasizes his black hearted villainy. Sasha Baron Cohen will surprise many with his fleeting and nearly scene stealing appearance.This film is truly a work of art on all levels, and one can feel the loyalty to Sondheims creation throughout. Purists of the stage production may well miss the material that has been left out, but I'm sure they will also agree that for Tim Burtons vision of the terrible tale, the focus needed to be fixed on the main characters and peripheral choruses would detract and not enhance on film. This is a bloody terrific and terrifying treat for anyone over 18 ( and not squeamish!).The Fan Carpet - www.thefancarpet.com",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tremendous movie, acting and the score, But. .","I would give this picture a ""9"" if it weren't for the execrable balance of the sound mix. The music is excellent (why not), well recorded. The singers are excellent (even though new at the art), BUT the final audio mix has the singers fighting with the score. Many times their words are drowned by the music, even though the reverse so be the case.I wanted to HEAR Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett in their duets, but often that was not the case. For that matter, the production dialog was lost here and there.Other than that, here is a case where the use of computer graphics is more than justified. We see the play in late 19th century London, and it looked very real. An excellent picture in spite of the audio.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Redux,"In my opinion, it is the Hamlet of today. Tim Burton should have the reputation for being meticulous in his production of work, because he is. Every element is considered, no matter the medium.I am a person who cannot stand a play that is sung, a musical production, but for once, I was stunned and absolutely amazed. That in itself is a triumph of the film, but what became of this movie was more, a beautiful credit to story telling.The idea that Sweeney Todd was at his most vulnerable when a man identified him as himself is brilliant. Not when his throat is cut by a child but by an observant individual that he is forced to overcome by physical means. It is a tribute to the blindness of men.The ending I adore for one reason- everyone gets what they want.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good performance from Depp, Rickman and Bonham Carter as always. Classic Tim Burton style. Just not the best musical. And a flat romance between Campbell Bower and Wisener","I love Tim Burton, I have seen all of his films. This is one that when it came out I was very excited and expecting something really special. I have watched it a number of times since then with a clearer head, and though it is enjoyable because of its unique Burtonesque/gothic/musical experience, there is a spark missing that prevents it being up with the best of Burton. I think 7.3 is an appropriate score. The songs aren't the greatest, though this is not a fault of Burton's. Great performance from Johnny as always as Sweeney Todd. And you've got the late great Alan Rickman as always. You don't rally buy into the romance between Jamie Campbell Bower and Jane Wisener though, that's probably what is missing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Weeney Todd-the Wimpy Barber of Fleet St.,"Awful, just plain awful. A typical Tim Burton movie with bizarrely unimaginative computer generated sets,and singing that makes ""High School Musical""seem like high art. Depp comes off as a rather effeminate Sweeny and that gray streak in his hair makes him look all the worse. Bonham-Carter is wasted again in a part that she is obviously too young for. The songs are OK-they are by Sondheim right? but for some reason they seem like an afterthought. It seems Burton could not make up his mind on whether this was a musical or another one of his self-indulgent and quite tiresome journeys into cinematic ""art"". Also on hand is Sasha Baron Cohen playing an Italian in a Borat like style that is totally devoid of any substance. The rest of the cast consists of no-name actors. This drivel can't hold a candle to the Broadway original or the filmed Hearn-Landsbury version of the late 1980s.You've seen it all before-just rent ANY Tim Burton movie, add some songs and a wimpy Johnny Depp and viola-you got it! Avoid it like the plague!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Depp can't sing,"Tim Burton is not a fan of musicals and it shows. The leads were cast before they were able to sing their parts. In particular, Johnny Depp (Sweeny Todd) can just barely get by musically, and most of the other actors in this show can do no better. The only people I liked listening to were Cohen (Pirelli, and utterly unlike Borat) and Sanders (Toby the boy). Everything visual in this production is marvelous...although I do wish the blood looked more like blood. The acting...I don't know acting well enough to fault it anywhere. Helena Bonham Carter...well,she's just draws one in, wanting to see what she'll do next. Considering this is her first singing role, wow. Her voice keeps the movie from falling flat. A quick check on Wikipedia reveals that about half the songs from the musical were cut for the movie. That's my main feeling after seeing this: what would the complete show, with professional singers be like. I bet it's good. But I'm not sure I'll get around to making a special trip and shelling out $75 a ticket. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Stylish, if a little too musical","I think the biggest problem I have with Sweeney Todd is with the concept itself, that of a horror musical. There's something just weirdly incongruous about people singing about killing and cannibalism, you know? Maybe it's just me; I like musicals, and I like horror movies, but I don't know if the twain should meet.That said, the time-honored premise of Sweeney Todd is diabolically gruesome, and I mean that in the most positive way. Todd is the former Benjamin Barker, a barber who's been exiled from nineteenth-century London by a corrupt judge, who then swooped in and took Barker's wife from him for good measure. Fifteen years later, Barker, now known as Todd, returns to the city, but his wife Lucy, raped and driven mad by the judge (Alan Rickman) has killed herself, and Todd's daughter Johanna is the judge's ward.Todd opens a barber shop above a bakery owned by a Mrs. Lovett, who's soon encouraging Todd to exact his revenge. They hatch the perfect plan: She needs meat, he needs revenge, so they work in concert, since Todd's moral compass has spun off its magnetic axis. Everyone wins! The movie was directed by Tim Burton, and his imprint is noticeable right from the start, with a rivulet of blood coursing through well-worn machine gears over the title cards. When you think of Tim Burton, you think of stylish, don't you, not placid, or heavily plot driven, or over-the-top action. You think of the visual images, the freewheeling, indelibly intriguing imagination that brought you Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and the Corpse Bride. Here, Burton is incredibly successful; the set pieces are magnificent, as is his use of color. When Todd slashes a throat, vibrant reds attack the screen in stark contrast to the staid, mostly black backgrounds (and the pallid complexions of the Londoners, of course).Prior to the film's release, there was more than a little bit of nervousness about the casting of Johnny Depp, a longtime Burton collaborator. This was to be an adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim stage presentation, a version of the old tale that - surprise - required actual singing. Could Johnny Depp lend enough gravitas to the dark role of Sweeney Todd? Sure, as far as actual acting went, but could he even carry a tune? Turns out he can, although I wouldn't sign him to any recording contracts. He's an okay singer; let's leave it at that. But he's fantastic, naturally, as the demonic barber - who, let's be frank, looks like Edward Scissorhands' dad or perverted uncle.Also proving to be a decent singer was Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett. I don't know what it is about Bonham Carter, but she almost always looks like she's playing a strung-out crack addict. Must be the saucer eyes and the paleness. At any rate, she's a real treat, as usual, as the wicked, duplicitous Gothic baker of unique meat pies.The movie is 116 minutes long, but if you cut out the musical numbers you'd be left with perhaps 45 minutes. True, many plot points are expressed via song, but it's not long before those songs feel forced, inauthentic, and superfluous. Granted, the songs themselves are thematically downbeat, not of the happy-joy variety, and granted, they're there to move the plot along, rather than inhibit it, but therein lay a problem. When the actors sang, they sang loudly. When they were merely speaking, they spoke softly. And this wasn't like 1940s musicals, where the songs are telegraphed ahead of time; the actors would go from talking to SINGING to talking to SINGING and I spent much of those 116 minutes adjusting the volume. Seriously - the dialog is so softly spoken it's very difficult to hear, even if the sound's turned up, and what's more, the characters all have nearly unintelligible (to me) Cockney accents that drop vowels, consonants, punctuation, you name it. I needed subtitles.So although the movie didn't quite do it for me, I can appreciate what it was trying to accomplish. Indeed, judging from the many accolades it received, it was quite successful. If you're looking for an ultraviolent horror show filled with singing, you will not be disappointed, although I can't imagine there'd be much competition for that dubious honor.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Depp animates a tragic hero yet again,"A few words about Tim Burton's production of what has been performed as live theatrical performance up until now (as far as I know there hasn't been a movie made of it previously). Fans of Burton's admirable ability to capture a tragic hero's quest for finding a niche in a cruel world -- a world that has no understanding, and less tolerance, for misfits -- will not be disappointed in Sweeney Todd.Where there is a possibility that live performers have captured the torment of Sweeney, it is certain that Johnny Depp succeeds. He exudes torment. He is a man driven. Obsessed even. He brings Sweeney, a man who is, in all spiritual respects a walking corpse, to life. He's a man who has been driven to madness by the cruelty of human nature turned against him, yet manages to keep enough wits about himself to wreak a considerable amount of payback.The rest of the cast shows no flaw. A short but sweet cameo by Sasha Baron Cohen, is the only splash of color other than red in the dreariness of the geographical and human landscape. The young lad who gets drawn into the madness looks like he will have an acting career ahead of him. Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Burton's long-term partner, has nailed her role as the consummately common baker of meat pies, expert roach smasher, and unrequited lover. Alan Rickman plays the perverse villain with his usual flair. I like the closeups of his face, which is gathering even more character, believe it or not, as he ages. His loyal, sneering manservant (sorry his name escapes me, but he plays a similar minion in Enchanted) adds his talents to the mix. The naives playing the roles of sailor and ward are sweet and innocent pawns unwittingly drawn in as well.Expect lots of blood and some rather graphic violence as the bodies hit the floor.Expect to be surprised by the pleasant sounds of Depp and Bonham-Carter's voices.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sweeney Todd,"Sweeney Todd I knew this was a musical. I saw in the trailers  that it was dark, and bloody; a different genre of film production!Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) convicts the barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) on false charges, rapes Benjamin's wives and destroys a wonderful happy family. Benjamin barker returns from exile after many years, adapts a new name and looks - Sweeney Todd; sets up a new barber shop along with a weirdo baker Mrs.Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter). There is a sub-plot in where a young boy Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower) falls in love with the Benjamin's daughter Johanna (Jayne Wisener) who is adopted by Judge Turpin. Sweeney Todd starts his gory revenge saga by cutting the throats of all the culprits involved in destroying his life and family. There is a tragic end to the tale  which I won't disclose here, to keep the spoilers away.The attempt by director Tim Burton is excellent. He presents the Broadway hit on screen in musical  a dark, bloodied and gory revenge saga is really an attempt. I read that this project idea was cooking since last 25 years with great actors in mind to play the lead. Luckily Johnny Depp got the onus.Johnny Depp acts brilliantly as the demon barber and it is difficult to imagine anybody else could have played the character with much more better conviction that Johnny Depp. He is outstanding in each scene. The other acting that stands out is again the mean portrayal of corrupt judge by Alan Rickman. He has matured into a seasoned medieval evil and looks convincing.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is intentionally dark and with blue tinge. It creates the atmosphere of loathe and disgust and letting the minds live in those dark ages. Especially the beginning 15 minutes  is intentionally darker in contrast, then the rest.Stephen Sondheim provides the original musical score of Broadway. It is excellent.For those with  weak stomach for blood and gory; and with weak likings of musicals  this is not their cup of tea.Overall, this is a good attempt to capture and present the world of cinema  something different, a dark, bloody musical!

Tim at his best,"I am an avid Tim Burton fan, Johnny Depp fan, and Sondheim fan. I could not have asked for a better combination of the three. I am usually not a huge supporter of movie musicals, but the overall tone of Sweeney Todd is theatrical enough to support people bursting into song. Tim's production design goes with the story - it is dark and creepy, but still, as I stated before, theatrical enough so that the bright red blood seems okay. Tobias is played by a young boy, which is new, but it works quite well, especially at the end. And who would have thought that Johnny Depp could sing that well? He really shines - Sondheim was right to approve him. Helena Bonham Carter is also singing for the first time, and she does quite well, although her voice is not terribly strong. I loved her character, though, and hope she gets recognized for it. However. this is not the movie to take your kids to. There are some really truly scary moments - the end is truly chilling. The old beggar woman really creeps me out. It is darkly funny, but not in a way that is appropriate for people under the age of 17. It is rightly rated R. Tim, you have done incredibly well. Its just the movie musical I needed.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very bloody and very entertaining,"Sweeney Todd is not for the faint of heart, with many waterfalls of blood gushing from many characters across the length of the film. This is Tim Burton and Johnny Depp at their most unrestrained, mixing gothic horror with lackadaisical black humour. Following the eponymous Sweeney Todd as he gets his revenge against a corrupt judge, the ever-present Helena Bonham Carter joins him as the equally corrupt pie baker, and all actors bring the perfect balance of being sympathetic and deranged. With a cast of delightful and memorable figures, the depravities of this film leaves the audience on the edge of their seats as they never know who is next to have their plots revealed or their throats cut. The production design of this film is immaculate, giving a grimy and dark undertone to the escapades of the ""demon barber"" and bringing Victorian London to life in all its horrors. Although the film's origins as a musical is inescapable, the songs often slow down the plot and trap the characters in a perpetual sing-songy conversational tone, to the detriment of the whole film's impact.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Doesn't work.,"It doesn't work! Hollywood films of stage musicals, in general, don't work.The film is well done, as a film. But it is so devoid of what the original show was full of.Carter is a good actress, but really not good here. I don't suppose one could portray the wonderful Music Hall quality of the character in a film of 2008, though.Burton should have known better.A disappointment, I'm afraid.For heavens sake, why didn't they include the ""Ballad"" in the end titles?

My first 10,"This is the first time I've given a film a ten; it wasn't just an excellent dark, witty and well produced film, it had great depth of character and every participant felt like they'd put 110% into the production. Every song, facial expression and movement we're carried out beautifully and it just proved Tim Burton's place in the hall of fame of the world's best directors. Unfortunately this film isn't to everyone's taste but if you like dark, nightmarish, musical extravaganzas, they please, please watch this film.

The most grim musical you'll ever see as a movie.,"The gritty part of London in the 19th century. Lived a deranged barber named Sweeney Todd who was double crossed by a Judge many years ago. Sweeney now awaits to seek revenge on that Judge for ruining his life forever and for transforming his personality from a gentleman to a mad man with a razor.I've expected this movie to be unique in many ways. It's a musical so 3/4's of it has singing in it. It's directed by Tim Burton who has a brilliant mind for making goth theme movies. Also contains a cast of well known actors. Johnny Depp and Helena Boham Carter who both worked with Tim before did an amazing job together. Also two actors from Harry Potter, Timothy Spall & Alan Rickman make an appearance in this film.The idea of this musical was never made into a feature film until now. I never heard of it before, but it is something only Burton would direct. Despite the theme of story being very dark and grim, the movie does have a few good moments to it.Not saying it's bad, because I've seen Burton's other movies that surpass this one. If I have to use a word to describe it, it's Burton's most unique directed film. It is worthy of having a place in any Burton fan list.Please be advise that this movie is almost as gory as Sleepy Hollow(which is a great movie). And the second R rated movie Burton has directed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"May I have your attention, puh-lease!...Sweeney Todd","Stephen Sondheim's musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is not your run-of-the-mill Broadway spectacle. This thing is dark, gory, and bleak to the end with little in the way of joy and hope seeping through. I had seen the staged production featuring George Hearn and Angela Lansbury a couple years back, so I was familiar with the story before sitting down to experience Tim Burton's vision. I guess by knowing Sondheim's other musical Into the Woods, he is accustomed to darker, off-kilter works, however, this one is way out there. A story that involves a falsely imprisoned barber returning to London in order to seek revenge on the judge that put him there, and subsequently stole his wife and daughter, by slitting throats and hiding the bodies in the city's best meat pies is not winning any feel-good awards. More a cult phenomenon than a huge Broadway success, I think it may find a new audience in theatres, if for nothing else but the inclusion of Johnny Depp. He alone will draw some viewers in, especially those that the trailer fooled into thinking it isn't wall-to-wall singing. Oh, and so I don't mislead you, when I say musical and non-stop singing, don't think you'll be toe-tapping on the way home. These songs won't be sticking in your head.Aesthetically, Burton has knocked this one out of the park. The muted grays really help the bright red blood pop off the screen as well as make the ""fantasy"" dream sequence even funnier than it is by itself, allowing it to have such vibrant colors. This is London at its dingiest, grime-filled in every shot. Cinematically, all the framing is unique and never boring, especially in scenes where our two leads share a duet and we see them in fore and background, even through reflections on the straightedge razor. As for the bloodbesides the hokey, watered-down red streams coming from bare necksit is handled well. It's more realistic once the initial spurts are concludedturning into thick ooze on the floorbut I guess the fakeness helps add a little necessary humor to the otherwise depressing tale.This film is by all accounts a Tim Burton enterprise. From the look and feel to the casting of his wife and Depp, this is a much-anticipated return to his earlier films for me. After his recent string of horrible remakes in Planet of the Apes and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I was almost ready to write him off. If not for the wonderful Big Fish in the middle of those, I might have been really apprehensive in going to see this, especially since it is pretty much a remake itself. Thankfully, besides it dragging a bit in the middle, (the play does too, though, so I don't fault Burton), and the storyline with Anthony and Joanna being so thin and almost thrown in haphazardly, the movie really surprised me with its humor and unabashed use of violence. I would have been very disappointed if he toned it down rather than amped it up as he does.All the acting is surprisingly great too. Depp is fantastic and subtle in his portrayal of Benjamin Barker turned Sweeney Todd, hiding the pent-up aggression as best he can before finally needing at outlet of murder. He could have gone over-the-top with it, as he unfortunately did in Charlie, but instead reined it in and probably came off funnier as a result, specifically with the facial expressions in the fantasy scene and throughout. While I don't think he could have done the play on stage, I still think vocally he did a superb job. The rasp and the deep baritone fit perfectly and his depressed state adds to the tragic end soon to come. Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, and Timothy Spall are all good in their roles, nothing special, but totally fitting the aestheticif anything Carter and Spall may be a bit too creepy. The real supporting standouts, though, are young Ed Sanders as Toby and the hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Petrelli, a rival barber. Cohen is a master of priceless voices and adds a nice layer to the proceedings.Sweeney Todd is not a perfect film and definitely not one for the masses, but as far as a cult musical with gore, it does the job. If anything, I hope this means good things for Burton's cinematic future. He is at his best with dark tales like Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and Batman and should stay away from the remake machine. Always gorgeous to watch, this one has some substance to it as well. A perfect ending definitely helps make up for the missteps along the journey too.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
pleasantly surprised,"Despite the grim color setting and story line, it's an enjoyable film for those who possess a dark humour. i found that it took a while to get to the good parts but as ms lovett says, all good things happen to those who wait and it was the ending that took the prize with me.i must admit the singing wasn't terrific, to be honest it gave me a headache at times but jonny depp has some great moments where I was like ''Whoah, that was a nice note''the demon barber on fleet street might not be your typical watch, it sure wasn't mine, but if you give it a chance you just might be as pleasantly surprised as I was, i know I sure will be looking into films akin to this one. yes, that's how much I liked it, and I'm not even that much of a movie person",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
If they Academy does not give Depp the Oscar it will be a crying shame,"I was enthralled from the opening credits and the marvellous music. I did not know the story well and just sat back and enjoyed it. Burton has produced a masterpiece and yet the film is not nominated for any awards except best actor (and yet again Depp will be ignored?) what does this amazing actor have to do to win an Oscar. People say they don't matter, well they do when you are as talented as Johnny Depp; without doubt this is the best piece of work that he and Burton have ever done.The bright colour scenes of Mrs Lubbock's dream are reminiscent of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, in the way that Burton used bled colour to make it too bright in stark contrast to the Gothic, dimly lit London. The scene of the pie shop where she sings that her pies are so awful is art directed to perfection, showing the filth and vileness of her disgusting shop. You feel your stomach churning at the sight of the cockroaches as she sings and beats the pastry. The cast is superb nobody wrong for the role. How audience will receive this film is hard to say but if you like Burton's work you will adore this. I cannot wait to get it on DVD later this year to watch it again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Tale is in safe hands at last!,"We all know the tale. When a barber loses his wife and daughter to a amoral judge and is sentenced for 15 years, returns and beings a new life only built for revenge, he is Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street. The cast is pretty alright for a musical. Most doubt Depp but he does come in strong. He sure acts beyond his limit and he CAN sing! Can he sing good? YES! Carter has proved herself in both departments so she is very well fit. Rickman has done the same and Cohen shows of his amazing singing talents. The script by Logan is very well done with most of SS's music still intact. Although there is a fair share of song cuts, the soundtrack is very solid. Burton does bring justice to this film. Not that it needed it but he adds the covering to it which turns Todd into a greatly acted and visually grand film. The blood is also done right, it is never over used and stops when it should. The cast work very well together and the stages and suits are very well done. The film never drags and gives you enough to make itself the best film of the year and one of the best films of all time!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street"" Promises you the closest shave you've ever had, and means it.","Okay I can't say enough on how brilliant of a movie this was if there ever was an adaption of a musical of this play this would be it. The acting is brilliant the set pieces and costuming and make up are fantastic and who the hell knew Hans Grueber a.k.a Alan Rickman could sing. On top of that it's one hell of a gory time. I think for a movie to succeed it needs great writing, and John Logan who wrote the screenplay did a fantastic job converting it over from Stephen Sondheim's play. Some of the best play moments are in here including Sacha Barren Cohens turn as Perrelli the french barbists who hides a secret until he learns that a shave can be a little to close for comfort.Kudos to Johnny Depp and Helen Boham Carter for portraying such devilish characters, and praise Alan Rickman and Timonthy Sprall who give a new word to evilness. Two favorite moments Alan Rickman and Johnny Depps duet, and Helen Boaham Carter and Johnny Depps dream like number on the beach were Mrs. Lovett wishes to be together forever with Todd.

He feels pretty and witty and insane...,"A story involving revenge, 19th Century London (wonderfully reconstructed by Italian production designer Dante Ferretti), madness, cannibalism and repeated throat-cutting - is it any wonder Gothic maestro Tim Burton fell in love with Stephen Sondheim's politically incorrect musical right off the bat? In fact, who else but the visionary who gave us Batman and Sleepy Hollow could have done this gory tale justice? That said, is Sweeney Todd Burton's best film? Not quite. And it isn't his greatest collaboration with Johnny Depp either: both titles are still shared by the combined magic of Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. It does, however, rank a close second on either list: such is the visual, aural and emotional power of the tragic, violent love-story-cum-horror-movie.The mood of the picture is elegantly set in the opening credits, made in typical Burton fashion: company logos (Dreamworks and Warner) set to dramatic music (no Danny Elfman, though: all the tunes heard in the movie are Sondheim's creation) and the camera following a productive process inside a building. Imagine Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with added blood, and there's the intro, followed by Todd's (Johnny Depp) return to London after 15 years of incarceration. Not that he's very happy to be back: he calls the city ""a big black pit filled with people who are filled with sh*t"", a description that is hard to dismiss, given the bleak weather and bleaker houses. One of the latter used to contain Sweeney's barbershop, but is now the home of Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who earns her living by making ""The Worst Meat Pies in London"". She recognizes Todd as Benjamin Barker, a successful barber who was imprisoned so that the sleazy Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) could freely seduce his wife and raise his daughter. Now, with the missus dead and the girl in Turpin's grasp, the grief-stricken man has only one thing on his mind: revenge, even if that means murdering innocent people along the road. From that simple idea stems a sinister plan, one that will appease Todd's lust for blood and improve his accomplice's business.Given the director's previous trips in musical areas (The Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride), one might expect a similar lightness of touch in Sweeney Todd. Nothing further from the truth: if there's one thing that makes Burton a genius, it's his ability to understand what works and what doesn't in a specific kind of movie. Back in 1989, he justified his take on the Dark Knight by saying: ""If you want to do it bright and light you either do Superman or Cotton Candy Man, you don't do Batman!"". His vision of the Demon Barber is backed by the same frankness: ""I had seen several stage productions where they toned down the blood, but you can't be politically correct with this: it's a story about a serial killer and they cook people in pies."". And there is no correctness in the feature: gallows humor of the blackest kind, implications of rape and child abuse, and gallons of blood - whereas Sleepy Hollow's decapitations were frequent but anemic, Sweeney Todd's succession of deaths doesn't hold back the red bodily fluid.Of course, with such a subject, chances are viewers might fail to root for the twisted characters. Burton solves the problem thanks to the songs: in most musicals, they are merely a distraction from the plot; this time, they are integral to the story's human core, as they are used by the cast to convey a complex range of emotions that are hard to express with normal words. Every single actor (including Sacha Baron Cohen as an Italian barber) masters Sondheim's lyrics with unusual grace (then again, the author had the final word on the director's casting choices), and they all use the music to transcend the two-dimensional prison their characters would otherwise be locked up in. Rickman, in particular, gives Turpin an additional majestic feel besides the sheer menace he has carried around since Die Hard, while Bonham Carter proves she wasn't chosen because she is Burton's sweetheart: there's real passion and suffering beneath Mrs. Lovett's insanity, as a beautiful dream sequence (the only moment in the whole film to contain sunlight) testifies. But it is Depp who, as expected, delivers the most impressive performance, for which he won his first Golden Globe and received his third Academy Award nomination: ""barking mad"", as his partner describes him, while he sings ""My Friends"" (referred to the razors) and painfully tender in his rendition of ""Johanna"" (a song concerning Todd's daughter), he paints a layered, immensely compelling portrait of a man wronged for no reason and driven mad by loss. In addition, fans will probably love the Scissorhands joke (""At last, my arm is complete again!"").Sure, some people might find the concept disgusting. Some will be turned off by the blood-letting. But by finding the humanity of the characters and using the musical numbers to tell the gory story of Sweeney Todd, Burton has made a spellbinding film that will, in due time, be considered a classic of the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tim Burton's Almost Flawless Masterpiece,"With strong and fulfilling base material, Tim Burton cuts and stitches together a highly entertaining fun horror musical that almost feels like satire. Johnny Deep is truly in his element, and even without much dialogue, his facial movements tell all. But it's Helena Bonham Carter who steals the show with an contrasting and elaborate fun performance.The set design and screenplay gives the potentially dark and murky landscape a lift in spirit with energetic pace and through touches of vibrance with torches and colour filters.The music is pleasant although not entirely memorable, and some scenes are a bit of a slog; one does have to be in a particular mood to fully enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
You know what Sweeney Todd doesn't have enough of? Blood!,"Yet another movie that teams Tim Burton and Johnny Depp together -- with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter who seems to tag along with the team as well. Sweeney Todd is the film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical about a wrongly convicted barber coming back to London with a vengeance.First off, being a musical, I had my doubts about the casting. But I was thoroughly impressed with Depp's vocal talent and range. I was less impressed with Carter's however, but she manages. Moving past their vocal limitations, the way they convey the mood of the song and exactly what they're saying is tremendous. It shows they are true actors, not just singers.My only qualm about the movie was the first half-hour. First was Depp's entrance. It was hard to get past the idea of Jack Sparrow and it sure doesn't help that he uses the same accent and his first scene is on a ship. A black, ghostly one, at that. But after a while, I hardly even noticed it. The other dragger was the non-stop songs. Within the first half-hour, there had to be maybe ten songs with at least three lines of dialogue here or there. It was quite slow. However, once it got to the contest, it picked up pace fast.Burton's directing style is superb with visuals that resonate long after the movie is over. He directs the actors perfectly in achieving a Gothic Victorian style.This would be a great movie and one I would want everyone to see if it weren't for all that blood. The first half-hour is tame. But it's all downhill from there. One song consists of throat after throat after throat after throat being slit. But what really grabbed me is that it was so much that the people around me started laughing! This movie is not for the faint of heart. When Tim Burton says I want blood, he gets blood.Other than that, a delightful, and quite a comical movie about a tragedy. And i cannot get that stupid song out of my head -- ""it's priest, have a little priest..."" It's bloody wonderful!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The perfect cast for the most part,"I think I must have annoyed everyone at the cinema when I went and saw this the first time because every time a new character came on the screen I'd giggle uncontrollably. I absolutely love Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall's always a lovely character actor and after the pirates I couldn't wait to see more of Jack... uh, I mean Johnny Depp. However he seemed to me to be a bit too fresh from Pirates and his gravely vocalisations presumably designed to hide his natural accent came off as almost piratical. The young couple were irritating and ultimately forgettable, as they are in the original, usually (I have yet to see even a stage production where I feel anything other than contempt for they young lovers), but generally the performances were lovely.Still, I'd recommend seeing a stage version of Sweeney Todd. If done correctly it can be entirely enchanting and bewitching, even more so than the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Another hit from Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, this time a slasher musical!","By the time this very dark musical came to the silver screen in 2007, I had seen most of the previous Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaborations, and had seen their last one before this, 2005's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", in the theatre, but that didn't happen with this one. I first watched this film on DVD two years ago this month, unfamiliar with the play it's based on, and I thought it was pretty good, but had trouble really getting into it, which was too often the case for me with movies around that time. I wrote a review of it soon after seeing it for the first time, giving it a 7/10, but recently deleted that review, confident that a second viewing would be better, and I was right. After seeing it twice, both times on a rented DVD copy, I can rate it no lower than 8/10.A man once known as Benjamin Barker returns to London in Victorian-era England after fifteen years of exile and hard labour for a crime he didn't commit. Now under the new identity of Sweeney Todd, he is obviously very bitter upon his return, and does not think much of the town! He soon enters a pie shop on Fleet Street, run by Mrs. Lovett, who tells him about the vacant room upstairs, which happens to be his old apartment! Mrs. Lovett also tells him that his wife is dead and his daughter is being held captive by the evil Judge Turpin, the man who sent him away! Sweeney opens a barber shop above Mrs. Lovett's pie shop, where he plans his revenge on Judge Turpin by luring him in and cutting his throat! He nearly succeeds, but not quite, and after this, the barber plans his revenge on the town by luring many customers into his shop and cutting their throats, hoping to get another chance to do it to Judge Turpin!Since this is a Tim Burton project, it's no surprise that the visuals are dark and very pleasing to the eye, which is one of the things that make this film so good and memorable. There are also many outstanding performances, once again with Johnny Depp as the protagonist, plus another talented Burton recast, Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett, and other talented actors such as Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin, controversial prankster Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli (a mean-spirited barber who abuses his child assistant, Tobias), and several others. Unlike most of Burton's movies, this is a musical, but the talented cast members generally have decent voices, even if they weren't known to sing in films before this. Some of the songs could have been better written, such as ""Poor Thing"", and ""My Friends"" (Sweeney Todd sings to his razor in this song), I didn't care much for Jayne Wisener's (Johanna, the main character's daughter) high-pitched singing voice, and I found that there was a little too much singing at times, but for the most part, the songs are very strong. There's also lots of tension throughout most of the film, and some humour, such as the ""Worst Pies In London"" part, and Pirelli's fraudulent elixir, which Mr. Todd says is ""p&#@.""There are obviously those who strongly dislike Tim Burton's films in general, and if you're one of them, this version of ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" probably wouldn't be an exception. His dark style is not for everybody. If you're a fan of the filmmaker and like his films in which Johnny Depp plays the lead role, there's a lot of the usual here, but unlike any of the duo's previous live action movies, this one is a musical, and you may or may not like that. I also can't forget to mention the throat cutting scenes. They don't start until after a while, but there are a bunch of them, and they tend to be very graphic. This is the reason for the R rating, but even many adults would find it hard to keep their eyes on the screen during these scenes. I'm glad I was warned about these parts before seeing the film! However, for those who can handle the gore and are not expecting a happy movie, this could be something good to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Movie can be addictive!,"Pleasantly surprised by how well everyone sings, and you can hear the words! This is not an ordinary musical for sure. Bought the soundtrack and am anxiously awaiting the DVD. I think the fact that these are actors first made the movie more enjoyable. The casting director should get an Oscar, everyone fits their roles to a ""t"".Johnny Depp has yet to make a movie I didn't enjoy, and this continues. Helena Bonham Carter tends to pick scary, wild-woman parts, but I think this role could be her finest ever. And Alan Rickman always was good-looking, but now he sings, too!Tim Burton has topped all his other movies with this one. Saw it multiple times in the theater, if you missed it, better at least put it in your list from Netflix.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Back into the box,"The best thing you can say about this movie is that it doesn't try to give us a happy ending, a rare exception in big-budget Hollywood. But while ""Mars Attacks!"" was an undisputed masterpiece and ""Sleepy Hollow"" had its moments, ""Sweeney Todd"", like most other Burton pictures, lacks the wit to offset its essential triviality. For starters, I don't see why we should care about any of the lifeless characters. What the movie lacks in character development and storyline, it overdoes in production design. The blood is thicker, the night is darker, and everyone's eyes are wider than anywhere else. The pointlessly showy, physically impossible opening shot almost tops last year's CGI fest ""Beowulf"". Last not least, London is at its filthiest, dirtier yet than in the Hughes' brothers' ""From Hell"" and the Wachowskis' ""V for Vendetta"". But it's a special kind of Technicolor, candy-sweet chocolate factory filth that leaves you burping, yet strangely unsatisfied. The visual overkill, although duly rewarded with an Academy Award for art direction, makes you feel like you've had one too many of Mrs. Lovett's greasy pies. All principal actors are reprising roles they have played dozens of times before. Alan Rickman has long had his hairdressing moment when he was up against Bill Nighy in the British Hairdressing Championship (""Blow Dry""). The rest of the ""Sweeney Todd"" cast is unremarkable at best, except of course for a hilarious appearance by Sascha Baron Cohen in the part of Adolfo Pirelli, the fake Figaro.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
My favourite!!,"To me personally, a good film requires a great cast, a great thrilling or on-the-edge plot, scenes set out magnificently and overall plays out smoothly and thus leaves the audience only caring for what happens next.So what do we have here?An Amazing cast including the best-of-the-best Johnny Depp and the female equivalent Helena Bonham Carter. Its no surprise judging from the cast and the genre that this is a classic Tim Burton at his very best.An exciting thrilling plot set to keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for more, more, more!!Scenes full of detail and yet keeping to a dark, contrasting colour scheme (either lighting effects or post-production effects).A film that plays out smoothly. The songs and the scenes flow into one another so beautifully that I find it very difficult to get bored of it. The songs are so operatic and theatrical, its very talented of the cast to fit it in to a film rather than a play.One of the best films that I've ever watched and I hope to see more like this! The only complaint I have due to it only getting a 9 out of 10 is that the blood always seems so much lighter than surely it should. It almost seems orangey in scenes, and thus I can't help thinking that Tim Burton would've picked up on this during the filming.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best musical ever,"I, personally have not seen a better musical. First time I watched this movie I did not expect a musical but a horror. I was dragged into the movie quickly with the mystery of what happened to Barker. By the the halfway point of the movie I was very pleased.The movie is not as violent or gory as some make it out to be, but if you thought Lord of the Rings (my other favorite movie) was too violent then this movie surly would be. The gore is done more in an artistic way, showing Todd's mood. Without giving anything away, I must say it has to be seen rather than read about.Assuming the reader is either seeing what others think of the movie after watching the movie or seeing what others think of the movie before watching, the latter should forget that it is a musical before they watch it. Nobody likes musicals that I know of but all who have seen this movie that I know love this movie.The romance, the despair, the anger, how every second of the movie achieves more than one emotion; and not to mention the music is unlike the typical musical. This is a must see. If you scare easy this isn't horror, but if homicidal maniacs are your fear best avoid, but the character is actually a character you can connect to.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Best Films of the Year,"With an expected slightly underdeveloped storyline to keep up with the typical musical-theatrical movie guidelines, Sweeney Todd offers something more than the typical Chicago or Hairspray. The ability to capture the attention of an audience without the flashy advantages of dance numbers (Hairspray) and memorable music (Chicago) is noteworthy as Stephen Sondheim's vocally besieging score is tackled with flawless performance singing. Johnny Depp plays his expected introverted character who attempts to overcome his struggle with inner resentment. However, as the movie develops, so develops his character, bringing forth acting moments not yet seen from Depp. Helena Carter, despite the occasional under-pitched tone (which can be expected from any Sondheim score), acts the part in a way that could not be paralleled by any currently known actress. The two create a thrill ride for the audience, often times leaving a spectator at the edge of his/her seat. The sound quality was a 7/10, but the story is so simple to follow that an occasional missed word is not essential. The film emulated the creativity of Tim Burton, leaving no light un-gelled with a tinted moonlight tone, creating the perfect atmosphere for this Gothem-like town. Direction - A, Action - A+, Technical Aspects/Special Effects - A+, Storyline/Music - A+, Overall A+. 10/10. See this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Throat Slashing Extravaganza Gone Wrong,"""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is a hard film to watch and will test some audiences, maybe most audiences. I was tested during this musical, turned for the silver screen, that never felt so wrong. There were some things that were done extremely well and I can appreciate that, such as the make up, set design and costume design. Those are all worthy of the Academy Award nominations that they got and I can't complain about their wins. There was some great CGI and special effects that give the look of the film a very contrasting picture of dark, bright, beautiful, and a down right heinous look. The blood is just as black as the clothes, or the floors, or the rooms which gives ""Sweeney Todd"" a very dark feeling that was captured very well by director, Tim Burton. The feel and tone of the film are pitch perfect, but once these characters open their mouths the film quickly turns from perfect to nearly unbearable.I actually would really like to see this film adapted to a fable instead of a musical much in the mold of ""Edward Scissorhands."" That's where I think this can be an exceptional film. The music is down right awful and it made me cringe in my seat. I had to leave during parts of the music because of the words and the sounds were just so hard to listen to; it's just bad. It's a musical and the music sucks. There was one song here, in a rare bright spot for the film, where Sacha Baron Cohen sings which generated a couple laughs, especially with the look of his hair growth formula. That's where the laughs end. This isn't funny and it isn't supposed to be, but that scene may have been one of the best the film has to offer- and that isn't even that good. It's just an average scene. The best scene comes at the end of the film. The ending is what got ""Sweeney Todd"" a rating higher than a half a star in my book. I won't ruin it, but it's a strong ending that doesn't wavier from the theme and tone of the film and even though it's predictable it's still very well executed. The progression of Sweeney' thirst for vengeance takes such a severe course where he forgets what he's avenging and who he's doing it for. In his blood-lust he forgets where he came from and what he's here for. Sweeney looses himself in his hatred and grows so dark that he does something that he could not bear to do.The acting is average. Depp should not have been nominated with so many other strong performances from the year. Brad Pitt in ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" was much, much better with a similar type of character; just against a very different backdrop. Ryan Gosling was much more deserving in ""Lars and The Real Girl"" and in all reality this performance doesn't even stand in the same breath as those two. Depp just mails in another one of his makeup soaked, black eyed, yellow teethed, over the top, completely out there performance that only Johnny Depp would want to do. He's done this same performance before and basically plays another variation of ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Sleepy Hollow,"" ""Charlie in the Chocolate Factory,"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" It's a performance that I've seen before and quite frankly a performance that I've been tired of seeing a long time ago. Depp has a lot of talent and was great in ""Blow"" and even better in ""Donnie Brasco,"" but with films such as this, all those talents are wasted with ridiculous characters. His singing is mediocre, but it's not like he's got the greatest songs to sign, so I don't fault him there. Helena Bonham Carter is pretty good in this, and this is exactly in her ballpark, as well. I'm not sure why she didn't get nominated since I couldn't find much of a difference between the two lead performances, but I guess it's do to the fact that she's not a big name like Depp.In the end, the plot was good, the look was great, but the musical just doesn't work. Without the singing this is probably one of the best films of the year. This is, however, not one of the best films of the year. I'm not a musical guy in the first place, but I am open minded. ""Sweeney Todd"" struggles with getting to where it wants to go and you can see where it wants to go from a mile away. I'm watching and knowing what's going to happen, but I feel like I'm waiting and waiting and waiting for it to happen as the music breaks up any kind of rhythm or pacing the film gathers. Instead of a 2 hour film, it should have been no more than 80 minutes. It becomes tedious and tiresome. I'm squirming in my chair, waiting for something to happen while Johnny sings for 5 minutes about his razor. It becomes boring instead of interesting and captivating. The music is the worst part of the film, and once again, for a musical? I don't think that's a good thing.P.S. don't show this to anyone who doesn't know anything about it other than Johnny Depp is in it. I've seen the results. They don't last ten minutes before they're gone. I have watched this two times with six different people. The results the same. Even Johnny Depp can't save this film. Main reason? It's a lost cause to begin with and he just isn't very good giving the same old tired performance that we've been watching for 15 years. The best part may have been the look of the giant breasts full of milk. And who doesn't love that?",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Burton and Sondheim,"I absolutely love this movie in all its macabre glory. I love Sondheim's music. I love the look of the film from costumes to set design to the special effects. I love the performances. I love the story. I love how everything weaves together in a complete package. And, on top of it, while the movie seems to wallow in nihilism, it actually ends up being a rebuke of nihilism as empty and self-destructive, which is a nice bit of irony to top it all off.Benjamin Barker was a naïve young barber with an attractive and virtuous wife and a young daughter. The evil Judge Turpin coveted Lucy Barker, threw Benjamin in prison and sent to Australia, and took on Johanna, the daughter as his ward when Lucy refused his advances. Fifteen years later, Barker arrives back in London with a new, darker look and a new name, Sweeney Todd, with a single objective: revenge.If I had to boil down the central point of this story to a single word, it would be corruption. Corruption of purpose, of the law, and, most importantly, the soul. There are very few innocents in this depiction of 19th century London, and those few left are attacked mercilessly until they break or are corrupted themselves. The central figure, Sweeney Todd himself, describes his former self as an innocent before the corrupt Judge Turpin threw him in jail, the experience of which corrupted him. Todd's singular purpose of vengeance blinds him to everything else around him. He barely sees the baker Mrs. Lovett, unless she's helping him in his quest. The only people he seems to have a clear eye towards are those who can help him or those who are impeding him. Turpin and his manservant Beadle Bamford are his main focus. The carnival barker of a barber Adolfo Pirelli goes from a way to attract attention to an impediment that must be dealt with. Even his daughter, the young woman he hasn't seen she was a babe, means nothing to him. She is just another tool in getting Judge Turpin to sit in Todd's chair for a very close shave.So, our main character wallows completely in vengeance with no view of anything else, but what does it bring him and does the movie itself approve? First of all, his thirst for blood is most completely described in the number ""Try a Little Priest"" where, after being thwarted in his quest by Turpin leaving his shop, Todd commiserates with Mrs. Lovett and they both come up with a mutually beneficial solution. He can take his anger out on London and humanity by killing men left and right, and she'll have meat for her meat pies, pulling herself out of the situation of making the worst pies in London. They're both nearly giddy with the prospect of killing all types of people, no matter their station or vocation, but the very next number is of Todd slicing all of these throats and the music isn't nearly as joyful. It's actually a lament for his lost daughter where an interesting set of contrasts play out at the same time. The first is between Todd's actions and his words. He's bemoaning the loss of his little girl while killing people. The other is that it's actually a duet with Anthony, the young idealist who came off the boat with Todd who has fallen in love with Johanna after a single sighting and who is actually trolling the streets of London looking for her. What would make Todd happy at this time? The blood that spurts all over him does nothing to him, he barely feels it, but he says he yearns for this lost daughter. And yet, he never makes a single move himself to find her, free her, or reunite with her. He's so corrupted that he won't actually do anything to try and help her.The anti-Todd in the film is little Tobias, a young urchin that formerly worked for the Italian Pirelli. He's wide-eyed, naïve, and eager to help Mrs. Lovett who, after the mysterious disappearance of Pirelli, took him in and saved him from another stint in the workhouse. He's blind to the evil going on around him, but he begins to sense that something is wrong, mostly emanating from Todd, a feeling that he confides with Mrs. Lovett. The irony is, of course, that Mrs. Lovett did more to direct Todd's evil outward that Todd did himself, so Tobias is caught in a trap. The resolution of the film, where Todd bares his neck for the child he knows stands behind him, is the exact right ending for both characters. Todd, realizing how blind he had been as he holds his wife's dead body in his arms, gives up everything, and Tobias takes the razor across his former master's throat, ending and evil rein of terror.What really helps carry the movie all the way through is Steven Sondheim's music. From ""No Place Like London"" to ""Final Scene"" the music is literate, witty, and adept. It's all very good music, so to say. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter land somewhere between fine and subjects of nepotism in their renditions, but the rest are very good, mostly because most of the rest have been pulled from the actual musical world. The numbers are staged on a very small visual scale, usually a person or two in a small room and only occasionally breaking out of that paradigm (like when Todd moves around the streets unseen by anyone in ""Epiphany""). I think it helps the film that there's no dancing or large numbers, helping us focus more tightly on the characters as though the songs were just extensions of dialogue rather than excuses to show off musical skill.I do not think that Tim Burton has made a better film. The look of the film, the sound of it, the execution of every scene is damn near perfect. It's one of those movies where director and material matched up perfectly to bring out the best in both. I absolutely love this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beyond explanation,"If I could I would rate this 100 out of ten. It is such a beautiful and cleverly made piece of filmography. Having not known anything about Tim Burton prior to seeing this for the first time, I was hooked and went on the watch and adore all of his other films and artwork. This really is the the work of a true genius. I have seen the stage show and can clearly understand how different these two are but I have to be honest I prefer the film. Firstly, Sondheim's score is exquisitely brilliant, horrifying and strangely beautiful and emotive. Johnny Depp IS Sweeney Todd and it just pains me to see when other people disagree. Yes, in terms of technicality, it is questionable but that was not why he was rightfully given this role. The schizophrenic undertones to his voice and his actions are absolute perfection. His ability to commit to such moods and thoughts is outstanding. Many comments of all the actors underacting or doing nothing is, to me, just missing the point. Stage and film are so different and in stage, your character has to be so exaggerated to be able to project it to the very back of the theatre, where as in film it is much more intimate and the ability to show internal emotion is much more accessible. Helena Bonham Carter has a beautiful yet untrustworthy appearance and voice. Just small touches just make the film utter perfection.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great things -- terrible, but great","I have about a fifty-fifty success rate on Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaborations; I've loved some of them, hated some. And I don't care for Steven Sondheim as a writer of musicals, while the reviews I saw for this film when it first came out were only mediocre. I say this in order to explain why -- thanks to a Johnny Depp retrospective at the National Film Theatre in London -- I've only just seen for the first time a film that premiered for the rest of the world a couple of years ago; and why I've been blown away by it.This is a terrible story... and I mean that in its true, original sense. The only possible 'happy' ending, when all is played out, would be for all the characters to die -- death at least being an end, rather than living with what has happened -- and this is, more or less, what happens. In between comes betrayal, obsession, virtual incest (in what sort of relationship has the Judge stood to his 'ward' throughout her childhood?), warped affections, and industrial-scale murder; not to mention lashings of blood in a volume generally only deployed for comic effect. The outcome here is very far from humorous.But it is not the blood that makes the film so terrible (and had me sitting almost throughout with both hands clutched tightly together and slippery with sweat). The true horror lies in its moral and emotional underpinnings, where even parental affections are not to be trusted -- ultimately, Todd appears to value his daughter more as bait for his revenge on the Judge than as a beloved child or even an innocent to be saved, while Mrs Lovett's protective feelings towards Toby cannot trump her sense of survival. And while she may be attracted to her former neighbour, right from the start of their relationship there are moments when she is afraid of him too...The twists to the plot become evident to the audience at just about the right moment, namely slightly before the characters themselves realise; enough anticipation to create a dreadful dramatic irony. The overall effect is to deliver a massive, shell-shocking emotional kick: almost in its entirety the audience sat shattered throughout the length of the credits, only beginning to file out with lowered eyes and voices when the house lights finally came on. I'm not sure what we'd been expecting: black comedy perhaps, the sardonic glitz of ""Chicago"". This film is far closer in tone to Depp's Jack-the-Ripper vehicle, ""From Hell"" -- but it is much more effective than the latter both as a thriller and as a 'slasher' chill-maker. (At least one shot in the early scenes reminded me vividly of a corresponding momentary image in Todd Slaughter's hammed-up 1930s ""Sweeney Todd"", and the dockside locations are recognisably similar: accurate historical reproduction, or a brief homage from a cinematically-literate director to his predecessor?)On a personal level, I've been going through a long fallow period when nothing I saw, not even re-watching classic movies, could seem to wake any kind of real response: ""Sweeney Todd"" has jolted me back into belief in the power of cinema again. Like Sweeney, I may have just waded through Hell, but I'm alive at last and from that, full of joy.I still don't get on with Sondheim (as with ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"", the film version contains only one memorable song, by the standards of this lover of old musicals at least -- and it isn't the would-be traditional 'Joanna'); but frankly, you don't watch this for the soundtrack. The music is more in the nature of ambient effects. I was astonished to read that 80% of the dialogue in the film is actually sung, as I certainly wasn't conscious of this while watching.It is true, I'm afraid, as the original critics pointed out, that Helena Bonham Carter's vocal delivery isn't really up to the role: when a grown woman's singing is in danger of being overpowered by a boy soprano in their numbers together, it's a sign that something's not right. Her breathy little voice was fine for the Corpse Bride's numbers with the equally hesitant Victor, and is adequate for most of what she is asked to do here, but there are moments when the contrast is not kind to her performance -- in her final duet with Sweeney especially, some vital plot material is inaudible. Johnny Depp, on the other hand, of whom I'd seen similar criticisms, sounded fine, and both are sufficiently effective actors (and the music, to my ear, sufficiently underwhelming) to bring their characters across regardless.My real problem in this respect was with Jamie Campbell Bower in the unrewarding cardboard role of juvenile romantic interest: I actually assumed that his singing had been rather clumsily dubbed by another vocalist, so little relation did it bear to his speaking voice and so oddly detached it seemed from his lip movements. Both young lovers, alas, are little more than plot ciphers, and one feels that this part of the plot could really have been cut out of the film altogether to its improvement. The story and tragedy is that of the title character, and it is hard to care much about young Anthony.For these issues, and for some very fake blood (were they worried about sickening the audience beyond bearing?), I'll knock off a point to score this film at 9/10; this is still a rating I give to few pictures of any era, and to very few indeed from the last forty years.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Boring Cannibalism,"Another subtle gem from Tim Burton - he completely misses the point of the stage play in order to hit viewers over the head with ""I'M TIM BURTON! THIS IS SWEENEY TODD! I'M TIM BURTON!"" Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are flat out boring in the main roles, and neither understands the nuances that make Sweeney Todd and Ms. Lovett work. Sacha Baron Cohen, for all of the 5 minutes he is on screen, brightens up the movie, while Alan Rickman bogs it down with one of the worst singing performances since Ashlee Simpson's SNL snafu.This isn't London that the movie takes place in, it's Tim Burton Presents A Gray Town populated by Citizens With Poorly Affected Accents. There are zoom-cuts that happen for no reason (and never again!), strange tangents into pointless areas (the entirety of By The Sea does not work WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY BY THE SEA) and the ""symbolism?"" Haaahahahahaha! The last shot is the only worthwhile shot in the entire film, so of course Burton lingers on it far too long so that HEY! LOOK! LOOK WHAT I MADE! I'M TIM BURTON!!!!As far as the score goes, Stephen Sondheim's excellent lyrics are washed away in a sea of organs and strings that are much too loud. In fact, before the movie even started, at the Dreamworks logo, I mentioned to my friend that the music was already too loud. Sadly, it only gets louder, and drowns out the singing. For the most part (Depp, HB Carter, Alan ""I was my singing voice in mud"" Rickman) I was OK with that, but when the sorrowful strains of ""Johanna"" tell you to be sad more than what Antony is singing... ugh.Don't waste your money. If you want to talk Oscar contenders, go see No Country For Old Men or There Will Be Blood - actual films.

Dark & bloody musical,"I watched Sweeney Todd 10 years ago on the big screen & was blown away by it, now I'm reviewing it having just watched it again on DVD at home. This film is many things - Gothic horror/slasher/musical/melodrama/comedy. It certainly starts off at a fairly leisurely pace in the musical/drama/comedy vein for it's first part, but once Todd begins his bloody work the story becomes very dark indeed, with many bloody & ruthless murders. Gore fans may become impatient for the wait, but on the other hand musical lovers may find the graphic violence too much.

Tragically Beautiful...Visceral.,"Tim Burton's ""Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" encourages its viewers to lick their lips at the prospect of this work as the ideal treat, and perhaps we should. In the remaking of this story, going half way will bring nothing to the work; nothing to the world, and Burton seems to realize this, as he goes nowhere if not all the way. He not only walks up to the theoretical bell, but he rings it, unabashedly.Hailed as the bloodiest musical in the history of the stage, it now becomes the bloodiest adaptation of a musical to film in history, and it isn't a joyful gambol. This is a dark telling of deeds driven by heartbreak, filled with a desperate chaos and (pardon the awful and probably often-used pun) bloody good meat pies. But fans of the work know all this from the start, and we feel endeared that Burton keeps the story close to the source; a fact which, for those hapless members of the viewing audience who have no prior exposure to this twisted historical story, promises no happy ending for our characters.In all actuality, the audience receives a much better ending than a mere banal happiness could convey; no cavorting romps through fields of wildflowers for them! It receives the only ending possible because Burton does not attempt to rewrite history in his telling. Contributing along this twisted Memory Lane are beautiful darkling performances by Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Ed Sanders, and Alan Rickman, with the demented silhouettes of Dariusz Wolski's cinematography, and a diabolical (and slick) production style by Dante Ferretti. Each of these lovely elements comes together to allow Burton to conjure the visceral essence of a 19th century London reflected so aptly by Henry Mayhew's ""Labour and the London Poor,"" a serious influence over famous Dickensian works, which assumed the sad and often disgusting job of reporting on London's more seedy ""Cheep Side.""The heart-beat of the story itself is so strong as to lend a palpable pulse to this work. The (anti-)heroes are forged of the heartbreak of life itself; its villains are made villainous by life itself, and they all waltz to the Death March played wistfully on the flute of that same life, which has forged their very beings. The acting is so poignant that it enrolls us as subscribers to this diabolical tale. And even as we gasp and cover our mouths in shock, there is the hint of a sardonic smile at the corner of our mouths, as the dark humor does not escape its target.Burton lovingly creates this musical with a near lover's touch, with vocal performances which are intimately offered, softly whispered, lovingly delivered. These darkly delicious Sondheims are filled with despair paired with a desperate longing for a world untouched by the evils of man. They are plot-driven and carry the story, rather than interrupting it.In reality, this film works as pseudo-history. It is not meant that we should take it as fact, but that it delivers the story without resorting to tongue-in-cheek camp. This is a completely beautiful balance; delicate and even fragrant, and Burton never fails to stop to point out its beauty in an incongruous way. This is a tragedy, in which Johnny Depp delivers a near-Biblical performance. The surprise is that instead of taking Helena Bonham Carter with him, she walks along beside him on her own tragic, but capable path.All in all? I loved this work. It is darkly wonderful, and our two stars never missed a mark. This is suitable for watching on Friday/Saturday nights, but NOT by an audience any younger than 18 without fear of mandatory life-long therapy. But I love it.It rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I Wanted to Love It So Much...And I Did,"Going into this movie I really wanted to love it and went in with high expectations. As it progressed I decided to open up my mind more and felt myself immersed in it's world. By the end was stunned.The idea of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is great. Its not often that you watch a musical about a murderous barber. But what's a great idea without a plot? Fortunately, Burton knew what he was doing, and the plot was very well done. Sure, he had the help of the original Broadway musical, but either way it was done very well.The characters are all well developed. They have their distinct character traits, but they're all very quirky and interesting, which adds to their personalities a lot. They're quite amusing to watch, and it makes the movie a lot more enjoyable.The lighting is one of my favorite parts of it. It's dark and sets the tone of the movie immediately, and it carries through perfectly throughout the whole movie (save for one scene where it made sense to brighten the mood a bit).The songs are all quite well done. The singing and music is all very pleasant to listen to and adds a nice charm to the movie. Some of the story is told through song, and luckily the lyrics are pretty easy to understand, so long as you have your volume turned up enough to hear it properly (duh).Overall Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is amazing. With an incredible plot, great characters, good songs, and fantastic lighting it's hard to find anything I didn't like. It's a movie that proves that murder and humor can go hand-in-hand. Despite what I've heard, the violence isn't that bad. It's bloody sure, but it's not horrific or hard to watch or anything. but if you don't like blood then you probably shouldn't watch this movie, which is really unfortunate that you'll have to miss out. If you didn't like it then that's almost as unfortunate, because it really is a great movie.

Even Stephen Sondheim's music cannot salvage this movie.,"Sometimes you have to rely on your gut feelings when deciding whether or not to do something and fortunately that I did in 2007 when something inside me said: ""Don't see this move."" Wow, was my gut feeling right! Recently I watched this movie on DVD, which I checked out from a public library. This may be the worst musical ever produced by Hollywood. The story is grotesque, the acting stagy and the musical numbers forgettable. Making a musical about a mass murderer is stretching literary license a bit far. Stephen Sondheim'syrics are clever, but even his music cannot save the story. Johnny Depp plays a role that is completely out of character for him; he is not an opera singer and his role required an actor who could belt out tunes; Ms. Bonham Carter's performance is laughable; and Alan Rickman is about as chilling a character as Charlie Chaplin.

I decided to write this after reading another comment,"One where someone talked about Tim Burton caving into the Hollywood thing of loads of blood and gore everywhere.It immediately struck me that this person clearly had no idea of the stage musical. There HAS to be buckets of blood, that's kind of the point. It wasn't unnecessary in the same way the singing wasn't unnecessary, sure, you could have missed it out and still had the bare bones, but it just would not have been Sweeny Todd. I'm sorry this person was offended, or at least perturbed by all the blood, but it's like going to see Saving Private Ryan and complaining about the violence, or Pulp Fiction and the swearing, it's just part of it, and always has been.Anyway, criticism of an ill thought out review aside, this film is brilliant. It isn't perfect, and there are small quibbles with it, but it's very very good. I was particularly impressed with the singing of all involved, and also the quality of the acting, with Timothy Spall in particular o great form as the creepy and thoroughly unpleasant Beadle Bamford. The direction was dark and slightly brooding, which one expects from Tim Burton, and worked very well with the story.However, I think the most credit has to go to the source of the genius itself, Sondheim. The man wrote wonderful songs, not catchy, mark you, but brilliant. Dark, comedic, in a number of cases, and wonderfully fitting for the tale that many people insist is true but, alas, is not.Oh, and Sacha Baron Cohen's suit is...indescribable.To sum up, a wonderful, comedic and strictly necessary bloodbath, with wonderful songs, sung well, and surrounded by great acting.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best cinematic adaptation of any Sondheim work,"I think Burton has made some better films than this but anyone who wants to say it is his best work you won't get much argument from me. The film is a striking neo-German expressionist film that really captures the blood soaked heart of the Sondheim operetta and more broadly the culture myth of Sweeney Todd. The film is cinematic and theatrical in the ways the best musicals are. It is darkly comedic and embodies a lot of cultural anxiety of around the economic mechanization of humanity, i.e. The myth is a dark romantic reaction to industrial revolution.Depp and Carter both give very good performances. I do like their vocal work even if it is less polished than Broadway would demand. They just fit the overall tone Burton is aiming at.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A near masterpiece of musical film,"Originally, I was going to give this movie a rating of 6/10, rather than 9, but a lot of things have made me reconsider. For one, the sets and visuals in this movie are downright amazing, and showed Tim Burton for the genius of cinema that he truly is.However, I was going to give it a 6/10 for a few reasons. As an example, they removed my favorite song from the stage-play (""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd""), and the casting seems much like a 12 year old would arrange. Like Johnny Depp as Sweeney Todd; he has a dark appeal to him and a sort of sinister voice when it comes to singing, but it seems that he was cast mainly because of how big of a name he is in Hollywood. Then there's the casting of Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall of the Harry Potter franchise. Showing that the both of them were cast in the same movie shows that Tim Burton wanted the same kind of feel of Professor Snape and Peter Pettigrew. Regardless of that, Johnny Depp, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall pull off their roles much better than I had ever expected (As a matter of fact, Timothy Spall has become my favorite actor to play the role of the Beadle in the history of Sweeney Todd, and I regret he didn't have more opportunities to sing).Helena Bonham Carter didn't quite live up to expectations, though. As a singer, she's pretty good. As an actress, she's great. But a great musical actress? No, not quite. Lovett is a character of comic relief, and you simply fall in love with her as the play progresses, but you don't in the movie. I kept feeling like I had to picture Patti LuPone in her place as the movie progressed.This movie is extremely well-crafted, as only Tim Burton could do. The blood seems a bit cheap and added-in, but the mood of the film is dark and, yes, somewhat frightening if you let it sink in as you watch it.All in all, despite a few casting errors and how they cut out all the comedic wonders of ""A Little Priest"" and ""The Worst Pies in London"", there's so much in this movie that compensates for it, such as how it's the darkest adaptation of Sweeney Todd I've seen in my life, musical or not.If you're squeamish, please avoid this movie. There's gore galore.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Movie with some problems,"Even thoug Sweeney Todd may be Johnny Depp's best movie since ,Gilbert Grape', it is not a masterpiece.
The beginning is one of the worst animated credit scenes i have ever seen, just like the blood in this picture. But the story of the Demon Barber is really thrilling, you can understand the serial killer and you may even support him. As the story goes by, there is a bit of a lack in the third quarter of it but the great and statisfying finale makes up for the two negative points i mentioned before.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The critics must have seen a different movie. Surely.,"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet StreetLast week a movie opened in theaters that I had been very curious about for quite some time. It was ""Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street"", as the avid reader will already have discovered from subtle clues laid about the text so far, and the concept was really quite novel to me; a shlocky horror-comedy-musical about a barber who apparently killed his customers or something. I need not tell fellow fans of the offbeat and the shlock how much potential this has as a concept, a potential classic in fact, but I was skeptical, so I waited this long to see it, figuring that any really bad points about it would have long since been whined about by now, and that if it was a generally bad movie I would have had it disrecommended to me. I even read some reviews, which I never trusted very much, but they all seemed to hail it as a godly genius masterwork. Heck, its www.rottentomatoes.com rating was a very good 87%, six percent higher than 'I Am Legend', which I saw last week and adored, despite it's small flaws, so I decided to go see it last night.And woe is me, I'll never get those two hours and ten dollars back.From the very beginning, it's flaws are extremely obvious. The singing, which I won't even call off-tune because that would mean there was a hint of proper tune to begin with, is performed poorly, and at many parts completely drowned out by the background music ( oh wait, does it seem like that's a complaint? ). The lyrics are completely forced, have radically different syllable counts from line to line, and amazingly repetitive ( ""...and she was beautiful"" was repeated probably 40 times during the movie ). Not only is it bad, it's completely random. I like a properly executed musical very much and I've seen and listened to quite a few, so disagree if you must but don't dismiss my opinion to simple lack of education on the matter. I mean it's completely random and doesn't really serve a purpose. It isn't more expressive, it's not extravagant and large-scale, I really felt the whole way through the movie would have been far more enjoyable without it.But my problems with this movie don't stop at the audio, oh no, they spread out to the realm of video almost just as much. The outfits and places I will admit are indeed stylized, and even at points sort of cool, but it really bugged me, even for a time-piece of a very dirty, crappy period for England, that such reputable people as a judge would go see a barber who has apparently never washed his work-space, and for that matter, despite claiming to offer "" the closest shave you've ever had"" sports a five o' clock shadow. But that's excusable. You know, style and all that. What is not acceptable is the very lame look of the intro credits and that scene ( or where there two? ) where the camera flies around the city. Basically, the prior scene has 3D effects that would have been at home in a 1995 teen shlock crap fest, and the latter looks like one of those 3D puzzles you can buy. And the blood. Oh lord the blood! Aside from the fact that every death in the movie but two was by throat-slitting, which is an alright movie death but amazingly overused here, the violence was completely ridiculous. The blood honestly looked exactly like V8 and gushed like fountains, almost like in Kill Bill, except it didn't look stylized and cool. It looked cheap. And I don't care what you say, there was no style there at all.""But Seby, you'd surely say, that's all well and good, the style is total crap to you, but surely there must be substance? "" and frankly, there is. The execution is the problem. The story is pretty interesting actually. The eponymous barber gets back to London after fifteen years of forced march brought on to him because the judge who sent him away had an eye for his wife. He naturally wants revenge, and goes to his ancient barber shop where one Mrs. Lovett now has a shop that sells ""the worst pies in London"". One thing leads to another and he ends up setting up his barber shop anew upstairs of Mrs. Lovett's meat pie shop, where he establishes himself as the best barber in London ( in by far the best scene of the movie, a great barber-off against Borat himself, Sasha Baren Cohen, here in outlandish garb and hilarious fake accent. ) and, as reputation means nothing to him, he starts slitting his patrons' throats so that Mrs. Lovett, disgusting woman that she is, can use them to make far better meat pies. All the while, some young nameless ( his name was probably mentioned, but it seemed very unimportant ) fellow is trying to seduce Sweeney's daughter who now lives with the judge fellow. This part seemed very tacked on really. And I know, this seems like a good story! It truly does to me! But frankly, as it was, I can't understand how anyone enjoyed it. It wasn't whimsical enough not to be disgusting, and not serious enough to not be whimsical. And the music once again did not fit.Please, do not buy the hype. Don't pay to see this movie. Do yourself and whatever shred of artistry is left in film-making a favor.-Seby Duguay",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hilarious in a Gruesome Way,"I must say, I've been somewhat underwhelmed by most of Tim Burton's output recently. I just felt that ever since his first couple movies he became too much of a Hollywood director and that his movies spent too much time on their action and happy endings (*cough* Sleepy Hollow*).Well I have to say that this movie completely exceeded my low expectations.I'm not into musicals, but I loved this. I felt that the music was a nice touch to all of the gore and the dark humor.

At last!

I even have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the performance of Sacha Baron Cohen. I really never thought I would say that! Timothy Spall was a delight with his rat face, and the only thing that detracted from perfection was the absence of Carter's meat pies in their full glory.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The WHOLE musical shebang!,"This movie is my absolute favorite musical in all time for 3 reasons: I have a deep lying infatuation with the entirety of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter's character dept. Neither leave me disappointed and without seeing actual pictures of them outside of film, I cannot imagine what they would look like outside of costume. The many faces of Johnny Depp remind me of a Count Olaf (from Lemony Snickette's: A series of Unfortunate Events) with actual talent and intelligent adults. Tim Burton has an amazing way of mixing my 2 favorite movie genres; animation and horror/thriller. His way of combining elements and twisting something dark and cynical into something dark and whimsical, while conversely making the light and whimsical light and demented intrigues and aids in perceiving the darker/lighter side of a situation. I love musicals. I do not, however, love movies that claim to be a musical and simply have musical numbers here and there as an aside. In many ""musicals"" you can skip over the singing and still follow the entire plot of the story without a single pause. In TRUE musicals (except the dreadfully overly musical, like Les Mis') the song is the dialogue and a full conversation between the character and themselves, two characters, or the entire cast at the time. The music of Sweeney Todd plays as full dialogue that shouldn't be missed and helps to further develop the characters. For instance, how else should they show that Sweeney had completely lost it than having him fantasize and sing to many citizens of London while another person consciously watched him unravel? And the music behind the lyrics expressed each individual character to aid in the plot development...that is a true musical. The music isn't simply an accessory or some paint to tickle your fancy, but a functioning element ensuring that the machine run smoothly.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Bloody Good Musical Thriller,"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a 2007 musical slasher film directed by Tim Burton, based on the stage musical of the same name by Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler. The film stars Johnny Depp as the titular barber, who returns to London after 15 years of wrongful imprisonment, seeking revenge on the corrupt judge (Alan Rickman) who ruined his life. Along the way, he forms a sinister partnership with Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), the owner of a failing pie shop, who suggests a gruesome way of disposing of his victims.The film is a dark and twisted tale of vengeance, love, and madness, with a brilliant performance by Depp, who showcases his singing skills and his charismatic screen presence. He portrays Sweeney Todd as a complex and tragic anti-hero, who is driven by his rage and grief, but also shows glimpses of humanity and remorse. Bonham Carter is equally impressive as the cunning and manipulative Mrs. Lovett, who harbors a secret crush on Sweeney Todd, and provides some comic relief with her witty and macabre lines. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, and their duets are among the highlights of the film.The film also features a talented supporting cast, including Alan Rickman as the villainous Judge Turpin, Timothy Spall as his loyal and sleazy beadle, Sacha Baron Cohen as the flamboyant and fraudulent rival barber Pirelli, Jamie Campbell Bower as the young and naive sailor Anthony, and Jayne Wisener as the beautiful and innocent Johanna, Sweeney Todd's long-lost daughter. The film does not shy away from the gruesome and violent aspects of the story, and depicts the murders and the pies in graphic detail, creating a contrast between the horror and the humor of the situation. The film also uses a muted and gloomy color palette, which suits the Gothic and Victorian setting of the film, and creates a bleak and oppressive atmosphere.The film is a faithful adaptation of the stage musical, and retains most of the songs and the dialogue from the original source. The songs are catchy and memorable, and convey the emotions and the motivations of the characters. The film also pays homage to the musical genre, by using various cinematic techniques, such as montages, cross-cutting, and split-screens, to create a dynamic and engaging visual style. The film also adds some original elements, such as flashbacks, dream sequences, and a twist ending, which enhance the narrative and the character development.Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a masterpiece of musical cinema, and a testament to the talents of Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Stephen Sondheim. The film is a thrilling and entertaining ride, that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and make you laugh, cry, and sing along. The film is a bloody good time, and a must-watch for fans of musicals, horror, and drama.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd,"""Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd. His skin was pale and his eye was odd. He shaved the faces of gentlemen who never thereafter were heard of again. He trod a path that few had trod, Did Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.""Those are the opening lyrics to the 1979 Broadway production with Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou. The movie version, made 28 years later with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, will blow you away. The entire film is so unique and so strange that you can't help but take in the awe of it. It is the story of a troubled barber who was imprisoned after a judge took his wife away. Years later, he returns to London where there is no sign of his wife and now his daughter is locked away in the Judge's house. His goal now, is to bring in customers, primarily the Judge, and slit their throats so that his new friend, Mrs. Lovett can make them into delectable ""meat pies"". And the best part of it all is that it is a musical and all of the actors, never previously singers, have unbelievable good voices that are very enjoyable to listen to and fit the story. The majority of musical films seem to be quite upbeat and contain large amounts of dancing, but this has neither. I prefer dark musicals such as this and also ""Les Miserables"", because I think it is harder to bring those emotions out in song and this kind of musical has much more meaning to me. Every actor in this picture does an incredible job in their individual role and I don't believe that a single actor was miscast. What's more, the writer of the stage musical, Stephen Sondheim, approved which he often doesn't do with movie adaptations. Tim Burton really scores on this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Ruining a Broadway masterpiece,"Reasons this film is such a heartbreaking disappointment to those of us who consider Sondheim's musical one of the great triumphs of the Broadway stage: 1.The missing song: Can you imagine Oklahoma without ""O What a Beautiful Morning"", or ""The King and I"" without ""Shall We Dance?"" or South Pacific without ""Bali Hai""? By eliminating the Ballad of Sweeney Todd which was a riveting opening number possessing both understated energy, going from the depths of ominous repetitive rhythms to the High penetrating falsettos of the tenors was a terrible miscalculation. Replacing it with just the opening introductory vamp is pointless. I noticed in the comments that so many people who did not know the show complained about the music. The genius of Sondheim's score is that it had a combination of clever songs, heart wrenching songs, lyrical passages - and a memorable, rhythmic driving song--the Ballad of Sweeney Todd -- which appears throughout the show -- at the beginning, the ending and several key spots in between. Without it, you've robbed the audience of a memorable tune -- and you've robbed them of rhythmic drive. No wonder their are complaints about the music! It's missing a key and crucial ingredient. 2. The casting. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are terrific actors - but not in this film. Oh how we miss the over-the-top outrageousness of Angela Landsbury's Mrs. Lovett and George Hearn's manic, desperate Sweeney Todd, and the more recent inspired interpretations by performers like the powerhouse Patti Lupone. Instead we get sour, dour often understated characters filled with pure bitterness and hatred -- robbing them of their humanity. On the stage, believe it or not, we could even identify with the characters. Here we could care less about them. 3. Where's the humor? By focusing only on the dark aspects of the show, there is no fun. The few more-light hearted moments are non-existent. The attempts at movie humor (the roaches in the ""worst Pies in London "" scene, the comic turn of Pirelli's crooked Italian barber, marred in the film by his so obviously beating and abusing Toby, makes the audience just feel uncomfortable. In ""Have a little Priest"" both Depp and Carter hardly ever crack a smile - they just sing with bitter irony and almost no facial expressions. 4. Speaking about Toby, another huge miscalculation was making his character a child. In the Broadway show -- he is at the very least a teenager -- even in his 20s. With Toby now a youngster -- his story line becomes pathetic. In the original he was a perfect foil for Mrs. Lovett's and Sweeney Todd's gruesome antics. His revenge is satisfying on the stage. In the movie it is macabre. 5. The singing. Helena Bonham Carter's singing is so weak -- and has such poor diction, she sounds like a little girl without any vocal training. Johnny Depp's pop singing sound (""I will have vennnnnnnnngeance"") is such a letdown after having heard some powerful operatically trained voices singing the role. 6. The violence. In the recent version of the Broadway Show with Lupone and company playing instruments in addition to acting (creating its own wonderfully imaginative, circus- like atmosphere)-there was no blood -- just red clothes And yet, when the violent actions of Sweeney Todd were shown on stage either realistically or symbolically, they were shocking - jolting. In the movie, the buckets of blood are not shocking -- we get immune to it. So the whole impact of a musical based on such macabre material is muted.Having said all of this -- one should note that the set decoration -- the scenes of a spectacularly grimy blue-gray London covered in soot and smoke and existing in nightmares is just fine. It's just too bad that such disservice was paid to the spirit of the musical -- what was remarkable, fresh, riveting and memorable is all lost. How sad!!",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's the STORY that gets you!,"Oh Wow! When I first saw the trailers for Sweeney Todd, I had mixed feelings. I am a Depp fan, and although I have liked everything I've seen him in, I have avoided some of his movies for various reasons. I'm not necessarily a Tim Burton fan, but have enjoyed some of his work as well.This movie drew me in a different way. I felt almost as if I HAD to see it, even though I didn't want to expose myself to the blood and gore that everyone was talking about. I went to the movie with only a skeletal knowledge of the storyline.As I watched, the story and the characters really entranced me. I was surprised to look at my watch and see that 2/3 of the movie had passed with only 1 murder - and it wasn't nearly as bloody as I expected. That changed when Barker's chair became an assembly line for slit throats - with all the accompanying blood.It's a very compelling story, Depp & Carter play their roles well. And Burton does a great job using Bower (as Anthony Hope) as the perfect counterpoint to the rest of what goes on in the movie.My only complaint was a certain difficulty in understanding all of the lyrics of the songs given the dramatic music and the cockney accents used by the main characters.

Bloody Wonderful!,"First, I will get the most obvious (and redundant) sentiment out of the way: ""Sweeney Todd"" IS Tim Burton's best film since ""Ed Wood""; and, had ""Ed Wood"" never been made, ""Sweeney Todd"" would be his best filmperiod, bar none, no arguments. Sure, it's based on the long-running Stephen Sondheim musical, but this film version is Burton's own distinctive animala marriage of his trademark Gothic visuals paired with richly fleshed-out characterizations. Imagine Herschell Gordon Lewis with a budget and a proclivity for song, and you've got it.I have always appreciated Burton's eye for distorting typical American facades (the Gothic carnival of ""Batman""; the eerie pastel caricature of suburbia in ""Edward Scissorhands""; the literal Candyland of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"")the man knows how to put his own distinctive stamp on a picture. However, many of the scripts he's chosen to helm come up short in character development (usually more comfortable to present the ""outside world"" as a string of shopworn clichés), save always for a protagonist who is some sort of socially maladjusted outcast. The result has been films that are aesthetically pleasing (certainly wonderful to look at) yet emotionally hollow.Yet in the character of Sweeney Todd (played by Johnny Depp), Burton finds his greatest outcast alter-egonot only does Depp dissolve into the role, but as the film progresses, we see Burton's own socially awkward persona fade into the characterization, as well. What could have come off as nothing more than a filmed version of a popular musical instead becomes a complex character study of the motives that drive a man to madness; Todd inhabits a world so grey and dark that the upside of things is impossible to recognize (until it's too late).That being said, the setup is rather simple: in flashback, we learn that Todd was happily married to Lucy (Laura Michelle Kelly), only to have her and his child, Johanna (Jane Wisener), stolen away by the lecherous Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). Silenced and hardened by 15 years of imprisonment under a bogus charge, Todd is released and returns to London with vengeance in mind (his first song is a misanthropic screed against the city that sets the tone for the remainder of the film). He quickly comes across Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), the proprietor of a roach-infested meat pie emporium; their relationship develops into a mix of business and pleasure, as Todd's victims become the main ingredient in the pies. But never does Burton give Sweeney an exit into an easy love affair with Lovettin a great montage, she fantasizes about traveling the world with the earnings from her rejuvenated business, with a stoic, frowning Sweeney en tow.Now, I have never been a big fan of movie musicalsin many cases, I have gone out of my way to avoid them. Songs from the Disney school have always struck me as redundant re-iterations of things the audience already knows, serving as little more than fodder the kids can sing to death on the car ride home (did any parent leave ""The Lion King"" unscathed by choruses of ""Hakuna Matata""?), while big-budget studio productions have always struck me as overblown and pretentious. Something daringly controversial (""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"") or conceptually innovative (the Burton-produced ""Nightmare Before Christmas"") can more easily earn my favor, and ""Sweeney Todd"" is impressive not because you'll be humming the songs on the way out of the theater, but because the music blends so seamlessly with the spoken dialoga way of further developing character and plot that puts us in within a jubilantly macabre world. Burton knows this terrain well, and frequently hits notes of pitch-perfect black humor when we least expect it. And just as surprising is a subplot involving a vagabond boy who falls for Sweeney's now-teenaged Johanna; what at first seems like padding eventually becomes the innocent-love counterpoint to the demon barber's own path of vengeance, desolation, and lost hope.As with ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" Burton favors the streets of Britain, and makes even the aristocratic areas gleam with squalorthe whole production looks like a postmodern Hammer flick, with blood spraying in a deep-red, exaggerated manner. ""Sweeney Todd"" also retains the director's own Gothic cutie-pie fashion nods (Depp often looks like a sinister variant on Edward Scissorhands, with Bonham Carter invoking a live-action manifestation of the Corpse Bride), and the characters' appearances actually complement their color-drained lives. And the performances...well, they're the stuff of genius, simply put.""Sweeney Todd"" is not only Burton's second-best film, but one of the best of 2007.8.5 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best Comedy/Horror/Musical of the Year!,"Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is definitely for those with an acquired taste. But for those who've acquired it, it's delicious.To sum it up without spoiling, while the first few minutes of the film are slightly foreboding towards its success, it recovers splendidly and maintains captivation of the senses throughout until the slightly hodgepodge ending. But to maintain that captivation while spinning a yarn about brutally unmotivated murder and mass cannibalism in musical form is a triumph in itself.To begin, the cast is perfectly diversified. This is a very character-driven show, and the faces of the characters seem to be made specifically for the parts they play. Helena Bonham-Carter's Mrs. Lovett and Timothy Spall's Beadle are specific examples of how just by looking the part they make the audience love and hate them, respectively, just with their presence.The acting is magnificent. Nothing is held back here. Gestures and lines are delivered beautifully, and the actors really seem to understand how certain idiosyncrasies play a vital part in portraying the comedy and tragedy of the script. Ed Sanders as Toby is a completely wonderful surprise in this context.The costuming, make-up, and sets are superb. For the most part, the entire gloomy mood of the film and the inescapable essence of it are truly expressed through forms of skewed harlequin versions of black, white, and colorful leather-inspired outfits and settings, and pale, precise make-up to go along with it. This macabre tendency of Burton's is the main reason why hordes of silly, prototypical non-conformist adolescents will stream to the theatre in the first place, but it works here, and the audience will love it if they've been fond of other Burton productions. There is one particular scene which strays from this palette, but it creates the desired effect of contrasting happiness and hope for a future with the tragedy of the film.Also, the special effects are gripping. It truly is hard to believe, even with the slightly unbelievable glossy-red tint to all that blood and gore, that Mr. Depp really isn't slitting the throats of his customers. Perfectly horrifying, and beautifully rendered.The music, however, creates a slight problem for the film in the sense that there isn't enough of it, as many of the original songs of the Sondheim musical have been edited and cut for the sake of time or content. While most of the actors command adequate mastery over the notes, some songs leave a lot to be desired by the audience, and most of the lyrics are regrettably forgettable throughout.As previously mentioned, this film is not for everyone. Musicals of this nature in this day and age rarely are. But for those with a taste for the theatrical and are in the mood for something different, it is definitely a piece that is to be respected for both its qualities of escapism and literary depth, despite the certain liberties taken from the original stage script.

A Bloody Masterpiece,"This is Tim Burton's masterpiece: it is simply one of the best film adaptations of a musical ever and there is a sense that here Burton's dark vision finally cohere into something of a whole.From the onset this is marvellous: London never looked grimmer, grimier, or more gruel and gruelling. The costumes deserve an Oscar - they add significantly to the production - as does the set and lighting - a fully realised vision of a Gothic Victorian London that comes to life - there are some beautiful detailing - the vegetables in the market are grey and Gothic - and it all works to place the characters in a setting of real significance.Overall, the casting is flawless: Johnny Depp is dark, menacing, brooding, damaged, and coldly insane at both the loss of his wife, his deportation to Australia, and imbues a very real sense of revenge. He is well complemented by Helena Bonham-Carter's Mrs Lovall: a woman who really does know how to fail and obsess well; and Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin is lascivious, and evil. Timothy Spall gives a career best - I thought him even better here than Boys from the black Stuff, which is saying something - he weaves an intricate beadle, who knows his status depends on obsequious violence, and Sasha Baron Cohen is simply a turn to be enjoyed - and shows his very fine skill as giving credibility to pomposity.Yes, it's dark. Yes, it's violent - but that's its tone. The Sondheim score is amazing - never did natural speech sound so good as music - and one sees why this and Pacific Overatures, along with Sunday in the Park, reinvented the genre. True, Depp doesn't have the voice to really excel as a singer - but he brings an acting skill that I would trade much better singers for.The first hour is simply dazzling, we felt that it could have been 15-20 minutes shorter - what works on stage drags a little - but at no point does it lose its way in anyway.It is bloody, visceral, and dark - but, as we would expect from Tim Burton, it's not disgusting or repellent.Overall, it is no exaggeration to say that this is a very fine film, and an exceptional musical. With Hairspray and High School Musical is it possible we're seeing a revival? Sweeney is essential viewing, and I would not be surprised if it is a dark horse come awards time - stunning visuals, stunning acting, and stunningly sharp. Might make you want to give up shaving, or wanting pies, for a while though...Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street,"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street is based upon the stage musical of the same name by Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler. The film is set in a very poor, dirty and dark London, England where a man named Benjamin Barker is introduced to us. We find out that he once was a happy barber married to a beautiful wife and had a new baby daughter till all this was taken away from him by a corrupt judge named Judge Turpin who sentences Benjamin to jail for 15 years, so he can end up having his wife. The 15 years have passed and Benjamin is out of prison and now goes under the name Sweeney Todd. He then meets a woman named Mrs. Lovett who lets him stay in her upstairs room above her pie shop. Sweeney has plans for revenge against the judge and the town, so he starts up his barbershop business again only to lure clients in and then slit their throats. To dispose of the bodies he decides along with Mrs. Lovett to make them into meat pies and sell them. Sure enough the pies become a hit. Meanwhile, Sweeney wants his daughter back from Judge Turpin and with a young man who is in love with her they plan a way to get her back and Sweeney also plans to take on his revenge for the Judge and continue to keep the bodies piling high. All this of course is set to musical numbers which are sung by the main characters of the cast. I first found out about the stage play musical of Sweeney Todd in my high school drama class when a teacher was telling us the general plot about it and from that moment on the story intrigued me and having always had a love of musicals it was definitely a musical I wanted to see. Thankfully, I have now seen Tim Burton's adaptation of the musical for the screen and I was very impressed. The film's set, costumes and makeup all give the film the bleak and depressing look it needs while really setting the mood for the film and playing as a backdrop to the story. The story itself is full of catchy and well done songs and it is also filled with morbid humour, lots of blood, dead bodies and one of the most interesting, original and wickedly entertaining plots to come along in awhile. Morbid and dark films have also appealed to me probably because my love of the different and the strange and as I mentioned earlier I have also enjoyed musicals, so all the ingredients (no pun intended) were here for me to completely enjoy this film and I did. The film was completely unpredictable from start to finish and I had no idea in which the direction of the story was going, but by the end of the film I was very satisfied with how the film ended and played out. The original, dark and plain out genius story was further enhanced by great acting, music and a lot of style and mood created by the backdrops and Tim Burton's wonderful eye of the macabre and the visually beautiful yet disturbing imagery. The film plays out like any classic musical you can think of, only it's rare you get one this violent or gruesome. However that just added to my enjoyment of the film because the darker and more wild this film got the more my interest grew and it kept my attention for the duration of it's length. If you like horror movies and happen to not mind musicals then this will definitely be a film for you. For musical lovers who do not like horror or the macabre then you best look elsewhere, but for people who appreciate both you will have a downright good time with this film. Definitely one of the year's best.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody magnificent!,"Director Tim Burton's latest, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"" an adaptation of the hit 1979 Broadway musical by Stephen Sondheim, ranks as yet another imaginative working from the man behind the camera of ""Beetlejuice"" (1988), the first two ""Batman"" movies, ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), and ""Sleepy Hollow"" (1999). ""Sweeney Todd"" has many marvelous sights and sounds, and a production design that's Burton's best and most imaginative since ""Batman"" (1989). In Britain in the 19th century, the story concerns Benjamin Parker a.k.a. Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp, perfectly pale-faced), a barber who was once convicted on trumped-up charges and sent to prison and tortured for 15 years by the hard-nosed Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) and has now returned to avenge himself. He later involves his lowly neighbor, the baker Mrs. Lovett (Mrs. Tim Burton Helena Bonham Carter, equally pale-faced), in his bloody scheme to exact vengeance. Of course, she is no angel herself, since she is something of a loon. And later on the in the story, is in fact revealed to be something of a cannibal, serving the cooked corpses of Britain's lowliest to unsuspecting customers as a way of disposing of Todd's victims. A young boy named Toby (Ed Sanders) also takes up residence with Todd and Mrs. Lovett, and becomes an unwitting accomplice in their bloody scheme. It's safe to say that even with the plentiful musical numbers and weirdo acting styles, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" doesn't mess around. Blood flows copiously in over half a dozen graphic throat-cuttings that are surely going to put a drain on Hollywood's blood-pellet supply. Although I'm not really that big a fan of his work, leading this sure-fire cast of course is Johnny Depp, a brilliantly skilled performer who does indeed project his voice nicely and thoroughly for the audience, even though his performance does contain shades of ye old Cpt. Jack Sparrow. We've never quite seen Depp like this, as a would-be Psycho-type slasher whose thirst for revenge extends far beyond his target, and into the brutal aristocratic society that keeps working-class people like him and Mrs. Lovett in almost constant poverty. This is Burton's second most marvelous-looking film to date. His production design invokes a strong sense of the time and brings back memories of his earlier ""Batman"" movies. I could say that ""Sweeney Todd"" is better-looking than those films, but I'd be lying to myself; I'd never be able to top my love of Burton's ""Batman."" But then, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" wouldn't be so bloody magnificent, now would it?10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Revives the musical,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningBenjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) was a simple barber with a pretty wife and infant daughter, until the corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) had him unfairly locked away so he could force his wife to be with him against her will. Years later, Benjamin returns to London but with a new name- Sweeney Todd- and with one thing on his mind: revenge. He makes friends with pie shop owner Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) and, after missing his chance for revenge against Turpin, decides to take his anger and vengeance out on the ordinary inhabitants of London, slitting their throats so Mrs Lovett can use them to make meat pies.The musical has been a genre that's faded away over the years, much like the western or the murder mystery. But director Tim Burton has reunited with frequent star of his films, Johnny Depp, to make a film version of the popular stage play. And it has his unmistakable style stamped all over it. This is no Rogers and Hammerstein, everything's jolly, la la la musical from the old days, but a raw, savage, blood-splattered film that would shock fans of those types of films away. Not so much The Sound of Music as The Sound of Throat-gurgling! It's Burton's darkest film to date and he handles it very well indeed.Watching the film, you're reminded what a unique and pleasant experience the musical can be, for a type of film that isn't about much nowadays, as the frequent musical numbers do sweep you away and wrap you up in the film quite wonderfully. Even more impressive when you think that all the cast, including Depp, Carter and Rickman, all did their own singing. It's not so much their performances that roll the film along here as their singing, which is certainly more likable. The story's pretty decent, too, showing an unflinching 18th century London with corruption and moral decadence everywhere, as well as exploring how one man's endless quest for revenge warps his mind and causes him to lose his soul.The 18 certificate didn't come for nothing, and when the throat-slitting scenes come about they don't spare anything, all the blood squirting and spraying out the slit throats in a manner as gross as you could imagine. This may be too much for some faint-hearted viewers, but it could just as easily be a recommendation to others. At any rate, this is well worth checking out as a sterling re-introduction to a genre that's fallen to the sidelines pretty much altogether over the years. *****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wow! This movie's unbelievably good - and it's a musical!,"I hate musicals but this is the second I've been more than impressed by. There's one small flaw having to do with a minor surprise, but this is an unqualified masterpiece. Depp, Carter, Spall and Rickman are dead on and in full control. Even Cohen and the kid (not sure who that was) are great. This must have been something on Broadway but there's no way it was this good, not without this stellar cast. I couldn't believe the sets either. There's a great attempt to be authentic, and as far as I can tell, it all is, or at least it's quite convincing and appropriately evocative. I saw this on DVD last night and I'm quite sure it's going to prove unforgettable.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blood! Gore! Tim Burton! Johnny Depp! Musical?!!!!!,"Yes, you read right, it is a MUSICAL and don't worry, this is a positive review. I adore musicals with a passion, but when I was in New York in the year 2005 (when I hadn't quite caught the musical bug yet), I noticed that Sweeney Todd was a musical and what did I think?: BAD IDEA (even though i had not heard the music). 2 years later, I am now a musical nut, so, I went to see this with high expectations and guess what? That 15 year old version of me, i could've gave him a slap. Sweeney Todd is FANTASTIC!!!!!! The visual tone of Tim Burton is supremely evident in this film. Most of the film is done in a grey-tone. One noticeable feature is that with flashbacks or fantasies, the colour tone is extremely bright and colourful. And amongst the grey-tone, the blood spurts out bright red! Johnny Depp plays this role to perfection as a man with his mind warped towards vengeance. I consider him as the perfect anti-hero. Helena Bonham Carter is superb as Mrs. Lovett (Sweeney's partner in crime). She plays the very beautiful, yet wilted English rose that is Mrs. Lovett. Now, to the section which peaks my interest: the music. One word for Stephen Sondheim: Genius. The music is absolutely wonderful. These are the kind of songs that you start humming along to. I love that nearly every two minutes of dialogue is surrounded by songs. That is what makes a musical amazing. and for the last section, the violence. The reason why the legend of Sweeney Todd is infamous. Let's just say if you don't have a strong stomach, don't watch it. I'm not a fan of horror movies, but the fact that it is a musical, that makes up for it.So, to conclude, watch this film if you can because it is brilliant.And this goes to show that the movie-musical is not a dying breed of genre.

The Many Facets of Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD,"When it comes to a work of the musical stage it is difficult to imagine a finer one than Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET. For those who saw the original 1979 Hal Prince extravagant production starring Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou/George Hearn, and then the 2005 revival as condensed so creatively by John Doyle and re-orchestrated by Sarah Travis who placed the orchestral instruments in the hands of the 10 actors who tell the story of the strange Todd, the Tim Burton (screenplay reduction by Josh Logan) film will only enhance the pleasures of seeing SWEENEY TODD resurrected in yet another form. Each of these incarnations has its riches and together they establish Sondheim's work as a masterpiece.Johnny Depp makes a convincing Sweeney Todd, in looks and demeanor as well as in singing voice, and Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs. Lovett fits right into Tim Burton's vision of the dark, squalid and seedy London. Timothy Spall is perfect as the oily Beadle, Alan Rickman makes Judge Turpin an understandable villain, Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener are suitably infatuated young lovers, and Sacha Baron Cohen and Ed Sanders give top flight cameos as Signor Pirelli and Toby. The one advantage of seeing this fine film on DVD is the option of turning on the subtitles so as not to miss a word of Sondheim's superb lyrics.For this viewer, however, the most successful version of this 'opera' is the John Doyle production currently on the boards in Los Angeles with Judy Kaye as the most satisfying Mrs. Lovett on record. This uniquely economical and endlessly creative production goes to the core of the work better than any other version, and if this traveling company comes anywhere near your home, go see it! It is the essential SWEENEY TODD and a fine adjunct to seeing the film version again and again. Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sweeney Todd: A Big Bloody Mistake,"Fans of the Tim Burton-Johnny Depp franchise can rejoice, and as usual, leave their critical faculties at the door. Their heroes have come through, spraying the screen with ketchup, acting the gamut from A to B, yelling their way toward Oscar noms. Or not. For the rest of usaware that Sondheim's great score is also the high point of late-20th Century music theatrethe movie Sweeney Todd is a noisy, thudding, completely unsatisfying bore. Depp starts out angry and goes nowhere. The voice is thin, reedy, and often overpowered by Jonathan Tunick's aggressive orchestrations. Depp barely manages to even look at Helena Bonham-Carter, and she, as Mrs. Lovett, connects only to little Ed Sanders--who as Toby, steals every single scene he's in. In other words, the chemistry is off, off, OFF. Alan Rickman is the sexiest Judge Turpin on record, but must make due without singing the great ""mea culpa."" Anthony and Johanna are sung by pretty actors who have little to no impact whatsoever, and Burton leaves their story unresolved. I enjoyed Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli, but don't think he was right for his role either. Again, Ed Sanders as Toby was amazing, but that's not the reason we go to see Sweeney Todd. In the words of the real fright master, Bela Lugosi, ""Beware, beware, beware.""",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"In a perfect world Sweeney Todd would be remembered as Burton's masterpiece, his most amazing piece of work.","With a malicious bent a mile wide and a malevolent bounce in its manic step, Sweeney Todd is defiantly sweeping, epic, and strange, which on paper might seem right up Tim Burton's alley, but in execution something far more intimate, beautiful even.We first see Sweeney Todd (the always amazing Johnny Depp) on a ship with a young man named Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) as they make their way to London. We get a first glance of Depp's singing in this opening scene, and surprisingly hes very good. Hes got a rock solid voice, and his voice never cracks or slips. Sweeney has spent 15 long, arduous years in prison, wrongfully accused of killing his wife thanks to Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who kidnapped his only daughter and left Todd to suffer. He then meets Mrs. Lovett (the charming Helena Bonham Carter), the owner of ""worst meat pie shop in London"". Sweeney then sets in motion a plan to take revenge on Turpin.Be warned, this is a MUSICAL, so expect a lot of singing and music numbers. Honestly, its what makes the movie all the more alluring. By intersecting the musical numbers with the usual Burton flourishes, the film is something different, but wholly Burton the whole way through. Its familiar in a fresh, unique way.Whats also familiar, yet fresh, is his two stars, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, his apparent muses. This is Depp's 7th collaboration with the director, with this being Bonham's 5th. This is arguably the best for both (yes topping Edward Scissorhands and Big Fish), there's something so entrancing about this film its quite hard to place. Depp and Carter are both amazing, not only acting (which is a no brainer, of course) but in their singing as well. They belt out some great songs throughout the picture and I'm lightly tapping my toes as I type this.The movie doesn't skimp on the gore, however, and blood fetishists will have fun watching Depp slice and dice unfortunate costumers that happen into his barbershop o' death. The film is relentless and Burton never holds back, ending in such shocking darkness that is far from the fairytale like ending in Scissorhands.Beetlejuice is considered the quintessential Burton film, Batman his most mainstream, Big Fish and Edward Scissorhands his most poetic, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory his most odd, Planet of the Apes and Mars Attacks! his most self-indulgent, Ed Wood his most ambitious, and Sleepy Hollow somewhere in the middle of it all. In a perfect world Sweeney Todd would be remembered as Burton's masterpiece, his most amazing piece of work.With thrills and chills in equal measure, incredible supporting performances (including a knockout scene-stealer in Sasha Baron Cohen), great performances and singing on part of the entire cast (including a surprisingly great tenor in Alan Rickman), and surprisingly deep emotional core displayed by the passionate performances by Depp and Carter, Sweeney Todd is one of the most visually sweeping and thoroughly engrossing musical thrillers ever created. One could say its Tim Burton's best film in his long and fruitful career.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
bloody brilliant,"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is my favorite movie. And that says a lot, because I do NOT do well with blood and gore in movies! My cousin forced me to watch this movie with the promise that I would love it, and I was very reluctant, but in the end I gave in. I now own the DVD and have the entire score memorized. Thank you Sam!!! Johnny Depp. What a genius. He manages, with one baleful stare into the distance, to convey the rage, horror and unrest of a terribly wronged man. In the thirty second flashback in which his Benjamin Barker is seen, a simple, naive, yet happy husband and father is immediately established and understood. Depp's transformation into the revengeful Sweeney Todd is also complete, and his voice spills emotions as much as his razors spill blood. Depp's singing voice is quite powerful, and though he is no trained operatic by any means, his voice fits Todd perfectly.Helena Bonham-Carter's Mrs. Lovett is sheer genius, and I fail to understand why she did not get an Oscar nom for her performance. Her Mrs. Lovett is worldly-wise, practical, and yet underneath there is a romantic longing which is obvious to all but Todd. Carter delivers her lines with a perfect blend of dry humor, practicality, and sweet romanticism. One of her most powerful moments is when she has locked Toby in the bakehouse, and her eyes fill with tears as she goes to warn Todd. Carter's voice is not as powerful as Depp's, but she works within her range, and does a splendid job with several very difficult songs, including the hilarious ""Worst Pies in London"" and the dreamy ""By the Sea,"" which by the way is the single sequence in the movie set in sunshine.Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall work perfectly together. Rickman has only to raise an eyebrow and speak in the softest voice, and he is a perfect, slick incarnation of evil. Spall's sniveling Beadle Bamford is the perfect sidekick to Rickman, and their song ""Ladies in Their Sensitivities"" is one of the best songs in the score.The supporting actors - Jamie Campbell Bower, Laura Michelle Kelly, Ed Sanders, Jayne Weisner, and of course Sacha Baron Cohen - are all brilliant as well. Cohen's cameo is awesome and he lends some much needed visual comic relief, although both his Italian and English accents are almost incomprehensible. Jamie Campbell Bower's eyes simply radiate innocent love at first sight, and his Anthony sings sweetly and longingly of Johanna. Laura Michelle Kelly, a seasoned stage actress, does quite well in her dual roles as Lucy Barker and the beggar woman. Ed Sanders's acting and facial expressions can be wooden at times, but his voice is spot-on perfect for his role as Toby, and he does fantastically well with his songs. And I wish Jayne Weisner's role as Johanna could have been expanded a bit, as her voice is beautifully clear, pure and sweet, and her huge dark eyes perfectly convey her desperation to get away from her life under the thumb of Judge Turpin.Tim Burton has done a fantastic job with this movie. He keeps the camera closely zoomed in on his characters, so as not to miss a single raw emotion. His Victorian London is filthy, smoggy, picture perfect, and he lets the blood flow as freely as the music. Which brings me to Steven Sondheim's score. Oh. My. Gosh. The score is the true star of the show. While most musical numbers are icing on the cake and aren't really necessary to the plot, the entire story of Sweeney Todd is given through music. Plot lines are explained, twists are made, and final secrets are revealed in songs with perfectly intertwined music and lyrics. You cannot separate the music from the script. The music is the script.This movie is amazing. If you don't like blood, just avert your eyes, it's only in a few scenes. If you don't like Tim Burton, give him another chance. This is one of his best films, and he doesn't disappoint. Watch it!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The most unmusical musical I've ever heard,"Jesus Christ Superstar. Annie. Evita. Even 'Tommy' and surely Buffy's Once More, With Feeling. These are all musicals with lots of musicality in them. There's a melody, there are some catchy tunes, there are some dramatic heartbreaking songs.Really. To make such a musical, and all songs are so ... devoid of any melody, a catchy tune ... it's an achievement.Not so for this dragon. Literally all the melodies were forced, unmelodious, suffered from an to high word-ratio per line, and sounded like an amateurs idea what a musical should sound like. It was rather like French classical music: there's no discernible line, no thread, no nothing. It was like practice singing, see how high you can go, and how fast, and then vary it to your own liking. No flow whatsoever.Maybe it's all too highbrow for me, maybe they thought it was too easy to make an accessible tune.The graphics in the beginning were also quite horrible. Why must everything be CGI'ed? Be brave sometime and spend some money on aniamatronics or puppets, enough with these cartoons already!I suppose the acting was adequate, but I wouldn't know, I was too distracted by the awful music.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sweeney Todd... a Musical Horror that avoids being a horrific Musical,"This review was originally written for South Yorkshire Newspapers and featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds and York -Tim Burton has taken the critically acclaimed Broadway and West-end Musical, sliced it, diced it, marinated it in claret, and baked it in rich black gravy to be served at a DVD retailers near you. But how does it taste? Set at the turn of the 19th century, Sweeney Todd is a tale of vengeance. 15 years after being wrongly imprisoned and shipped off to a penal colony, Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) returns to London to take his bloody revenge on the man that sent him away, Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), and anybody else that gets in his way. He takes the alias Sweeney Todd, and reclaims his Fleet Street Barber Shop, which is conveniently located above Mrs.Lovett's Pie Kitchen. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) is so besotted by Barker/Todd that she overlooks his misdemeanours and helps to dispose of his victims by using them as pie filling.From the crimson oozing flow of the opening credits, through the arterial sprays of Todd's cut-throat razors living up to their namesake, to the shattering skulls and crumpling corpses of victims that are catapulted off the barber's chair - Burton has set out to make this his most gory of films. The splatters of viscera are further accentuated against the black and white grubbiness of the characters and scenery. Aesthetically the film is distinctly Tim Burton, Gothic and twisted; this is the director at the top of his game. Fans will no doubt clock that the barber shop bears a striking resemblance to Edward Scissorhand's attic refuge, whilst his grimy smoke-smothered vision of London is astonishing, a nightmarish fairytale imagining that recalls the best bits of his Gotham City (Batman/Batman Returns) and his London in 'From Hell', but everything is so much more beautifully realised. The level of depth and detail in every shot, the costumes, props, and scenery are all flawless, an artistic vision that is stunning from the swooping opening shot right through to its gruesome end.The same level of care and detail is applied to the pallid cast. Burton has stuck with Johnny Depp, his long term leading man, and his wife (Bonham-Carter), rather than opt for actors known for their singing credentials. In a musical where the songs are renowned for their range and complexity, this was a brave move, but one that has paid off. Depp has always served Burton well in the past, and he comes up trumps again, making Sweeney Todd truly iconic, and even doing a commendable job of the singing.If you're not a fan of musicals then the Demon Barber of Fleet Street is unlikely to win you over, but it's hardly the Sound of Music either  songs have been significantly trimmed down from the original theatrical versions, being used solely as a device to build character and relationships, and as a passionate extension of conversation. As such, the vocalists maintain their cockney accents, remaining faithful to their persona by building melody into their dialogue and even whilst hitting the high notes resist sounding like a 19th Century Lily Allen.It's testament to how dark the film is to know that the big love song of the piece revolves around Todd's beloved razors ('My Friends') rather than the relationship he forms with Mrs.Lovett. They do share a touching duet when they settle on their Pie ingredients ('A Little Priest'), a song that forms a cannibalistic list of potential victims and the way they are likely to taste. It's the only scene where Todd softens enough to look Lovett in the eye, this is a man who is utterly consumed by his blood-lust and need for revenge. You may not like the murderous retches that they play, but it's difficult not to be captivated by their performances.Thankfully the grisly content and tone is all off-set by a good level of humour throughout, Sacha Baron Cohen's (Ali-G, Borat) part as a flamboyant rival barber may be brief, but hilarious, Timothy Spall's presence as a sneering rat-faced aid to the Judge is bordering on cartoon-like, and Lovett's dream scenes of a rose-tinted future with Todd are certainly the most comical that Burton has committed to celluloid.If Sweeney Todd wasn't a musical, then the plot and characters could be criticised for their simplicity for a film of this length. However, in this format, with the aesthetics and performances to back it up, it's clear that the narrative is perfectly structured, offering more intricacies than some of Burton's previous works (Sleepy Hollow for instance), and managing plenty of surprises in a tale familiar to many. It's easy to imagine Tim Burton having to be as driven and single-minded as his incarnation of Sweeney Todd, just to get this film made  as it runs the risk of being too gory for many fans of musicals, yet the musical credentials may put off fans of horror. But that's what makes Sweeney Todd so distinctive  it manages to pull off a Musical Horror Movie but avoids becoming a horrific musical. Above all, if you're a fan of Burton's work, or Depp's for that matter, then there's plenty for you to get your teeth into here. Bon Appetit!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Tim Burton does Classical Greek Tragedy Musical,"This is the very good film and musical. But it is very bloody (and NOT a family film - It is ""R"" for a good reason. Keep the kids at home with a sitter for this film). If I had to see this film again, I would probably do so. The noir quality of Tim Burton's film is similar to elements from other movies he has directed.I am convinced that Johnny Depp can truly do anything after seeing him in this role. The tone of his singing voice is excellent, as were the other performers.

Surprisingly good,"As a huge Tim Burton fan, when i heard he was creating a film about Sweeney Todd (i hadn't heard of the stage musical), i became extremely excited. Hearing about Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter made me desperate to see the film. Then i heard it was almost entirely singing and i was, well, sure that it would be quite painful. As i am 15 i couldn't see the film in cinemas but when it was released on DVD, my parents bought it, and then i watched it.And it was brilliant. At first i found the singing, well awkward, but once you start appreciating the film for what it is, it's incredible. In particular Johnny Depp & Helena Bonham Carters performances allowed you to sympathise completely with their characters.Overall a fantastic film, if you're in to musicals and dark films anyway, with a unexpected twist at the end.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Burton and Depp's best work together,"this movie was definitely in my top five for the year. it seemed like everything that needed to be done to make this a good film was done. i didn't not like a single moment in this entire movie I'm a huge Tim Burton fan. if i had to choose a favorite director it would have to be him and i would have to say that this is my favorite film that he has done. his ideas are brilliant and he truly has made a masterpiece out of this film.Of course, when people like Tim Burton, the same people generally like Johny depp, and he did an excellent job in this movie. Sweeney Todd was not his best role to show off how good of an actor he is, but he played it perfectly. there just isn't enough emotion in the character itself to turn it into an actor's best role. i thought that depp did as good of a job as he could though to make it perfect.Helena barnham carter also was fantastic. i thought that she should definitely be in the running for supporting actress. her character, Mrs. lovett, was a lot more complex than anyone else in the story and i think that she really stepped up to the plate to make this one of her best roles.the story overall was incredible. a musical about a murderous barber who's girlfriend uses the body's to make pie?! and somehow it works. this movie is definitely not for the squeamish. i loved the violence. there was more blood in one murder scene than in most movies all together. the thing that really made me love this movie though was the music. i don't like musicals. plain and simple, but this is for sure an exception. the singing was very good all around, but the orchestra was incredible. the music was used so well throughout the different scenes i was in awe.if you miss out on this movie i really feel bad for you. see it on the big screen wile you still can. worth every penny.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dark and different - Burton's Brilliance,"Benjamin Barker, Sweeney Todd (Depp) returns to London to get revenge on Judge Turpin (Rickman) who sent him to prison and stole his wife.Tim Burton brings his dark imagination to vivid life once again in this deeply disturbing and brutal musical horror, and is his darkest film to date.With an opening shot of raw red blood dropping through machines during the credits, the tone for the film is set and Burton instantly dives deep into the darkness of London, with stunning imagery for the City, and a particularly excellent shot of the London Bridge, helps achieve the ultimate chill factor as Sweeney Todd enters.Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean) shows once again why he's the hottest actor around by giving an astounding Oscar nominated performance as barber Sweeney Todd. In his first singing role, Depp creates the right feel for the character, emotionally scared but vengeful to, and this is portrayed through an excellent choice of songs.Bonham Carter (Fight Club) gives a good performance as Mrs Lovett and her songs give an upbeat mood to the dark tale, though the humour is slightly off putting.Every actor sang their own songs and all were singing for their first time on screen, and all perform well and in particular Depp who arguably has the hardest and most songs to perform, but all are done so well. The songs are repeated which is slightly disappointing but nevertheless there isn't one bad song and each reflects what a dark narrative it is.Based on the Broadway musical, Sweeney Todd tells a harrowing and disturbing tale of the barber who cuts people up and makes pies out of their bodies, and this alone is enough to chill you to the bone as we see the madness and the darkness of a man.The graphic design behind the chair and the settings in general achieve the darkness and emphasise the moody atmosphere of the plot, and are brilliantly directed by Burton who uses a variety of techniques to get the true cutting edge, literally.Sweeney Todd isn't for the fainthearted as it is truly graphic and very bloody and the ideology of killing in that particular manner is very tense. This is a true horror, expertly (if somewhat bizarrely) directed in usual scrumptious and diverse fashion by Tim Burton, and acted exceptionally well by Depp with a great support cast, make the most graphic and horrific film of 2007, which is an essential watch, there is nothing out there like it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sweeney Todd- Well Worth the Cut ***1/2,"I shall have vengeance sings Sweeney. (Johnny Depp) He certainly tears into this role with a vengeance.How well he sings the music of Stephen Sondheim. The guy is an absolute natural and is equally matched by Helena Bonham Carter's terrific interpretation of Mrs. Lovett.This film reminds me of the 1968 Oscar winner ""Oliver!"" due to the sets and how it brings out differentiation among the social classes of early England.The film also reminds us that revenge doesn't necessarily pay at all. What goes around comes around is so appropriately depicted here.The cast is just smashing with Alan Rickman and Sasha Baron Cohen giving excellent support in their respective roles.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Expected much, got more","Who else could play the roles that Depp has? The true actor--the chameleon--is so rare. Depp, Oldman, Norton...few others. People think ""actor"" equals the much-attended-to Clooney, Damon, Pitt, but what is their range, really? Could they become the Libertine one minute and Wonka the chocolatier the next? Never.This was wonderful. Despite the warnings of excessive gore, I honestly didn't find that distraction in abundance. Yes, many people bit it, but those in mid-reverie, so to speak, didn't have time to bleed before they were slalomed off to the basement.Normally, I don't seek out violence, but this wasn't gratuitous. It showed the decline of a good man into indifferent amorality, the meanwhile entertaining us with some humor, some pathos, and some darn good singing.I loved the atmosphere because it was completely appropriate, here. Occasionally, I think Burton's a bit too dark (does he know what a comb looks like? Do any of his characters? Just asking...). Loved the way the sea of folk passed around Sweeney as he sang and then the scene returned to the loft.Having not seen the play nor knowing much about it save the rudiments, I was totally taken aback by the ending.Amazing work from everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tim Burton hits the mark again with this dark musical.,"Well of course it was going to be a masterpiece! What else would you expect from a Burton, Depp, Carter collaboration?Add a splash of Alan Rickman, Sacha Baron Cohen and Timothy Spall and you have a recipe for something amazing.The thrilling musical tell the dark story of Sweeney Todd the demon barber. Anybody familiar with this gruesome tale will be aware of what lies ahead. If you don't know, expect blood.. and lots of it!Now, on to the star of the show. Johnny Depp never fails to perform. His acting skills are amazing and this time we get to hear his outstanding singing voice.I love this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Only Burton...,"Only Buron could achieve tasteful gore. A sophisticated musical horror. It has a completely unique feel to it that's almost impossible to describe. It's like an improved, refined Sleepy Hollow, but a musical.I love musicals and I love Tim Burton films so this was perfect for me. The music was amazing, i have the CD and i can never stop listening to it. All the performances were incredible despite the fact none of them really came from trained singers which meant you got a great acting performance.My grandmother can shudder all she likes and use that awful phrase 'it's not my cup of tea' but that just makes it all the better because her cup of tea is always romantic comedies starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant (they might be good at smiling but you can hardly call them versatile) and none of them can really be half as captivating as a Tim Burton Musical.I loved it.IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE FILM BUT YOU HAVE SEEN IT, READ THIS IT APPLIES TO YOU:Since writing the first half i have read a few reviews from people who hated it and god it made me angry! Can't people cope with a bit of surrealism these days. I thought the whole point of films is they aren't real. Who wants to watch real life? It's boring!the blood does look fake, no-one could bleed like that but that's whats so great about it! The rest of the film had to look desaturated in order to make the blood stand out. It's not just horror it's verging on art!What happened to allowing for artistic license? Really people, i'm ashamed of you.In real life people don't randomly burst out into song! I thought the whole point of films and books is it's fiction! And it's fun to pretend!It's not just a gore-fest, it's sophisticated gore, if there is such a thing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrible Film - Sickening - Slow moving.,"I felt like walking out after a few minutes of this film, - I told my girlfriend that if she wanted to leave, I would be happy to go.Had I paid to see this I would have been very disappointed.Firstly there was too much singing. none of which was very stimulating.Secondly the blood and gore was the worst I have seen, lots of throats cut and blood gushing out (mainly innocent people), very sickening, but would appeal to the criminally insane - whoever had the idea of putting that in the film needs psychiatric help.The general feeling of this film was depression and negativity, with a few only slightly humorous moments.The talent of the stars, who I thought were well cast and played their parts well was wasted in this film.This is the first time I have posted negative comments about a film.John",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tim Burton takes on a Broadway masterpiece,"Tim Burton is one of my favorite movie directors, Stephen Sondheim is my favorite Broadway composer/lyricist, while Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are among my favorite actors. So you can imagine how eagerly i was awaiting to enjoy this version of Sweeney Todd, the Broadway masterpiece, on the big screen. Well, was it up to my expectations? The first time i saw this movie, i was expecting too much because i was already so familiar with the stage version. However, the second time i saw it, i appreciated it a lot more. I had another chance to examine the movie's strengths, which there are indeed. The look is classically graphic, while the orchestrations involve Paul Gemignani and Jonathan Tunick - two experts on works by Sondheim. Yes, some numbers were unnecessarily cut off or shortened, including No Place Like London and Ah Miss!, both of which would have nicely added a softer, more humanistic, touch to the otherwise relentlessly gloomy proceedings. The By the Sea number was also sadly shortened and poorly edited. Although A Little Priest was not my favorite number of the musical, it was the best presented in the movie despite it also having been shortened. The acting is overall really superb, even if Helena Bonham Carter was a little too subdued as Mrs Lovett, although that makes you really feel for her character. But then, Mrs Lovett is supposed to be vile, and unlike Angela Lansbury's stage incarnation who spits her words out while chirpily enjoying manipulating Sweeney Todd, here Bonham Carter tries to sing melodically and as a result, she deprives the character of the oomph befitting a lead role. Nevertheless, she is still deliciously good, while Johnny Depp is amazing. The film is superbly edited too. And the way the blood in the movie spurts and gushes out is really reminiscent of the horror movies of old, which Burton and Depp supposedly love.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Depp is a 'cut' above the rest ....,"From the very beginning of this film you are drawn inexorably into a world of shadows, of hate, of revenge and injustice. The photography is appropriately dark and menacing (Gotham City is, by comparison, positively cheery!) The two principal characters are taken by Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Both are excellent, although arguably a little too young for their roles. Alan Rickman, glorious to watch as ever, is the evil Judge Turpin. Perhaps the real surprise for many is that they all sing  well, too! Depp plays the title role of a brooding, introverted and embittered man who, being cheated initially of the revenge he seeks on one man (Turpin) is more than willing to hit out at the entire world, with the connivance of Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter). Depp accentuates the quiet introvert bit so his outbursts of rage are all the more effective, when they come. The rest of the cast are admirable. 14 year old Ed Sanders takes the role of Toby. Perhaps younger than usually cast in this role (he has three important numbers to sing, including the hit 'Not while I'm around') - he's just perfect for the part. Timothy Spall once more plays a grimy, unpleasant character (The Beadle is very unpleasant!) to great effect. Sacha Baron Cohen, perhaps best known for his 'Borat' character, is fine as the fake Italian hairdresser, who tries to blackmail Todd, thereby becoming the first to receive 'a very close shave'! Whilst in no way displacing the two televised versions (on DVD) of the stage musical (one from 1982 with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn, the other a concert performance in 2001, with Patti Lupone and George Hearn) this is a magnificent movie. Sondheim's score is somewhat abbreviated (the opening chorus is omitted altogether) and the blood and gore is perhaps a little too generously applied, but Director Tim Burton is clearly in his element here. This is not a 'musical' in the generally accepted sense  it is a 'music drama' or musical thriller  and very thrilling it is, too. I've seen it twice  and I shall look forward to seeing it again  a fine piece of work.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
