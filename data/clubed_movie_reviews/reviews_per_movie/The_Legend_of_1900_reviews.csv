Legendary,"As its pianist, this film could be bound for success, but the fact is, it remained relatively obscure. I can't understand why did a movie with this deepness and feeling end up in oblivion. Because, if there are some beautiful movies, this is one of them, from the moment that fantastic Ennio Morricone score begins until we witness the tear-jerking finale. An epic story from tip to toe, we journey through the original story of a man who becomes a pianist on board the boat where he was born. And as he grows, so does the fascination by the others in his art and the questions whether he should take that leap overboard and become a ""normal"" person. A brilliant movie, from the man who brought us ""Cinema Paradiso"" and made us all cry, this won't disappoint you, and it's worth by Morricone's score alone. The sequence where the piano floats freely through the dance hall is anthological. A legend of its own.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Astounding Visuals, Unique Story","This a ""sleeper,"" a very good film few people have heard about. The ones who have reviewed it here obviously know about it and you can see by their comments how well-liked it is.....so if you haven't seen it, check it out. In North America, it's called ""The Legend Of 1900.""The movie is definitely unique, about a man who spends his entire life on board an ocean liner and is a fantastic piano player. The best thing about this film, to me at least, was not the story- which I did enjoy - but the cinematography. Wow, what a great-looking film. Speaking of looks, Melanie Thierry is gorgeous. Too bad she has only a small part in this movie.It was nice to see Tim Roth play something other than a detestable villain and Clarence Williams was fun as the arrogant ""Jelly Roll Morton,"" who comes aboard ship to challenge Roth to a piano duel, which has to be seen to be believed. Can you say ""outrageous?""This was filmed by the same man who did the much more well-known Italian film, Cinema Paradiso, and if you appreciate how good-looking that film is, well, this is even better!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"The antidote to all your troubles, ""1900"" will sweep you away","It is at a time like this I wish I could expand my vocabulary to better articulate the virtues and qualities of such a fine film. I also find I'm bursting to talk about this film that I regrettably saw alone. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but desperately want to share it with everyone.The talented star of ""The Legend of 1900"", Tim Roth, presented this film along with Clarence Williams III. His encouragement to the audience was that if anyone was the sort who liked to pick apart at films and critique their lack of realism, they should just leave now. He touted this wonderful vision from the director of Cinema Paradiso, Giuseppe Tornatore, and likened the film to a ""dream"". He also said that if anyone had seen his own film, ""The War Zone"", that ""1900"" was the antidote for it. I was slated to see ""The War Zone"" the next day, but that was fine by me. I managed by a sheer stroke of luck to get into this Canadian premiere and found it to be absolutely extraordinary and the best film I'd seen so far of the Toronto International Film Festival.It seems as though mere moments after the initial credits, that the wonderful storytelling and incredible music combined with stunning visuals almost had me moved to tears. While I'll admit that I'd be seeing films all day, no film in my recollection had such an impact so quickly.The story is one of an abandoned baby who is found on a ocean liner by one of the ship's crew. He is unofficially adopted and named ""1900"" for the year in which he was born. At a very early age the boy demonstrates an extraordinary gift for piano playing which is only strengthened in his passing years. The boy grows up with no official identity, into a man having never taken a step off of the ship onto dry land in his whole life. The young man, played by Tim Roth is encouraged by his dear friend to leave the boat and pursue a life of fame and fortune as the great pianist he has become. 1900 declines, explaining simply that everything he needs is on the boat.Well, that should be enough to intrigue you; there's much more of course, but I've no desire to spoil it for anyone. I must encourage everyone to see this film, I can hardly imagine anyone being disappointed. It's for music lovers, dreamers, romantics and film buffs everywhere and my greatest hope is that it will be seen by many, many people, especially those I know and love. And after seeing the film, and hearing Tim Roth's words echoing in my mind, he was absolutely right. It is like a dream, a wonderful dream that I wished would never end. And for a future prediction, I see this film as a Best Foreign Film Oscar nomination for 1999.",,Anonymous,Music
A lovely film that has a heart,"On the first day of the twentieth century, an infant is discovered in the coal room aboard a luxury liner. The worker (Bill Nunn) who discovers the child on The Virginian names him 1900 or more accurately Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon Nineteen-Hundred. Eight years later the boy loses his ""father"" in a ship accident but discovers an amazing ability to play the piano and a legend is born. It is indeed The Legend of 1900, a fable by Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso) based on a dramatic monologue by Italian novelist Alessandro Baricco. The story is about a musical prodigy who spends his life aboard a ship, sailing back and forth between the U.S. and Europe, entertaining the passengers with his unique talent but never sharing it with the rest of the world.The film is narrated by Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince), an American saxophone player whom we meet at the beginning as he tries to pawn his trumpet. On leaving the shop, however, he hears the only recording 1900 ever made, a master that he had broken into pieces but that was later restored. When he finds out that the master came from a ship about to be demolished, he rushes to save 1900 whom he is sure is still aboard. In the process, he tells his story to convince others that 1900 exists. Through flashbacks we learn about 1900 and how he navigated his life from stem to stern. The question throughout the film is whether or not 1900 will abandon the ship and set foot on land? There is a hint that he might do so after he meets a beautiful young woman (Melanie Theirry). She inspires him to compose a beautifully expressive love song while gazing at her through a window, but the only thing that remains is the last copy of the record and an enduring memory.The Legend of 1900 creates its own world and I confess it is one that I got lost in. This is a lovely film that has a heart. It is sentimental without question but is redeemed by the glorious music by Ennio Morricone, beautiful cinematography by Lajos Koltai, and a terrific jazz piano duel between the adult 1900 (Tim Roth) and Jelly Roll Morton played by Clarence Williams III. 1900's world has clearly defined limits and he is fearful of venturing beyond. Land represents for him a place without boundaries, where people can get lost, a place without beginning or end. To me, The Legend of 1900 may be a metaphor for people who find a comfortable niche for themselves in life and are afraid to take risks to see what the possibilities are. In many cases, as with 1900, the world will never know the contribution they might have made.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Great Flick,"This movie was given to me as a Christmas gift in 2004. My friends know my love of ships and movies, so they knew this would be something I was surely to like. And did I. I would have been deeply disappointed if I had seen this at the local CinePlex, because there are so many excellent scene's you will want to rewind an ponder over, even shed a tear or two. Its the story of a baby boy ( Tim Roth )who is found aboard an ocean liner( by actor Bill Nunn ), who spends his entire life aboard this ship. Its a movie that is wonderfully acted by all the cast. It moves with ease an always keeps you in a slight fog that lifts at the perfect moment. The piano score's are exquisite !!!I found it haunting and moving at the same time. This movie is 2 hours long, but it will glide by so quickly you will want for more. Without spoiling it, the ending scene is powerful, its..............well......I'll let you be the judge.

A wonderfully wistful mixture of melodrama and music.,"""The Legend of 1900"" wistfully tells its creative, capriciously unpredictable, and musical tall tale with excellence in all aspects of film from sets to sound, costume to casting, and script to screenplay. Roth and Vince work well together in this plaintive, simple story which will captivate those who can make the leap of faith required to ""buy in"". A good film for all but critics, ""Legend"" will likely resonate most with those who equate living with musical expression. La vita è musica.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Colorful and moving film dealing with a solitary man who becomes a gifted pianist in a luxury ship,"Nostalgic and sensitive picture with stirring drama , ravishing cinematography and moving musical score . An epic story of a man who could do anything , except be ordinary . Shortly after the Second World War, Max , a transplanted American (Pruitt Taylor Vince) , visits an English pawn shop to sell his trumpet , there meets a shopkeeper (Peter Vaughan) and a peculiar musical single . Then Max tells the tale in flashback after learning a ship has been condemned (there was actually a registered ship named the SS Virginian which was built in 1904 and scrapped around 1954). As an abandoned infant is discovered aboard the luxury liner in 1900 and reared by an engine labourer (Bill Nunn) and the crew . As an adult is nicknamed Novecento (Tim Roth) and he has become an expert pianist , but since 1900 remains an enigma .The picture contains drama and nostalgia completely wrapped in an enjoyable story between a lone pianist and a trumpet player . The story is narrated with great sense and sensibility , the intelligent screenplay based on monologue Novecento by Alessandro Baricco was written by the same Giuseppe Tornatore . Slightly overrated but excellent all the same time , the picture is enjoyable and entertaining , but overlong . Magnificent performance from Tim Roth as virtuoso pianist in the ship's orchestra who has superstitiously never set foot off the boat and Pruitt Taylor Vince as his trumpet man friend . Good acting from remaining cast such as Bill Nunn as Danny Boodmann , Clarence Williams III as Jelly Roll Morton , Mélanie Thierry as The Girl , Gabriele Lavia as Farmer and Peter Vaughan as'Pops', the Shopkeeper . Originally released under various titles and at 170 minutes , it was re-cut and still had its problems . Glowing cinematography with scenarios colorfully and splendidly photographed by Lajos Koltai who reflects the elegant scenarios .As exterior shots of the ship are the inspired blueprints of the SS Lusitania and her sister ship the SS Mauritania, the ballroom in which 1900 plays his piano in had a dome similar to the dome the SS Mauritania had in her ballroom during the transatlantic period . Rousing and moving score musical by the veteran master and prolific Ennio Morricone who was nominated with a deserved Gloden Globe . The picture was well directed by Giuseppe Tornatore who made similar nostalgic films including good actors , such as the excellent ¨Cinema Paradise¨ with Philippe Noiret , ¨Malena¨ with Monica Belucci , ¨ The star maker¨ with Sergio Castellito and ¨Baaria¨ with Raoul Bova ; being his English-language debut feature titled ¨The professor¨ with Ben Gazzara . Rating of ¨La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'Oceano"" (original title) or ""The Legend of 1900"" or ""The Legend of the Pianist on the Ocean : Better than average, well worth watching for exceptional cinematography , first-rate acting and wonderful score .",6.0,Anonymous,Music
This is a film for which the medium was invented.,"""The Legend of 1900"" is not the most attractive title for a film and the Italian original, ""The Legend of the Oceanic Pianist"", is no better.  in retrospect there is no title worthy of this film.  The marquee should read simply ""See This Film, Your Life Will Be Better for It.""The story, music, cinematography, direction and, I hazard to say, a near perfect performance by Tim Roth combine to make for a compelling film.  The story is told with a poetic lyricism that is immediately captivating and that is more than enhanced by Lajos Koltai's well stated cinematography. Clarance Williams III's controlled overstatement as an unexpectedly nasty Jelly Roll Morton is the perfect contrast to Roth's underplayed and unworldly 1900.The American release of the film is 125 minutes.  The Italian release was 160 minutes.  What are we missing.  Maybe this shorter cut is better but I cannot forget the devastation that was wrought on ""Once Upon A Time In America"" for its 139 minute US theatrical release.  I certainly would not be not adverse to being subjected to an additional 35 minutes of the film and judging for myself if it was too long.Aside from its title the films only flaw is the exit song.  After two hours of enthralling instrumentals the vocal on the exit song undercuts rather than underscores a masterful filmic experience....rmk",10.0,Anonymous,Music
They should scraped the barnacles off instead of cutting 37 minutes,"I saw this in the theater in 2001 but for it's US theatrical distribution this film was cut from it's original 160 minute run time to 123 minutes. I see here that a lot of people enjoyed this film which I found to be good but not excellent as many viewed it to be. With a film directed by Giuseppe Tornatore of Cinema Paradiso fame and music from the great Ennio Morricone and the interesting storyline I felt this would be a good film to see but I ended up a little disappointed with the film. We never really learn how with no tutelage Novecento becomes the legendary pianist of the ocean. Presumably as some savant skill he was gifted with that listening to pianists play in the ship's ballroom as he grew up he picked it up without training or the ability to read music. The character is pretty dull despite growing up among hardened seafaring men of the boiler room and below deck and being exposed to high society above deck but I suppose one would possibly be kind of one dimensional if they lived on a single ship their entire lives never setting foot on land. Tim Roth is Novecento. Roth looks stiff in the title role. Despite being in a few hit movies like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Rosencrantz and Guilderstern Are Dead and Vincent and Theo earlier in his many films career he seems to have appeared in far more less memorable films including this one. Pruit Taylor Vince has the same career problem. Despite being in JFK, Mississippi Burning, Barfly and Natural Born Killers earlier in his career he also seems to get cast more forgettable ones than memorable ones. both Roth and Vince turn in stiff acting performances here. Clarence Williams III, best known as Linc from the old TV show Mod Squad plays Jelly Roll Morton. Morton was Creole from Louisiana who had mixed race blood but he didn't look black and looked more French so from a historical perspective as this film weaves an actual historical figure into it's fable, Williams is miscast. Williams by the way is pretty stiff himself in this film. The romantic angle in the film never really catches fire and the film has very little drama. This film looks good, has a mildly interesting story and a great soundtrack but despite it 40 years of trans Atlantic crossings it never really goes anywhere. I would give this a 6.0 of a possible 10 but wouldn't see it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A more general observation,"It is quite inexplicable to me why many North-American critics and viewers have a visceral negative reaction to sentimental Italian movies. By Italian I don't mean necessarily the language but a certain easily identifiable directorial style. So this category contains movies such as _Il Postino_, _Cinema Paradiso_, _Malena_, but also English language films such as _Stealing Beauty_ and _The Legend of 1900_.What they all have in common, besides beautiful cinematography, is that they try, quietly and modestly but nevertheless ambitiously, to investigate some aspects of the very essence of the human soul. The emotion used by many such movies, especially the ones directed by Tornatore, is nostalgia: by understanding the pain of irrecoverable loss we are supposed to understand what we truly needed. These movies express perfectly HL Mencken's definition of the artist as ""one who observes the eternal tragedy of man with full sympathy and understanding, and yet with a touch of god-like remoteness.""However, for reasons I fail to understand, the unavoidable sentimentality of these movies bothers many critics and casual viewers to no end. It's true that sentimental art exposes itself the most to irony and cynicism, but it is nevertheless disappointing to see many critics taking advantage of its vulnerability and indulging in hitting hard and hitting low against such movies. No wonder that art in general, not only movies, is nowadays almost devoid of sentimentality. Artists choose to clad themselves in critic-proof armors of irony and sophistication. Honesty has long become a dangerous no-win proposition.So I say 'Bravo!' to Tornatore for having the courage to give us some bullshit-free insight into ourselves by showing us what moves us and why. I also say 'Boo!' to the critics who don't get it, and who mistake their expectations and biases for some kind of objective artistic standard.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good movie, but it doesn't give the audience enough credit","Ever heard someone tell a great joke, then ruin it by explaining the punch line even though you got it the first time? That's the feeling I kept getting throughout this film. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie well worth watching. But the director's habit of over-explaining things kept making me wonder if he thinks we're all idiots.For example, there's a really cool scene where 2 pianists have a duel. Pianist #1 plays something amazing. Pianist #2 duplicates it note-for-note. It was almost a perfect scene except the director felt the need to have some extras in the audience yelling, ""He's playing the same thing! The exact same thing!""Another example would be during the same scene when one pianist breaks into a taunting version of ""Silent Night"". It was a funny moment, but again those stupid extras start yelling, ""Haha, he's playing 'Silent Night'!!""Whenever anyone plays something impressive we get those same unnecessary commentaries from peripheral characters, essentially telling the audience, ""Ok, you're supposed to be impressed here."" In that vein, the whole production struck me as being very operatic... meaning characters exaggerate reactions and emotions for the sake of giving the audience cues. Reminded me of a Kenneth Branaugh film. If you like em that way, then no problem. But if you prefer films on the subtle side (Kubrick, Bergman, Kieslowski), you might start to get distracted by this film's overtness.THE FILM'S SAVING GRACE... is the incomparable Tim Roth. He offsets the melodrama of the characters around him with his calm, sober portrayal of the guy who knows it all yet has seen nothing. Roth plays the central character, a man who has lived his entire life within the bowels of a boat. And he pulls it off with amazing authenticity.The film's final 15 minutes are where Roth really shines, and the director gives him every opportunity to do so with no distractions (no music, dark set with only faces illuminated, nice slow pacing so the dialogue can breathe). When it was all over, I could forgive the minor flaws mentioned above, and I came away impressed and fulfilled.I definitely recommend ""1900"" if you liked the films ""Copying Beethoven"", ""Shine"" and of course ""Cinema Paradiso""... It has the same polished style. In many ways it also reminded me of the Herzog film ""Invincible"", a movie that similarly comes across as a little overdone, but as soon as Roth appears everything falls into place.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Wonderful concept, horrible execution.","Imagine, if you will, a world.  A world where movies have thought provoking premises, eye-popping cinematography, beautiful sets and costumes, and absolutely beautiful music.  Now, take all these positives and combine them with contrived dialogue, blind editing, cliches, and a plot that meanders on a journey to nowhere.  This is the world of The Legend of 1900.I'm a big fan of feel good movies, Disney has made more than one feature film that has ""pulled at my heart-strings,"" yet I found it almost impossible to care about this movie.  Character development never took place, in fact, I'm not sure acting ever took place.  The movie was filled with unrealistic, ""magic"" moments that might have made more sense in a children's fantasy movie.  But this can hardly be considered a children's movie considering the number of times the f-word is used and the feature is too painfully grounded in reality to be considered fantasy.To call the dialogue tin-eared is almost a compliment and though the director is Italian it's not as if he would be unable to hire someone who did have a clue.Speaking of directing, why direct a movie that should be an intimate character study with such an epic style?  The grandeur of the camera angles/movement is impressive until you finally realize that it's there to entertain you through part of the flat plot.As plots go, we never really accomplish anything.  By the end of the movie, I almost felt that I knew less about 1900 than I did at the beginning. And Vince's character, eyes darting about to the point of distraction, gives a horrible performance with a whimp of a character.  Other than serving as 1900's lap-dog and trite narrator he serves no practical purpose whatsoever.The thing that bothers me most, though, is the number of people singing this movie's praises.  Endless reviews calling it ""magic"" and ""unforgettable."" It gives me cause to step back and re-examine my long-held views that people aren't generally idiots.I don't mean to destroy this movie, I simply find myself disappointed.  I had hoped for so much more.  I would love to see this movie redone by a director who knows English and with a script that follows the same plot without the painfull specifics that drive this feature into the dirt. This movie gets a 3/10.  1 for cinematography, 1 for music, and 1 for a concept that had enough potential to make me pick up this movie on a whim.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
I'll Never Watch Another Movie Again!,"""I'll never watch another movie again!"" cried my sweet-hearted wife as she wept uncontrollably as the final scene ended. Touched, I wept with her, but made no such vow. She may not keep the vow either, but I can see why she said what she did. This was my second viewing, her first. This time, though, I was deeply touched by everything in the film. 12 years ago, when I first saw it, it was fun, interesting, and for me a real salvation for an actor--Tim Roth--who normally plays the bad guy. Today I can easily say that of the thousands of films I have seen, this one out-ranks all of them--definitely is #1 in my book. I honestly can think of no other great film that is as good. Mary Poppins comes to mind, but still doesn't make the grade like this one. Oh, and we love, love, love Jazz. There's Ragtime here, and Dixieland, and Roaring 20s Jazz, and other Jazz styles--and even quite a bit of Classical. Roger Waters even steps in for one of his classic solos written for this film--and I'm a big Pink Floyd fan because of, you guessed it, their Jazz influence. I've gushed enough, I guess, but see this one, then get a copy for yourself, and watch it once a year--to remind yourself that the inner world, the inner kingdom, is far and away better than anything that world out there has to offer.

That's his life, maybe a little different from ours, but should also be highly respected. He, his piano, his ship, how beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Impressive,"Not a classic, but whoa, some of that piano playing just sweeps you right off your feet. Tim Roth is good as the handsome pianist Nineteenhundred and so is all the the rest of the cast. This cast also includes Clarence Williams III, presumably the grandson of Clarence Williams (the man who wrote the song ""Basin Street Blues"" one hell of a classic), as Jelly Roll Morton. This leads me on to one of the most impressive parts of the film where Nineteenhundred and Morton have a match to see who is the best pianist. There is some piano playing in this scene which will leave pianists with there mouths hanging open. Probably the best thing about this film is it's music. There are many rousing themes played throughout the film, especially the love theme played while Nineteenhundred kisses a girl he has fallen in love with, a simple yet very effective theme. Another thing that makes this film very good is the fantastic camera-shots, especially one of Nineteenhundred as he stands halfway across the plank which leads him from the boat to New York, undecided whether or not he should leave the boat and head for world-wide celebrity on land, or stay on the boat and remain unknown to anyone but the passengers. I have got to get myself the soundtrack to this film and you have got to see it somehow. Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
They say that you can always get by if you have a good story to tell. Try this one.,"An outstanding feature of this film is the atmosphere developed in all the crowd scenes.  The early morning arrival of the SS Virginian filled to the brim with well-heeled passengers and excited emigrants shouting ""America!"" is a most moving spectacle. Another crowd scene is deep down in the belly of the ship where stokers grimy and sweaty are shovelling coal into the open mouths of the fiery boilers.  The whole scene is grim and threatening with steel platforms and steel steps, heavy chains and pulleys, men shouting above the noisy activity. Then again many decks above bring us to the crowded dance floor aglow with the rich and famous out for a good time with wine,women and song. Diector Giuseppe Tornatore handles all these scenes superbly and with true feeling. In all this shipboard activity is a lonely man called 1900. Of unknown parentage he was given that name by stokers down below after being found in a box on the grand piano in 1900. He was born at sea, lived his whole life at sea and could never bring himself to leave the ship. He died at sea. The character 1900 is played by three people - a baby (adorable), a young boy (charming) and a grown man (Tim Roth).  Most people will remember this film for the exciting piano playing competition.  I have never seen such nimble fingers as they rattle over the keys and hammer the piano wires into a fiery temperature.  The photography at this point with its multiple overlapping images of hands and piano keys helps to build the excitement. It's pretty serious business because bets are laid on the outcome of the competition. 1900 has one true friend, a trumpet player.  I like the scene where the two men seated at the piano (with the brakes off) race at a terrifying speed around the ballroom as the ship lurches to and fro in the heavy seas. I have a couple of queries though.  I may have missed something in the film but I cannot recall how 1900 learnt to play so well and who taught him.  But it makes a great scene and the music is exciting and enjoyable.   And that girl....peering in through the porthole as young 1900 woos her with his gentle notes.  What a gorgeous angelic creature who touches the heart of 1900 for a fleeting moment!  Such a small role and yet the glow of her face remains long after the credits fade.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Interesting concept, not well used","1900. Danny Boodmann, a stoker on an American passenger liner, Virginian, finds a baby abandoned on the ship. He names the child Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred '1900' and raises the child as his own until his death in an accident on the ship. The child never leaves the ship and turns out to be a musical genius, especially when it comes to playing the piano. As an adult he befriends a trumpet player in the ship's band, Max Tooney. After several years on the ship Max leaves, and tells the story of 1900 to the owner of a music store.Interesting concept, not well used. The idea of a man who has never set foot on land, whose whole world is one ship and cannot relate to the world outside was a very original and promising one. However, the story really doesn't explore any of these themes well. The story is quite superficial, full of empty, devoid of context sentimentality and contrived, implausible situations. It's a simple linear storyline with faux-sentimental, style-over-substance scenes dropped in.Even the tone is wrong. The movie is often cartoonish in its sub- plots and characters. What was needed was gravitas, not cheap thrills.The conclusion does provide some insights into 1900's motivations and outlook on life but still isn't that profound.This all said, the storyline was reasonably interesting and there is some good tension towards the end.Solid work by Tim Roth in the lead role. Pruitt Taylor Vince is a touch unconvincing and irritating as Max Tooney. The lack of gravitas is almost entirely his, or at least his character's, doing. Supporting cast are fine.Ultimately, a reasonably interesting plot but nothing more than that.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
This is a film I wish everyone would see -,"the more people see it, the more people there are to help me work out what to make of it.  It's hard not to like, and the central conceit, the fantasy story of someone whose entire life is spent crossing and re-crossing the Atlantic, is just delicious - yet there's always something that prevents it from working as it should.  There's too much narration.  Narration aside, there are too many words.  Just before 1900 and the narrator part ways the former explains himself, to some degree, in a longish speech.  The speech was necessary: we needed to hear his reasons from his own lips.  But once it had been given the scene should have ended.  Instead the two characters keep adding postscripts as they walk away from one another - and they're standard, maudlin things which are at odds with what 1900 had been saying a moment ago.  Again and again, there are words where there shouldn't be.But then, it may be that the title character was given too FEW words - at least at first.  Because it's so long before we first hear 1900 express his thoughts verbally (and because in the absence of other information about his character we are unwilling to pass judgment on him until he does) it takes too long for us to warm to him.  In fact we never warm to him as much as we should.And yet there are scenes - the piano duel, the girl in the rain - that are just fantastic, that make me reluctant to criticise anything at all.  Any film containing moments like those can afford to lose its way at times.P.S.  Of course, a film about a pianist born on the first day of the Twentieth Century ought to be called ""The Legend of 1901"", which if you asks me sounds better anyway.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

And the fact that he never gets off the boat, I mean OK he need not do it for good, but just to take a walk around, you know, he can stick to his convictions and then go back.

A Lovely Note of Life,"Without a doubt, this is a story worthy of your time despite its fame.

Unlike Forrest Gump who symbolizes the America's post-war right-wing spirit, 1900, disregarding his talent, comprises the qualities most of us may have in reality: introvert, timid, unsociable, and often introspective. He's blunt enough to irritate the captain and outplay the greatest jazz musician, but not brave enough to profess his love or step off a stairs; he could perform melodies with pure emotions and imaginations, but couldn't discern the voice of the ocean. Tim Roth portrayed such character with great depth, as I see myself in the eyes of 1900. Moreover, the movie narrates the grand yet exquisite tale with ravishing cinematography and designs, appealing minor plots, and fantastic score by Ennio Morricone. One point I disagree upon is 1900's confession in the end, as he claims that the endless life is what can be worrisome: indeed, appreciating what's already owned and present is crucial, but life is also meaningful for it involves constant learning and adventures. It may be most comfortable to lie down and breathe, but one can only find fulfillment when he moves on... Or not! Who's to say what life's all about?",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A descent movie with a heart,"Greetings from Lithuania.""La leggenda del pianista sull'oceano"" (1998) is a long epic, kinda forgotten one. I actually did not head anything about this movie but just now, when spotted it for a first time at the bottom of IMDb top 250 movies list. Its a bit crazy that this movie came out basically in the same year as ""Titanic"" have, which costed nearly 200 million dollar and this movie just 6.Overall, ""La leggenda del pianista sull'oceano"" is a good fantasy story about a man who lived his life entirely on a ship. It sound a bit unrealistic, and this movie is unrealistic but its not tried to be anything else. I found the performances just OK but nothing special. The look of the movie was really good and cinematography was great - surely the music itself which plays a huge role was excellent. While at the running time 2 h 45 min this movie did drag here and there (its a very long movie), i did enjoyed it because of the simplistic story which probably will never be told again on a big screen in the age of superhero movies. This is a good movie all in all, which has a heart in a right place.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Good Story Worths More than an Old Trumpet,"After the Second World War, the American musician Max Tooney (Pruitt Taylor Vince) comes to a pawn shop to sell his trumpet and asks to play one last song with the instrument. The shopkeeper (Peter Vaughn) puts an old record with the same song to play, and Max asks him where he found it since it is an unreleased unique song. He tells that he bought a piano from a scrapped ship and found the pieces of the record inside the piano. Max tells that on January, 1st 1900, the stoker Danny Boodmann (Bill Nunn) of the Steamship ""Virginian"" finds a baby boy over the piano of the first class in a cradle carved T.D. Lemon and he decides to keep the child. He gives the name of Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred and raises the child in the boiler room of the passenger ship. Years later, an accident kills Danny Boodmann and the boy leaves the boiler room for the first time and discovers that he is a natural born pianist. When Max is hired to play trumpet in the ship, he becomes a close friend of 1900 (Tim Roth) and witness his life, including the duel with the arrogant ""man who had invented the jazz"" Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III) and when he falls in love for a girl (Mélanie Thierry) and almost leaves the vessel in New York. When Max left the ship on August, 21st 1933, he lost contact with 1900. Now he decides to go to the junkyard and find his missing friend. In the end, a good story worths more than an old trumpet.""La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'Oceano"" is a sensitive, poetic and tragic fantasy about music, missing love and friendship, with magnificent direction of Giuseppe Tornatore; top-notch performances of Tim Roth and Pruitt Taylor Vince; and haunting music score of Ennio Morricone. The cinematography, costume design and art direction are wonderful and the dialogs are intense and delightful. This film was released in Brazil on VHS in the 90's by Warner, but deserved at least a DVD. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Lenda do Pianista do Mar"" (""The Legend of the Pianist of the Sea"")",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Improves with every minute.,"No major SPOILERS here.Starts off as one of those European, ""grand"" (read: pretentious-looking), overly sentimental turn-of-the-century epics, but it gradually, steadily but firmly, starts growing on you. It's a highly idealized bio of a larger-than-life fictional character. I moaned when Roth, as a child, immediately learned to play the piano with great skill the day he first saw it. But, as I said, Roth plays a larger-than-life guy so anything goes; there are practically elements of fantasy here, even though this isn't literally spelled out. One has to accept the otherwise absurd premise that a man who is born on a ship, willingly spends half a century aboard it without once setting foot on land. Yet the movie is shot so well, and combined with the pleasant music (not ""pleasant"" as in ""puts you to sleep"") it pulls you in, especially in the second half. Roth appears too aloof for a while and his character too mysterious and undefined, but his long, very interesting speech to the trumpet player at the end of the movie clarifies a lot in a strange and original way. It's always good to be pleasantly surprised by a movie that starts off not-very promisingly, and then improves so much that it's never boring and even fascinating all the way to the end. It doesn't even matter that 1900 grew up with an American foster parent, but - as Roth - developed a British accent. The movie is good, so I'll leave the nit-picking for some other time...",,Anonymous,Music
Heal my soul,"This is a movie that heals the soul and is also a sentimental movie. After watching this movie, along with the piano music made by 1900 for girls, I felt more thoughts on loneliness.

"Lovely to Look At, but that's about it.","First of all, it was nice to see the ship exterior and promenade deck from Fellini's ""And the Ship Sails On"" once more. Every studio should have its own ship, and the one at Cinecitta is lovely. The overall production design and cinematography of this film are a constant delight.That being said, this ship gets lost in fog around halfway through, and never finds its way again. As with so many Italian films, this movie is about the grand gesture, but all too often here the gesture is clumsy, badly written or staged, or totally inexplicable. The ballroom piano recital in the rolling storm is a memorable gesture, the playoff with Jelly Roll Morton is phonus bolognus, the closing self-explanation of the main character's life and his vision of heaven is unbearable.You know something's wrong when, in the opening sequence, a ship filled with immigrants enters New York harbor from the wrong direction, with the Statue of Liberty and the island of Manhattan sliding by in reverse. Did they come in from Albany? Unimportant in itself, this howler shows an autointoxicated disregard for truth in the pursuit of gripping but often unmotivated emotion. This self-indulgence kills the whole film. We are told that Truth is Beauty and Beauty is Truth, but in this movie, one of them is a liar.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

"A beautifully shot, wonderfully scored movie, with a great lead performance from Tim Roth","This is an imperfect but incredibly beautiful film, and the strengths go a long way to help the film overcome most of its flaws. First saw it about 8 years ago, and besides some slightly dated CGI, it feels like it's aged really well in that time.It excels in three key areas: it's beautifully shot, the always incredible Morricone (RIP) delivers one of his best and most varied scores, and the constantly underrated Tim Roth gives one of his best performances. (As a sidenote, because it's not really a part of the film: the poster is beautiful and one of my all time favourites).And to expand on Morricone's score: the movie is about a supernaturally gifted musician who comes up with some of the most gorgeous music the world has ever heard. I'm not sure how many film composers besides Morricone and maybe John Williams could pull off that kind of score- he was literally required to create supernaturally beautiful music, and he succeeded. There's even a piece of music with an intentionally off-key note and it still sounds perfect and chills-inducing somehow.There are also a number of amazing sequences- the first scene with Tim Roth and the sliding piano, the whole piano duel sequence, and the part where 1900 records a song based on the way he feels a young woman he instantly falls for.The film has an almost fantastical tone- it's close to a fairytale in some ways, and I can see that being a turnoff for some people. It does mean that there are moments that are overly sentimental, and maybe even cliched, but again: it's so beautiful and engaging on an emotional level that I don't really mind.There is a romance subplot and it is a little underdeveloped too. I'be only seen the theatrical cut, and it may be expanded in the director's cut, but then again two hours feels like the perfect length, and I'm sceptical over whether I'd enjoy the film as much if it was 45 or so minutes longer.Anyway, it's without a doubt worth a watch, and I wish it got a little more love. It's not quite on the same level as the director's earlier Cinema Paradiso, but it also isn't too far behind.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The Vidiot Reviews....,"The Legend of 1900Ocean liners are the ideal jazz venue because the audience has no means of escaping.Conversely, the pianist in this drama is attracting passengers to his vessel.When a ship worker finds a baby aboard the SS Virginian, he raises it as his own. But when he passes, the child - dubbed 1900 (Tim Roth) - must fend for himself. Eventually, he learns the piano and joins the vessel's orchestra - never once stepping foot on dry ground. When word of his talents reaches the mainland, famed pianist Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III) boards the Virginian to challenge him to a piano duel.While the narrative never goes beyond the concept, and 1900's character arc is basically nonexistent, this adaptation of an Italian novel makes up for its shortfalls with dynamic direction and scorching soundtrack.However, if the ship ever starts sinking it's probably smart to say you play the triangle.

Whimsical and unlikely yet touching and wonderful,"A man, Max, walks into a pawn shop to sell his trumpet.  While playing it one last time, the owner puts on a record that sparks memories in Max and is the very reason he has returned to New York.  Max tells the story of a boiler worker on board the cruise ship The Virginian who finds a baby left on New Years day 1900.  He keeps the boy on board and raises him  naming him `Danny Boon TD Lemon 1900'.  When the boilerman is killed, 1900 stays on board and discovers a gift for playing the piano and is famous across the ship.  However, Max insists that 1900 has never, in 40 odd years, left the ship and is desperate to convince the demolition crew (about to demolish the ship out at sea) that 1900 must still be on board.When I sat to watch this film I had no idea what it was about and had never so much as read a review  I just thought I'd give it a go as I had little else to do.  I am very glad that I did and would urge anyone else with the chance to see this film to do so.  The plot is very unlikely and very slight when it comes to details but it has a real whimsy to it that really keeps things moving alone really well.  Add to this the beauty of the music and it really gives the film a nice flow that stops it dragging.  The device of having Max tell the story and running the two time lines beside each other also really kept the story moving.The light mood of the film changes later to slightly more serious drama but by then I was sucked in by the lightness and the change was not too heavy and was all the more moving for the light touch that had gone beforehand. True, it all is a bit (very!) unlikely and some bits of it feel like the bigger idea had come first and the details had been sketched in later, but this is a minor flaw as the film is perfectly pitched (excuse the pun) with a light feel that carries everything else.From the first meeting of Max and 1900 to the emotional but easily foreseen climax the film is a mix of emotion and whimsy that works very well.  Roth is an OK (if not great) actor and only occasionally seems stretched here. For the most part he is good but I do find his squeaky voice annoying the odd time.  Vince was excellent in heavy and I was glad to see him again here  his role is strong and he does well.  Smaller roles such as Nunn and Williams III are good and everyone in support helps the comic yet emotional tone of the piece.  The direction is superb and again sets the mood well. The film suffers once from a poor projection on the ship's hull but other than that sets are great be they the growing city or the ballroom of the ship.Is this a classic?  no.  Is it a light film that effortlessly sucks you into an emotional story?  yes.  If you're in the mood for something like this then this is the film for you.  The moment I finished watching it I wanted to see it again and go and give the tape to my friends to see, it really is that enjoyable.",,Anonymous,Music
Simply spectacular!,"The Legend of 1900' offers a unique premise we haven't seen before.

Even if you're not a musician, this is an interesting watch and a film to be admired for so many reasons.'The Legend of 1900' is visually beautiful. The production design is incredible and the photography and cinematography stunning. Acting from the entire cast is very good, but especially Tim Roth in the lead.

"epic tale of jazz music, friendship, romance and.magic.","The story, told by the main character's best friend Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) takes place on the Virginian, one of the luxurious ocean liners of the Titanic-era.

He names the boy after the name on the crate he was found in: T.D.Lemon. Since it's the turn of the century, 1900 is added as his surname. Tim Roth is 1900. Or more accurately: Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon 1900. It turns out that 1900 is a special boy. His gift for the piano makes him a legend. But in order to experience the the piano sound of the legendary master, you have to make a cruise because 1900 never sets foot on land!The only one to come close to the way 1900's mind works is his friend and colleague Max, an accomplished trumpet player in the ship's band. As Max puts it: `You're never really done for as long as you got a good story and someone to tell it to'. And boy does he tell a beautiful story. A story that will keep you mesmerized all through the film. There are scenes that will definitely put a smile on your face.

Although the story is original and the score is more than well done, this movie lacks of ""small"" other things. The set sometimes looks fake, like for e.g. when at the beginning the ship is approaching New York, passing close to the statue of liberty. The main actors are not convincing, Pruitt Taylor Vince fits physically as Max, but there are many scenes, where he looks like he'd burst out laughing, although dealing with dramatic issues. Tim Roth, I'm sorry to say this, didn't convince me. At certain points, for e.g. the scene where he does fall in love with the passenger was completely unbelievable in my eyes, not for the story, but for acting.

Call It Fable; Call It Fantasy; I Call It Wistful and Magical,"Unusual and definitely not for everyone, THE LEGEND OF 1900 is a magical tale that should have great appeal for those possessed of a certain kind of sensitivity.

Now you're getting it.What will a story about a man who, from infancy, has spent his entire life on board a luxury liner (and become a musical prodigy along the way), never having set foot on dry land, say to you?He has a name (a mouthful), but they call him ""1900.""

And with the Virginia now scheduled to pass from existence, what choice will he make? Can he choose? Has he already chosen?Much analysis of various themes has been done in other commentaries about this film, but ultimately, each viewer will decide - or, perhaps, feel - what it's telling them.

a strange tale,"This offering from director Giuseppe Tornatore was billed as ""an epic story of a man who could do anything... except be ordinary."" Tim Roth stars as the title character - the spastic, moody pianist who was born and raised on a ship, and named after the year in which he was found. He encounters many unique personages on his travels, most notably the story's narrator, Max Tooney (Pruitt Taylor Vince). The two become fast friends: 1900 teaches Max to find his sea-legs, and Max becomes his most devoted fan. For 1900 is a piano prodigy. He plays beautiful music that no one has ever heard before, inspired by the faces of passengers that he sees. Appropriately, his most gorgeous piece is written when he catches sight of the woman he is destined to love. There's only one problem: he refuses to set foot on dry land.The film is, basically, a fantasy. A grown-up's fairy tale. Not for a moment do I believe that any of this could ever happen, and neither did all the critics who gave it negative reviews. This kind of movie is acceptable, perhaps, in Europe. Not in America. Our critics demand realism, and their usual beef with any given film is the ""unrealistic"" happenings, or ""plot holes"". But it's The Legend of 1900 for a reason...it isn't real, and we're not meant to believe that it is. In order for this type of story to work, the characters must be compelling enough to carry a fantastical tale. Films like Goldfinger and Ocean's 11 have banked on this before, and we've become used to such hijinks in the action/adventure genre. But an unbelievable drama? There's no question that Roth's 1900 is fascinating. Charmingly neurotic, he endures the ribbing of his friends and enemies with Bogartesque grace. The character of Max Tooney is meant to be the duller companion to his genius: the Watson to his Holmes, the Robin to his Batman. Unfortunately Vince's performance leaves something to be desired, and his character is given little to do. He plays the trumpet well and (reportedly) tells a great story, but he lacks the charisma needed in a sidekick. When 1900's home ship, The Virginian, is destined to be destroyed, Max embarks on a quest to find 1900 and save him from the explosion. This search spans the whole film, intercut with flashbacks to the many voyages of Max and 1900. The ending is predictable. In fact, each moment in the film is predictable, with one exception. Almost every single plot point is shamelessly foreshadowed at least once, and I found myself wondering wearily how long it would take to reveal each ""twist"". Maybe it's the American in me. I just wanted to see stuff get blown up.The one truly interesting scene is the ""piano duel"" between 1900 and jazz sensation Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III). You find yourself as bewildered by 1900's behavior as are the passengers...what is he doing? Why? When will he finally show Jelly Roll who's boss? In spite of yourself, you really want this strange young sea-bound man to win. You like him. What's not to like? But liking a character isn't always enough to carry a film. Such is the case here. In the end, you realize that you never really had any vested interest in 1900 or his fate. He's interesting to look at, but his magic lasts only as long as his fingers play.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Tim Roth plays his character with pathos and charm, and whenever he has a speaking part, he dominates the screen (particularly notable is the discussion he and Max have near the end of the movie). Finally, the piano music is just wonderful, start to finish.But, some of this movie is highly clichéd, particularly some of the dialog -- which is surprising, considering just how philosophical and wonderful some of the other dialog is. There are some pretty gaping plot holes (and I don't consider myself to be a plothole-seeking pedant by any stretch of the imagination...they're just really hard to miss). And honestly, the acting by pretty much everyone *but* Tim Roth is pretty mediocre.What to say? It's hard to reconcile all this. This is both of one the most beautiful and most irritating films I've seen in a long time. I give it an 7/10 because the beautiful parts are so beautiful, but I could easily have given it a 4/10 because the flawed parts are so flawed. It's no Cinema Paradiso, but I'd say it's worth watching in spite of its flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Just fascinating,"I have seen this movie many times. Today without even knowing I turned on my television and the movie was just starting. I cannot think of a more fascinating movie than this. The music is beautiful, the story makes you wander into time and into the Pianist's mind. A whole world turns around him as the center of his universe. He does not need to go out and look around for an identity. Why should he go out into the real life when the world comes to him? I cannot think of a better actor to portray this character. The sad look in his eyes gives credibility to what he does. The ""girl"" Melanie Thierry is as beautiful as they come. Her peacefully wild looks make her an unforgettable player in this movie. Regardless of the technical deficiencies, the plot itself is so strong, that you cannot but get inside the story and follow it throughout the duration of the film. I recommend this picture as a must see for anyone that is sensible to life itself",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A beautiful allegory of an artist's journey,"This magnificent metaphoric film is not for everyone.  It is poetic and symbolic and therefore not to be seen in the usual literal narrative terms...which may confound some. For me it was a lyrical and profound cinematic experience, by far the best film of 1998.  An infant is found on a ship (already a mythic theme) and lives his entire life aboard this ocean liner, named ""1900"" after the year he was born.  As an adult he has a prodigious talent as a pianist...a natural...performing in the ship's dining saloon for passengers (in the 20s and 30s...marvelous authentic costuming). Tornatore's writing and direction, its imaginative images, the development of the character of the artist as a visionary, an outsider are remarkable and courageously innovative, never a trite or easy depiction.In general terms (though without the humor) ""The Horse's Mouth"" comes to mind, another brilliant evocation of the outsider artist (more direct and less philosophic than""The Legend"").  If you haven't seen it, and love this sort of film, by all means, rent it!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Music

A delicate and authentic magic,"Upon first consideration, ""The Legend of 1900"" seems merely to be a shaggy dog story, albeit a lyrically shot and physically sumptuous shaggy dog story.  The more you consider it, however, the more penetrating the film becomes.  Forget Hollywood action fluff like ""End of Days"".  THIS is a parable for the end of the millennium.Tim Roth stars as Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon 1900, born in his namesake year aboard a cruise liner called the Virginian and taken in by the ship's crew as a surrogate son.  1900, as everyone calls him, reveals a prodigistic ability on the piano, and over the years, he wins admirers and friends, and becomes a figure of musical legend...all the while never setting foot on dry land.  Even after being given the opportunity to make it big as a recording artist.  Even after besting ""the man who invented jazz"", Jelly Roll Morton (played with fierce pride by Clarence Williams III) in a piano duel.  Even after facing the temptation of a wide-eyed, beatific muse...1900 stays firmly rooted to the sea.As we watch, we enjoy the skillful performances of Roth and Pruitt Taylor Vince, who plays Max, the trumpeter in the ship's jazz band and 1900's closest friend.  We also appreciate the film's visual presentation. Director Giuseppe Tornatore and cinematographer Lajos Koltai give every shot a lush, burnished elegance, and the film is caressed by a lovely score from the legendary Ennio Morricone.Eventually, though, it all comes to an end.  The world survives a war, Max returns to dry land, and the Virginian rots away, and still 1900 stays on board the ship.  Finally, Max comes on board, pleading to his friend to leave and come into the world.  And 1900, a man who speaks for the past that he is named for, delivers a speech that renders the fact that this review is being written for the Internet bitterly ironic.  It lays bare the fact that we are all lost in a vast and impersonal sea of endless stimulus, that provides us with all we seemingly need but does not allow us to really put down roots, to take shape, to grow.  The film speaks urgently to a world caught in the stranglehold of sensationalistic mass media and corporate control.  It imparts a simple but essential message.  Better to be the shining star of a small world than to travel through infinite space as a nobody.""The Legend of 1900"" is a sleeper, and one of the deepest and most interesting films of the year.",,Anonymous,Music
A story over the waves.,"A compelling and sympathetic bittersweet drama telling the story of a boy abandoned in a great transatlantic and raised by a worker of the the ship. The boy grows up and turns out to be a fantastic piano player but although his undisputed talent he never get off from the ship, living his entire life inside the ship. A interesting and very original premise that Tornatore, a sensible director with a special touch in telling stories about love, friendship, solitude and hope (see Cinema Paradiso, for instance, develops in almost flawless pace. To say the truth, there's some problems along the way; some scenes are a bit too long, like the duel between 1900 and Jelly Morton and Roth gives a cold and undeveloped performance in the lead role. Otherwise, the movie is a original view over some primal questions like the meaning of life, the substance of the being and the destiny of a man in a world too much complicated and unfriendly, but never in a Bergman amplitude. I give this a 6 (six).",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good story, disappointing movie","I really wonder why I didn't like this movie more and found some answers.As Hitchcock once said, if the starting point of a story is too good, it has to go down until the end. I may add, if the starting point of a story is good but unbelievable, I feel f...ed by the book.Understandably one has to use a lot of GI if you lack the money to build and blow up an ocean liner for your story, but some shots were too cheap to be believed.I liked the Charakters but never felt close to them, though played well, because of the sum of all the implausibilities. The ""piano dance"" early in the movie is visually great, but physically impossible.

I think that movie fans and music fans alike can enjoy this. For one thing, I used to play the trumpet and still play piano a bit and the way the characters play is amazing. The piano duel is about on par with the famous guitar duel from ""Crossroads"" (Steve Vai and Ry Cooder). There are a number of good laughs in this too. Particularly the famous gaining the sea legs scene with Max and 1900. That just about had me on the floor laughing. The cigarette on the piano scene was also memorable. The ending was a big tear-jerker though. This is a good film for couples to watch together, just have a box of tissues on standby at the end.

"Boring, disappointing","Watched this one with my love, and we both came away a bit disappointed. Nice enough imagery, music is fine, but the story doesn't really captivate or rather: it doesn't even simply 'get going'. A baby is 'somehow' left on a cruise-ship, the boy grows up and 'somehow' turns out to be a natural for the piano, 'somehow' rises to tremendous fame and in the end is not prepared to go out into the endless, asphyxiating world. He goes down with the ship, without having done anyting really worthwile. Neither intruiging depth nor amusing shallowness, no heart-stirring romance or nail-biting supsense: just a pretty long period of time containing not very much. Wouldn't pick this one if you wanted your date to curl up in your arms (though I did almost fall asleep)",4.0,Anonymous,Music

TITANIC has just sunk even deeper. This is how it should have been done.,"I cannot believe i didn´t went to see this movie at the theaters ! THE LEGEND OF 1900, is one of the most beautiful and poetic movies in a very long time, (with the exception of Magnolia wich is also fantastic, but in a different style). But this one has one of the most unexpected and original stories i ever saw in a  movie. But what is realy difficult to describe is the feeling which this movie conveys. It has an atmosphere of an haunted fairy tale but in a very poetic way, turning even the most normal events into some kind of enchanted moment. The movie is directed by Giusepe Tornatore the Italian director who created one of the most beautiful movies of all time, Cinema Paradiso. Strangely enough this was one of the reasons i didn´t went to see The Legend of 1900 at the theaters. I thought that after Cinema Paradiso, there was no way, the same director would be able to create another movie like that. Man, was i wrong !I loved The Legend of 1900 so much, that i don´t know what i like best anymore. I think i only seen a story as poetic as this before and that was in Cinema Paradiso.I´m not going to talk about the plot of 1900 because you can read it in all the other reviews. What i just want to say is that this movie has just sunk Titanic even deeper, for it has all the emotion and strengh that  James Cameron never did achieve in his movie and being similar movies in atmosphere i think it´s fair to make a comparison and it´s also fair to say that THE LEGEND OF 1900, is far emotionaly superior to TITANIC in every aspect and every detail of its story. This movie is everything i was expecting to find in TITANIC and it was´t there.I wish i could do justiçe in describing how beautiful The Legend of 1900 is, but this is one of those things you have to see for yourself to really appreciate, because i guess there are no words to describe, the poetry of so many of the scenes in this movie. The moment when 1900 falls in love is truly undiscribable. The way in which music is used in this story is simply a work of genius. And this soundtrack wipes the floor with all the comercial c**p that appears nowadays in the Hollywood movies.The Legend of 1900 is to Music what Cinema Paradiso was to Cinema. Tornatore has done it again ! And as love stories go, this is one of the best i ever seen. Giuseppe Tornatore seems to have this gift to realy create extraordinary beautiful love stories without making them into  Hollywood soaps and this is very rare this days.And it´s not only the story that makes this such a good film to watch. Visualy its also trully impressive and glamorous. The production design and photography in this movie creates incredible visuals. Some scenes even look like classic paintings coming to life. And the cast is fantastic. I won´t name anyone in particular because all deliver a truly fantastic ensemble performance. Giuseppe Tornatore has created another unforgettable classic, that i can bet will be truly recognized as the mastepiece it is in years to come.Unfortunately, because it isn´t an Hollywood product, the movie didn´t had the publicity or distribution, it deserved, and so i guess not many people got the chance to see it at theaters, but hey, it´s now out on DVD and in an incredible high technical quality edition (at least in region2) so please go and rent this movie. Buy it , in fact because you won´t regret it. And if you have a widescreen tv and a surround sound, you´ll go nuts with this film.It´s movies like this that prove how fake the Oscars are. THE LEGEND OF 1900 is a masterpiece.",,Anonymous,Music

Tedious Ivory Tinkling,"Looking past all the things I dislike about this film I find there's an original plot, and one I could take to at that.However, the film is filled with a number of musical performances that hit all the wrong notes with me. Unless you are heavily into piano music, particularly early jazz, you may find the set musical pieces as tiresome as I did, to the extent that it spoils the entire film for you.A further problem of the music is that throughout you are to view the central character as some kind of uber-genius of the ivories. If you fail to enjoy the music to the extent that you nod and go ""yes, he is a piano God"" then much of the fuss and story surrounding him falls apart.I'm also not sure about Tim Roth. For some reason I like him a great deal in Reservoir Dogs even though a part of me feels his performance is flawed. In this his performance seems pretty woeful. He has a tick where he squeals a bit as he speaks when he's in a bit of emotional turmoil and I find that puts me off him. In this film he is also expected to do a bit of genius-fuelled wistfulness, but - I'm afraid - when he does this, I just find he looks a bit of a fool.It's got a nice feel of the period, but every time I tried to relax into the film and enjoy it, there was always something irking me.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

Title: The Legend of 1900 (1998) - A Musical Odyssey Across the High Seas,"""The Legend of 1900,"" directed by Giuseppe Tornatore and released in 1998, is a visually stunning and emotionally resonant film that takes viewers on a captivating journey through the world of music and imagination. Set primarily aboard the ocean liner SS Virginian in the early 20th century, the film tells the story of a virtuoso pianist named 1900, who is born and raised aboard the ship and possesses extraordinary talent.At its heart, ""The Legend of 1900"" is a tale of identity, destiny, and the power of music to transcend boundaries. Tim Roth delivers a mesmerizing performance as 1900, capturing the character's complexity and depth with nuance and sensitivity. From his humble beginnings as an orphan discovered on the ship's piano to his rise to fame as a legendary pianist, Roth's portrayal of 1900 is both captivating and deeply moving.The film's narrative unfolds through the eyes of Max Tooney, played by Pruitt Taylor Vince, a jazz musician who befriends 1900 and becomes entranced by his musical genius. Through Max's reminiscences and flashbacks, viewers are transported back in time to witness 1900's remarkable journey, from his early days entertaining passengers aboard the SS Virginian to his epic piano duel with a legendary jazz musician named Jelly Roll Morton, portrayed by Clarence Williams III.Visually, ""The Legend of 1900"" is a feast for the eyes, with stunning cinematography that captures the grandeur of the ocean liner and the beauty of 1900's music.

Handy was a contemporary of JR Morton and they maintained a dispute for many yeard as to who 'invented' Jazz. The irony being CW III playing the role of his grandfathers' , by extension, adversary.Even better, it took 100 years for the irony to be realized.

He meets another artist, a trumpeter who gets hired aboard the same ship. They become colleagues in the ship's orchestra that entertains the voyagers.

At times the music takes over the visuals, as to the very powerful minimalism of a face of a woman backed by exquisite and subtle piano piece, to the other extreme, of compelling and dynamic visuals which move with the music, as when the whole ship rocks in the middle of a storm, while the pianist frenetically plays a full sized tail piano rolling across the ballroom, talk about rock and roll!!!

The man who tries to get him to leave and is his best friend is played by Pruiit Taylor Vince and he , for me, is the star of the film. I have critisised Vince before when i did a review of Nurse Betty but in this ,he is the star , even above Roth.

Richly rewarding character study,"Director Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso) has lovingly crafted a bittersweet story about life, music and the intricate weave of one upon the other.  Tornatore caresses the heart with characters steeped in emotion and sentimentality without descending into sappiness (okay, maybe just a little at the end).The setting is turn of the 20th century.  On New Year's Day, a baby is abandoned on an ocean liner and adopted by one of the crew members who names him `1900'.  The boy never leaves the vessel and crosses back and forth for his whole life.  As a child he learns to play piano and proves himself to be a genius at the instrument.The story is interesting by itself, but Tornatore brings incredible feeling to the tale.  1900 has an amazing gift of being able to put not only his emotions to music, but characterizations of others he sees around the room. All his pieces are impromptu and as original as the people surrounding him.Tim Roth is fantastic in the lead role, displaying extraordinary range.  He renders a believable pianist, but more importantly, he simultaneously brings the character dynamism and depth.  When he is playing the crowd he is the flamboyant showman, yet when he is alone or with Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) he is reflective and moody.Pruitt Taylor Vince also comes through with a strong performance as 1900's close friend and fellow musician.  Vince plays the part with great empathy and the interactions between him and Roth are often moving.  Clarence Williams III (yes, that's Linc from the Mod Squad TV series in the 60's) is electrifying as Jelly Roll Morton, the self proclaimed inventor of jazz. Williams steals the show for at least 15 minutes as he and Roth duel it out on the piano.The music is exquisite.  Ennio Morricone is a prolific composer whose career spans 40 years.  He has scored over 400 films including ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", ""The Untouchables"", ""Disclosure"", and ""Twister"".  His ability to find the right music for the multiple moods in this film is astounding.For viewers who enjoy complex character studies replete with unabashed sentimentality, this film is worth hunting down at the movie store.  I rated it a 9/10.  It is a richly rewarding experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
a character without a compelling story,"Max Tooney (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is pawning off his trumpet and recounts his life on an ocean liner with the legendary 1900. At the turn of the century, a baby is found by the crew of SS Virginian. There are no parents to be found and the crew raises him with the name 1900 (Tim Roth). He never sets foot on land and starts playing the piano. The ship brings immigrants and transports the wealthy. In wartime, it is turned into a hospital ship. It is now being demolished and Max pleads to have the work stopped until they find 1900.It wants to be a personal epic. However like 1900 himself, it feels like the movie is traveling a lot without getting anywhere. There is little drama and no tension whatsoever. It's an idea for a character but it lacks a compelling story. The sets are beautifully made and the movie looks good.

An overly melodramatic film that tries too hard.,"While the basic idea is thought-provoking, the film simply didn't convince me.  I wanted things to be less perfect, like the seasick piano scene - why not have them smash into a few walls for humor and added believability? Also, why were there no interesting anecdotes about how 1900 managed to stay on the ship his whole life?  It was too brushed-over, I felt.  And if Tim Roth was really in love with the land girl, why go through all of that if he's just gonna stay on the boat?  What was the point?!!  I think Tornatore put a little too much faith into the concept without developing it into a cooler, more believable tale.  It's not the worst movie I've ever seen.  I enjoyed the piano duel scene but that was about it.  I think the hokiness that I felt can best be summed up when Pruitt Taylor Vince's character says, ""I never forgot 1900...""

touching,"A long long film. In the end, the huge ship bursts into pieces , I felt a light , slight, mild or inconspicuous anguish in my heart, but sudden and short.The first scene of adult 1900, he walked into the ballroom, followed by the trumpet player. Sitting at the piano, he played beautiful music while the piano dancing on the ground. Startling graceful, this maybe the most accurate adjective to describe the scene, music, piano, dancing, pianist, everyone in that ballroom, even the awkward trumpet player. I think most audience would have the same feeling with me at this scene: 1900 is a different protagonist . With great talent for music , he brought so many amazement to people on that passenger liner as well as the audience, especially he competes with that so-called greatest pianist from shore, completely stunning! However, I feel the theme of this film is of sadness though I totally lost in the main idea people who create it would like to express. 1990 is afraid of the ashore life, maybe just like I am afraid of Hitchcock, Agatha . But it should be different, my fear comes from the thrilling scene ( maybe not thrilling at all in others' opinion) , the suspenseful plot or deep shadowiness of human beingIf I have not read a novel or watched a film like that, I would never know my scare at this, even it haunts me like nightmare when I am alone , I am still curious and willing to accept the ""horrible"" novel or film when it comes to me occasionally.Unknown fear of ashore life confined 1990 to the ship , in which he was raised up and played tremendously ""magic music"" . To him, land is even more terrible than death. Sometimes people like a fragile rose on a thin golden stem, delicate, exquisite but weak and helpless. Feeling makes human powerful , at the same time, it can destroy human 's outlook, hope and life.

I've loaned my tape out to dozens of people, whose reaction is all the same: one of the best films they've ever seen -- absolute perfection.I suspect that one day this will be widely recognized and regarded as highly as Citizen Kane and the other classics.  I doubt that any other director or any actor other than Tim Roth could have carried this off, but they have done an astounding job, and I only single them out as the major contributors. The other major players (there are only a few) were beautifully cast and delivered impeccable performances. The score, as everyone mentions,is superb also.This movie may be hard to find, but it appears occasionally on cable. Tape it. You'll be glad you did.

hats off to Morricone,"The Legend of 1900, the first English language film of Tornatore is an unbelievable story set in its own world. It is about a pianist born with gifted talent. Known as 1900, he never step his feet outside the ship where he was discovered first. Just like all the films of Tornatore, story is treated with special care. It begins just like a normal affair and then all the events one by one makes it stepping out of the reality. But even after being unrealistic at times, it never looses its virtue. Tim Roth brilliantly played his part with his stylish expressions and was supported nicely by Pruitt Taylor Vince. Overall it may seem little stretched but the film is filled with lots of beautiful moments. Cinematography is wonderful at times. And Ennio Morricone deserves the highest praise. His music plays a major part behind film's titillation. It simply stunned me at times. Piano duel between Clarence Williams III & Tim Roth's characters alone makes this film a must watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Fascinating voyage into a unique man's mind,"I finally got a DVD of this film, which never played in theatres here.  I was so stunned by its rich characters, atmosphere, emotion and subject, I watched it twice in one night.  This film is so intensely beautiful, it hurts.  It reminds me in some ways of ""The Red Violin,"" following a piano and pianist through the years.  Tim Roth's 1900 has a liquid face that tells us so much before he actually gets to verbalize his feelings about his life. The relationship between 1900 and Max is rich and satisfying.  The music is sublime.  Others have said there is too much dialogue, but I disagree.  The narration is economical and we wait so long for words from 1900, that when they come, you're grateful for every one.But mostly, the joy for the viewer is exploring the mind of 1900, a man of great depth, a skewed vision of the world and someone unlike anyone most of us ever know.  That's why I go to films--to meet unique characters who subtly alter the way we see the world.  Roth's performance is outstanding, as are those of every other actor in this film.  It's tragic that the film is marred by a really tacky model of the Virginian at sea and a deck set with items never found on the deck of any ship.  The interiors, however, are beautiful and the piano, costumes, extra casting and dock areas are all first rate.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the Top 100 FIlms of All Time - The Legend of 1900,"The Legend of 1900 is a special film; it is on my top 100 films of all time, and that is not easy to be listed on. It is the second best film project ever completed by the team of director Tornatore and film score creator, Morricone. It is second only to Cinema Paradiso, the greatest Italian classic film of all time. The lead actors and production values are topnotch and the script is absolutely impeccable.The story of a baby born and abandoned on top of a piano of a luxury liner on New Year's Day of 1900 is fascinating. He is raised on the ship by a 5th Deck (men who shoveled coal for the liner's energy) seaman for eight years, and then after the seaman's unfortunate demise, lives on his own, in the bowels of the ship. And there is more thing about him
He is the greatest piano player who ever lived.He is a master of the piano by age eight; and entertains the entire crew and passenger categories, from the poorest to the richest. He becomes part of the luxury liner band, and has several adventures during the numerous crossings of the ship. He even meets a beautiful girl, but does not pursue their relationship off the ship after she departs. The sea is his mistress; and he never abandons her.The primary motifs of this film are the piano and the ocean, as well as a good friend who blows a pretty mean horn, Max, played beautifully by Vince. Roth is awesome in his role; so much better than the performance given by the competent Jack Nicholson in As Good as it Gets. Roth wasn't even nominated for Best Actor! I guess Hollywood sticks to its own when it comes to awards. However, the opening motif, which is repeated a few times in various crossings, is also important. There is always one person, who in the early morning mist, while approaching New York Harbor, sees the Statue of Liberty for the first time, like an angel parting the clouds of upcoming democracy. ""AMERICA!"" the excited immigrant yells, and a roar goes up from the large crowd of immigrants on the deck as everyone faces the statue and the ship enters the impressive harbor of New York City. If that opening sequence does not move you, then you are someone I would not really care to meet.These scenes are accompanied by outstanding music, as are several other scenes in this classic film. As the protagonist explains, all things have a beginning and an end, and being confined to a small piece of land for him would have been a premature end to his existence. So he opts to live and die on the sea. Both the sea and the piano are eternal and unlimited in scope. This film is a must-see for any serious film buff.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A wonderful fantasy,"Perhaps a critic shouldn't be too critical of a modern fantasy, for thats what this movie is. The story is unique. The photography is compelling. The acting is top notch. The mood and decor are just about perfect. It's one of those films to be remembered. Nevertheless... >It would be impossible to fix a broken phonograph record as was done in the movie. >It is unlikely that a black, even one of Jelly Roll Morton's stature, would have been allowed to book first class passage on a steamer in the twenties. >The yo-yo as we know it was not invented until the thirties. Yet there is a reference to it in a scene set in the twenties. >The Royal Navy trucks supposedly in use in WWI were of WWII vintage. >The vintage of some of the movie cameras filming the piano ""duel"" is questionable. But despite these flaws, it's still an intriguing and memorable film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"a gem,no doubt about it....","I guess I just have to write something.I just can't help it. If memory serves me fine,it's been a while since last time I felt compelled to do the same thing- can't wait to gush,about the feelings that keep flooding my mind, and heart. This time,it's only after I watched the movie ""legend of 1900"". A truly remarkable, profoundly touching piece of cinema. Well directed,the scenes beautiful and emotion-laden, characters fully fleshed out and convincingly depicted. A job more than well done. Kudos to the crew and cast. But I think the thing that really reaches and touches the innermost recess of my tender heart, is not just the movie,the art form ,the vehicle that serves to showcase, but rather what's been told, what's been showcased, what's been revealed. In other words,It's the story that does it. I didn't know much about the screenplay and the writer thing,nor that I cared. I just noticed at the beginning of the movie,when the billing came up one by one,the movie is based on a novel ,by a foreign writer.I mean he is a Non-American writer.Perhaps a Spaniard or French.So the immigrant perspective and sentiments pervasive in this story(and movie,thanks to the wonderful director,who is also a Non-American director,by the way) are very much real,and make for a truly cinematic as well as literary success, in terms of how many hearts it touches and moves. For there's always something alien in this story, in the main character 1900,the seafaring pianist who refused to ever set foot on dry land,not even when the ship he was born and spent all his life on,Virginian,was about to be blown up to pieces.Not that only immigrants would be easily associated with such aberrations,it's just that it would feel more right if it occurs with a foreigner, an immigrant who is destined to be at odds with a whole new culture that is seething beyond the board, beyond the beckoning Statue of Liberty.I just fear such a brilliant, such a heart-breaking ,such a once-in-a-lifetime story would not be safe with a seasoned, sophisticated and native American screenwriter and director. There's always something they just can't get, that subtle vibe, that unique angle.Unless they are foreigners, they are immigrants, they see things differently,literally and figuratively. So it's a real good thing, for audience, and for the cinema history as well perhaps, that a foreign squad was assembled to get the story told in cinematic terms. Even The lead role,1900, was played by a ""foreign"" actor, Tim Roth, a Briton.I keep missing the point.I don't know why.I have no idea why I keep avoiding coming to the point. The point of what's in the story that grabbed my heart and squeezes my tear gland so damn hard.There's no beating around the bush now I guess.It's just me,I must confess. It's the way 1900 lived his life, viewed his life, chose to end his life that really struck a chord with me.Because I can feel 1900, because in a way I'm him, I'm like living in a ship of life, just like him. I sympathise with him,with what he has gone through;I'm saddened by what he's missed,what he's been denied- life's luxury,great love, a skyrocketing fame,given his stunning piano-playing skills;I truly relate to what he said at the end of the movie to Max, his only bosom friend on board(and assumedly,on land too),the trumpet player, the words he whispered in his characteristically mellow voice,with an air of confidence and ease fit for a Shakespeare play monologue, with a light in the eyes that could still an enraged lion, the words that really tugged at my tender heartstrings. I could only paraphrase.I may not be able to quote verbatim,but the gist is, life beyond the board is like a piano with infinite keys with it. A piano you can make no music on. A talented,nay,gifted player like him could only play(and alas,played so fantastically) on a piano with 88 keys. Once on land,he would find himself stranded, in the endless possibilities, infinite choices, and limitless temptations. He'd felt lost and he'd never be himself. He'd rather blow up with the ship. And he wished there'd be pianos in heaven. All of a sudden,I just got it,why I'm so moved by this movie. I'm 1900 in life.Every word he said has long been whirling in my mind and waiting to be formed.1900 did it for me,before I ever existed.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Beautifully Written,"This movie is absolutely everything a music-lover could hope for. OK, so I'll agree with the all the criticism that this movie has gotten. The acting isn't fantastic, the story may be a bit far-fetched... but one has to realize that the movie isn't entirely ABOUT any of those things. It is about the one thing it sets to describe... music.Music is clearly the centerpiece of this film. Not actually music itself (although there is quite a bit of good music in it) but rather the philosophy behind music. Music as an expressive art. Music as a descriptive tool. Music as a way to relate to life. Tim Roth's character, Nineteen Hundred's perspective on life is exactly his philosophies concerning music: he can make infinite things happen in a limited amount of space. Like in his last monologue... he can make infinite music on a finite keyboard... he cannot make any music on an infinite keyboard.If you want to see an A-class movie with A-class acting, you may be disappointed. But if you're looking for a beautifully artistic movie about the philosophy of music, this one deserves more than a 10 out of 10. I'd highly recommend it to any musician who loves music as more than audio noise; to anyone who sees life in music and music in life.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

A charming fable captured on celluloid,"I love music; I admire the work of Ennio Morricone. I love good cinematography and the Hungarian films of cinematographer Lajos Koltai have long appealed to me. It is perhaps natural that the first film I have seen of Guiseppe Tornatore that involves Morricone and Koltai should appeal to me.But in retrospect, the film grabbed me because the appeal of the film went beyond Morricone and Koltai. The performances of Tim Roth, Vince, Williams and Nunn were arresting. Roth's British accent at the end was annoying (who could have contributed that to 1900 when the character grew up on the ship?) but otherwise both Roth and Vince played very convincing roles. The casting is commendable--especially when some of the players are not very famous.There were certain sequences that Koltai and Tornatore can be truly proud of: playing the rolling piano on a ship swaying to choppy seas and the engine room sequence with Nunn and the child.Most of all, the marketing of the film as a fable, which it is, has its own charm. I particularly loved the song at the end of the film ""written"" by Morricone --or is it wrongly credited?-- and sung by Pink Floyd's ex-lead singer. Don't miss it as it captures the story in the song as the credits roll by.This is a very European film, which is probably the reason it has not been given the recognition that it deserves in the US. I strongly recommend this film to many of my friends who have not seen it. Tornatore, Koltai and Morricone weave magic together.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A metaphor for the movies?,"It's possible that 'cinema' (or ""the movies"") could be one of Tornatore's thematic preoccupations. Given that the director of CINEMA PARADISO made THE LEGEND OF 1900 at the time when cinema was celebrating its first 100 years, it is possible to read the film as a reflection on the state of cinema as it enters its second centenary.One can't say for certain. For the most part the film concentrates on telling its story. However, the scent of metaphor hangs in the air. Just below the surface lies a resigned nostalgia hinting that the ""greatness"" of cinema may be a thing of the past. Like a big old rusting passenger ship consumed by an indifferent ocean, the brilliance and splendour of cinema has sunk to the bottom of a sea of mediocrity. THE LEGEND OF 1900 suggests that cinema has been reduced to churning out repetitious and facile dead-in-the-water crowd-pleasers, one lumbering TITANIC after another, and it does so by being exactly that.There is a pivotal scene near the end of the film where Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) talks to the character known as '1900' (Tim Roth) within the rusted bowels of the abandoned ship (the worn-out wreckage of cinema). 1900 has never been on dry land. The ship is the only reality he has ever known, and he refuses to leave. As it creaks and groans beneath them, Max tries to convince him by describing the world beyond the vessel as a place of infinite choice, but he knows that 1900 will never accept the mediocrity of dry land (modern-day commercial movies). There is no place in such a world for the true artist. 1900 will go down with the ship (the discarded notion of cinematic art) rather than compromise his true nature.So, did Tornatore intend THE LEGEND OF 1900 as a denunciation of big-budget commercial Euro-puddings, cleverly making the film in the vacuous style of its worst excesses (i.e. criticising the likes of TITANIC by emulating them), or did he simply make a vacuous film? I suspect the latter. As one of the characters says, 'You're never really done-for as long as you have a good story, and someone to tell it to'. Maybe he meant to say, 'someone to SELL it to'.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"My 100th ""10""","So here it is, a landmark event, the occurrence of me finding my 100th ""10"" movie, as rated by the IMDB.There are movies on my list that would NEVER probably find their way onto those of the great critics. After all, for me, it's not about technical wizardry or having all the pieces fall into the right places. I've given 10s to movies that have flaws.

Everything comes down to how much the movie messed with me, how I went in looking at the world one way, and came out the other side with my brains mixed up. How now there are new colors in the world, thanks to this new perspective that's changed everything forever.THE LEGEND OF 1900, starting Tim Roth, and written and directed by one of my favorite directors, Giuseppe Tornatore, the man who made CINEMA PARADISO, is my 100th ""10"".

"Distinctive, Memorable Trip Into Someone's Floating Hideout","This quirky and memorable journey is not so much a story as a sensual experience, exquisitely filmed with several unbelievable but joyous musical sequences. The Legend of 1900 is a strange tale, for sure, of a piano prodigy who has never had a lesson, a man born and left on a luxury liner and, as the years pass, who fears leaving the safety of his safe haven. How much better to stay safely on the sea than venture out into what some might call The Real World!Many of the formal critics cringed at the film's immersion into sentiment, but that's part and parcel of this glorious evocation of the magic of music, an immersion in a never-was-but-wish- there-was--past. Several long talky sequences go on far too long for the film to be a unalloyed joy from start to finish, but this distinctive floating world is still a wonder if you don't expect guns and sex and rock and roll.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Worst Movie of All Time? Maybe not, but close.","Watching the film ""The Legend of 1900"" is by definition a trial of patience. Every aspect of the movie strains believably to its breaking point, to such an extent that you wish to watch a movie like ""Star Wars"", just so you can watch a movie without having to question the silliness of everything that happens.Like many movies that feature phenomenal music, not-so-bright people mistake that music for a quality movie. That is a shame. The music truly is exceptional, and is one of only two redeeming aspects of the film. The other is the acting of Tim Roth, who desperately attempts to pull this movie out of the depths it is falling into. But unfortunately, all of his acting chops cannot save this movie.The movie falls apart quickly - the eye-rolling begins at the beginning, with the unlikely discovery of the baby, and quickly turns to out-and- out groans when we find that the child has the magical ability to play the piano at a professional level without ever having touched the instrument or having been given any introduction to music, chord structure, formal training or any other aptitude building of any kind. Since the movie is built on this concept, everything that follows lacks any punch since none of it is in any way believable. By the time 1900 and Max are sliding around on the ballroom floor during a huge storm while deftly playing the piano, you'll likely have realized that this movie is pure silliness. That stuff works in anime movies, but not in films like this where the audience really needs to believe that the events depicted could have happened.The movie isn't helped by the terrible, terrible acting of much of the supporting cast. The awful Pruitt Taylor Vince hams it up to the best of his (meager) abilities, and every scene he appears is dragged down into boredom, eye-rolling, and laugh-inducing dialogue. I guess its no surprise when the co-star of the films only other notable role was as a patient on ""House"". Other than Clarence Williams III as ""Jelly Roll"" Morton, and Bill Nunn as 1900's adoptive father, there's really no other actors to speak of anyways (and applying that term to anyone in the film other than Roth is a stretch, to say the least).If you're able to stick this terrible movie out to the ending, you will have progressively been deadened time and again by the schlocky, pointless, unbelievable story to the point that the final ridiculous scene won't even surprise you much. Although when you think back on it, you'll find yourself chuckling to yourself and wondering what you were thinking by not turning it off earlier. And that's really where we get in this movie - Nowhere. Turn it off before it starts and you'll be happier.So its maybe not the worst movie of all time, there are movies like ""Plan 9"" and ""DeathBed"" which deserve that title more. But when a movie takes itself so seriously and comes off so pretentiously, as ""1900"" is wont to do, you really want to rank it below the movies that are worse, if only to punish it for its excesses. Watch something more believable, like ""Men in Black"", or ""Spy Kids""... or even ""Cars"". The idea of talking cars is so much more believable than this tripe.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

funny beyond belief with some fantastic acting,"this film rates in my books as a film that would be, possibly if not certainly, a future classic. this film is one of the most amazingly memorable films i have ever seen if a film can make you laugh and cry all in one hour it certainly passes my criteria with honours. however i did find some scenes just empty with nothing to them. in the way of production it probably rivals the titanic this film contains some fantastic scenes, the most enjoyable was the scene in the storm with the piano. just hilarious. i don't know why people dis-regard it so much. some scenes pull on the heart-strings, though it may down grade the movie a bit. but even with some weird scenes it is still a very good film worthy of an Oscar any day. i believe it shows sometimes even if you live life to the maximum and make the most of it, it will all fall down on you. friendships will be broken love lives will be lost and the most precious gift you can have, life, will be stolen. if there was a movie that simplifies friendship and life this would probably be it.

Born on a ship & lived on a ship!,"I saw this gem on IFC and I was happy to see others enjoyed this movie as much as I have. It's a quirky premise but so well-acted that you fall under its spell in a very short time. It's also beautifully photographed, btw. Roth is a first-rate actor and uses his skills to the fullest here.The one point I couldn't digest was the lack of loneliness displayed by 1900 (main character's name from his being born in 1900). Through most of the movie, he's obviously in his early 30s but never says a thing about his living in such isolation. Perhaps, as it's the only thing he's ever known, he just doesn't know what could be his in the outside world.., One of the highlights of the movie is the piano duel between the character acting as Jelly Roll Morton and 1900.

Very entertaining,"If one is willing to give great liberties because the movie is  a fairy tale with a message, then it is entertaining though overly long. One of the things I liked about the movie was that there was no nudity or sex or foul language only to discover that it was rated ""R"" for language. I watched it on the Bravo channel so I must have watched a cleaned up version. That was fortunate because if foul language had been used, it would have destroyed the fairy tale quality of the movie. During the period from 1900 to 1940 when the movie took place, foul language was rarely used and it would have detracted from the aurora of authenticity that made the movie go. Had I seen the foul language version I would have rated it much lower.But it is only an aurora and not reality. The ship, which was built before 1900, would have been out of service by 1920. Coal burning passenger liners were too inefficient to compete with the more modern oil burners, both in cost and speed, and the luxury lounge which was the center of the movie, would have been empty since anyone who could afford to travel luxury class would have travelled on the more modern ships.The movie needed to be shortened. One scene that could have been left out was the scene when Max and 1900 were careening around the ballroom while playing a piano during a storm. I don't think the scene added anything to the movie and it was too realistic. Anyone who has been on a ship in a storm would find the scene too unbelievable. In the first place Max and 1900 were sitting on a piano bench and the bench and the piano moved in synchronization as if they both connected, which is never going to happen. The much heavier piano is going to leave the bench quickly. Secondly, the piano gracefully swings around pillars. In reality that piano is going to go in a straight line until it crashes. Eventually it does but instead of traveling from side to side of the ball room it goes straight down the center of the ship. That would happen only if the ship made a 90 degree turn into the wind. But the whole point of the scene was to set up a conversation that Max and 1900 have shoveling coal as punishment. The movie did not have to go through that much of a contortion to set up the conversation.One of the best scenes in the movie is near the end when 1900 tells Max why he never left the ship. It was the highlight of the movie but took too long to get there.The scenes with Jelly Roll Morton were comedic and really part of a fairy tale because no black musician no matter how famous he was would have been allowed to mingle with the luxury class on either an American or British passenger liner.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

A stunning tribute to the imagination,"Director Guiseppe Tornatore and composer Ennio Morricone are the true ""stars"" of this movie. It is not often one is allowed the exquisite pleasure of two geniuses working in tandem. Anyone who knows the true meaning of creative power, or anyone with at least an inkling of curiosity as to the true meaning and potential of the human imagination should feast on this smorgasbord of inspiration. Tim Roth is unforgettable. Mélanie Thierry's enigmatic beauty, I'm sure, is also not easily forgotten. But I do think Pruitt Taylor Vince is miscast in this film.  He does an earnest piece of craftsmanship, but his interpretation of the character Max seems to me to create a dissonance in the movie that I could do without.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Potential magic falls flat,"What could have and should have been an absolutely magical tale got all tangled up in poor casting and the inadequacies of the writer/director. I would imagine, that if this movie was pitched to me, recommended to me, what have you, I would have nothing but positive notions. The story seems lovely (and is indeed, the strongest part of the movie), the characters, for the most part, wonderful creations, the setting and the theme and the music, all stellar. The delivery is lacking. Our narrator, Max, responsible for relaying the plot to us, the gentle audience, is supposed to be a likable creation, a chubby, cheerful, New Orleans jazz trumpeter. Instead, he's your drunk math teacher who talked to loud, or the uncle that smells and asks awkward questions and stares too long at your chest. At best, he's a Blues Brother...hardly a compliment in this case, for The Legend of 1900 is hardly a comedy, and Max isn't supposed to be a caricature. And so, this beautiful plot, the story of 1900 gets choked out through Max's double chin, and the beauty and poetry of the story on the boat is rudely interrupted by his spittle flying tirades and cheap Yankee colloquialisms. Further bashing 1900's face into the grit and the gravel is Tornatore's inability to convey to us the genius of 1900's music. Instead of any real emotion, he relies on slapstick dropped cigars and knocked off wigs to show us that the audience is impressed. Instead of allowing great music to speak for itself, he hammers it into our skull with flying sweat and notes so fast they could hardly be played by two hands...OH MY GOODNESS, LOOK AT THOSE EFFECTS, IT LOOKS LIKE 1900 HAS FOUR HANDS! It's as though he expects us to have no appreciation of music, no ear to hear what is beautiful without blatantly spelling out, letter by letter, just how may keys per second this man can play. Tim Roth shines, however. He too, it would seem, saw the magic and beauty of the story before it was spewed out by Tornatore. He is 1900. a complex and mildly insane character with a strong back story and a magnetic presence. His face and hands say far more than Tornatore's sorry words, that often work to disrupt the character's existence and hinder Roth's performance. But any ache in my heart at the end was due to Roth's skill and believability in this role, and his full assumption of the well-crafted character.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

TEN! thumbs up,"its very strange , cause such movies are not really my thing!but i saw the movie while i was surfing through TV channels , it was the scene where the two pianists were competing, from that moment. i got glued to the screen ;)a lovely ,wonderful ,touching story, touches the deepest deepest core of your heart and soul . it does not discriminate betweenmale/female rase/nationality .. etc. but effects one as a human being(individual). the story of the movie seemed very provocative , yet artistic. it slightly touches the tender area that we humans don't even want to think of. just like 1900 fingers played on that piano in a phenomenal way, his beliefs and ideas have played the same role on our beliefs and ideas. (existence and reason of life). the acting is more than fascinating. i loved every bit of it. actors were well casted, and the directing was perfect, not to mention the music, it was AMAZING. its a perfect movie.funny that at the end i just lost it!! i couldn't stop crying:''(in Conclusion, its a must see movie :)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One simple story,"This movie is not great. It's a simple movie, with a simple story and a simple main character - and thats what makes this film so good. It wasn't made to be great and big; it just want to tell the story of a man who was left behind and raised in the Ocean. He never set foot on land and that's the only  thing that makes him special. That and all its consequences. Visually the movie is beautiful and its a proof that special effects have nothing to do with a beautiful image - they are beautiful because you feel it. And it's a story that will make you want to meet the main character in person. The ending is wonderful and it's very well put (so hard to find a good ending these days). Tim Roth is excellent as 1900, but the two biggest actors in this movie are the ""ship"" and the ""ocean"". Both seem to have a life of their own. This is not only a movie that is worth to watch, it's a movie everybody should watch - it's the living proof that a movie doesn't have to be great to be good. In fact, it can be excellent. One last thing - the title in English is not quite beautiful as the original Italian one.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

A great understated performance by Tim Roth. The piano duel is a fantastic scene. I don't think I've seen anything like it before. The film SHOULD be famous for it.

It sneaked into release with hardly a sound. But those who find it will remember it all of their lives. Yes, it has imperfections, but then so does the Mona Lisa. This film led me into a musical exploration that hasn't stopped yet--an exploration of jazz piano music of the Jellyroll Morton, Fats Waller, Art Tatum variety. So I owe it a great debt, in addition to the gratitude I feel toward the filmmaker for creating it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Anyway, i appreciated also the fact that it's about common people, like all of us, not only looking at the shinning side of life but also presenting the troubles, the tormenting of this guy of genius, who just couldn't live otherwise that he could and feel.

I recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining departure from the usual fare. The music is wonderful, and it provides a glimpse into a life that is long gone... the twenties and thirties with jazz and cruise ships as the standards of life in that era.

Hard to find but worth your time,"By and large I don't ""get"" art and I don't ""get"" indie film.This movie is by far one of the best films I will ever see in my lifetime.Watching this movie is a heartwarming, bittersweet, and cathartic experience. It's friendship, panic, intimidation, comedy, and loneliness all independent of one another yet immaculately woven together. Portrayed so well by the actors that you'll be left in awe.The acting across the board is above average. Tim Roth surprised me with the some of best acting I think I've ever seen. The story has some very theatric and unbelievable moments but that's okay in my book. Joseph Campbell might have described this movie as mythic - more than true. It doesn't matter if it's true, inspired by a true story, or complete fiction. It's still an unforgettable masterpiece.I've tried to drop as many $0.25 words so that you understand how important it is that you see this.

An Entertaining Fantasy,"Although it is overly long and drags at times, I found the movie very entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the music. The cast is made up of no names who previously played only bit roles. It is a low budget movie but the scenery is usually authentic. Because the story is a fantasy, viewers have to overlook the unrealities. Such is how did 1900 learn to play the piano as well as he did without leaving the ship. My mother was a concert pianist and a music teacher and I learned to play the piano. To play a piano as well as 1900 required some extensive music lessons in order to master the keyboard as well as he did.I have to hand it to Tim Roth. He did a marvelous job of playing the piano although it is unlikely that he actually played the music.It was good enough that I watched it twice.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
What An Unexpected Delight!,"I have to confess that I had never heard of this film until I caught it on Sky one rainy afternoon and I was immediately captivated by it. It's very offbeat and kind of theatrical, but Tim Roth is superb in the lead role and I just thought it was a brilliant concept, beautifully executed. If it reminds me of any other film, I suppose it's Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon A Time In America' - it has a similar lush feel and the soundtrack is perhaps occasionally reminiscent of the work of Ennio Morricone - but it's certainly no slavish copy, it has a magical quality all its own. It looks as though quite a lot of money was spent on this project and I feel it's a great shame that it hasn't reached the wider audience it so obviously deserves. I'd warmly recommend this film to anybody who feels like being captivated for an hour or so. But be warned - you'll need your hanky for the end!Philip Caveney",10.0,Anonymous,Music
What's This!   The Legend of a Sinking Ship...?,"Seems a lot of folk that watch movies, have the mistaken view that if a film looks in anyway whatsoever 'different' it 'must' be good!. I'd imagine that '1900' must have made some members of the Italian fine Arts Council, and all those listed in the credits for pouring tons of money into this fiasco, want to hide themselves in the rest-room after the premiere. They must to this day, still be hiding the investment figures from any government auditors ~ following a massive $9 Million dollars, that returned less than $260,000.The version my wife and I watched was the international, running a seemingly interminable 123 Min's. To think that some poor souls overseas had to sit through 170 Min's is untenable. As it was, my wife kept asking how much longer can they stretch this ridiculously thin material? Perhaps the original Monologue by Alessandro Baricco (if it was short enough) may have held up, but as an overblown movie, not quite so.Director: Giuseppe Tornatore (and his bank-rollers) must have thought that after the success of 'Cinema Paradiso' everything he touches will turn to gold. But as this movies huge losses showed...all that glitters is not gold. And 'glitter' this movie does, big time. The sets are HUGE, but overdone to the point of being unintentionally unconvincing. Director of Photography: Hungarian born Lajos Koltai works hard, but the story and situations are simply so outlandishly foolish, that he can only attempt to add some visual saving graces. I would even go so far to say the word 'Fable' was added to the publicity as a last minute bid to salvage a complete wreak, following audience reactions.As a collector of Ennio Morricone soundtracks, I even found this score uninspired, as if he too knew this one was was doomed to failure.If you're easily pleased, and love 'Arty' pretensions, then you might enjoy this not entirely successful overindulgence. As with another film of director Tornatore; the very stylish, sex fueled, foul mouthed entry 'Malena'...I hope to never suffer either again. Maybe '1900' is OK for those that like to add their own depth to shallow fiction. It's also possible it might have been better if it had been given a way less excessive treatment ~ or even a better choice of stars (these look as if they're wondering if they've wandered onto the wrong set) it might then have come a little closer to working, but wouldn't hold out too much hope....",2.0,Anonymous,Music

The inside world and his running,"It is not a movie, it is only a slice of life. A Christmas tale with classical honey-cinnamon mixture, with the colors of fall and voices of angels. A legend of a simply travel around the life. But, in monologue and in movie remain the smoke of a nostalgic shadow. A symbol of ashes, a question of another time, a smile of a lost moment. The hero and his travel , his art end his fall, his love and his fear are only pages of the book who lives in each existence. It is a form of fight and a look in the miracle bones. It is the childhood happy in a very old winter. At first view, the director presents same story like in ""Malena"" or ""Paradiso"". The colors, the gestures, the music are pieces of a game with same rules. Tornatore, like everyone, has a personal truth. He said what he believes in the words and images but that truth has roots in every soul. Not a musician is the character, not a form of contemplation is the subject, not a time is the stage. Like Coelho, Giuseppe Tornatore presents, with grace, a world of basic ideas. Pianista may be Kafka or Kavafis, Shakespeare or Mahler. A human shadow who knows that this world is the result of his imagination. It is his dream and his way. His victim and his toy. The inside world and his running.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

If your spirit can't find the uplifting benefit in this film, I'd have to question your personal character, your outlook on life - or your moral turpitude.

Limited Boundaries on the Freedom Of Expression,"Giuseppe Tornatore's ""The Legend Of 1900"" is truly one of the best films to be released during the 1990's.

The boundaries of the life that 1900 (Tim Roth) has only can be reached by those who come aboard the ship he is on.

It had beautiful characters, elegant and inspiring music, and a story that was a psychological and musical thriller. Woody Allen would call it weird city, but it might as well have been written by him. It has the same melancholy tint and strange attitudes that make a Woody Allen film a classic. But to me this was better than all but a few of his movies.So all I ask is that you give this movie a chance. I cannot tell you why you should, but this is a story that could only be told in a movie.

As for me, the heavy-handed dialog, ""meaningful"" pauses and ""deep meanings"" made this one of the worst films I have ever seen.  The replica of a World War I vintage ocean liner was very good, however.One point, the initial timing of 160 minutes as contrasted with the actual time of 125 minutes, and the fact that the notes on the DVD box caution parents that the film shows a woman's breasts, while I did not see any, leads me to believe that the film was cut.

"a.k.a. ""The Legend of 1900""","This is an excellent film I first watched on the STARZ satellite network (via DIRECTV) a few years ago. At the time it was not available on VHS or DVD. Now it is.It's a gentle film, but often sad, about a child left by a First Class passenger aboard an ocean liner in 1900. The child is found in the ballroom by an engine worker and aptly named ""1900"". He grows up with the delicious ability to play music by ear (without sheet music).

I first thought the opening narration was corny, REALLY corny, but later I realized the director was telling a fable. The language is self-conscious: ""Gather round while I tell you a tale about a piano playin' lad who never set foot on dry land."" That sort of vibe. At times the film reminded me of ""Pippi Longstocking"" only with the production values of ""Titanic"". The black stoker who adopts the abandoned waif is a caricature, not offensive like the crows from ""Dumbo"" but along the same lines. I thought for a while the film might be good for kids. Orphans who are taken in and grow up to be great is one of the oldest mythic motifs, but the language is unpardonable! If they'd left out the expletives, this might've been a fable as good as ""Edward Scissorhands"". As it is, I don't know what market they were aiming for. A noble effort, but no.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Worst Movie ever seen,"Leggenda del pianista sull'oceano, La (1998) was the worst movie ever. The Italien-American music (Ennio Moricone, Lyrics by Roger Waters in the last song terrible !!!!) was the most cheesy ever heard. Sounds like a heritage of the crumpy italian writers like Verdi or Vivaldi or Donizetti. Terrible !!! The playing of the piano was really unmotivated, the idea to play it as fast as possible was typical for the American idea of playing piano.",,Anonymous,Music
The concerto of life,"If I could ajust the star, I would rate it beyond 10. As this is the best movies about life and the meaning of life I have ever seen, this one is even better than the legend Once Upon A Time in America. Everyone should watch it at least one time in life.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Watched it in year 2017. Loved it.,"I have this movie in my bookmark link for like several months. The title and the trailer of this movie didn't attract me at all. Because the title pretty much already told me there is no much contents in this story. It turned out I was right, yet a very simple story with overwhelming emotional moments. I fell in love to this movie in the first 10 minutes with its unique background of the character. If you have your own life-stories, you can resonate with the conversation. Unfortunately this is a movie for people who have really lived, enjoyed, and suffered. Probably very boring to many young people. I will definitely recommend this to people in my age. Not to mention the music is beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Makers of Titanic, Watch this and WEEP.","The Legend Of 1900 is the story of a boy found as a baby on a transatlantic liner on the first day of the new century. He grows up on the ship, and as an incredibly skilled pianist, out plays a legendary Jazz musician. But he will not leave the ship.This film is wonderful in many respects. It evokes the atmosphere of a luxury ocean going liner superbly and is beautifully filmed. Here end any comparisons with Titanic. The screen play is superb. The story is subtle, engaging, moving and intelligent. The makers of Titanic should watch this film, because it demonstrates how to tell a story on a ship, that is more remarkable than the ship itself. Then they should feel bad that their second rate film gained worldwide publicity, and this gem did not. Compare the 37000 votes Titanic has received to the mere 300 this film has received.The are also tremendously interesting themes running through this film, of our fear of the unknown, and the acceptance of the macrocosm into which we are born, for which the Truman Show was so notable.Altogether, a marvelous piece.

A Masterpiece,"I was buying groceries in my local store and they had the DVD of this on the shelf and I saw that the music was by Ennio Morricone and Tim Roth was in it and being a fan of both I thought I would give it a go.How pleased I was to discover a real diamond of a film, entertaining, poignant, funny, clever, there are just not enough superlatives for this film.Tim Roth is great and plays the main character brilliantly with support from Pruitt Taylor Vince (recently in The Mentalist) as his friend and Mélanie Thierry as ""the girl"".The music is excellent and even though it is obviously a low budget film the way it is filmed and edited along with the use of Ennio Morricone's superb soundtrack all blend to make a highly enjoyable and interesting film.Everyone I have recommend this film has said how much they too have enjoyed it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Looks beautiful, but thats about it...","Its hard to believe that the same person who directed the fabulous, Oscar winning film, Cinema Paradiso, directed this film.  While the 1988 Academy Award winning Italian film was a film set in reality, it's effect was magical and captivated me all the way to the very end. Legend of 1900, which in all respects is supposed to be a fable with elements of fantasy (such as Tim Roth playing the piano as if possessing four hands, or a scene where Roth plays the piano as it rolls around on the deck of a ship during a storm), it is firmly grounded in the mundane.The cinematography, costume, music and set design in this movie are truly great, and for all intents and purposes, the movie looks and sounds fantastic. However the ham-handed dialogue, uninteresting story, and messy editing really undercut this film.  Everybody in the film is trying in one way or another to let you know that this guy 1900 is truly a magical and unique guy.  They are either crowding around to shower praise upon him, or staring at him dreamy-eyed.  1900's best friend, Max, played by the perpetually twitchy-eyed Pruitt, latches on to 1900 and develops a strange, puppy-dog like idol worship.  He smiles and gazes at Tim Roth's character as if though he were some sort of latter-day Messiah -- but I just don't see it.  1900 is portrayed here as nothing more than a great pianist with a bad case of agoraphobia.  He comes off more as a coward than a hero.  The only reason why we know 1900 is a great man, is because the film bashes you over the head with this knowledge through heavy-handed, cheesy dialogue.Speaking of the dialogue, it was way too sappy, and felt extremely unnatural.  This might be due to the fact that this was Giuseppe Tornatore's first English dialogue film, however the speech and dialogue patterns of this film from the main characters to the extras and side-players all felt rather forced and over-the-top.  I was literally laughing at the scene where 1900 was trying to give his ""crush"" a record as she was disembarking (or being pushed-off) the ship.  I also found Pruitt's acting during the emphatic ""piano duel"" scene with Clarence Witherspoon III extremely reminiscent of Chris Farley as he throws a fit and eats paper. I love Chris Farley, but his style of acting doesn't belong in a film like this.There were times where I found myself bored and actually fast-forwarding through parts of this movie.  All in all, a good try by a great director, but this is a most definitely a miss.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie is absolutely pivotal,"I have been having trouble lately in choosing good movies to see using the IMDB ratings.  I had thought that the input of hundreds if not thousands of people would on balance reveal the quality or lack thereof.  The rating for this movie proves my assumption was wrong and therefore the movie is absolutely pivotal for me.  It tells me that there is no reason any longer to waste time at IMDB reviewing the ratings and user comments, looking for the top 100 of this and that type of movie.  It's about as reliable as those corny referrals at Netflix that once you see e.g. a French movie they think you want to see any French movie.  This movie is so pathetic that words don't serve me in explaining the depths of mediocrity it has reached while the readers write glowing reports and ratings to the tune of the current 7.5 out of 10.  Ladies and gentlemen this high of a rating is insane!  The acting is poor, the characters aren't developed, the story is clumsily handled and incoherent, the directing is god-awful, the music is utterly forgettable and the timing is dreadful.  For anyone here with an IQ of 100 or above, disregard this sleep-inducing, over-rated by IMDB users, sophomoric nonsense.",,Anonymous,Music
A movie that needs more than one viewing to fully appreciate,"What a great ""small"" movie. (Small only in the compactness of the story, the presentation and the performances) This movie has a wonderful authentic look...like stepping back into the heyday of the beginnings of jazz as an accepted art form and being one of the participants.The casting is superb. Tim Roth is so believable as this complex and talented character. Isn't it interesting that - in the end - we only exist in the memories of those who knew us? We are born without a name, we are molded by our environment and those closest to us, succeed (or fail) through our own efforts and strive to die on our own terms.I'm not sure that 1900 has a moral or a message - but - it does have lessons for all of us. Our life is our ""ship"". Where we sail, how we sail and with whom we sail will define us.The use of music in this movie is unique. When 1900 plays Silent Night after Jelly Roll Morton's first turn at the piano is the ultimate ""put down"". 1900 has just said: ""Beautiful - but oh so SIMPLE!) The duplication of the second number is the glove to the face.It's a shame this movie was not given proper promotion in the U. S..I can't wait to use the line: Here, you smoke it, I don't know how!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Could Have Been So Much More,"This flick is enthralling and makes you both laugh and cry. The original and risk-taking ""plot"" (maybe ""premise"" would be a better word) immediately engage the viewer. The photography is lush, the script jaunty and punchy and the acting superb. Either the rolling piano or duel scenes alone are worth more than many movies in their entirety. But the flaw of 1900 is that we are not given enough to justify 1900's decision to remain on the Virginian. This might have been accomplished by having more scenes with 1900 interacting with the the crew and passengers (instead of just espousing his unexplained insight regarding them). It would have helped immensely too if we could have learned why 1900 developed such passion for the piano, which could have been better developed as an allegory to his life. Please don't get me wrong. If this film had contained the features I desire, it may stand as one of the all time greats. But as it is its merely a wonderful, excellent film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

I will probably order the video so we can watch it again.It is one of the most finely acted movies I have seen and the music was wonderful.  It had a real 1900's flavor to it and you could just imagine yourself on this ship on your way to Europe with the fine dining and dancing, the stylish clothes and the wonderful piano playing.As others have said, this was the film I expected Titanic to be. We cared so deeply for the character 1900, in spite of his flaws, or perhaps because of them and by the end, we were moved to tears.We rarely watch today's movies...I, in particular, am devoted to the old movies...so I was glad to see that someone still makes a film with multi-level characters you can care about and an interesting storyline.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
It's the greatest feast of emotions,"The Legend Of 1900 is an imaginative story about a man who is born, lives his entire life, and dies on board a cruise liner. The man's full name is Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon 1900. He has a natural talent for playing piano and shows his infinite music by using the limited keyboard.The charming story is supported so well by the incredible music, the excellent cinematography, and the wonderful manner of storytelling, that I can't see The Legend Of 1900 as anything but a success in which almost had me moved to tears.While I'll admit that I'd be watching films all day, no film in my recollection had such an impact so quickly, that was, when 1900 is challenged by jazz great Jelly Roll Morton to a piano duel, he meets the challenge and annihilates Morton with a performance that left me shaking and yelling. What's more, I got lost in thoughts such as ""land represents for a place without boundaries, where people can get lost, a place without beginning or end"", ""does it really meaningful for us to chase the world not belong to our own?"" To be frank, that's a matter of debate. As to me, I will choose the same way as 1900. Also there are some words impressed me deeply. For instance, ""in all sprawling city there was everything except an end ""As my honest speaking, there is no boring moment from the beginning till the very end.

The concept was unique, the story captivating, the acting flawless, the score was haunting, the ship was glorious and hideous all at the same time, as you were carried through. I am half Italian by heritage, so I got pleasure out of reading more about how the film was made, finding stories about it on dedicated websites. Apparently the ship was a Russian vessel pretty much in a salvage state, used for training Russian seamen, when the Italian filmmakers found it, sailed it to Italy, docked it near Rome, and prepared it for the film. I loved that ! It was modeled after the Lusitania and the Mauritania...the ballroom was MARVELOUS,,,and the engine room was frightening ! Like in the Titanic, the classes are neatly divided,,,the richly rich and the very poor, living their lives as they sailed from one continent to the other, according to their state in life...with one exception...""1900"" himself..who lived his own life in his own way from beginning to,,,, There are scenes in the movie that took my breath away...and,no, I won't do spoilers here. You will just have to find the beauty, the joy, the poignancy, and the pathos in this film for yourself. You just don't see this kind of film every day.

"fantastic fairy-tale with a deep philosophical content, 10/10!","This film is a very original story about a piano prodigy, who is born on a ship, and will never in his life set foot on the mainland. In a crucial (and very emotional) key scene, he explains that the reason that he will never disembark, is that he can fully grasp the life on the ship, but he is very much afraid of the vastness of the outside world. The idea of all the streets in New York out there, and all the unknown possibilities and many new facets of life just terrify him, and he is willing to die instead of confronting potentially immense and incalculable consequences he isn't prepared (and most importantly, doesn't WANT) to get involved with.I strongly felt there was a clear parallel with the contemporary developments in technology and science, which proceed in a horrific pace. The enormous amount of information and data in our present world, the head-spinning inundation of bits and bytes makes life all the more complicated. It is truly dazzling, and more importantly, it could drive human beings with a sensitive nature insane.But apart from the rather pessimistic undertone this brilliant story renders, let's not forget that parts of the film are hilarious, like the surprisingly slapstick-like scene of the main character, yet again an impressive role of Tim Roth by the way, and the trumpettist played by Pruitt Taylor Vince, sitting together at the ""wave-stricken"" piano...Also, last but not least, the jazz-contest bit is haunting, thrilling, and in some weird way quite emotive.A magical, epic, and above all, AUTHENTIC masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

A tale tale on the high seas- musical and memorable.,"The film is about the legend of the man '1900' who was found as an infant on new years day 1900 under the piano in the ball room of a cruise liner. The film tells the tale of a man who spent his whole life on a ship. A man with no country- only sea, who spent his childhood in the bowels of the ship shoveling coal and became the legendary pianist of that same grand ocean liner. Without going into the plot too much- the film is fantasy (why I compare it to Big Fish) but not too crazy that it wouldn't be believable. The music, costuming, and sets are beautiful and although the acting isn't always great, the film as a whole is compelling. There are touching moments (1900 sees a girl) , moments of tension (The challenge by Jazz legend Jelly Roll Morton), and musical magic. My most memorable scene is when Max meets 1900 in the ball room on a stormy night with high rolling seas. The brakes come off the piano and 1900 takes Max on a musical ride.

Now on my top 10 of all time!,"""Legend of 1900"" is beautifully shot (by Lajos Koltai), amazingly performed (Tim Roth) and of course well-written and directed (by Giuseppe Tornatore). This film is exciting one minute and serene the next. A wonderful lead character with a talent to watch and be made speechless by. Highly recommended for anyone in need of a step back from life. The day after viewing I purchased the DVD and Soundtrack and having been enjoying it since. The Duel scene is branded in my mind forever.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A hauntingly beautiful film,"My husband and I attended a free preview showing of this film in 1999 with other members of the D.C. Film Society.  Just two days ago, we found a DVD release of it and were quick to snatch it up.  In the period in between (3 years) we were surprised that it didn't get a more notable reception on the independent film circuit.  The skillful cinematography made some of the scenes-- with the workers in the belly of the ship, the narrator's ""getting his sea legs"" scene with the piano in the ballroom, the dual between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton, and others-- so memorable that seeing it again was like homecoming.  Although the narrator was a less than stellar choice and the ""romance"" was eye-rolling bad, I recommend this for any collector.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The Legend of 1900 - An obscure gem of a movie!,"This one passed under the radar of even the most discriminating American movie audiences, but is well worth seeking out.If you were partial to movies like Cinema Paradiso, Life is Beautiful, or any of the other contemporary gifts from the Italian cinematic industry, you'll love 'The Legend of 1900'. It's a must-see for music lovers as well. Wistful and nostalgic, yet achingly appealing, it embodies every road not taken and beckons us to live every day as if it were the last.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent movie!,"The Legend of 1900 is an epic story of a man who lives his entire life within a ship, but also a story about music, hope, friendship, passion, and despair, and about the fear of facing the unknown.The story takes place mostly on board of The Virginian, a luxurious ocean-steamer used to take Italian immigrants to New York, and is told through the memories of a trumpet player who is the main character's best friend.On the first day of 1900, while carefully searching the first class after anything of value, Danny (Bill Nunn), an employee of the ship, finds a newborn baby in a box on the piano. He keeps the boy secretly hidden, and calls him `Danny Boodman TD Lemon Nineteen Hundred', 1900 for short. Eight years later, after Danny's, death, the boy finds the piano and plays incredibly well, much to everyone's amazement, becoming the pianist of the ship.Several years later Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) joins the ship's orchestra. On his first night there is a storm and he becomes terribly seasick. 1900 (Tim Roth in a great performance) approaches him and invites him to sit by his side at the piano while he plays. As the waves rock the ship and the piano slides around the ball room, 1900 doesn't even seem to notice and continues to play. They end up crashing into a glass wall and into the Captain's cabin. This is on of the best scenes of the movie, and the beginning of a strong friendship.Once, while playing the Tarantella for the Italian immigrants, someone spots the Statue of Liberty and they all run to see, leaving 1900 alone. More than once does Max try to convince him to get out of the ship and feel the new experience, but 1900 seems to fear the unknown, and stays inside.Nineteen Hundred shows an amazing skill in the piano, being able to play any kind of music. His music truly comes from his heart, considering that he has never learnt how to play. While playing in a ball, 1900 suddenly changes the rhythm of the music, according to his impressions on each passenger. He appears to understand everyone's soul.His fame quickly spreads, and even the father of Jazz, a proud man called Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III), goes on board to challenge him on the piano. 1900 does not take the challenge seriously at first, but after a while he finally plays with passion, so brilliantly that everyone listens in absolute silence, almost paralyzed, and even the Jazz whiz becomes astonished. It is Max's best scene, as he (who has bet a whole year's salary on his friend 1900) goes from despair to ecstasy.Because of 1900's refusal in leaving the ship, a recording is planned to take place there. As he plays, he notices a young woman observing him. Inspired by her youth and beauty, he composes the sweetest song ever made, but when told of the success and fame he will surely achieve, 1900 fears the possibility of leaving the ship and decides to keep the record from the world.Finding himself in love, 1900 becomes determined to offer the record to the girl who inspired it, but fails as she disembarks, leaving him behind. After a long period of loneliness, 1900 announces his decision of leaving the ship, surprising the whole crew, but changes his mind and returns before even touching the ground.Years pass by. Max leaves the ship and they lose contact. Several years later Max goes into a second hand music store to sell his old trumpet and runs into 1900's record. He becomes aware of the ship's fate: it is ready to be blown up. Max narrates 1900's story as an attempt to save him, for he has no doubt of him still being on the ship. He is finally allowed to search inside The Virginian, and finds his lonely friend there, but is unable to convince him to leave the condemned ship.The last dialogue is very touching. 1900 tells Max the reason why he never set forth to leave the ship. Opposing the piano, which is a concrete element with a definite size, the land is never-ending. 1900 is afraid of the abstract, of whatever he cannot control. While on the ship there are few options, on the streets there are infinite possibilities, and 1900 finds this insane. Land is a ship too big for him to control. He finally states that, as he doesn't exist to the world, the world will not exist for him. Deeply sad, Max leaves the ship without his friend.1900 is portrayed by Tim Roth, who fits so well in the character that it is impossible to imagine someone else in his place. 1900 is an enigmatic pianist whose world is the ship where he has always lived. He has a natural and extraordinary talent for music, but is refrained from leaving the ship by an unconscious fear of exploring new horizons. We learn about 1900's legend from his best friend Max, a chubby trumpet player who refuses to accept his reluctance to step in dry land. He constantly brings up the subject, but does not succeed in changing 1900's mind.The sets and costumes reveal a meticulous reproduction of the beginning of the twentieth century. The music is delightful, and without a doubt the highlight of the movie. The sound effects are perfect, particularly the wind and the waves, sounding like a real ship. The direction also contributed for the great quality of the film: the scenes are harmoniously presented, and it is almost possible to imagine ourselves as one of the immigrants as they see the Statue of Liberty for the first time. In fact, the first scene is a masterpiece, setting the mood for the rest of the movie.The Legend of 1900 has certainly surpassed my expectations, turning to be an interesting and captivating movie, for what I truly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

A beautiful film to both see & hear.,"Once upon a time a wonderful film was beautifully crafted and the most exquisite music lovingly composed and perfectly played. How sad it was so sparsely seen on the big screens of the world, perhaps as it makes the cable circuit on our smaller screen more people will be able to see it and love it as I do. Many who are lucky enough to see it will certainly want to add it to their collection on VHS or DVD. Suspend your rational thinking, turn up the sound and let this film take you away to grand time on a grand ship full of unforgettable scenes and endearing characters. The amazing Tim Roth gives a fine performance as 1900, with the naivety and innocence one would expect of a person who has spent his life on a ship and has no real life experiences other than by observance of ever changing passengers who he grandly entertains. Pruitt Taylor Vince is perfect in his role as 1900's friend and the narrator of the story. Every actor seems perfectly chosen for their roles.

Live mismatches the world again,"It's no wonder about the story character: T.D. bored in an improper way again. Improper boring place and time let such genius to be in inevitable destiny.As there was a period of US imagination from Europe, most of the people had a mind set that the dream to New York indicated a pathway for wealth. However, it's make a strong contrast of such infinity desire, seems no one revealed that it let them to fall in a nightmare rather than a sweet dream. Only those elites (actually T.D. was named as 1900, also implied the Caucasians were so superstitious even after the period of enlightenment) were sober enough and not be chanted.What T.D. experienced and then achieved to be a legend, was about how to overcome those temptations, in which there were 2 life crossovers, determining he would be an ordinary or extraordinary.First, he was so calm to regard reputation and wealth, knew that success was not be measured by such a way. It was a memorable competition with the Musician: Father of Jazz, who was noted and rich, while compared with T.D. and Max (no one knew such hidden guy, and Max was so poor who sold his trumpet later), people should regard the anterior to have a recognizable identification. However, a Black suffered the impact so shocking, after being defeated, was due to his previous ""success. Without an extreme attention on the power and reputation, he knew ""no one will be number one all the time"", and hence got a positive feedback from the interflow with T.D, rather than treating it as a competition.The other incident was am barrier that everyone fails in it: Love. Many philosophers have mentioned before that Love could not be explained reasonably when someone falls in it. The involver will be very confused and does various silly thing until they have been escaped. In the case of T.D. he was definitely fell in love, but he could still defense for his personal living principle. Only passing such hard tests can be promoted to a holy level in the life. (notice that in ""Cinema Paradiso"", Love was highly admirable and it was worth scarifying a lot by accomplishing it, such contrast made in ""The legend of 1900"", probably being intended arranged by the director and producer.Although the destiny of T.D. was so unfortunate, it was colorful and meaningful to others. His last joke told to Max, clearly concluded a ridiculous world: he said if he was broken after the ship explored, can let his right arm connected back, but may mis-attached on left shoulder, made him to be abnormal. Such indication about the mis-match of his born and growth on the marine and abnormal (even as a genius) was not valuable, he would rather to be ordinary and live on land, like normal people: marriage, organizing a family with children, no surprise of such live but worth living..Finally, I want to point out those scenes' that impressed me most. The initial one was the performance of T.D. versed the Jazz Musician. The magic playing of T.D. was presented in various cut-in between his face, the piano keys, chord, and his multi-hands. His sweating was also be charm in such a way. With the aid of the semi-dissolving transition, as well as the cut-away shots of the response, gestures of those audiences (include the musician), such excellent magic was shocked by twice in our eyes.The other scene was about T.D. landing. When he got ready ashore, the freeze medium close up was stable, peaceful, without any background music. Such silence let T.D. made a crucial decision. Then he threw away his hat implied abandoning those mind set (i.e. human desire when facing such a highlight city), he would be chanted by a material world, and what he hardly got: love with girl. The director tried to minimize any effects on that scene, whilst was unforgettable for most of the audiences, like me.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

It is touching, beautiful, moving, and amazing. It is just amazing. It is pure art. It's fairly long but well worth every moment. It's relatively hard to find, but it is well worth purchase.

My personal No.1 film of all time,"The Legend of 1900, is my No. 1 film of all time, and I've seen a lot of great movies. I really can't pinpoint exactly why I love this movie so much, but I think its partly because the characters are all so well formed, and easy to relate to and sympathise with. The director, Guiseppe Tornatore, was also my favourite director for a few years after. I saw this for the first time when I was 9 on a plane from the UK to South Africa, and I was just peering at it awkwardly between the seats in front of me. Being a typical 9 year old then, once I had seen the trailers for the films showing on the flight, I was very disappointed. This really didn't look my taste (or any average 9 year olds taste,) but for some reason, it absolutely blew me away, and from that night on, it has been my top film of all time, and thats for over 7 years now. I'm not going to say anything more except Pruitt Taylor Vince is superb and Tim Roth spectacular as 1900, and that the music is just incredible (won the Golden Globe for Ennio Morricone.)

A very beautiful and powerful movie,This movie is truly remarkable. I was amazed that such a powerful movie made such a small impact in the media.  Tim Roth is very talented and deserved much more recognition then he received.  The movie should be released again and marketed properly. I hope that because it is being released on Video in Canada that people will watch this very unique movie and give it the recognition and attention that it should have received when it was first released.The movie touched the hearts of all those who watched with me.  One formed a strong empathy with the lead character known as 1900.  We are left with one question that remains to be answered and debated.  What would you do in 1900's situation if you could choose his fate.,8.0,Anonymous,Music
Beauty,"When watching The Legend Of 1900 for the first time I was amazed. This film is made with beauty. Tim Roth's best work to date, he plays 1900 fantastically.This film isn't just about 1900 and his story it's about the music. It's about how the music can be the sound to anything, beauty, sadness, evil and love.The score to this film is beautiful. When we see 1900 play the piano whilst watching the girl through the window, it's like a window into 1900 we see exactly how he feels for the first time.The duel between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton is definitely the highlight of the film and it managed to make me laugh and then cry.I didn't want this film to end, I thought there was a lot more to see about 1900. The way the story is told by 1900's best friend is great and gives us a good insight into 1900's character and also leaves us wanting to see more.'You're never done for if you have a good story and someone to tell it to'",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Worth seeking out,"It would be wonderful if this movie eventually finds its way into the multiplexes, the way Life Is Beautiful did last year.  But somehow I doubt it....the studio seems to have little hope for it because of its overseas reputation.  A shame because it's yet another fine addition to 1999's list of thoughtful, challenging movies.  It is inevitably being compared to Titanic, if only because of its setting (ocean liner in the early part of the century).  The film has more in common with Fellini than Cameron (viewers who have been disgusted with the film's visuals and sentiments seem to have forgotten why we go to movies in the first place).  The scenes are slightly surreal and always fascinating.  The delivery of the dialogue is a bit stilted, especially by the actor who played Max, but Tim Roth is a talented actor and makes the most of it (especially during his final, impassioned speech at the end).  No surprise that this was made by the director of Cinema Paradiso.  Both films are presented primarily in flashbacks, both have a romantic feel, and both deal with an amazing, unexpected friendship.

Good  move! Why have I never heard of it?The musical score is incredible it is a mix of classical and jazz, including a lot of Jelly Roll Morton and I think some Scott Joplin.Roth plays the adult character of a boy born and abandoned aboard a transatlantic liner in 1900 who plays piano exceptionally.

Tornatore's finest film to date!,"This is one of those rare films, which mesmirize you so much that you actually feel sorry to leave the theater and wish the story would not end so soon. I watched it breathless and when the credits started rolling I still longed for more magic and were ready to start watching it all over again right away. Like a true film gourmet I wanted to indulge in the exquisite treat for as long as possible, enjoying its every small tidbit.Needless to say, that art direction and cinematography are perfect as they always are in Tornatore's films. They duly impress you with beauty and grandeur.Oh, the music score! I can't find proper words to describe it: fantastic, awesome, gripping or even better than those three together, written by Ennio Morricone, the guru of film music! Pay attention to how aptly it matches the scenes in the film. In fact, the music is one of the main characters in the story too.As for the story itself: well, it can call forth different feelings and interpretations. The story of a man of genius who prefers to confine himself to the small world of a cruise ship and the ocean can induce many a Freudian-like rationales from psychoanalysis aficionados. But it won't leave you feeling indifferent for Tim Roth's fascinating character who combines talent and unpretentiousness, passion and insight into people's souls - the qualities that are the marks of true brilliance.The directing holds you captivated for more than two hours, letting you savour quite a number of memorable finely orchestrated scenes. My favourite is the piano duel between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton. In this episode small nuances help masterfully create the growing suspense, which is one of the best I've ever seen in the movies.The acting is superb! You can't help but appreciate perfect casting and a slew of outstanding performances. The actors don't act, they live on screen. Now Tim Roth completes the trio of my favourite actors along with Sean Penn and Al Pacino.This film and Tornatore's second best ""Cinema Paradiso"" are my personal favourites and I highly recommend them to you:Don't miss the feast of emotions!

The adaptation is great and sceneries and characters are almost exactly what I imagined during my reading of the book.

The direction is good, as well as the screenplay that is very close to the book to the point at which some dialogues are exactly the same.The two main issues I had are related to the length that is a bit felt and the CGI that unfortunately shows its age.

Story about a genius,"This is a really old film, produced in the last century. When the time went by, the heat of the film rose again and during that period, I got the chance to see this film.The story is about a man born on a ship, who teaches himself to play piano and becomes a piano master. During his lifetime, the pianist hasn't left the ship. The film shows his life through the perspective of his friend, a worker on the ship.This film portraits a complete genius, all the action of him, the words he says all reveal the sense of talent. Since this is a film about a pianist, there're lots of music in this film. And they all reveals a taste of the last century. The actors also do a good job in this film, especially the one that performs the pianist, his performance is a good illustration of a jazzy master pianist.If you are a fan of biographical film of very fond of musical, you definitely gonna love this film.

An unique experience,"How does one explain what his soul feels ? how does one explain the feeling you get when waking up from a beautiful dream ? The one who could do that could also explain this experience that is called The Legend of 1900, I lack the words but I will try ...The movie in a nutshell is extremely simple, it tells a story about a child who was abandoned on a liner, the Virginian, that sails between Europe and America, and how he grew up in the bowels of this steel giant he called home, it tells the story how he found music, it tells the story how he embraced the music so much that he in all practical sense became one with it. It tells a story about a man who never left this ship he called home, who saw the world pass him by 2000 passengers at the time. You could call this movie a fable, an extremely beautiful insight to someones soul. The execution of this movie is flawless, Tim Roth and Pruitt Taylor Vince give excellent performances and Clarence Williams III is most glorious in his portrayal of Jelly Roll Morton, a pianist who supposedly invented jazz and comes to challenge 1900 to a piano duel. Director Giuseppe Tornatore and cinematographer Lajos Koltai weave an utterly beautiful world where the story takes place, the visual beauty is unmatched, it's just astonishing. One way to enjoy The legend of 1900 is to turn the picture off and just listen, Ennio Morricone's music is an essential part of this movie and is one of the most beautiful pieces of music in it's own rights. The director does what very few have done before, all the pieces fit, perfect visuals, stunning music, superb cast, infact I would go so far that I would say I cant find anything wrong about this movie, except it ends.Granted that this is not a movie for persons who enjoy action and big explosions above anything else, but anyone who can watch this piece of cinematic genius with an open mind will encounter something really special.One of the best movies of 1990's if not the best.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Fantasy perhaps?...perhaps not.,"The premise of this movie intrigued me. A man born on an ocean going vessel who lived there all his life? And became a piano virtuoso as well? A bit far fetched, but worth investigating. Tim Roth's character (1900) is enough to keep your interest alone, but the setting of a luxury cruise ship and the early jazz era time period only intensify it. While no scene is without merit, there are several which will move you or make you stand still, as with the Jelly Roll Morton sequence. I am only sorry that this movie came out about the time of ""Titanic"" as it would have taken a few of the awards that year itself. When watching this movie, keep in mind that legends are only that if they are bigger than life and there is no one around to verify the facts.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
two and a half cheers for 1900,"The poet Tennyson wrote that ""all experience is an arch through which gleams that untraveled world, whose margin fades forever and ever as I move."" Everyone chooses how big a world to live in, what archways to pass through. Some people never leave their home town, others travel the globe. The protagonist of this story chooses to live out his life aboard the ship he was born on, traveling the world, albeit inside an iron shell. His reasons for refusing to leave are eloquently articulated in one of the final scenes of the film. ""1900"" is a sort of Holden Caulfield, his sensitivity seemingly too refined, too delicate to venture out among the trammeling horde. Aesthetically, this film has it all, great music, decor, imaginative staging, fine acting. Each viewer's gut philosophy will prompt him or her to cry or cheer at ""1900's"" decision to be blown up rather than pass through Tennyson's arch of experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The Legend of 1900My Rating 8.5 /10I'm amazed that I haven't reviewed one of my favourite movies of all time Cinema Paradiso written and directed by the great Giuseppe Tornatore I will rectify that in the near future when I receive the Directors cut which runs for 2hours 54 minutes.I was struck by the many similarities between Cinema Paradiso and The Legend of 1900 .Both movies beautifully portray a child's journey to adulthood both end with the demolition of a condemned structure and both feature an incredible score by one of Cinemas greatest composers Ennio Morricone .The Legend of 1900 made 10 years later than Cinema Paradiso is a lesser known movie that has gained more critical acclaim since its release in 1998.I don't think it's as great as the 1988 Cinema Paradiso which In my opinion is faultless perhaps because my own early childhood is reflected in Giuseppe Tornatore beautifully crafted story.The Legend of 1900 also captured my imagination and the extraordinary sets decoration and costumes perfectly portrays the glamorous age of luxurious ocean travel during the era of Titanic beautifully.The Legend of 1900 is a fascinating fictional tale with an ethereal almost fantasy atmosphere and some may question the possibility of a human being never setting foot on dry land but I understood this character.In fact I thought of our cat that has lived a wonderful life indoors never venturing out to a hostile world.The movie begins with the discovery of an abandoned baby left by his mother on a luxurious ocean liner .The baby is discovered by Danny Boodmann a stoker on the American liner SS Virginian he names the child Danny Boodmann T. D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred '1900' and raises the child as his own until his death in an accident on the ship.With no birth certificate no name no identity the young child 1900 is adopted by the crew and grows up on the liner .It soon becomes apparent that 1900 played by Tim Roth as an adult is incredibly talented in fact a musical genius .1900 Danny is befriended by a trumpet player in the ship's band, Max Tooney.After several years on the ship Max leaves, and tells the story of 1900 to the owner of a music store.There's a fabulous scene where actor Clarence Williams III who plays the legendary jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton hearing of 1900's reputation boards the SS Virginian and musically duels with the young pianist.The interior sets of the SS Virginian are fabulous and a credit to the design team and cinematographer Lajos Koltai.This is such a touching and emotive legend told with great affection by trumpet player and storyteller Max Tooney played by Pruitt Taylor Vince .The conclusion is heartbreaking but strangely understandable and left me with many unanswered questions which may be answered in the Directors cut.The Legend of 1900 is a long movie the Directors cut is 2hours and 49 minutes I watched the original theatre release which is 125 minutes but I've ordered the 2019 longer restored version and can't wait to see it .An interesting footnote there was actually a registered ship named the SS Virginian which was built in 1904 and scrapped around 1954.The SS Virginian also had a vital part in the Titanic disaster in April 1912 as she was reported near the vicinity of the sinking and within radio contact.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The best film ever that inspires you,"""The Legend of 1900"" is the truely an inspiring movie. Since I am a musician myself, the film has givin me a reason to keep going of my musical dreams and also teach me something about life. Tim Roth gives a brilliant performance as he demonstrates the talent of the character he is playing. I promise you that this movie will leave you in a state of shock of how a great movie like this has surfaced.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Spaghetti western with piano's not guns,"The movie is a fun, riveting story that picks you up and takes you on a journey. The destination in this case is as important as the journey.Tim Roth et Al, give solid performances. The music is absolutely great, Ennio Marconni does a superb job as usual.The plot is certainly not one of the 'usual six' that one sees repeated. Boy meets Girl, boy plays the piano is as close as it gets.I could go on to describe how good this movie is but, the aspect i will choose to comment about is why this movie didn't do better. I don't understand it. I can only assume that there Hollywood politics involved. The movie isn't of the 'Best picture Oscar' calibre, but it certainly isn't worthy of being ignored and forgotten. My suspicion is the movie was accepted well due to the fact it was a foreign production (Italian) and Hollywood has a hard time accepting their own movies let alone a foreign production.Well worth the price of a DVD, let alone a rental fee. I did have a hard time locating it in the stores. Don't give up !",9.0,Anonymous,Music
One of best movies ever,"Tornatore is a genius. As all of his movies ,this one is excellent! It is a light and poetic fantasy about a fantastic pianist raised in a ship and that had never got out of it. Raised and educated by a rude but sensitive sailor, living since the balance of a cradle to the balance of the ship, he learned piano by himself and became a fantastic piano player entertaining travelers while his fame spread out to the shores. Some scenes are unforgettable as playing the piano in a violent storm and many others. The story, narrated by a musician that played with him and due to though times has to sell his loved instrument to survive. A must see movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Gem!,The scene of the waltzing piano in the ballroom alone is worth the price of admission. What a wealth of stories are packed into this unassuming but glorious package. I do not understand why movies such as this one go without accolade. An Italian made beauty. If you haven't seen it - go out and rent it today.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
incredeble film,it's been a week since i've seen this wonderful movie and i can't forget it. one of the most beautiful films i've ever seen. a movie that makes you think about life and dream about music.

My favorite movie of all time,"This movie changed my life when I was a little kid.I don't know, there is something in it that capture me every time I watch it, even today. I think that you can fell a lot of magic from it. Sometimes it seems that you're reading a book, while you're watching it.The cast, well... is perfect for this movie: it helps you with the atmosphere of the whole story, and Tim Roth is really great, showing that he can be a wonderful actor in any role.I think that everyone should watch this, at least once, and try to absorb all the magic that it can transmit.Just a great masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Simply a stunning movie with an incredible score,"A wonderfully well crafted movie.

"Unique, Brilliant, and a Joy to Watch","This movie absolutely did not get the attention it deserved when it was released. It has just about everything you could want in a movie... laughter, tears, romance, and even a bit of edge-of-your-seat action. The actors are amazing, the plot is unique, and the music is out of this world!!

"Beautiful, moving","I am rarely moved to go out and find the DVD of a film I've just seen, however, I will be buying this one. Like many other commenter's, I stumbled across this work of art while channel surfing (I missed the first 20 minutes or so), and was immediately captivated.The movie is ROTFL funny (the 'jazz-off'), moving (the girl, the music), and insightful. Tim Roth was inspiring as was the music which absolutely deserved the Golden Globe Best Score. Tornatore succeeded in drawing me into the life of this ship and the heart of this gentle and charming man.

Legend of 1900,"When you consider this was, I believe, made in the same year as Titanic but only on a budget of nine million dollars as opposed to 200 million, what stunning achievement. What a great story, a man who didn't exist and in the end a sad ending. I think one of the greatest surprises was Tim Roth actually playing. I used to be a pianist on three cruise ships and faking playing like that is impossible. The music is wonderful, Morricone never fails for me and the scenes were lush and truly grand. In a lot of ways I think this movie is far superior to Titanic. Due to the sometimes salty language it can only be for adults, that said I would recommend it to anyone, good solid entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
An absolute jewel!,"The depth and beauty of this film cannot be explained in just few words. It's a delightful spending of time and it haunts you after. It's such a masterpiece from so many points of view that it's difficult to describe it in detail.Tornatore's genius combined with Morricone's music - what a piece of art! And the cast is just great -it's the first time I enjoyed Tim Roth in angelic character, what a surprise!What a pitty cinema has degenerated to what's become nowadays!A quarter of century later it still remains an absolute MUST see!( I can only think about two other films that have passed the test of time: Amadeus and Cabaret)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Same as everyone else,"My experience with this movie was very standard,and it might be a good resume for 90% of the people who saw it:-film is aired on cable channel-me see title ,me not attracted-me watch the beginning of the movie out of curiosity ,expecting to go to bed early-15 minutes after,me is hooked-film ends,me look around to see if nobody saw me crying and wonder when I'll go and buy myself a copy of it.I didn't think I would say that one day about a movie ,but this is simply the most beautiful movie I've seen until now.And I'm not a sissy,believe me. The kind of movie you'll talk about to your children,really.Some of the most beautiful scenes ever made for the cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The most underrated on IMDb I can think of..,"It seemed that this movie is rather inconspicuous in America. However, in my country, China, it received its due credit. It's somehow very much appreciated by Chinese fans, even more than the Godfather. A friend of mine was a pianist, he was recommending this movie to me all along. I watch the beginning and found it interesting, but my schedule hindered me from watching the whole movie. Yesterday I caught a glimpse at the TV show Lie to me and found the exact actor on that show: Tim Roth. The show really reminded me of this movie so I decided to watch it. I'm glad I did, and I regret leaving the DVD aside for so many years.The movie was about a child/prodigy, left on a ship by an supposed immigrant family, was adopted by a stoker. From the stoker, the boy established the notion that the ship was everything to him{(everything outside the Virginian is bad). Tragically, the stoker was later killed in an accident, leaving the boy an orphan. Being on the ship long enough, the boy fostered a great interest on piano. By watching the pianists play, he became spontaneously proficient at playing the instrument. The night the stoker was buried(thrown overboard), he sneaked into the ball room and played an improvised sad piece, a piece which attracted passengers all over the ship(including the captain)to listen. Later, the boy grew up, playing the piano on the ship all his life. It was not until he was 27 that he met his lifelong friend: a trumpeter named Max Tooney. Although he became a legend on the ship because of his music, he never set foot on land, let alone starting a life there.Watching this movie, I never bothered to check the clock even though it was close to midnight. My eyes were glued to every scene. The direction was perfect. I loved the idea of having Max on the voice-over, it increased the sense of epic and enhanced the consistency of the movie. Of course, the lovely piano pieces help to shed light on the scenes as well. Whenever you have exhausted your attention span, the music emerges, snapping you back into the movie. There are scenes that are still memorable even 15 years today. I.e., the scene which 1990 took Max on a fantastic piano ride in order to rid him of his seasickness. The piano duel between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton. The scene which 1900 saw a beautiful lady and played a beautiful piano piece for him. Oh God, those scenes were so lovely. I could watch them again and again without getting bored. You really should give the composers credit for writing such beautiful music.As for the acting, this movie was also top-notch. Tim Roth gave possibly the best performance in his career. Before I saw him on the DVD cover, I gave my doubts. I doubted if he could handle a character so elegant and noble, as he was used to playing villains and lowlifes all the time. His debut in the film erased all my doubts. He was charismatic and esoteric. His eyes showed you his crave for music and his sense of belonging to the ship. His emotion showed his willingness to connect with other people off the ship even though it was a lost cause. Finally, his performance peaked at the scenes with the girl. He really showed his passion for the girl although he was a shy person in nature. At times, I resonated with him. I was also a shy boy once and the always stalk the girls I desire and watch them from afar. In the end, it was his performance in the last scene that really stunned me. Originally, I thought it was kinda lame for him not to go overboard(no pun intended). However, his explanation to Max in the later scene allowed me not only to resonate with him, but also share a few tears for him. My emotion can only be manipulated by Tim's perfect performance.On the other hand, I think Pruitt Vince Taylor gave a crappy performance. His emotion was so stiff..No wonder no one's hiring him anymore. In the last scene when he was supposed to be sad by 1900, I think his face expressed disdain instead of sadness. The guy's surely gotten his facial expressions all messed up.For those who haven't seen this movie, I strongly recommend you to watch it. This is simply an amazing movie and Top 10 on my list on par with movies like The Shawshank Redemption. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you, have some backbone for you own opinion. If it's any consolation, on Douban(a Chinese movie website equivalent to IMDb), it received a high score of 9.1 and currently ranks 8 on Douban Top 250.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

A Vivid Portrait Of A Man Who Could Do Anything... Except Be Ordinary,"An amusing, touching, heartfelt, soulful & sentimental delight that brims with warmth, is crafted with passion, and sails on the breezy tides of Ennio Morricone's awe-inspiring score, Giuseppe Tornatore's The Legend of 1900 is a wonderful fable of music, passion, life & friendship that may not be able to justify its daunting runtime but there is a comforting & magical quality to it that nonetheless compels us to journey wherever it wants to take us.",,Anonymous,Music
beautiful but sad film,"Enjoyable film, very sad but thought-provoking. Tim Roth's character, 1900 was tragic as he just could not develop his life. It was like the ship was his surrogate mother who he was unable to leave. I loved the fact that his 'father' was a black man too. I would have loved to see 1900 have romance and experience life on land, albeit for a short moment. If only he could make that journey to shore, who knows his life could have different.Beautiful, sad film.",,Anonymous,Music
A really great movie by the best cineaste of our time,"Tornatore is in my opinion, the best cineaste of our time. Cinema Paradiso is a classic by itself.

you got to have the right mood to appreciate it.,"Before I bought it, I got no idea what the movie would be like. After I saw it through, I got some pieces of advice for you before you see it. First, and most important is you have to get right mood to see it.The movie is not like usual Hollywood movie, it is actually a sort of European movie style, delicate but a little bit slow. So, you got to have a peaceful mood, and seeing it at night alone will be better. Second, enjoy the music, the jazz in the movie as much as you can, they are great and touching. Third, do not think the logic during seeing the movie. Take the movie as a story, make yourself sunk into the essence of it. During looking at the movie, I found Max got some disease on his eyes. You can check it up yourself, whenever the camera shoots at his eyes, they were always shaking.",,Anonymous,Music
What a dream ...,"It was beautiful and drowsy, logical within the bounds of the story. Dream logic, yes? A child, born on a ship, grows into a man who never leaves it? Why yes, of course! Just close your eyes (don't, please, you'll miss so much) lay your head down (up high enough to see, though) and dream of tuxedos and beaded gowns, music that has no label so let's call it jazz, dining on snow white linen. And don't worry, the ending is just as good as the beginning.",,Anonymous,Music
fresh,"If you do not like this movie... you don't like movies. Just give ashort verbal description of the story to a friend and they become veryinterested in seeing it. And why shouldn't they? It sounds so unusual,and it has built in metaphors galore. The fact that it is an Englishspoken Italian movie somehow enhances the surreal mood. The awkwardnessof the dialogue's phrasing and rhythm is a kind of jazz which compelsyou to listen to our own language with a little more attentiveness-especially set against the synchopation of the outstanding music. (Themusic should have been listed in the credits as part of the cast, it isthat important to the film.) I am often perplexed by what the ""whitebread"" sect falls all over themselves to see. A movie like ""Castaway""will be in every theater in America for 2 months, when it is essentiallya dull movie with alot of product placement and a completely overdoneplane crash scene. Wow, considering it's success, I guess the mostimportant product placement was Tom Hanks. The Legend Of 1900 gives youso much more than your average movie. This may be an odd comparison,but, if you like the children's book ""The Polar Express"" you will lovethis movie................................",,Anonymous,Music

Legend of 1900,"I am very hard to please in terms of movies and books.A Thai colleague gave me a copy of this film that he found in a disposal type store and suggested I might enjoy.He was very correct.How this film didn't make box office records and win major US awards has me baffled. The Director alone should have won it with the 'piano dancing' scene or the competition with Jelly Role Morton.Photography was amazing, especially given much was in black & white.Music superb.At a recent party I spoke to a English professor.

A truly remarkable film,"Well written, well acted, and well received! Three thumbs up for this movie, the first I've purchased since Les Miserables! English is so limited in superlatives, but this movie deserves them all. Some have commented, 'this was a disappointment' for them; they erred in expecting it to be more than it was-- a legend. Legends die, that's what makes them memorable . Although not a hidden agenda of the author, I took a valuable lesson away from this movie. And it becomes clearer with each time I re-watch it (#7 so far) Don't lock yourself in your own little world--get off the ship of your little town or die in it! The truly great men from Jesus to Bill Gates got out of their hometown, and small town thinking, this resulted in greatness for both of them and thousands of others who did the same. Not to be measured financially-- but how they affected others in a positive way. You and I can be that... a great force for good , by taking our skills and using them for the common good.

"Wow, excellent movie !!!","It's kinda funny, being from the USA and an Italian movie inspires me to go thru reg process just to say, ""Wow, excellent movie"".  The movie had me mezmerized by trying to view the world thru a unique perspective.  This guy uses music to express much more than words can even attempt.  Than on top of it all, they throw in a glimpse or two at the most beautiful woman i've ever seen in real life or in movies. The only words of any consequence that I could offer, would be ""Thank You"" or ""Gratzia"" (most likely misspelled).  This movie left me with a feeling of... well, since I can't describe it, I guess I will call it a feeling of understanding.  The human condition is a wonderful ride and haven't felt this from a movie since watching la vita bella. It's got the ocean, emotion, and a beautiful woman.  More than enough for a wonderful life.  There it is... it leaves you with the understanding that life is wonderful.  Joie de vivre (love of life and most likely misspelled again) that's what this movie offers.

Magnificent Cinematography,"Not to give short shrift to the plot or the performances, but a year after seeing this film at the local art house (where it played for exactly one week), what I remember most is the gorgeous widescreen cinematography--particularly in the shore scenes, which I believe were filmed in Odessa.  It's a shame that most people, if they see ""Legend of 1900"" at all, will watch it on a TV screen.  If there were any justice in the world, at least one screen in each cineplex would be reserved for fine but overlooked films such as this.",,Anonymous,Music

Thanks to the brilliant surrealistic cameraworks and light, the story was like a fairy tale which was a pleasure to watch. Unfortunately the movie ended with a terrible long monologue in which 1900 (Tim Roth) tries to explain why he wants to die in the ship. I was so annoyed by this, that it was a relief when he actually was blown up.",,Anonymous,Music
Magical but Overlong,"It was interesting to see the range of responses to this film. I liked the first 60 % of it, then became increasingly restless, because the director failed to sustain the often magical tone of his ""fable."" As some other viewers noted, the best scenes revolve around the child 1900 as he is adopted by the crew of the Virginian; the scene in which 1900 as a young man careens giddily around the ballroom, seated at his piano during a storm at sea, is also really inspired. And I also agree with those who praised the openly sentimental, over-the-top emotional expressivity of this Italian director. Plus, he shares Fellini's skill at choosing wonderful faces for momentary closeups in a crowd.I'm not sure exactly when I began to lose interest. It may have been during the piano duel with Jelly Roll Morton. There is always a danger when a fabulist pulls in actual historical figures: the real person may have been more interesting than the screen character as presented. This is definitely the case with Morton, who was indeed a braggart and musical bully -- but also a man of enormous humor and savoir-faire. Clarence Williams III isn't given much to work with, and the whole scene reeks of one more white-guys-actually-CAN-jump moment in Hollywood films. Also, bravo to those who pointed out that the deference with which Morton is treated by passengers, barkeep, etc., is jarringly at odds with actual attitudes toward American blacks during the time -- even if you were a famous jazz musician.Once 1900 tries to make himself leave the ship, and fails, the movie gets very tedious. The director simply cannot match the whimsy and overall imaginative quality of the preceding scenes. We get way too much of the trumpet player's rueful efforts, too much self-explanation at the very end by 1900 himself, etc. etc.Incidentally, Tornatore has recently released a ""director's cut"" version of his Cinema Paradiso that adds over a half hour of time to that movie -- it's putting people to sleep in a theater near you! So maybe The Legend of 1900 would have benefitted from having a ""suit"" hanging around during the editing process telling him Giuseppe, you made the film too long.",,Anonymous,Music
A beautifully told fairytale,"The legend of 1900 is a fairlytale-like story of a man who grew up on a ship and spent his entire life there while playing the piano like no one had ever done before. It is at times funny, tragic and sad. The music is very easy on the ear, especially when 1900 meets the love of his life. But most of all I liked the part of the film when 1900 explains why he never left the ship. 1900 liked the fact that on board of the ship the possibilities are not infinite whereas on land the fact that there so many streets and so many places to go made him feel desperate. I agree with another commentator who said that this story is the story for the next millenium. The fact that with all the new technology the motto seems to be that the sky is the limit one wonders whether this is really an improvement or just an unnecessary complication of life. And before I forget, Tim Roth and his trumpet playing friend Max are- to my opinion- acting their best.",,Anonymous,Music
good but..,"I thought the role of Max was badly played.. the actor seemed to be struggling with staying in character and his lines just didn't fit the 1900 era-- more like 2004. I hated his acting the most during the Jelly Roll piano fight scene.. very inconsistent..Also, I couldn't feel sorry for Tim Roth's character- yes, Tim did an awesome job- he's just one of my favorite actors, but the fact that Tim's been in Taratino movies blocked me from feeling emotion I should have felt, although I came close.  Oh well, he's proved himself time and time again despite my opinion.  I wish he'd gotten off the boat to see that girl, make money from gigs and bought a yacht and dock it off some sandy-white shore in the Caribbean..",,Anonymous,Music
"A visually rich, thematically unique, but ultimately flawed piece of work","Although no one would argue that the plot here isn't completely original, the actual film is still incredibly flawed, even to the extent that by the time film reaches the halfway mark the story had become dull and the pacing laborious. Clearly, Tim Roth is a fine actor who has impressed in the likes Made in Britain (1980), Reservoir Dogs (1991) and Pulp Fiction (1994), and it is to his credit somewhat that the film survives as long as it does, but I have to honestly admit that the best parts of the film are the earlier sequences that revolve around the child version of Novecento (the character that Roth plays), who's wide-eyed sense of wonder and mystique leads him up into the ship and to the grand piano so central to the plot.Alongside the interesting plot and unconventional character there are some fine performances from the supporting cast, as well as some particularly strong emotional themes, such as the ideas of loneliness and the class divide, but for me, the film really struggled to keep itself going with the short scope of the running time or the rushed, unfinished feeling found in many of the individual scenes. Admittedly, I have not seen any other Tornatore films, despite the amount of critical praise that his Cinema Pardiso (1988) has been given, but it seems that with this film he's either compromised his vision in order to appeal to a more mainstream American audience or simply, I've seen some horribly truncated, studio re-cut (which could be the case, as it would seem that Tornatore has been badly treated by US/UK distributors in the past, who insist on cutting his films down to more easily digestible running times). If this is the case, then I sincerely apologise, but even so; I'm not sure I can imagine a film of this scope working at anything less than a suitably epic four-hour running time, akin to something like Bernardo Bertolucci's similarly set historical piece, 1900 (1976).As you could expect, the cinematography throughout is impeccably beautiful, employing haunting shots of the ocean liner drifting out of the fog like a ghost to create an entirely alien world reminiscent of Fellini's great work And the Ships Sails On (1982). The production design is also remarkable, and the attention to detail that Tornatore and his crew have put into the film is second to none, but for me, the film just failed to maintain that sense of momentum over such a short duration. The Legend of 1900 (1998) is still an interesting, remarkable beautiful looking film, but one that I feel fails to deliver on its epic potential. It is elevated somewhat by the aforementioned photography, the haunting score from Enio Moerricone and the commendable performances from Roth, Bill Nunn and the underrated Pruitt Taylor Vince.",,Anonymous,Music
"A different, refreshing, poignant film that will remain a favorite.","I don't think there would be a single person who would come out of this film without being moved. From the opening shoot, of Max sitting on the steps, to the time when Max walks out of the store, the films grabs you and holds you to the seat. Refreshing ideas like the time when 1900 takes Max for a quick 'ride' on the piano, and the characters you find sprinkled in every scene make for a great movie experience. Though the scene that I really fell for, is the one where 1900 is playing the piano as he's watching 'the girl' through the porthole. It's sheer poetry! It's moving! It's wow! Tim Roth and Pruitt Taylor are brilliant. Melanie Thierry takes your breath and away it's not difficult to understand why 1900 false for her. Is there something that I don't like about the film? Hmmmm, the tagline. It's anything but that. I could go on and on about the film. But I guess, I'd summarise it by saying - A different, refreshing, poignant film that will remain a favorite. A must see and a must have.",,Anonymous,Music
A truly moving experience.,"I have watched this film time and time again and it never fails to impress me. Tim Roth performed extraordinarily well as the naive and prodigious pianist Nineteen Hundred. The music was beautiful to say the least. The best part however, was the truly original storyline. In an age when movies focus on sex, drugs and violence of today's society, it was refreshing to come back to such a romantic and inspiring film. The Legend of Nineteen Hundred is by far one of the most beautiful creations I have ever seen on film.",,Anonymous,Music
Stunning....,"Some of my favorite film experiences were those I was unprepared for and just happened upon. One such film was when I was about 9 years old and late at night on Christmas eve, alone with the tv, I came across a film that totally captivated me in every way imaginable. That film was ""Its a Wonderful Life"". A similar feeling came over me, when, on a flight from Rome to New York on Alitalia, ""Legend of 1900"" came on as the second in flight film. It was one of the most visually and musically stunning films I have ever seen. This film experience was just wonderful, and I don't hesitate to put it in my top 3 of all time. I just purchased the DVD and look forward to enjoying this personal classic over and over again. A wonderful story with great acting.",,Anonymous,Music
love is too weak a word,"I have been a fan of tim roth for a long while now, but this film, even if i hadn't been, would have made me so.  i haven't cried in a film like this since i saw american beauty for the first time.  it's somewhat hard to explain.  there is a painful, heart-breaking beauty that can make you cry without feeling truly sad contained within the stories of 1900.  he makes you laugh, he makes you angry, he makes you fall in love, and yes, he makes you cry.  if anyone feels they have an appreciation for beauty, see this movie.  i cannot find any other words to say, other than that:  see this movie.",,Anonymous,Music
Another great Tornatore Film,"Guiseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso etc.) is an absolute Master of the emotional cinema.In the classic style of Cinema Paradiso, this is a movie not to miss.The music by Ennio Morricone, Tornatore´s favorite composer (and mine too) is just overwhelming.A great 10 Movie.",,Anonymous,Music
