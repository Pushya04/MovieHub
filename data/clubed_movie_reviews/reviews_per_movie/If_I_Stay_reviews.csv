A Moving Film That Makes Me Think About My Own Family and What's Important,"If I stay is a beautiful, moving film about a teenage girl and the life or death decision she must make. Mia is a teenage girl that has a wonderful, quirky family, a boyfriend who loves her to pieces, and a bright, ambitious future. But, all of that changes when she and her family are in a fatal car accident. While Mia's body is in a coma, her mind journeys back to all of her memories, triumphs, heart breaks and future. She has to make the decision on whether or not to fight and stay alive, or let go and leave this world. Will Mia stay?I love this movie. It made me laugh, cry and it helped me to see all of the good in my own life that I should cherish, because you never know when it could all change. The cinematography is beautiful. Most of the film is filled with memories that Mia has and the way they are portrayed is very neat. The music is also beautiful. Mia is a cellist and a lot of the film focuses on her dreams of becoming a successful musician, so the film is filled with beautiful classical music.My Favorite character is Mia played by Chloe Moretz. This film shows so many aspects of Mia's life, so it's easy to find something to relate to. She has a great passion for playing the cello and dedicates most of her life to it. She has difficulties relating to her parents and even her boyfriend since their musicals tastes are far more edgy than hers. She has to face her insane loss and she has to choose between many different things in life. There's something about her life that I think anyone can relate to, so she's a wonderful character. Chloe does a wonderful job portraying everything she's going through and she moved me to tears many times.This film makes me think about my own family and everything I would do for them. It makes me think of my life and all the joys and sorrows I've faced. There was not a dry eye in the audience because this film provokes unique memories for every individual. I felt especially connected to Mia's family because I too have a younger brother and am very close with my parents, so I was very touched by Mia's situation.I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 because of the intense emotions and mature content. Make sure you check out If I Stay in theaters August 22nd.Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Affecting, Without Being Manipulative","'If I Stay' is without shame a picture aimed straight at the tear ducts, presumably in the belief that a good crying spell is both therapeutic and cathartic for the spirit. And the picture mostly works hard to earn its tears honestly: The characters are attractive and appealing and likable, and the actors playing the characters also are attractive and appealing and likable. This is the rare picture which features no bad guys. Everybody's a good guy.Based on Gayle Forman's 2009 young adult novel of the same name, 'If I Stay' chronicles the emotional experience of a buttoned-up 17-year-old cello prodigy Mia Hall, played here by actress Chloe Grace Moretz, and her worlds-colliding romance with an up-and-coming young rock-and-roll guitarist named Adam. That both Mia and Adam are on the cusp of professional breakthroughs in their musical pursuits accounts for most the of the ups and downs in their relationship.Unfortunately, their romance is in the middle of one of its downs when Mia and her family are involved in a catastrophic auto accident, casting Mia into an out-of-body experience in which she can observe the people she loves, but not communicate with them or interfere with their actions.'If I Stay' is a picture that gives you the kind of satisfaction you get from being on time for an appointment, following your doctor's orders, eating the right cereal, taking your medicine as prescribed, or getting a flu shot: You might rather be watching 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' a 'Fast and Furious' movie or 'The Expendibles,' but you just know that a movie with this much cello music in it has got to be good for you.And it is fairly good. Young Mia has wonderful support from her parents, a set of amiable former rockers played appealingly by Mirielle Enos and Joshua Leonard. Leonard especially, late of 'The Blair Witch Project' hysteria of 1999, has matured into a solid character actor and possesses a sort of good-natured, loopy appeal which in 'If I Stay' contrasts nicely with the buttoned-up performance of Moretz as his daughter.In the film, it's shown in flashbacks that Mia's folks grew up and embraced responsibility when it became apparent to them that the late nights and party lights did not blend well with parenthoodan epiphany which makes even more perplexing their almost pushing young Mia out the door to be with her rocker boyfriend.As Mia's rock guitarist boyfriend, Jamie Blackley is somehow manages to be sullen without actually pouting, and is simultaneously withdrawn and inarticulate about romance yet strong-willed and verbose about music. You can see why Mia's attracted to Adam, but if you're like me you might be more than a little conflicted about their falling into bed quite so quickly, especially if, like me, you view the picture with your girlfriend's adolescent daughter present.Unfortunately, at some point—I'm not exactly not sure when, but I think it's about an hour into the picture—the narrative becomes sticky and manipulative, and the picture begins to rely on broad characterizations, familiar stereotypes, and the familiarity of plot devices from movies past, to sort of swindle the tears from the audience.And that's too bad, because by that point I'd already decided I enjoyed the picture, and was unprepared to modify my opinion. That the scene which I believe began the manipulation featured the showcase moment for veteran actor Stacy Keach, as the crusty but lovable old Grandpa, made the cheat seem even more unexpected and surprising. Keach, much like Robert Loggia, seems like such an honest, sturdy, and dependable actor.But having said that, about 80% of the success of 'If I Stay' belongs to young Chloe Grace Moretz in the central role as Mia. Moretz is earnest enough in her craft to make us care about young Mia even through her most puzzling and selfish interludes.Moretz followed 'If I Stay' with a supporting role the high-profile action film 'The Equalizer,' with Denzel Washington. And combined with 'If I Stay' and Moretz' affecting characterization in the title role of the most recent remake of 'Carrie'—not to mention Hammer's under-appreciated 'Let Me In' and the 'Kick-Ass' pictures—it's plain that this is one young actress who's going places. Fast.I liked 'If I Stay.' But I think I already told you that.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Average story but good acting.,"I was really excited to watch this after seeing the trailer, and not to say that I was disappointed but I was kind of expecting a bit more. The whole story basically revolves around her first love and whether she should stay. Though I appreciate that it wasn't as lovey-dovey as most young romances (or high-school relationships) tend to be, I would've liked if there was more to the story other than that.The music element was pretty cool, and I wonder if she really plays the cello herself, because it looked really authentic. Same with the other actors in the band.The acting was pretty good, it wasn't spectacular but it was good enough for the film. Moretz surprises me by the range of her characters, as I first knew her from Kick-Ass which is profoundly different. Blackley does a good job too, though I guess I didn't really feel the connection between the two,and maybe that's why I felt that there was something missing from the film. I didn't sympathize with them and so thought that the film was just all right. Though the parents had real character to them and they played the part of a family really well.Another thing I noticed was that when Hall was a 'spirit' people still tended to move out of her way and it was really obvious. There was this one scene where her friend opens a door and she pushes it a bit further as if for the person behind...which was Hall as a spirit. That was not good. Do people actually see or hear her? If not, it should be consistent throughout. And it also seemed as if she could touch things, though people didn't notice.Read more of my movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A movie that wasn't cheesy but a little generic in some parts. The ending was perfect & really helped. Better than I expected,"""Sometimes you make choices and sometimes they make you."" Mia has a great and loving family. A boyfriend who is in love with her and she is one step away from her dream of going to Juilliard. All that changes after a car wreck leaves her alone and fighting for her life. Watching her family and friends at the hospital and looking back over her life she must decide to stay living and chase her dreams or let go and be with her family. First thing I have to say is that while this is a sad movie it wasn't as depressing as I was expecting. The movie did a really good job of making it emotional without feeling forced. The movie was able to stay away from becoming overly melodramatic or too cheesy. On the other hand though the movie was a little generic in some parts and you were able to see certain things coming. The whole movie you are trying to guess whether she will stay or go and I had a feeling that the choice would make or break the movie. I could see points for both sides and I have to say that I thought the ending was perfect. Overall, a movie that wasn't cheesy but it was a little generic in some parts. The ending was perfect and really helped the movie. This was better then I was expecting. I give it a B.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful,"Anyone interested in this film already knows the premise by now if they have read this far, so I won't rehash it.All I will say is that this film could have easily been contrived and cheesy and hokey and clichéd but rather, the end is result is truly one of the finest, most real representations of youth and love I have seen in a long time. And the fact that it seemed so genuine is exactly why I have not cried in a film so much since....""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."" Chloe Grace Moretz has already proved she is a force to be reckoned with, but by an accomplishment like playing the key character in a film that was made to be a tearjerker without coming across as completely laughable shows what a strong actress this young woman truly is.Excellent, relatable script, wonderful direction and perfectly edited, the fact the a bunch of tween girls went ""Huh? What? That's the end?"" when the credits began to roll proved that R.J. Cutler knew exactly when to end this film at the precise moment. There was no need to overstay the welcome.Make sure you have some Kleenex.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Cello Runs Through It,"The cello is my favorite musical instrument. One of my favorite movies of all time is the Japanese Oscar Best Foreign Language film winner ""Departures"" and a cello played a prominent part in that one. ""If I Stay"" is another film in which a cello takes center stage, and I would not miss it even for that reason alone.""If I Stay"" is a dramatic film about a shy cello-playing teenager named Mia Hall. She has cool supportive parents, who were once in the punk scene. Her boyfriend Adam is the front man of an up-and-coming rock band. Everything seemed to be going swimmingly with her. She is awaiting for her acceptance letter from the Julliard School. Then one beautiful winter day, a tragic car accident happens.I was looking forward to good cello music, and it did not disappoint. Those music in those scenes showing Mia auditioning for Julliard were breathtaking. As it turns out though, the cello music is not the only thing good about this film.This film is a tearjerker of the highest order. The script was written in very emotional language by Shauna Cross based on a best-selling novel by Gayle Forman. Thankfully, the cast, though mostly unknown except for the lead actress, does very well in bringing this script to life.Chloe Grace Moretz is really a phenomenal young actress. She gained attention as the ultra-violent It Girl, the best part of the ""Kick Ass"" films. Now a little more grown-up as Mia, Moretz provides this role the grace and elegance. A lesser actress may have made those death scenes mawkish and those romance scenes cheesy. Those cello-playing scenes were killer scenes.Jamie Blackley was fine as Mia's boyfriend Adam. He seemed uncomfortable at times, and his chemistry with Moretz was not entirely convincing. I like the actors who played Mia's parents Denny and Kat better, Joshua Leonard and Mireille Enos. That New Year's Day scene where Kat was drying the dishes while Mia washed was especially well-written and well- acted out.I had seen Liana Liberato in her devastating film debut as a victim of child rape in ""Truth."" She also did well her as Mia's loyal friend Kim. I think this is the first time I have seen perennial bad guy Stacy Keach in a role that made him so emotionally raw as Mia's grandfather.The storytelling, with its weaving in and out of past and present events, was very well-edited. However, the pace taken by Director RJ Custer can feel very slow and repetitive at certain times in the middle, which made me look at my watch a few times. Overall though, it was effective in its intention as a tear-jerking romance. Your handkerchief or tissue paper will definitely get wet with this film with its many touching scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"moving, if you can relate to it","hey I loved this movie. If a movie stirs my emotions to a point where my body can't control itself, cry, laughter, anger etc, then in my mind it's done it's job. Movies are escapism. If you don't feel like you've been transported into the movie, then you're just not into it.As a father I relate to this movie, the sacrifice the father makes for his talented daughter.. It well and truly stirred my emotions. It's a 10 in my book. The concept might appear cheesy to some, but it was up my ally.If you're a romantic at heart, you will enjoy this flick. If you don't want to embrace being taken on a journey of what it might be like in he next world, then go check out something else.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Watchable, but very Disappointing and Forgettable","When I first saw the trailer for If I Stay back in April, I got chills and it quickly became one of my top five most anticipated movies of the summer. From then on, I stayed away from all other trailers and clips so that I could see the movie knowing as little as possible, to the point where I'd put the TV spots on mute and run out of the theater when a trailer came on. Based on the trailer I saw, I honestly expected something similar to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or a dramatic Inception. However, after having finally seen it this weekend, I am sad to report that If I Stay is nothing like that at all, and is instead probably my most disappointing movie of the summer.If I Stay follows Mia, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, an 18 year old girl who likes classical music and cello, and who's still not quite over her ex, Adam (Jamie Blackley). Then on a snowy day, her life is completely turned upside down when her family and she get into a deadly car crash, sending her into a coma. In this coma, she has an out of body experience in which she needs to decides either to die and go up to heaven or live with the physical and emotional repercussions, all while flashing back to the relationship she and Adam had.The movie is primarily made up of flashbacks to the relationship that Mia and Adam had, and the chemistry that the two of them share isn't very strong and can be described as okay at best. Chloe Grace Moretz is a talented young actress who really gives it her best in this film, whereas her costar Jamie Blackley ranges from decent to mediocre. The relationship between their two characters is cute and sort of fun for the first half of the movie. However, in the second half when their relationship slowly starts to go downhill, Adam becomes a jerk and is unlikeable and unreasonable, which made me have a tough time feeling bad for him when he was an emotional wreck. Also, with Adam and Mia's relationship, something felt missing. Rather than true love, it felt like a typical high school relationship where the two people think they're love, then someday breakup and later realize that they never actually were in love.Then all the other characters are either annoying or underdeveloped. Mia's parents are somewhat likable, however, most of their jokes and dialogue come off as either flat or cringe-worthy. Then there's this couple who is close friends to Mia's parents, and they are present in the hospital for most of the movie and in many of the flashbacks. In one scene they talk about never wanting to have children, but then they are later seen in another scene with a baby (referred to as their son) who is then never referenced or seen again afterwards. The one exception to all this would be Mia's grandfather, played by Stacy Keach, and he had one scene in particular that I did really like (those who have seen the movie can probably guess what scene it was). Perhaps I am just being biased since I do enjoy Keach and his acting, but I do think he gave a good performance.Now I have some things to say regarding the ending. I'm not going to outright say any spoilers, but I'm kind of going to imply what happens in the end. Therefore, if you do not want anything spoiled about If I Stay, skip this next paragraph.Mia makes her decision to stay or leave based off of a five minute speech that one character makes to her, and then the movie ties itself up really nice in a bow and leaves everything real hopeful and bright for the characters. While I do like happy endings, I felt in this case a less hopeful ending would have been better suited to really make her decision difficult. Not Requiem For a Dream level hopeless, but rather cutting the whipped cream and cherry on top. However, I do have to say that with the route they chose, the last ten seconds of the film were perfect. The place where the last shot cut could not have been better.In the end, If I Stay is just another average teen romance movie, and it's not even all that interesting. The trailer makes the movie seem like a tear-jerking drama that takes place all in her mind about her decision to live or die, when in reality, it's a high school love story consisting of 70% flashbacks that only spends a small portion with her out of body experience. I REALLY don't want to give this movie anything below a 6/10 because of how much I had been looking forward to it for so long, but I have to give it a 5/10. It's even possible that in the future my score will go even lower. While it is somewhat entertaining, If I Stay is a rather weak romance movie for teens and is overall very forgettable.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Real and genuine - a cut above the rest,"This is a well balanced romantic drama. The movie has a good balance between family tragedy of a horrific car accident and teen romance of young love. Also the theme of music is well shared between classical cello and Pacific Northwest rock band. The romance is a convincing tale - not too passionate for their age but with the real problems of differing paths and East Coast (Juillard) vs West Coast (rock band). This is a problem that face many couples and it's good to see proper issues as the problem instead of trumped up melodrama. The story felt more real than ""The Fault in Our Stars"" and less sentimental too. In fact although the tale is a sad one, it's the best of the recent teen based romance movies far better than ""The Giver"".Chloe Grace Moretz proves she can do anything from horror (Carrie) to action (Kick Ass) to moving romantic drama. Her face is sensitive and expressive. Even though she is very pretty she is such a good actress she can still pull off the shy musical prodigy without being fake. Her love interest is played by Jamie Blackley who does a good job without overacting. He isn't too good looking so it's a believable romance. The ex rocker type parents seem like they couldn't have had such a beautiful daughter but never mind. Stacy Keach is surprisingly effective as her grandfather.Well done - moving, involving, rings true.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"An Emotional, Moral Filled Tale","Surprise, surprise another weekend, another movie based off of a book. I start my review off this evening with the latest popular drama entitled If I Stay Why we have yet another somber, emotion engorged screenplay when we just had one, I will never know, but Hollywood is eating up the profits from movies like this. So with the hot little topic these movies are at the moment, I go once more into the dimly lit theater to determine if this movie is worth your hard earned money. What is my verdict? Like always, please read on to find out.The key factor that these movies go for is the ability to bring about some type of emotion. If I stay is no different, though in this flick you can pretty much guess what emotion is filling the screen. From the trailers, one should be prepared to go in for a tear jerker movie, filled with sad and morbid factors for the whole nine yards. In my theater, there were plenty of emotional fans crying, gasping, sobbing, and any other description you can think of as Mia (Chloë Grace Moretz) faces her trial of choosing to live. Before you turn away though, If I Stay surprisingly has some happy emotions to it as well, spread amongst the misery to help lighten the mood. Perhaps this is what kept me interested in the movie, as the delivery did a nice job balancing both happiness and sadness. Integrating the disaster amidst memories of Mia's life is a great approach, helping to establish and develop a backstory without giving it all away at the beginning. While I'm sure fans of the book already expected this, but I appreciated the development of the relationships with her family and friends, gradually building up to where the movie starts. The timing of these memories was spot on, each memory slightly deeper as Mia fights to hang on to life, using a different aspect of her life to carry on. Of course, the movie is full of morals about the various components of life, each done in an artistic fashion that is filled with glorified movie magic. One can certainly appreciate what the story has to teach, enough to oversee a little of the cheesiness in some of the scenes and dialog.Of course the balanced emotions are only one part of the strengths of this movie. The acting is not half bad, with Moretz doing a good job at playing the awkward girl role. Moretz is dynamic and I enjoy her broad spectrum of characters she can play and the way she brings her lines to life. In this role she gets to act like a real person, reacting to the situations life deals her as she tries to break out of her comfort zone. Yet, for me there was a little too much crying and weakness in this character, her drawn out rants of crying and screaming a bit taxing for my patience. Of course this fits with the theme of the movie though and helps one relate to the turmoil she is feeling. Playing her opposite is Jamie Blackley who is perhaps the central point in Mia's world. Blackley's character is an attempt to represent the wild, unruly side, but his character is more relaxed than wild. The audience will get more than their fill of his songs that fit well with the scene he brings to life. However, some of the songs are simply shoved down our throats in an attempt to promote the actor's talent at singing songs that sound all the same, (like a Taylor Swift album). Regardless, I like how real his character is, and not some extreme, high on life, rogue whose bad boy attitude has all the girls swooning. The rest of the cast was fine, and well fitted into the story, but they were all rotating around the giant love relationship in this movie.This brings me to the next part of the review, some of the weaker aspects of the movie. Despite the relationship being a little more realistic than others, it still has its moments of sheer fantasy and movie magic that sob lovers will enjoy. The predictable nature of the movie is also a bit old as well. While I did enjoy the balance of memories in the story, it was obvious where the tale was going with the underlying themes in it. Such predictability is overshadowed by the slow pace of this movie, as the lack of any exciting events leads to movie to be slightly boring. I'm still weaning myself away from the action, but this movie seemed to go around in circles instead of covering any forward ground. One minor thing is while I normally love songs that help bring out the emotions in the scene, this was a little too somber for my taste. Soft and classic rock fans will rejoice in the soundtrack, but it just didn't do much for me in this movie, and once or twice made me very sleepy.Overall If I stay is an emotional tale that drama lovers I feel will love. It's got great life lessons, an intertwined tale of both joy and sorrow, and some decent acting that fit well to bring the novel on the screen. Yet, don't let the trailers and commercials overhype the movie, nor should you go in comparing it to the book. While I have not read the novel, my track record leads to usually disappointment, so try and block that mindset if you can. Is it worth a trip to theater? My opinion is not really, as there is very little quality that would look better on a bigger screen. Truth be told it's a great girls night out movie, or a movie you can treat your significant other too in hopes of getting reciprocation.

As Bad As a Weepy Pop Song,"Music is a recurring literal and allegorical motif in If I Stay. In keeping with this tired trend, if If I Stay was a song, it would be a weapy Avril Lavigne ballad: fake, melodramatic, and boring. It's blandness to the nth degree, with little to no style OR substance to pull it out of its own self-absorbed pretension. Who will this movie appeal to? It's too slow for tweens, too tepid for adults. Unless you're looking for something stupid, vapid, depressing, clichéd, annoying, and laughless, don't bother. The movie's essentially a fantasy for shy teenage girls: the dreamy, popular older band-boy inexplicably notices you, pursues you, and falls in love with you. She's a shy but stuck-up classical cellist jerk. Her love interest is a selfishly immature hipster jerk. They are a match made in conceited jerk heaven! But when a tragic accident puts you on the brink of death, your conscience must decide: do I keep living, or do I avoid pain by dying? This pretense could make for some interesting storytelling, with a ghost having to watch her life play out without affecting itbut nope. Moretz, who I normally like, is given nothing to work with and turns in her worst performance to date. A bevy of Portlandia-style caricatures parade around screen shooting for authenticity and consistently missing. I couldn't contain my eye-rolling at the onslaught of cynical clichés and bad quips about the ""power"" of music. Some decent scenes of actual musicianship, a couple of good performances (Grandpa), and a modicum of sweetness are completely overwhelmed by the inauthentic and never-ending dullness.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Didn't appreciate it as much until an accidental 2nd viewing,"I thought it was pretty good the first time. To be honest, I was half asleep when I first saw it, to the extent that I didn't realize I had seen it just based on the name of it, so I accidentally started streaming it today without realizing I had seen it before several months ago. I know, this doesn't sound supportive of this movie. For the record, I almost never watch movies more than once...I get too bored. After it started this second time, I did realize immediately that I'd seen it before, but I figured I'd stop it the moment I became bored, which I knew was inevitable given that I'd seen it before. Well, somehow I watched it all again, in its entirety. This time, I saw more depth than I'd seen before. Bottom line, this is worth watching. Of course, it's not perfect, and the main character looks like she's 12 rather than 17 or 18, which is a little bit creepy. But it has heart, and it's beautiful. Granted, I don't totally agree with the ending, but up until then it brought up questions that were very meaningful for anyone who has experienced loss. Kudos to this movie for being unexpectedly watchable for a 2nd run, and for actually being better another time around.",,Anonymous,Music
Plays well to it's audience,"I saw IF I STAY last night! This movie, directed by R.J. Cutler, is based on a novel by Gayle Foreman about a teenage girl named Mia, played by Chloë Grace Moretz, who has an out of body experience after a massive car wreck that leaves her comatose. As Mia's life flashes before her eyes, she must decide whether she will live with her life forever altered or embrace the serenity of death. I really have to give this movie it's props for two reasons. First of all, for those of you who were wondering if Chloë Grace Moretz can really act or is she just the flavor of the month, the jury is in and it's unanimous, the girl has got some skills. Her performance is wonderful and she really effectively showcases the full range of emotions that a teenage girl can have. Moretz is not the only actor here that's good, the whole cast does a great job especially Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard who play Mia's ex-rocker parents and Stacy Keach who plays Mia's grandfather. The second reason to like this movie comes from the script. It is so carefully written that it manages to keep you attached to living in the moment despite watching a series of segments that take place in the past. If I have any complaints it is that it runs a little long and things get trope-ish from time to time in a really CW kind of way and they get REALLY iffy near the third act when Mia's boyfriend, played by Jamie Backley, shows up with a sack full of melodrama. Overall I'd say that If I Stay is a good movie. It knows it's audience and plays to it really well and despite a few hiccups and possibly overstaying it's welcome a little, the people it's made for will enjoy it. If I Stay gets a 3.5...out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Music
teen melodrama of life and death,"Mia Hall (Chloë Grace Moretz) is a cellist. Adam Wilde is a locally-known indie rocker and the new kid in school. He falls for Mia hard. Her best friend is Kim Schein (Liana Liberato). She's stressed about getting into Juilliard. Her parents (Mireille Enos, Joshua Leonard) are formerly alternative folks. They talk her into a family outing on a snow day and they get into an accident.Chloë Grace Moretz puts her incalculable charms at work. She brings as much life as possible to the rather conventional young adult melodrama. The romance doesn't have the best chemistry. It would help if Jamie Blackley is a more compelling actor. The flashback structure doesn't have enough drama to offer. The movie slowly runs out of story rather than build to a climax. The only question is whether she lives or dies.

Meehh,"Greetings from Lithuania.""If I Stay"" (2014) is so sweet and cheezee that unfortunately it comes as a disappointment for me. There is absolutely no chemistry between two leads, and when a movie about love and life has no chemistry between lovers, it's a problem.""If I Stay"" is nothing new, nothing original, just an empty eye candy at running time 1h 40 min. It drags. The pacing is OK but the screenplay is so predictable, so one dimensional and cheezee that at moments i had my eyes rolling over the screen. Chloë Grace Moretz has nothing to do in this flick, it's definitely far from her best.Overall, for 14 years old girls this will do just fine, for all older i can say, you can safely skip this. It's not a bad movie by any means, just unfortunately it's very predictable, it has nothing new or exciting to offer and at running time 100 min. it drags and repeats itself - it has well intentions, but unfortunately it just doesn't click.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Worth staying for,"It was a real intense roller coaster of emotions raging form sappy to happy, to sad, to dark.I like that the movie had a music base to it. I enjoyed the story of the main character, Mia's passion for the Cello, which only seemed to contradict her parents passion for Punk Rock. Although not really a fan of the indi rock scene a lot of the movie focused on It did not halt my enjoyment overall.Huge fan of Chloë Grace Moretz who plays Mia. Mostly because of her role as Hit girl in the Kick Ass movies, but it was cool to see her do other things. She has a real connection with the kid who played Adam, which made their own screen relationship entertaining to watch.Romance is not really my thing, and it gets a little to sappy when it revolves around teen love stories, but I thought it was worked well.Like the ghost story element as well. It was touching to see how fulling a person's life can be in such a small period of time, not just for her but for people around her.This was a good one.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
to watch,"I really, really loved this book version. I remember, when I read it, i couldn't even breathe, because was crying so hard. Was really looking for the adaptation. So the movie? Well, yeah, it was something. Not so sure which something, but not the 'oh-gosh-this-shook-my-world' kinda feeling. I mean, I really loved Mia, she was this cute girl you can relate to easily, but she also got this freaking talent with her love, the cello. Basically she was the girl I loved in the book. Chloe was amazingly good in playing her, it was good to see that something can be made exactly the way you imagine while reading. But Adam? Hey, Hollywood you sure can do better! It was like watching the twilight series again, (not like it didn't hurt enough for the first time). And it wasn't because of the two love-struck teenagers who fall madly in love in a very young age. Nope. This feeling come to me, because Jamie Blackley resembled Kristen Stewart so sadly much. OMG! NO FACIAL EXPRESSION! NO ACTING! Remember, when you went out on a cold winter day for too long to play in the snow and then for hours you couldn't move the muscles on your face, because they froze? This was Adam. He already was someone. Probably at the beginning of the shooting he was someone already, and couldn't change his face during the movie, because he was cool like that. Uhm, big, fat no. His character is a shallow, love seeking, insecure, possessive asshole, who cannot get over himself. And it sure as hell didn't come from the book. Where did you put the kind, loving, caring boy he was, dear film-makers? This point was the biggest disappointment of this film. On the bright side Adam Wild fans, Jamie has a strong, catching voice, you can believe him having a career in music. As for the soundtracks, pretty much all the song were great. Even if this wasn't Shooting Stars, just some weird Willamette Stone. Loved the classical music blend into all this modern drama. At some points I felt right it wasn't really worked out everywhere. Some places are not clear how they can explain, if they do a second movie from Where she went. And maybe there were too much memories and not enough time in the hospital to give time to the viewer to let this tragedy sink in. Or maybe it's just me knowing the inner fight this girl had going on while deciding if she stays or not. That's for sure, that there where great lines with excellent timing in If I stay. Somewhere I was just so shocked about how artfully the power of these sentences were emphasized. OH, and loved the parents, their characters were amazing wish-i-had-them- here as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A lot of music and tears in this teenage romance tearjerker love story.,"A Warner Brothers/MGM film. 'If I Stay' is a tearjerker film about a teenage-girl who experiences an out-of-body experience whilst in a coma.The teenage-girl is played well by Chloe Grace Moretz. As film opens we discover that she is part of a sickly-sweet family that seems just too perfect. Off out together, they are involved in an accident. Miss Moretz's character, Mia Hall, comes to, but does not understand why she is being ignored by the emergency services, as she stumbles about in a dream-like state. Seeing herself, she starts to understand, as she goes to the hospital. These scenes all occur at the start of the film, the rest of the film is based at the hospital, with the majority of the film being flash-backs.Director RJ Cutler has done a good job here. The scenes at the accident are, as said, rather dream-like, thus capturing the confused state of Miss Hall. Miss Moretz captures well the disorientation of her character. Both Director Mr Cutler and actress Miss Moretz capture well the out-of-body experience. As a disembodied spirit, Mia Hall has no physical abilities thus travel can only be achieved via open doors etc.Thus, 'If I Stay' is completely different from 'Ghost' and 'Truly, Madly, Deeply', both of 1990. Those films were about the interaction of living breathing humans and the spirits of dead humans. Not so in this film. 'If I Stay' does however share one thing with both of those other films, a love story.Flashbacks tell us that the teenage schoolgirl Mia Hall, has fallen in love with older boy Adam, played by Jamie Buckley. The two were attracted to each other, and did fall in love, but were troubled with what might be described as musical differences. Thus this film has a major musical plot-line that reminds of the recently screened 'Begin Again'. The films are similar in many ways, the major one being that we viewers get to hear a fair bit of music. Mia and boyfriend Adam are both musicians, though very different ones. However the music does provide one further link to 'Truly, Madly, Deeply'.The two young lovers are ably supported by a great cast, all of whom are good, but special mention should go to those playing family members. Joshua Leonard plays Mia's father. He and the Director got the flashback scenes just right, they are also funny, as we see the younger wild rocker turn into the more sedate parent. Hair-styles in those scenes was particularly good. Mireille Enos, playing the mother, has some poignant scenes with her daughter. However the most emotional scenes were with veteran actor Stacy Keach. He gives a stand-out performance, particularly in one very emotional and very important scene.Preparing for her role in Kick Ass (2010), Miss Moretz trained with a stunt-crew for three months and also did most of her own stunts. For her musical role in 'If I Stay', Miss Moretz is also reported to have engaged in much musical study. Last year she gave a tremendous performance in the 2013 remake of 'Carrie'. Here, in 'If I Stay', we once again see Miss Moretz play a somewhat shy girl, that sometimes seems dreamily unaware, but that at other times capture perfectly the utmost depths of the rawest of emotions.Shauna Cross wrote the screenplay of the Gayle Forman novel. Director RJ Cutler has done a great job. Outside shots, particularly those featuring different seasons, were done well, ably capturing the sense of passing time.This teenage love-story shares a supernatural spiritual love story like 'Ghost' and 'Truly, Madly, Deeply'. Like 'TMD' it also has some hauntingly beautiful music. The film is also about music and could be described as a teenage version of 'Begin Again'. If you liked any of those films, then 'If I Stay' will appeal to you.This tearjerker deserves 10/10 but needs a hanky.",,Anonymous,Music
Just a lot of awkward cuts and a lot of kissing,"7/10 I was actually really excited for this movie, me being a fan of both the book and Chloe. I thought I was in for a real tearjerker. But some parts, I felt myself get bored and think of other things, or I'd long for the particular scene to be over. And to be honest, Mia was looking like a little girl compared to Adam. My friend and I had also agreed that there were too many kissing scenes that seemed that have just made the movie unnecessarily longer than it needed it to be.There were also a lot of good things about the movie too, though (hence the rating). Chloe and Jamie had perfect chemistry with each other and their relationship developing was one of my favourite things about the movie. I also loved how it stayed true to the book, the message and the little details that were weaved into the movie. Some of the pain Mia was feeling had pierced through my heart as well, but not all of it. The ending, also, was another one of my favourites, and you'll understand why if you've read the book and watched the movie both.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"What prevents 'If I Stay' from overcoming the stigma of a teen film is its inability to abandon the clichés of the genre. However, it is a good and emotional drama for sure","Even released in 2009, three years before John Green's novel ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" the adaptation of Gayle Forman's bestselling ""If I Stay,"" piggybacks on Josh Boone's film and appears as another short story. Generic style, which narrates the life of a young couple being hampered by a tragedy. The feature films based on the stories of Nicholas Sparks conquered audiences around the world and generated offspring in and out of literature.The adaptation of If I Stay is made for a teenage audience, and should fully appeal to a younger and female audience, but the plot also has enough elements to also attract the attention of a wider slice of the audience. Its differential can be in the rhythm, slower and contemplative - but not sleepy - or in the tone of the speech, admittedly romantic and reflective. The direction makes room for necessary breaths in a plot like this, in addition to the cast having a rare harmony, all in connection with what is to come. Although it does away with the surprise element of the story - something already eliminated in the synopses or even in the promotional trailer - at least it serves to prepare the audience for the drama that will develop until its conclusion, answering with emphasis the question posed by the conditional of the title.Featuring the star Chloë Grace Moretz, who plays the protagonist Mia, and directed by RJ Cutler, known for directing television series such as ""Nashville"", this equally disparate film, ""If I Stay"", introduces us to the beautiful and sad story of the family. Hall. They who apparently live everyday grace have their structure literally shaken by a terrible event, which takes us by surprise and creates a general apprehension - at least in the second act, which proves to be distressing. That's because Cutler devotes a lot of screen time to introducing and deepening the characters. Rocker couple Denny (Joshua Leonard) and Kat Hall (Mireille Enos) are naturally happy and humanly flawed, but they have a huge love for their children and easily win us over. The same is true of the grandparents played by the beloved duo Gabrielle Rose and Stacy Keach, who convey sweetness and simplicity.The screenplay by Shauna Cross, the same as What to Expect When You're Expecting (2012), a retrospective that accurately indicates her very feminist view of the facts. In If I Stay, however, the two focus not only on what will happen after the tragedy, but also on the unfolding of events that involved this girl until that moment. The focus, as it could not fail to be in a case like this, is on the almost angelic courtship with the heartthrob Adam (Jamie Blackley), on the always affectionate relationship with her parents (Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard) and on the conflict about her future. Professional: born to a hippie mother and a drummer father and in love with a rocker, she is, however, an excellent cellist, and dreams of pursuing a career in classical music.Something that draws attention here, on the part of the directors, is how R. J. Cutler decides to continue with the narrative. By using the flashback feature a lot, we have the impression that the story walks in a non-linear format, which is a tremendous success. By only giving clues and revealing the plot little by little, the filmmaker piques the viewer's curiosity, who constantly tries to understand what the meaning of the story is to be taken in that way. Or even arouses interest in knowing, after all, what will happen or has happened in those people's lives. The film builds its own rhythm where the two times work well. The way Mia goes to and from the accident is also very well-constructed, demonstrating that she is stuck in her emotions and not exactly in a physical space. It is not by chance that every time the light calls her, something new appears in her memory. And, even moving in a style that needs a strong melodramatic content, Cutler maintains a surprising aesthetic and cinematic elegance. Aided by the photography of the experienced John de Borman, who has worked in the genre for a long time, he knows how to vary the tones and give the atmosphere required for each movement.With narratives in first and third person, the plot is driven almost exclusively by Mia's memories making the story transit between past and present. Mia's retrospective begins with the most important day of her life: the day she got her cello and how everything has changed since then. Her thoughts wander through the unforgettable and happy routines with her parents and siblings, until the day she met the person who would completely change her life and her dreams: Adam (Jamie Blackley), a young man a little older than her, cool, full of friends, handsome and lead singer of a famous band in his state. In other words, just like her parents, someone completely different from her and from everything she liked to hear the most: classical music.The beauty of the film is, among many beautiful messages, the respect for different personalities and ways of life. Mia was a completely different girl from her and Adam's parents, but that wasn't why she was unhappy. On the contrary: everyone knew how to live with it very well, respecting and learning from each other. In addition, the film portrays that, for a relationship to work, both sides need to know how to give in and respect the other's space, in addition to allowing themselves to learn about the other's world without having to give up their world or what they like. And believe. This teaching is present not only in Mia and Adam's love relationship, but also in her relationship with her parents, grandparents and friends.At this point, the script slips a little in excess of drama, especially in relation to the teenage couple. The relationship between the two is beautiful, delicate and full of clichés and corny phrases, with the script appealing too much to the emotions of the viewer. I mean, the story is already sad by nature, the addendums that scream ""cry now"" are completely unnecessary and end up having the opposite effect - they cut the mood of the whole thing. The excess of romance and clichés written for the duo of protagonists may work on the pages, but aloud they sound cliché and unbelievable. Some moments border on the shame of others. Even so, the teen couple convinces about their love and it is pleasant to follow the birth of this romance, with all the discussions and obstacles common to any relationship. All this is thanks to the actors Jamie Blackley and Chloë Grace Moretz, who blend in well on the scene and develop their characters perfectly.Classical music and rock are essential elements to establish Mia's relationship with the world and its consequent existential questions. As she dreams of Ludwig van Beethoven, her parents praise Iggy Pop and her boyfriend has epiphanies to the tune of ""I Wanna Be Sedated."" The musical references are believable, not just random mentions, which gives the film admirable credibility. Moretz, who balances finesse and strength well, also makes sure her character doesn't look like a fool when wielding a cello.Although it is predictable in the succession of its events, it is impossible not to get emotional in one passage or another of If I Stay - especially in the final participation of the veteran Stacy Keach, as the grandfather in his final goodbye. However, even admittedly sad and melodramatic, the plot reserves very tender situations, such as the sequence of happiness around the campfire or family interactions - the parents are simply inspired. Moretz, on the other hand, is a delicate type, but it is far from accurately reflecting a dilemma as crucial as the one her character is supposed to be facing - she rather runs from one side to the other, like a ghost lost between two worlds, rather than imposing itself as a soul in conflict. However, without demanding too much from the audience, it is a friendly film in its construction, which unfolds without major setbacks, efficiently fulfilling expectations.What prevents If I Stay from overcoming the stigma of a teen film is its inability to abandon the clichés of the genre, such as the wordy off-screen narrative and the manipulation of tears, with scenes that clearly seek to leave the audience in tears. Still, it's surprising, being more complex than its supernatural beat-up premise. More than an interesting film, with hits and misses, ""If I Stay"" can very well be analyzed as a reflection of its time. From a time when women don't need to be useless creatures who wait for their princes charming, nor put aside their dreams for their loves. A more in-depth work with the protagonist, a more polished script and a general editing of the clichés would already make big differences in the drama of R. J. Cutler. Does it make you cry? Yes. But it's not enough: it could be much more.If I Stay is a teen romance like many we've seen around these days, which makes us think about this new generation so pessimistic and melancholy about life and love. As if you had to die a little, or give up a lot to live an intense relationship. In any case, it manages to function in its main intention to thrill with a sad and beautiful love story. From a time when social networks are supporting true relationships, not substitutes for relationships. And even more important: from a time when loss, death, life and everything that is really worthwhile is discussed, even if it is necessary to raise feelings to the maximum potential, just like teenagers do.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazing,"When it first came out I read the book, cried then went to see the movie where I cried yet again. The chemistry between the characters in the film is one of those which I don't think you see very often in a film. Normally films which are based on books aren't actually that similar but I thought it was fairly similar. I loved the story line and the drama in the film. It's most definitely one that I would watch again. I would recommend it to friends and family being the socialite that I am. Typical college girl me. Sigh. Look I you want to rate the film just watch it because I personally thought it was fabulously entertaining. At times it was slightly boring and hard to understand, although I would've liked a tiny bit more action. Just a little.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Very emotional and touching at times, but somewhat forgettable","Based on the novel by Gayle Forman, If I Stay follows 17-year old Mia Hall (played by Chloe Grace Moretz), a violin prodigy who falls for a handsome guy named Adam (played by Jamie Blackely). Their relationship seemingly goes smooth while facing some occasional ups and downs. This is until one afternoon, Mia and her family are critically injured in a car accident while going on a small road trip with her family. While the family manages to survive, Mia becomes stuck in a coma and experiences an out-of-body experience as a ghost. With her family and friends sitting next to her death bed, Mia must decide whether she should wake up back in her body, or leave and go to heaven. This film flashes back and forth from her in her out-of-body experience watching her family and friends while they are in the hospital, to the events leading up the accident.Upon reading the plot, the film sounded interesting enough. The whole premise of the film is intriguing and captures good attention. This film has some very emotional and touching moments throughout, enough to make viewers reach for the tissues. However, it really tries so hard to take advantage of the emotional tone, to the point where it becomes a bit manipulative. Throughout the picture as the main character's family is trying to cope with the tragedy they are about to face, you can strongly feel their emotions; which is a good thing. But then, when you add the slow tone and the constant sappy music score to it, it tries to be emotionally manipulative, especially when you have the romantic plot between the main character and her boyfriend. While you learn to care for the characters, you get so bored out by the constant sappy tone. Chloe Grace Moretz's performance is what I personally found to be the most appealing aspect of the movie. She does a great job at keeping her character alive, even though her character is critically ill. I also enjoyed the performances by Jamie Blackely and Liana Liberato (Kim, Mia's best friend). Lastly, I thought the film is a little predictable. Some scenes are very easy to guess, and if you watch this, you might know what I'm talking about.If I Stay is not terrible movie, but it isn't too great of a movie either. If you watch this, you may enjoy it. But it is not very likely you'll find a reason to watch it again. While this goes on an hour and 47 minutes, it feels so much longer.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Novel to it,"I'm pretty sure the novel worked better than the movie itself. Which is by no way a fault of its main star. Nor the way the story evolves (cannot comment if the structure is the same as the book it is based on, as I haven't read that). It will also be touching and I'm sure you will be moved by how the story is portrayed.Still while we all can relate to many of the given themes here, the movie goes more on the romantic route than the dramatic one. Which is a shame because there are quite a few things that could've been played out better (imho). It's easy to keep up with the time frame, even if it might confuse a few people at first. What's important, is that you're always with the main character (no matter what your stance on religion, after Life and more things are, this is a story, nothing more nothing less). And Chloe takes another step (acting-wise) in the right direction",6.0,Anonymous,Music
May the best genre live,"I was struck and very attached to the beautiful face of Chloe. That is really what got me through the movie, as well as the family dynamics. I don't view it as a possibility to mix a truly classical mind with that of a teenage rock wannabe idol. The two just don't combine well, except, of course, when background is added to some soft rock pieces. So, that is what the movie was about to me: the attempt to mix the two genres.Personally, I see it as impossible at the level one has to understand and memorize centuries old cello solos compared to three or four chord rock songs that really don't tend toward peace. Instead, they're about a mixture of feelings and breakups in a chaotic world, whereas cello solos come from a more profound depth in the soul of the player and listener where God speaks. In order for the real winner to be, the cheapest music had to be dropped, and it was. Let the cello live on.",,Anonymous,Music
Should I stay or should I go???,"""Isn't it amazing how life is one thing and then, in an instant it becomes something else.""If I stay is the latest film adapted from a YA novel, and even though this movie is in no way aimed towards an adult audience, it does have some moments that aren't as superficial as one would expect coming from this genre. Despite of all the clichés and the melodramatic scenes the story works thanks to Chloe Grace Moretz who is able to hold the film together and get us through all the corny moments. Her chemistry with Jamie Blackley on screen works, although in my opinion their moments together weren't actually the best scenes. When the film focused on the relationship with her parents was when I actually was drawn more to the story, and the few scenes she had with her grandfather, played by Stacy Keach, where the highlight of the film. There is actually a very emotional scene near the end where Keach gives a powerful speech which if were in a better film, critics would be talking about award consideration for his small performance here. Of course that won't be the case because we are talking about a YA novel adaptation filled with flaws. Chloe Grace Moretz gives an inspired performance as well and she is actually what holds this film together. She has four more films coming out this year so hopefully we will get plenty of more opportunities to see her shine in better films. She is an actress who has been in my radar since her role in Kick-Ass and I absolutely love her. The romantic part of the film which is the main attraction for young teenage girls is probably the weakest thing about If I stay considering it's full of clichés. The fact that both these characters are in to music helps out the film because the soundtrack stands out, but at times the romance feels like it's part of a music video clip with beautiful scenery and good looking people. If I Stay fails to break out from the genre conventions and the premise might be a bit far stretched to make much logical sense. It is also very manipulative and at times the scenes are basically introduced to force the audience to let out a couple tears. Having been released only a few months after The Fault in Our Stars also hurts this film because it doesn't handle the emotional scenes as well as that film did. Moretz and Keach are basically the only reason why I'm giving this film 3 stars.If I Stay was adapted from Gayle Forman's novel of the same name by Shauna Cross (known for Whip It and What to Expect When You're Expecting). Moretz is Mia, a talented cello player who catches the attention of Adam (Jamie Blackley), the rock star of her High School who is actually getting an important break with his band. Adam falls in love with Mia, the shy and quiet girl from school and they quickly begin a relationship. The love story is told through flashbacks as Mia is going through an out of body experience after she suffered a fatal car accident with her family. Her parents and younger brother are all killed in the accident and she is left in a coma. She must decide whether she continues to fight and stay or if she should let go now that her family is gone. How she is given the power to decide is never really mentioned in the film and doesn't make much sense, but we just have to accept it. The parents are perfect which makes the audience feel Mia's pain and loss. There isn't one scene where her parents look like real people because they are constantly portrayed as these cool and perfect parents. It is perhaps a flaw in this film, but I actually enjoyed the scenes they shared with Moretz. It is all pretty much a fantasy aiming to make the audience cry and feel sorry for Mia, but Moretz's grounded and natural performance elevates this otherwise poor film.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Enter the Void ... this ain't,"Off the top, I cannot think of a film that brought with it higher expectations. In my review of KickAss2, I pointed out that Chloë Grace Moretz was not merely good in the film, she was the ONLY good thing in it, showing a knack for saucy dialog and delivery, and generally (given her age) being willing to go further with her character than other members of the cast twice or three times her age.And I have always had a weak spot for these tales of life between life, Enter the Void, Here Comes Mr. Jordan, Stairway to Heaven, these are some of the films that spring to mind.So, how can you not have a great film here? Easy? Terrible script (so bad it should never have made it to production) along with some really bad casting choices and top it off with some of the worst editing in the history of the medium.That last item is especially important since a film about someone wandering in limbo (real time) while having flashbacks (past time) requires editing at the Oscar level. Here it seems the budget can't even afford an editor NAMED Oscar.Chloë Grace Moretz, who verily stole KickAss2, and had the best lines in KickAss1, seems here lost and completely unconnected with her character or the hapless audience.In fact, it is veteran Stacy Keech who actually steals the few scenes that he has, and for mere moments in an otherwise forgettable exercise makes the viewer CARE about what happens next.Fans of Ms. Moretz (and there are many, including, don't forget, this scribe) need not feel compelled to shoot the messenger (reviewer) here, a quick glance at her bio shows her to be a very hot property now, with multiple projects underway, and many chances in her long career ahead to make up for this travesty.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Live For Love.,"So basically I am wondering why it took me so long to actually watch this film. I'll try to write this with no spoilers.If I Stay is a film based on the book by Gayle Forman. It is about a girl called Mia Hall (Chloe Grace Moretz) and how her life changes after her whole family is in a car accident, leaving her in a coma. She is having an out-of-body experience and must decide whether to wake up and live a different life or to end it by not waking up. The choice is all down to her.During her out-of-body experience, she see's her other relatives turn up, her friends and her love, Adam (Jamie Blackley). The film focus' a lot on their love and their journey, with the help of some flashbacks you kind of get how and why they fall in love. They are both into music but at different ends of the spectrum. He is a rock star in a band and she loves classical music and plays the cello (which whoever is playing her music double is AMAZING). It shows the trouble they go through when he goes away and starts to make it big, while she's at school applying for colleges, but there is one in particular college that she wants to go to and that is Juilliard, but that means leaving Adam behind. The flashbacks also show the relationship between her and her parents and her little brother, with her best friend Kate and into some of her memory's, like Halloween and New Year, where she is surrounded with people she loves. It's a true love story on so many levels.I like this film because it has stayed true to the book and oh my it just made me feel all emotions all at once. I couldn't give this any more credit. So tissues at the ready because you will cry.https://gracedoody.wordpress.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Surface level entertainment.,"If I Stay (2014) follows a teenage girl as she has to make the toughest decision of her life after a devastating car crash. This film is alright and is the perfect film to put on when you need a good cry but the performances were mainly poor and it felt too shallow. I have a lot of nostalgia for the book so it was kind of a guilty pleasure!The cinematography was pretty dull and there wasn't much to talk about, which was a shame as I expected stronger colour palettes to create an atmosphere. The lighting was good though and every shot was clear and easy to see, but that was about it.The sound design was decent, but like the cinematography, there wasn't anything notable about it. The sound mixing pretty good and I really liked the soundtrack as I found it added to the emotions quite well.The acting genuinely put me off as it was distractingly poor. The main couple didn't really have any chemistry together and their relationship wasn't believable, it was also very cliché and unoriginal. This wasn't helped by the surface level dialogue that was quite cringeworthy at times, especially in the narration.The film was at least consistently engaging and kept me entertaining, but I do think it could've been a bit shorter. It was easy to digest but still very sad, and I honestly cried like a baby at certain moments even though the emotional moments felt fairly messy. The pacing was also pretty consistent, but I feel it ended way too abruptly. I liked the time jumps too as they added a lot of context in a clear way.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

The Vidiot Reviews...,"If I StayThe worst thing about having to die young is living an eternity wearing nothing but oshkosh b'gosh clothing.Luckily, the half-dead girl in this drama doesn't shop in the kids' section.An aspiring cellist, Mia (Chloë Grace Moretz), is left in limbo after a car accident kills both her parents (Mireille Enos, Jamie Blackley).Near death, Mia oversees her comatose body, as her grandfather (Stacy Keach), best friend (Liana Liberato) and on-again/off-again rock-star boyfriend Adam (Jamie Blackley) wait by her hospital bedside.Reliving the events leading up to the collision, Mia's post-punk parents, her dream of Julliard, and her troubled romance with the touring Adam are explored in-depth.With its facile music factoids and obvious artistic love interest, this adaptation of the YA novel caters to weepy teen girls.However, more discerning minds will find it a trivial idealization of death.Besides, a real teen's life flashing before their eyes mostly consists of them texting.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Boring,"Big yawn. This movie has an unrealistic and fairy tale like story. All the characters had the same ""super duper good guy"" personality. Life is nothing but good, decent, wholesome fun. Everyone is talented. The parents and grandparents have the perfect textbook answers to all problems. Everyone loves everyone else. No one even has a pimple or crooked smile or a hair out of place. All the characters were one dimensional, plot was one dimensional - like in a Disney movie but not as lively. I saw many mothers in the audience with teenage daughters. The girl behind me told her mother "" that was the worst movie ever"". But the mother was crying buckets. If you want a dark quiet place to beat the heat and go to sleep, this movie is for you.

You WILL know what happens next. This movie is to be watched on a lazy Sunday afternoon.I will give credit to the awesome music played and how it was acted by Grace.

I've seen that the main character in 'If I Stay' is also one of the main characters from 'Kick Ass'. I think it will be quite hard for the girl to change her characters. Going from a kick ass super hero with awesome moves to a on the edge dying girl. Lets see if she can pull it off.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Not a chic flick movie type but liked the movie,"I don't usually go to chic flick style movies (prefer horror) but this one was pretty good (didn't cry but came close :) so even if you're not into this type movie usually - it's worth checking out. I originally just went to just to see how they depicted the outer body experience but actually turned out liking the whole movie. (Must be getting soft in my old age :) but I would recommend this one, but most people will need tissues. Good story line great outer body depiction decent acting. My only critique would be parents reactions to things going on were a bit unrealistic even for liberal parenting. Overall still a good movie even for a chic flick, coming from someone who doesn't usually like chic flicks AT ALL.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
VERY TOUCHING,"IF I STAY is a very touching movie. My heart was ""in my throat"" three times at least but I won't go into detail. Watch it and you'll get it.Overall, I think the actors did a great job. The girl who played Mia was exceptional. I was surprised to see a few of the actors had minimal roles, like her grandmother. That sort of confused me; I expected her to be sitting next to Mia comforting her and talking to her while she lay in the hospital bed fighting for her life.One minor detractor, since Mia is out of body and spiritual I was wondering why others moved out of her way while she was running through the hospital but I let that go, the film was that good.I enjoyed the music esp. The cello. You seldom hear classical played in most flicks. That was a plus. If you are looking for a good heartfelt film, IF I STAY is right up your alley!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
If you watch,"I went into this blind. I knew nothing about the book it was based upon. It didn't take long before I realized this might not be my thing. It's obviously aimed at a younger audience. Judging by this I will assume the book is also one of those Young Adult type things. That isn't necessarily bad; I've enjoyed several of those movies over the years. This one, though, missed the mark. The narration and music obsession totally got on my nerves. We get it: you like music. 786 references is overkill. It doesn't even feel sincere. Chloe Moretz does a less than impressive job. She's one of the younger actors today whose career I can see either lasting a long time or fizzling out within a few years. We'll see. Her parents here are terrible. The dad is played by the guy from Blair Witch Project. I didn't even know he was still around. Stacy Keach gives the most memorable performance in the movie as the grandfather. The guy she falls madly in love with is a poorly written cliché of a Cameron Crowe character. He has no chemistry with Chloe and their love story is inane. Really, the whole script is just pretentious drivel that tugs on the heart strings with no subtlety at all. It's also overlong and often dull. It makes A Walk to Remember look like a classic.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Cello Love,"Kat: You're going to go to Julliard and play the hell out of your cello. Or, you're not. You're gonna stay with Adam and have lots of amazing adventures. Or you're not. Or maybe tomorrow, the Earth's gonna smash into a meteor, or it's not. Life is this big fat gigantic stinking mess. But that's the beauty of it too. Whatever you do, I support you. Either way, you win. And also either way there's something that you lose. What can I say, baby? True love's a bitch.This is my favorite quote in If I Stay and it epitomizes the reasons I really enjoyed this film. The story follows Mia Hall (Chloe Grace Moretz) bred from a rock and roll family who ends up with a love for playing the cello. Her parents Kat and Denny Hall (Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard) are very supportive and cool who allow their daughter to be who she really is. They understand her undeniable passion for the cello and never once put her down despite the fact that it sometimes annoys them. Mia on the other hand, does not quite seem to see what her parents do. I observed her to be insecure, unsure, and overly critical of herself. Then she meets Adam (Jamie Blackley) a cute rocker who is the complete opposite. For me personally, there was something lacking in their chemistry with each other. I'm wondering if that is because Mia's character feels out of place amongst Adam's clan...perhaps a feeling she felt her entire life with her family? Either way...I didn't 100 percent connect to their love for each other. Early on in the film, we witness Mia and her family in an accident that leaves her outside her body watching on as doctors strive to revive her from the coma she is left in. The film then transitions back and forth between the past and her current state after the accident. I feel the film hit the nail on the head with happy moments shared in a loving family. The film is a tearjerker for sure but I found these family scenes absolutely beautiful as it reminds us that life can change at the drop of a hat. That is why we need to make the most of our time while we are here. Overall, the performances were great with a special nod to Chloe Grace Moretz. She was consistent in her portrayal of Mia and powerful at the times she needed to be. The only other thing I disliked was that I felt this was story that had been told before. It wasn't as original as I would have liked it to be but that didn't take away from me enjoying the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
What would you sacrifice for your art?,"This film was not supposed to be as good as it was. I expected to be disappointed, but I can say I was impressed and moved deeply. So what if her face (Moretz) was digitally imposed on a real cellist. Moretz did take lessons, but was not screen ready. I respect that sort of commitment to a part. I've played for 30 years, so I know the time needed exhibit such bow control. (We did see the orignal baroque bowing of the Prelude)A teenage romance that ends too soon for their teenage hearts. The boy is destructive and the girl is a loner, but music brings them together. Reminded me of August Rush, just with teens. We can experience the awkwardness of teen romance that appears to be true love. Regardless, this is more than a film about teens in love, far more. We learn of the sacrifice a family makes for their children, for music.The film is emotional, yes, verily, with a simple storyline, so be ready to enjoy this film once, and leave it there. It is simply too dramatic, too close to the heart, to heavy to watch on repeat. With that said, it is a beautiful film, perfectly packaged for an ""Insta-gratification Generation"" while appealing to Xennials and Milenials alike.And it is all tied together with good music: Saint-Saëns Concerto N°1, Beethoven Cello Sonata N°3 in A Major, and the Kodály Solo Sonata. We enjoy the Kodály twice and quite prominently actually. We witness the only ever cello audition, ever in a film. We are with Mia and her family as they record her audition, and we witness the importance of a little brother's encouragement.I know what that is like because I lived Mia's life, sans the romance. My family believed in me, encouraged me, stood backstage and gave in-car pep talks. They let me wander off and listen to the 3rd Beethoven, for months as I dreamed of a music school in California. I experienced that same ""out-of-body"" feeling Mia felt during her in-person audition. I know what it is like to play your guts out and leave it all on the stage. And I know the joy of winning that audition too. :-)I am a cellist, who song writes on guitar, who lost a father to brain cancer, who auditioned for uni and WON with the same Beethoven A Major Sonata Mia loves so much. Music has brought me back to so many times, and cello is always bring me closer to my late father.Plus, my family owned a green Ford Taurus wagon, and I love the Smashing Pumpkins.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Thought provoking about fate,"I am watching this as a 53 yr old female more identifying with the parents and grandparents than the young female lead. It's a movie about choices and the balance of following your dreams in youth and the reality of obligation and sacrifice as you grow up because some things just need to be done--because of other choices made in your youth. The balance of not living with regret is also presented against selfishness (in the best way) to put yourself first and yes, that is okay. The ""other"" parallel story about how life can be changed in an instant highlights these issues. I enjoyed the film and it made me reflect on my own life choices and sacrifices. The actors did a very good job in each of their roles. Young love is messy and awkward and hard when your life isn't settled yet. The harsh reviews are unjustified.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"It's different and worth-watching for all people with vision and feelings, nowadays.","If you are looking for a romantic movie to watch in a lonely night, this is it! The best approach of the movie was decision making so I say it's self raising. It's realistic and touchy because it's the kind of a life that teenagers would like to live so what happens when 'this life' breaks apart? Decisions are made regarding our fate and life goes on. The chemistry between the boy and Mia was everything. If you're looking for a different love story, go for this film. It has nothing with teenagers being very sexually involved or making big dreams come true. It says falling in love with the wrong person is not always wrong, so why not love it?

Indie filmmaking at its mediocreness,"Independent films have been able to find a market lately as a source of bold original cinema. If I Stay is neither bold and only mildly original as a story of a teenage girl, her relationship with her indie-rock boyfriend, and an out-of-body experience. The camera work is amateurish and cheap at times, even by indie standards, and the movie mostly relies on Chloe Moretz narcissistic acting and Portland's hipster culture to the point where it comes off as contrived and haughty. There are a few redeeming plot elements and it will definitely tug at the heartstrings, but movies like this are better suited to the Hallmark Channel.In the end, it's nothing more than a tear-jerking Chloe Moretz vehicle trying to be the Fault in our Stars (which is a much better film).",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Started Out Really Good, but then became Average","Mia Hall (Moretz) has a decision to make: attend Julliard for music (cello) or stay with boyfriend Adam (Blackley) an almost successful rocker for life. A car accident puts her into a coma and in an out-of-body experience, she has the capacity to decide what course to take and is able to run the halls of the hospital to find out what happened to the rest of her family who were also in that accident.Here's the thing: Mia's father Denny (Joshua Leonard) gave up his rock band music and sacrificed his career for the sake of his family most notably Mia because Mia had the talent on the cello and could go far. Will Mia give up Julliard and stay with Adam? Will Adam give up his rock band and support Mia? This is the story in a nutshell. What do you want Mia to do assuming she wakes up from the coma?We see Mia in the hospital with flashbacks to her time with family and with Adam so we don't lose anything. We see it all. We really like her family who are super supportive and we see that Mia can talk to her mother Kat (Mirelle Enos) about boys. (kidding, right?)We see the stirrings of first love between Mia and Adam and the dialogues, eye-to-eye contact and facial expressions went a long way to our liking this union. Then later, decisions have to be made and the relationship becomes strained and it is here we are not too keen about Adam. Hey, we are all about Team Mia. (thought so)The movie while good is too long and didn't have to be. A downside that didn't make any sense to me was when Adam tried to get to Mia's bedside and was turned away often. The family (or the author of the book this is based on) didn't see the value of a loved one at the bedside of a coma victim until way into the end of the movie. Maybe the family knew about the break-up and didn't want Adam there. Maybe. Still I would think that everything should be done to help a patient out of a coma.Miss Moretz is truly an exceptional actress and we'll see much more of her in the future. The entire cast was very good and we were not bored any time they were on screen. It was the length of the too long script that put this into the ""average"" category as the pacing was too drawn out.Notables: Liana Liberato as Kim, Mia's best friend; and Stacy Keech, Mia's ""gramps"", who came up with a very good bedside pleading. It's okay to have a box of Kleenex nearby at this time.This started out really good and became average.The last scenes involve Adam and Mia whereby Adam had finally written a song about Mia and sings it to her at her bedside. Mia hears the song, and we and she see the bright light and then the camera comes back to focus on Mia's face and then (7/10)Violence: No. Sex: Yes, but nothing is seen.

"Yes, it's cheesy - but it touches you","It's not that I don't agree with many of the reviews, this movie is for sure not an award worthy masterpiece at all. And it get's cheesy to a certain degree, you can even argue if Chloe Grace Moretz was the right choice for the part playing the shy misfit (altough I think she did a terrific job).But I have to admit, that movie got to me, I just couldn't hold back my tears in many scenes, that said being a married man in my 30s.I don't know why, but I just felt the pain and sadness in it, especially when seeing the flashbacks that are beautifully build up.The end is a little abrupt, maybe more than you'd expect and are comfortable with, but it makes sense in itself when you see the whole movie.So, I guess this movie is not for everyone, but if you let go and feel with the characters it will touch you, and that's the most important part to me.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

I guess because it was based on a relatively? successful book.Don't get be wrong, part of this is OK. It does a good job of capturing cute teenage romance, and the two actors are actually adorable and incredibly relatable. But the script is just actually painful. Two star-crossed lovers from different walks of life end up seeing past each other's differences and step out of their own comfort zones and end up in a relationship. ""The you you are now is the same you i was in love with yesterday, the same you i'll be in love with tomorrow."" Yawn.There isn't much else to say.

good adaptation,"This was a good adaptation of the book by Gayle Forman. I think the movie captures it well, as does the cast. I like the way the movie flashes back and forth in between the hospital scenes and the story behind the love interests' story. Chloe Grace Moretz is a good choice to play the lead as a gifted cello player who gets an audition for Julliard, and it causes friction between her and her boyfriend, who's the lead singer in a band. Her father was in a band too. Chloe is involved in a horrific car accident and has an out-of-body experience and learns how much everyone cares for her, the fate of everyone else involved, and the hardest decision she had to make.

It's a quite nice movie.,"""If I Stay"" is such a great movie to watch which teaches us about life decision. I can say that I've learned a lesson in my life from watching this movie. It is about whether what exactly we want to do, follow our dream or follow our heart. But what is important is that what we follow always affects people around us and Of course ourselves. If our decision makes everyone and us happy so why not choosing it? Mia wants to give up (die) but just because of Adam, who is her boyfriend, makes her fight for life again. Life is not about ending up so easily because we have our choice and we should have solutions for the problems. Everything not just ends up by the death.

"Sappy, teenage love story","Chloë Grace Moretz gave a decent performance and that is why I did not rate this movie lower. The underlying theme is a straight forward teenage romance with two very encouraging parents who seem more than thrilled that their daughter has bagged a punk rock lead singer of a local Portland band. Much of the film is basically run of the mill teenage fantasy fluff that was intended to appeal to the youth demographic. This is the kind of movie that money minded studio executives dream up and from their success at the box office, they got what they wanted.The thematically heavier material like death, out of body experience and the bereavement of losing all of one's family is strangely only incidental and treated as an appendage to the teenage love story. Sixteen year olds looking to get laid on a date my have use for this material, but I would give this film a pass if are looking to be entertained or thoughtfully provoked.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent portrayal,"There is nothing really exceptional about this movie, nothing that really stands out, and probably nothing all that memorable. But it just does what it does so very well. The acting is excellent, the directing really shows the difference between two nearly-opposite worlds and the difficulty of love vs career.I do wish more emphasis had been placed on the family at the beginning; they could have made the movie a bit longer or taken some time out of the relationship difficulties and put it into forming a tighter family bond to start with. So it wasn't perfect. But if someone has a heart rather than an adrenaline pump... this will definitely play the strings like a bow on a cello.I'll admit, I happen to love cello music so perhaps that was part of my appreciation. But there are enough 8 to 10 star reviews on here to let me know I'm not alone.This is a good film, better than most I've seen over the last several months. Good story, good directing, great result. If you love romantic movies, this is well worth the time.

I would leave,"I didn't know anything about this movie except that Chloe was in it. So I figured I'd give it a shot, since I really liked her performance in Let me in, and Equalizer.It started out really okay, not too cheesy,in a not too over the top teen romance kind of way. I haven't read the book, so I don't know how close the movie follows the book. Sadly instead of trying to be original,it borrows from Flashdance and a few othersBy that I mean, cute talented girl who have doubts about pursuing her dream, and questions if she is talented enough. Flashdance had way better music score in it though. But they share some of the same clichés,which I think its a bit sadMia the quiet nerdy girl, falls in love with Adam the cool rocker guy. whom has the typical leather jacket(Hollywood's way of saying he's a rocker/rebel)With the broken home background. I found it a bit cool though, that Mia's parents was OK with her dating a older boy.Thats is a rare quality in moviesThe only problem I had with the relationship, was that you can clearly see he's way older. Like too old, to go in the same school older. The chemistry between them, isn't all that either.. But they didn't really have the whole, deeply-in-love-for-the-first- time-chemistry.Got the impression they were just going through the motions And the characters are kind of shallowMy biggest problem with the movie was,actually the whole stereotype clichés recipe they have used.Just to make it teen bait.= The boyfriends are always the one who starts an argument, the girls is always the victim. The boy always have to do something insanely romantic to apologize.I'm probably too old to be the target audience, but I would like for once to see the girl be the rocker instead of always the boy.

"Teens, and die-hard fans of the book, might fall for this sappy junk; but everyone else will be bored!","'IF I STAY': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Teen melodrama flick, based on the popular YA novel (of the same name) by Gayle Forman. It tells the story of a teenager who has a major 'out-of-body experience', after being in a severe car accident, in which she must decide whether to go on living, or die; as her family did. It stars Chloe Grace Moretz, as the teen, and costars Jamie Blackley, Mireille Enos, Joshua Leonard, Liana Liberato and Stacey Keach. It was directed by R.J. Cutler and written by Shauna Cross (who also wrote the outstanding 2009 teen drama flick 'WHIP IT', and the novel it was based on). I found this movie to be pretty boring, and excessively cheesy as well.Moretz plays Mia Hall; a teenager that's in love with classical music, and playing cello, despite the fact that her parents, Kat (Enos) and Denny (Leonard), are really into rock music; and her dad was in a mildly successful alternative rock band (when he was younger). She falls in love with a rocker from school, as fate would have it, named Adam Wilde (Blackley). Just when she's deep into making really tough and dramatic teenage decisions, about her new love life, her family is involved in a horrific car accident; and Mia falls into a coma. She then experiences life 'out-of-body' and must decide whether to keep living, or pass on; as her parents did. Mia's past life is told through flashbacks.I like the premise of the movie, and I do like well made films adapted from young-adult novels, but this movie is just poorly made. It's way too melodramatic and badly paced; it's even excruciatingly dull at times. Both the director and the writer have made better movies than this, but they really dropped the ball here! I also like Moretz, in other films as well, but she gives a pretty unimpressive performance here too. Stacey Keach is the only person that does anything impressive, in this movie, but his part is too brief. Teens, and die-hard fans of the book, might fall for this sappy junk; but everyone else will be bored.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/yW1G90SYF_o",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Doesn't translate to the printed page,"""If I Stay"" offers believable characters and a narrative that is enjoyable at times, and occasionally interesting, but is undercut by its silly central premise, that the movie barely shows anyway. It's as if the filmmakers knew it wasn't working, and just tacked it on out of obligation to the source text.Indeed, it's the kind of thing that works better on the printed page than up on the screen. The main character is involved in a car crash which puts her whole family on life support. She wanders around as an invisible ghost - though people still stop and move out of her way, clearly able to see her - and wonders if she should come back to earth.See, on the printed page you aren't noticing that a character is supposed to be invisible, and yet extras can still see her. The camera captures everything its pointed at; the writer directs your attention much more easily.The movie is mostly flashbacks anyway, making you wonder why the ghost stuff was even necessary.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Not As Good As It Could Have Been,"Here's the thing, in the movie Field of Dreams, with Kevin Costner, everyone was perfect. Each role done to perfection – all except the wife. Bottom line is she simply tried too hard. Her supposed enthusiasm was irritating to the point of absurdity. The one bad note in an otherwise perfect symphony. In this picture, If I Stay, that honor went to the mother. As the wife who supposedly was part of the wild live band scene in previous years, she overplayed her part to equal imperfection as that mention above. She bopped around, acting like an aging hippy more than anything and it, again, struck the one false note in the melody. Other than that, my only concern was this movie rather dragged on. I mean, it was a tad short of plot – the girl dies, does she stay? Does she go? So it sort of lagged here and there. I guess I was expecting more somehow and I was a bit disappointed with this one. I had so looked forward to it, and it isn't a bad movie, just not what it could have been, I think. Light on action, heavy on emotion, it's okay. But that's all I can say.

Tedious and Horrible,"Incredibly boring until the final act. I foolishly thought the ending would at least *partly* justify the time invested (read wasted), but NOOOO ... they messed that up too! While is there IS technically an ending, it's so short and predictable that it's completely unsatisfying.I don't understand the positive reviews here; I LIKE sappy films. I also like Chloë Grace Moretz. But crucial information is withheld about what becomes (post-""ending"") of the major characters. In other words, this film PUNISHES you for caring about them. Whoever made these decisions should fired.The acting and cinematography are fine; it's the (lack of) story that's the problem. The film is structured in a bifurcated linear way --- present time and ""flashback time"" -- both move forward. The jumping back-and-forth between the two timelines is supposed to liven things up, but it doesn't.The best part of the film is a heartfelt speech by Stacy Keach. Normally, I would add a bonus star for that, but NOT with that crap ending -- it's inexcusable given the copious time wasted earlier in the film. FYI, I realize they were going for an ""implied future"" ending, but there are MANY possible outcomes that one might extrapolate here; some good, some bad. There is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. I feel completely cheated (another reviewer said ""violated""). I give this ONE (1) star.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Not Bad,"I like the characters and the story. Being a musician myself, it was pretty relatable and fun to watch.

I think this film was pretty realistic too (other than the fact that Mia gets in Juliard and Adam becomes a popstar which is a little...far fetched might I say). Mia basically had a normal life, until the day of the car crash. Shows how unexplainable accidents like this happen in real life, and there's nothing we can do to control it. What matters is how we handle those situations - that's what the film is trying to say, I think. The problem I had with this movie is that it felt slow paced, and when it was over I didn't feel particularly amazed. I was just like okay, that's it? Kind of predictable.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
I'm sorry Chloë - but this was underwhelming,"First I'll have to say that I'm a big Chloë Grace Moretz fan. And shes the only reason I considered watching this movie. Her acting has always been top notch. And you can really see that this is a girl that works hard to stay that way. But,The step from a child to adult is a hard one for every actor and actress. The things that was really good a couple of years ago, is not impressing anymore. You have to evolve, or you'll end your career as an A-star.In this movie she showed the first bit of weakness when it comes to facial expressions. In a life changing moment, she often turns to wrinkle her nose or open her mouth slightly. Its not good enough, and frankly, its a little bit disappointing.I'll say this. I think it could be cos of inadequate directing. Cause we all know what ms. Moretz can do when she's led in the right direction. Like her few scenes in The Equalizer, so we know shes still got it.I don't have much to say about the movie. Other than its a generic teen drama with an existential theme that The Fault In Our Stars made so much better use of.

Boring And Poorly Made,"The trailer to this film made it look decent, so I was hoping to enjoy it... But I really didn't. This film just isn't good. It has almost all flaws and very few positives to it.To start off with, the story is an interesting concept, but it's executed in a way that is extremely cliché. The story has your typical plot points that a lot of cheesy romance films have. The fight, the make up, etc. We really don't see a lot of the in between dead and alive kind of stuff, and even that isn't executed. It got so cliché that it started making me incredibly bored. I wanted to yell ""STAY OR DON'T, JUST MAKE A DECISION!"". It really just doesn't work.What make this story worse is the acting. It can be pretty bad. Chloe Moretz just isn't very good. I haven't seen much of her work, but I just don't see why she would be cast in a lead role. She is cute, but her acting just can't hold a film together, especially a film with such an emotion driven plot. I didn't feel for her in the least bit, which completely ruins the film. It was very tough to get through.Another little detail that I couldn't get over was the CGI head. I'm sure you're asking, what does that mean? Let me explain. Chloe plays a character who plays the chello extremely well. I am assuming Chloe doesn't know how to play it, because in scenes where we see her playing it, they obviously CGI her head onto the body of someone who knows how to play, and the issue is, it's extremely obvious. Her head floats and bobs and looks so odd. What's worse is that in shots where it's from the side, you can tell it's not even Chloe at all! They don't attempt to CGI her head from the side, but just leave the different actress who you can tell from the side isn't Chloe. It was so distracting and I couldn't help but laugh at how bad that was.Overall, if you wanna see this film, just watch the trailer and then find out whether she stays or not. The trailer gives you a better emotional journey than the film as a whole does.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Warning: Do Not Watch!,"What are these good reviews even talking about? When I go to a movie theater, I go for entertainment. This movie was not entertaining!

Wandered Drama,"If I Stay has a strong premise, it might as well be compared to Ghost, but this one gives the main character an opportunity either to live even without her family or to die leaving the rest of her loved ones. It gives a vast emotional tone whenever she explores her past and trying to choose between her fate, but it doesn't let the conflict be as stirring as it meant to be. The plot is so burdened with the flashbacks that feels more like one big exposition leading to the tragedy they are facing right now, as for the plot itself it doesn't bring enough intrigue to its actual situation. I know that the film wishes to build more of the drama than the high concept, but it also feels like a huge hindrance from something that is actually interesting to the story. Those big chunks of memory didn't help the story to bloom enough either, and that is how it sadly fail.One of its conspicuous problems is its lack of exploring through its supernatural side. The situation of the character does sound risky, but the film doesn't make the cope feel like it's right there. Definitely, the story has to rely on the backstory of Mia. Those flashbacks do not have much of a big conflict, they're basically just simple problems that are already too familiar in many romantic films you've ever seen. Adding it with their affections to music is its only, but small distinction. What the movie tends to bring isn't really hard to figure out. It obviously tries to make the audience connect with the characters so when the story hits to where the movie started, it would make the life and death decision look a lot challenging. But there isn't really much happening to Mia's ghostly journey. It only consists few actions, which is either finding out what happened to her family or just watching her mourning loved ones. And the nurse who somehow knows about this weird spirit zone seems to only exist for exposition to a world that doesn't even try to make sense.It does have a fine job of building how their lifestyle works. All of these scenes are quite pleasant to watch, and the characters are pretty charming adding a shade of life, but we mostly cannot reckon what else is big or interesting going to happen next, other than the accident. Much of their personal issues are just stale to keep the attention on, and yet it gets more of the focus than its most crucial moments, which leads the entire film momentum free as possible. The acting however helps to make it tolerable. Chloe Grace Moretz has outweighed her own character, she gives more of the soul than what it is written for Mia. Jamie Blackley is fine, even though he didn't leave any mark to the character other than being a cool boyfriend. And the adult cast, although with only few scenes, perfectly delivers the needed gravitas the movie is cut out for.If I Stay may set its tone right and have a better ambition to flesh out its love story, but in the end it's just a rather dull surface. The main plot rarely goes anywhere, until the final act at least when the genuine drama is starting to show, but it is going to take a lot of time to get there. And even with that normal runtime, the film almost feels unending, precisely because it doesn't earn enough growth with its own storyline. But my real complain here is its lack of consideration to its much interesting themes: the grounded romance isn't really that fresh (even if they're musicians, it doesn't change a whole lot) and the fantasy elements are terribly underutilized, which doesn't give the full compelling effect it wanted to show.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Heart Wrenching,"If you are in looking for a film that will make you cry, this is the one for you. I watched this film the other day and neither me or my friend left the cinema with dry eyes. Chloë Grace Moretz does a great job at playing the part of Mia and really makes you empathise with the character, as the story line is one of which could happen to everyone (depending on your beliefs of course). The music is my favourite part of this film and has inspired me to take up the cello. Jamie Blackley has a beautiful voice, and face but that's another story, and got to sing some great songs. I want what you have by Willamette Stone is now one of my favourite songs along with Mind and Today. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone, can't wait for the DVD!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"11 years later, I still hold space for this movie","It's actually funny how deeply this movie impacted me. When it came out, I was a freshman in high school and absolutely crazy about Chloë Grace Moretz, so of course, I went to see If I Stay in the cinema with a friend at the time. Days later, I picked up the novel by Gayle Forman at a bookstore and fell even more in love with the story. The soundtrack was never released on CD in my country, but a couple of years later, when I started collecting cassette tapes, I bought a blank tape and recorded the soundtrack onto it. I even printed a cover and everything. To this day, I still listen to Willamette Stone's songs (especially Heart Like Yours).Today, I picked up the Blu-ray from my shelf to rewatch the movie after a long time. Sure, I can see now that those young actors had a lot of maturing to do in their performances, but still, the cinematography is pretty great, and the soundtrack remains absurdly underrated.

It's fine if you change some of the details from the movie, but to change almost the entire relationship story of the two lovers is just formidable. I hated the movie, but I loved the book.

Choices and harmony,"Chloe Grace Moretz has been my favorite actress since she first appeared on ""Kick-ass"" and that was the reason i chose to see this movie. I watched the trailer and, to say the truth, was not really interested in the plot. There were some movies and novels about after life and love and I thought this movie would be on the same way as them. But after seeing, I realized that the movie is about choices and harmony.When being a kid, Mia chose to play cello, not to become a rocker like her parents. Then Mia date a rocker and they two had some troubles caused by the differences of kinds of music they follow. They chose to overcome that difficulty and become harmonic to each other.There is a mix between rock and classical music and I find that pretty interesting. I've never thought that these two kinds of music could be such harmonic. I love classical music and now I love rock music too.The final choice Mia has to make is whether to wake up or not. She lost her family and if she chooses to stay alive, she would have to face the loneliness. She used to be very happy with her family and now that happiness is not available any longer. That was a difficult choice. And I am happy that she chose to wake up.The scene that impressed me the most was on the last part of the movie when Mia looked back to the party she had with her family, her parents' friends and Adam's friends. The moment when they gathered around Mia and Adam playing in a special show with cello and guitar is really a moment of true happiness.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

It was mostly about Mia's love story. Maybe I'm just so curious about coma state, so I kinda disappointed with the adaptationWhile the book narrates the accident with a very horrifying words, here I guess the director is too scared to make the brutal and horrible accident scene.

Great idea terribly executed.,"Without beating around the bush I love me a good romance and Chloe grace moretz is my favorite female actress so this movie must be great right? Unfortunately not. This movie is bad and i didn't enjoy it, here's why.The start of this film is actually half alright. Real good character development and introductions. The cast is good and their acting was decent. The duo shared a awkwardly adorable and cute new relationship but then all goes downhill after 30 mins of the film. The main duos relationship is terrible. They fight and bicker all the time and don't seem in love or remotely happy at all. There was also 0 build up and suspense. You know exactly what was gonna happen and although it did have somewhat sad parts they were too out of the blue without any build up for me to have any sort of emotion besides ""ohh that sucks"". Nothing really happens in between her being in a coma and the ending was also quite sudden with no build up so it was just a right mess.to put it in short for a sad romance there was 15% good romance mainly by the parents funnily enough. Bad suspense and no build up for you to feel overly upset at the circumstance. I would highly not suggest this Mess of a film! What a shame..",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Seems A Bit Gimmicky,"After loving the roles that Chloe Grace Moretz played in ""Carrie"" & ""The Equalizer"", I decided to give this one a shot after recently having watched (and enjoyed more than I thought) a similar teen drama in ""The Fault In Our Stars"". Unfortunately, I felt that this one was kind of based on a gimmick.For a basic plot summary, ""If I Stay"" tells the story of Mia (Moretz), a high school girl who plays a beautiful cello. This musical talent gets her noticed by cute guy Adam (Jamie Blackley) and she is awaiting a letter from Juilliard's music program. On a seemingly normal family drive, however, Mia is involved in a car crash putting the entire family in the hospital. As ""physical Mia"" fights for her life in the hospital, ""spirit Mia"" watches the action unfold as a kind of ghost entity, trying to discover what is happening to her and her family members. Many moments of the previous year are flashed-back to as Mia discovers what is really important in her life.The main problem with this film is that it seems to be based on what I consider to be a very gimmicky concept, that being ""spirit Mia"" watching herself (and her family) in the hospital interspersed with flashbacks. What purpose did that serve in the film besides to give Moretz more time to act? It all could have been done with Mia just laying in her hospital bed. All that would have been missed was a few reaction shots.Couple that with the fact that the story here didn't strike me as particularly strong to begin with. Maybe if one appreciates cello music more than I do, or is a sucker for sad movies, they will find more significance here, but I never felt that what I was watching made the jump from ""contrived"" to ""real"".The highlights? Moretz is still great in her role (as convoluted as it may be sometimes), while a grandfather character (played by Stacy Keach) practically steals the show with ever scene he is in. In a movie that should be filled with such emotion, it is telling that a guy on the screen in a very limited role has such an impact.Thus, while I know I shouldn't directly compare this to ""Fault In Our Stars"", it just so happens that I saw both within about a two-week span. ""Fault"" made me actually care about what was going on and drew me in. ""Stay""...not so much. At times I even got a little bored waiting for something to happen. Like I said, Chloe Grace Moretz is still solid, but it isn't enough to inject life into this vehicle.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"""I'm not really good at writing about things that make me happy""","After a severe car accident, the girl in a coma has an out-of-body experience (astral projection) during which she observes people in her environment and remembers her life so far, trying to decide whether to wake up or let go.The basic premise is, at least from the perspective of my experience, quite original, but the movie overall is not. However, although there are a lot of clichés, the story is very emotional and believable, and it is easy to identify with well-acted characters. Visually beautiful, with well-blended flashbacks (which I usually do not like) and pleasant music. Chloë Grace Moretz proves once again that she is not just a pretty face.

"A guaranteed weepie that, in trying to tell its love story, loses sight of its profound family tragedy.","There's a genre of movie for every mood - comedies to make you laugh, horror flicks to give you the heebie-jeebies, and weepies to make you cry until your eyes hurt. If I Stay, of course, belongs to the last category, alongside films like The Notebook and The Bridges Of Madison County. At their best, such movies strike right at the heart, finding something devastatingly truthful to say about the tragedy of the human condition. At their worst, they wallow in undercooked melodrama, wringing tears by brute force rather than gentle persuasion. If I Stay hovers uncomfortably in the middle, a first-rate tearjerker with some third-rate narrative twists.Mia Hall (Chloe Moretz) is the oddball in her family: obsessed with her cello and classical music, she can't imagine how her super-chill, hard-rockin' parents - dad Denny (Joshua Leonard) and mom Kat (Mireille Enos) - could ever have produced someone like her. One perfectly ordinary snow day, her entire family, including little brother Teddy (Jakob Davies), gets in the car for a fateful drive that will change her life forever. Suddenly, Mia finds herself wandering through the broken remnants and memories of her life, as her body lies torn and tattered in a hospital. Teetering quite literally between life and death, she revisits her romance with budding rock-star Adam (Jamie Blackley), and watches as her grandparents (Stacy Keach and Gabrielle Rose) and best friend Kim (Liana Liberato) wait in breathless, heartbreaking anticipation for her to wake up from her coma.There's a tantalising question in the film's title - what is there left for Mia if she chooses to stay, to live? Unfortunately, the answer to that question is tangled up rather uncomfortably in Mia's relationship with Adam, which is flushed with the heat of first love. The romance makes sense, more or less, but for every genuinely sweet moment (Adam coming up with an interesting idea to decorate Mia's room), there's another that's either cloying or clunkily written. The weight of their love frequently relies on silly, cheesy proclamations, and it's hard to tie it into the kind of soul-defining connection that we're supposed to believe might keep Mia tied to the world of the living.Far more effective is the lively, heartwarming dynamic within Mia's family: the film feels stronger, and the tears it elicits more real, when we delve into Hall history. We find out how Denny came to have the strength to give up being in a rock band; and we watch, hearts in our mouths, as Kat gives her daughter some invaluable life advice as they wash dishes at the kitchen sink. Keach's Gramps, by the way, will shatter your heart and tear ducts when he sits by his granddaughter's bedside, wanting her to live but not wanting her to suffer. It's a shame that this part of Mia's life winds up taking a back-seat to her love story - all-encompassing as it understandably is.The cast is better than the film strictly deserves. Blackley has enough charisma to hold it together when his character swerves swiftly from mature to childish. Enos and Leonard are wonderful as Mia's parents, skulking after her to demand that she have fun instead of keeping to her invented curfew. But this is really Moretz's film, and she carries it with a great deal of grace. Even when she's called upon to rend her garments and clutch her face in despair, the camera swirling (melo)dramatically around her, she emerges with dignity intact. She lends If I Stay the credibility to power through its more poorly-crafted moments.If it's a full-blown weepie you're looking for, quality be damned, If I Stay will hit the proverbial spot. Even though its plotting and execution never quite works in the way it's meant to, this film is pretty much constructed to drag the tears out of you - and that it will do, come hell or high water. But if you're looking for a finely-crafted drama with deep insights into the tragedy of life and the joy of death (and vice versa), you're more likely than not to be frustrated by If I Stay, which spends too much time in the realm of teen romance and too little exploring the rich, far more affecting family drama at its heart.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Expected Better! 4/10,"Review:  I'm in two minds about this movie because I liked the intriguing out of body experience  footage, although she should have known that no one could hear her but I didn't like the corny love story which took over a majority of the storyline. Chloe's acting was also a bit annoying because she kept on wondering around the hospital in a daze. The movie is about an inspiring cello player who falls in love with a popular lead singer in a up and coming rock group. There's then this big accident which destroyed the whole family and leaves them with life threatening injuries. Whilst in hospital the main character, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, has an out of body experience and runs round the hospital, scared that she's going to loose her whole family. The movie then travels back in time to show how she met her boyfriend and her relationship with her family. The problem with this movie is that the love story really took over the whole plot, even though the family is fighting for there lives. I was waiting for ages for something to happen, and when it finally does, it's nothing that amazing. The teenagers got on my nerves after a while, especially the guy who was playing her boyfriend and the ending was proper corny. Anyway, I personally lost interest after a while and I don't think that the concept was executed that well. Not that great!Round-Up: Chloe Grace Moretz has been getting some major roles lately and she always seems to be playing the lead but I personally don't think that her performances have been that amazing. I think she was the wrong choice for Carrie and Kiss Ass 2 was really disappointing but she was great in the first Kick Ass and her small part in the Equalizer wasn't that bad. I don't think that she has had a role that has pushed her to the limit yet but at the ripe age of 18, she's got plenty of time to shine. She has achieved so much at such an early age so I hope that it all doesn't go to her head. The rest of the cast were mediocre along with the whole back and forth thing that got on my nerves. Anyway, the film made a healthy profit at the box office, due to the adverts showing all the best bits but I personally wasn't that impressed with the film.Budget: $11million Worldwide Gross: $78.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic/dramas about a girl whose an inspiring cello player and falls in love with a rock star but she is close to death after a fatal car crash. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Really moving and graceful,"I heard a lot of good things about this movie from my friends, from some of my family members, mostly girls.

It is not the first time such theme as an out of body experience is exploited. But this love story between Mia, a talented but shy Cello player and Adam, a future rock star to be, is really touching and a tearjerker. 2 worlds collide but they do a wonderful union.The two main actors, Chloe Grace Moretz and Jamie Blackley have a really good chemistry between them. There are a lot of scene which makes me cry especially the last one when Adam starts singing a song he wrote for her telling how much he loves her and how he wants her to wake up to fully live their passion. Stacy Keach is also very touching in his role of a grandfather so proud of his granddaughter and who is completely torn to have lost his son, daughter in law and grandson, whose only hope left is to see Mia waking up.But Chloe's performance is so touched by grace. Seeing her realizing how much she has lost in that car crash, seeing the people she cherishes the most passing away, completely powerless. Her performance makes me cry all alone. She really proved how talented she is and I truly hope a lot of directors have seen her golden talent as well. Kick ass is just fun but If I stay is much deeper and she managed to have the right tone and attitude in the perfect time.I'm so glad to have followed my friends and family's advice and now I'm going to read the books.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Wonderful movie,"I have watched this movie three times already and I totally love it. The acting was awesome and there was a bit of everything: humor, love, emotions, sadness, magic. It's one of these movies where I can connect with the actors and build an emotional relationship immediately. This is a good sign and lots of movies these days just don't manage to do this. Plus I love the Cello and its magic sound. Reminded of the eighties movie Electric Dreams where Virginia Madsen played a Cello player. If I stay just gives me goosebumps each and every time I watch it. It's one of these movies that I can watch over and over again.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
I am so disappointed,"I learnt about this movie in school in English class that was all about movies. Two girls made their analysis on this film. I only saw the trailer, but it was enough to convince me to see this film if I ever had the chance.But boy am I disappointed! I expected something way more from this film. Of course it's deep, it has important meaning. Mia is an amazing characters many people will see themselves in. But the thing is, no one can truly, truly feel like they are Mia, if they haven't been in a life or death situation before. So it feels like a waste of character. There could've been another story about Mia, amazing Mia with her talents, who doesn't even know how amazing she is. There are other stories you could put her in so people could truly feel her. But having her in weird ghost fantasy was kind of a waste, especially when this kind of story seems so typical. Has this been done before because I feel like I've seen a similar movie but with less interesting main character?One of the things I hate about this film is the dialogue. Almost immediately when Adam talked with Mia I had to sigh and roll my eyes. No teenage boy talks like that! That pretentious dialogue is so annoying to listen to. It suits with some romantic sappy novels you read in rainy day, hoping you'll meet your significant other, not in a movie. I don't know if I can excuse it if the dialogue was that bad in the novel. It's like some unrealistic fantasy, and it bothers me. Does someone actually watch a movie like that and then hope they'll meet a guy who talks in poetic pretentiousness? Ugh!And I really expected this to be the kind of movie you could watch and cry so long you're kind of cleansed, but no. That's the thing I'm most disappointed about. This movie didn't move me at all! I'm mostly blaming the writing for that.I can't really judge right now, but usually I'm very impressed by Chloe Grace Moretz. She's a talented young actress. She was very convincing as Mia, she was astonishing. She displays emotions well, no matter how ""bad"" they might look in front of a camera. That's what I love about her acting.I loved the music in this film, but if it's a movie about music then... Then it's kind of obvious you have to have good music there. There was both classical music and punk rock. It's the same kind of contrast that was between Mia and Adam.As I said before, this movie is very deep and it has an important meaning. It struggles with several themes that may not be important in general, it's not like this movie has a political message. No, the message is mostly for individuals. And even if the horrid dialogue makes you shiver, If I Stay really makes you think about several things the movie mentions. You don't have to agree with the message, but at least you think about it.If I Stay was definitely not for me. If you love movies about teenagers that are actually deep, this is for you. If you don't care about writing too much, this movie might be for you. Obviously If I Stay has an audience that loves it, and it's definitely meant for someone. If I stay is deep, the message is amazing and it's probably even emotional movie when it hits the right person. If you are sure you won't like it, don't bother. But if you think there might be a chance you'll love this movie, take that chance.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Not as great as expected,Honestly it was a little boring and hard to follow,2.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not totally uninteresting, but for the most part If I Stay is far too slow and if you'll forgive the pun it's also somewhat lifeless","Mia Hall (Chloe Grace Moretz) is a promising young cellist whose biggest wish is to be accepted into Julliard which is an esteemed music school. She's also set to go on a date with rocker Adam on Friday night. However, she decides to go out for a drive to see relatives with her family and unfortunately their car collides with an oncoming vehicle. Mia ends up in a coma, but ends up experiencing some sort of afterlife and is in a position to see the aftermath of the accident which ultimately makes her re-examine her whole life where she realises that she has some tough choices to make.Although If I Stay initially feels like it's ripping Ghost off I have to admit that this is a relatively interesting and involving film. The film essentially has two strands to its story; you have Mia's out of body or afterlife story arc where she is able to see how the accident affects both her and her friends and family. The second strand of the story is a little more interesting where we get to see what would have happened if Mia would have stayed and gone on her date with Adam rather than go out in the car with her family. Although it's interesting to start with I got the feeling that we have a film with 10-15 minutes worth of plot which was agonising drawn out to a 95 minute feature film. Many of the scenes in this film were repetitive (particularly the scenes in the hospital). As mentioned, the other arc to the story was slightly better, but this again felt like it was going round in circles. I also never really felt that there was much chemistry between Adam and Mia which again was something else that drew me slightly away from the film.Shauna Cross' screenplay is a mixed bag and although there are some heartfelt and touching scenes for me the film also became a little irritating - things like Mia's afterlife moments where she keeps talking to people even though it's established very early on that they can't hear her. For me this became quite annoying and together with the tedious repetitive nature of the narrative it also made it a very long 95 minutes. The ending of the film is also a little cheesy.I can't really fault the performances and I can see that If I Stay is a film that's full of good intentions as well as offering some interesting insights into the afterlife and life verses death, but the story is unbearably slow, repetitive and a little tedious at times. It's a shame because there was a lot of potential here, but sadly most of it is wasted.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
If I Stay,"""If I Stay"", a movie that almost has five stars on Netflix, is not worth the watch. It started out as a book and should have stayed a book. The movie is like every other drama movie. It makes you cry like you never thought you would and keeps you in suspense. The movie is watchable because of the tear-jerking plot, and the way you can relate to the characters, but if you're looking for a movie with good acting, I suggest looking elsewhere.The movie starts out with Mia (Chloe Grace Moretz) eating breakfast with her family. After finding out it was a snow day, Mia's parents, played by Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard, decide to take her and her little brother to their grandparents' house to get Mia's mind off her crazy, teenage life. Little did Mia know that that was the last time she would be eating breakfast with her family. On the way there a tragic accident occurs and leaves Mia in a coma. Mia has an out-of-body experience and can see everything that goes on but no one can see or hear her. She now has to decide whether or not it is worth waking up to a life she never expected. As the movie progresses it flashes back to events that happened in the past and introduces her hunk-of-a-boyfriend, Adam (Jamie Blackley) and her best friend, Kim (Liana Liberato).The acting in the movie makes a huge difference in how the movie is portrayed. Mia, the main character, has a lot of weird moments. The movie sometimes made me feel uncomfortable because of how awkward of an actor Chloe is. An example would be the part when Mia gets stung by a bee at one of her parents' potluck dinners and Adam sucks the stinger out of her hand. It is a hard scene to watch because you feel uncomfortable for them because of all Mia's ""family"" sitting around the table. There is a part later in the movie that shows Adam and Mia getting intimate and as she is taking clothes off Adam she rehearses notes or strings like she is playing her cello. Extremely weird!The script is also something that contributes to the terrible acting because there are some awful attempts to be funny. The part where Mia tells Kim she wants to lick the side of Adam's face is a dreadful way to fit in humor. Alongside the part where Mia dresses up as a rock star for Halloween to impress Adam at one of his shows and then does this weird ""grr"" to Adam when asking if he likes her better dressed in this costume or her normal, boring self. Adam replies with something sweet, like he always does.The reason that this movie is highly rated is because of the storyline. It is a heartbreaking movie. Unlike some drama movies, the director, R.J. Cutler, really keeps you guessing on whether or not Mia will decide to wake up. Another reason this movie has good reviews is because you can connect with the characters. It is a very relatable movie because the director puts you in their shoes. When tragic events happen to Mia and her family you get chills thinking about how that could be your family. It is amazing how a movie can make you feel so real.Despite the terrible acting and the awkwardness of the characters it was an acceptable movie. I am sure the book is more pleasurable to read than the movie is to watch, but if you like typical drama movies with actors that make you feel uncomfortable then ""If I Stay"" is the movie for you.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Decent adaption,"I really liked this book, the movie adaption is decent but honestly also pretty forgettable. Sort of along the lines of The Fault In Our Stars but not. This story follows Mia Hall after a car accident puts her in a coma. Through flashbacks we reflect on her life while she decides whether or not to wake up and face her new reality.Most of this story is told through flashbacks; to her sweet loving, meant to be hip parents, her little brother, her (endless) cello playing and her up and down relationship with the popular, older bad boy from the band who for some reason has fallen for... her. Mia gets accepted to Juilliard, her boyfriend goes on tour, Stacy Keach is her grandfather, Mia roams the hospital and her memories with endless musical interludes including cello recitals and watching her dreamy boyfriend play in bars. I found the music too much in this, with entire songs shown when little bits would have been fine.Enjoyed Mireille Enos as the cool mom even if the family ws portrayed a little TOO perfect.Definitely preferred the book on this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Best movie I have ever seen 🙌🏻,"I am not even joking this is THE best movie I've ever seen. I love every thing about it, the, romance, drama, and the music it is just such an amazing and beautiful production and I highly recommend watching it. I especially enjoyed the chemistry between Adam (Jamie Blackly) and Mia (Chlöe grace mortez). When Mia had an out of body experience, she witnessed her moms, fathers, and even her little brothers death, and just watching her family talk to her beside the hospital bed while she was in a coma made me all teary eyed. When Mia and Adam were together, they were always so happy and in love. When Mia told Adam she applied to juliard, he was upset because all he wanted was to be with her, and he said ""long distance relationships never work out and it's like you're dating a ghost"". At the end, Adam is reading the letter from juliard to Mia while she's laying in the hospital bed in a coma and he tells her she got in. Then he sings her this beautiful song and while that's going, she suddenly wakes up and Adam looks at her and says ""Mia"" in a happily surprised voice, and that's when the movie ends. I cried for so long after that and kept thinking about how much I loved the movie. I hope my review helped you and I hope you love it as much as I did. Oh, and I forgot to say, as Mia has her out of body experience, she has a choice to live with her deceased parents, in heaven, or live an orphan with all the people she loves as well as Adam, what what do you choose?",5.0,Anonymous,Music
What Do You Get from A Lifeless Empty Melodrama? Nothing.,"I feel nothing but hate for this film. Everything was shallow and fake, particularly Chloe Grace Moretz' acting. Her sweet, girl next door vibe felt unnatural and borderline irritating. Plot and love story were cringe worthy to the point of ""just die already"". Ouch.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A Contrived Low Quality Movie For Children,"Within the first 5 minutes, you realize this is a movie starring 95% teenagers who sound the way old people think they sound, and is FOR teenagers. This isn't a grown up movie. And I've never seen anything SO contrived and pandering. Again, within 5 minutes there's a reference to the band The Shins, a reference to Alice Cooper, the main character has a sticker in her locker that says 'I ♥ Yo Yo Ma' and a song by Iggy Pop. Yuck. Not yuck to Iggy Pop. Yuck to the fact that they were allowed to use such a great song by a great performer in such a silly, disposable movie. It tries so hard to appeal to people. Too bad they didn't try as hard to just make a good movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Underrated movie - Really emotional.,"If I Stay is one of the most underrated movies in recent times.The movie is just perfectly written if you give it a chance and really makes you feel with all the people involved in it, especially Mia Hall who is a wonderful character.I can't find any reason to give it a 6 out of 10 because everything works for me, the music, the writing, the characters, the story and the way the story is presented.The movie is excellent IMO and everyone should give it a try. I love movies that make you think a lot about life and that one was one of them. I gotta say I really cried my eyes out here, and I'm not ashamed.Also: The ending really worked for me, of course I was a little sad that we didn't get to see much more but... the moment really clicked with me and it made a lot of sense.",,Anonymous,Music
Touching,"This film items the story of a teenage girl who is very good at playing the cello. She meets a guy in a rock band and falls in love, but soon afterwards she has a traffic accident and is fighting for her life in the intensive care unit.I like Chloe Grace Moretz, and I think she's really good in this film. She plays the plethora of emotions very well. As her life plays before her, and also seeing the reality of the accident is very gripping. I'm particularly touched by the grandfather's speech to her at the bedside, while Adam's wishful attempts to bring her back to life is also touching. I could not predict what really happens at the end, which keeps me engaged throughout. I enjoyed it.",,Anonymous,Music
Brilliant,"This film was so good, such a amazing film to watch and definitely a must see. I was crying throughout most of this film as it makes your heart race, but also you cant help but fall in love with Adam and Mia's relationship, its just such a strong story line and keeps you entertained throughout. One minute its all romantic and the next your back crying with tears and sadness. Each character was a strong character and I loved the way the story went from Present day back to what had happened in the past. It also makes you consider life as we know it and what we would do in a situation like Mia's. How would we react, what emotions would we portray. It has made me want to live life to the full and enjoy every moment as much as I can.",,Anonymous,Music
