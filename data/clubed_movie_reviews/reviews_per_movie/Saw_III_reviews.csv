Another savage & extreme sequel that is fun & shocking,"Loved the first Cult Classic & loved the Donnie Wahlberg sequel & now I've enjoyed this savage part 3.Saw 3 is incredibly clever & completely connects everything from part 1 & 2 & brings it into this brutal revenge story about a depressed grieving man who lost his little boy to a dangerous driver who got a tiny little sentence by a corrupted judge because of a cowardly witness refused to step forward & the slowly dying John Kramer uses this horrible situation to set up a new game & invite everyone he dislikes to play.Saw 3 is really a vigilante vengeance film but in the confines of one of Jigsaws booby trapped torture buildings.The cast is Awesome with Shawnee Smith (who gives an incredible troubled performance) & Donnie Wahlberg (back as the injured but brutal cop) & Tobin Bell (back as the sinister & smart genius Jigsaw) & Dina Meyer (back as the beautiful & troubled cop) & Angus Macfadyen (excellent performance as the grieving father) & Baha Soomekh (as the captured doctor) & all such solid performances that hold all the Horror & gritty situations together.The look/Cinematography is grainy & raw & looks like its shot on film & the music is exciting & thrilling.Excellently written with everything connecting & all loose ends tied up. Basically a real shocker & a thrilling sequel.Yes this super savage sequel has really a true anger at it's core with how useless & unfair & corrupted the Justice system really is & the rage people feel & the vengeance they crave.There's plenty of twists & turns & extremely gory scenes, so much so that i had to look at Away often lol, more extreme than the first two film.Here sick John Kramer/Jigsaw captures a doctor who has a damaged life behind her work & Kramer wants her to fix him the best she can without going to hospital & the game is a deadly affair that puts a vengeful father through a maze of torture as he comes accross each person who let his son's killer get away with murder.A very serious issue at it's heart & a graphic horrific tale of violence with excellent performances throughout.Another great sequel in this savage franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A bit more gore than in its predecessors,"We went to the cinema yesterday to see this flick. I can't really say I had any expectations, I mean, it's a third part in a series and such are rarely keeping the same quality as their predecessors. After seeing it, I have to admit that this flick is definitely keeping the same touch of quality work as the first two parts. I'd say it's better than the second piece, and if it's not better than the first piece, then they're at least even.I found the third part to have a bit more gore in it, compared to the other pieces in the series. Some scenes are really disturbing and even I, who claim myself to be quite difficult to disturb through film as a medium, at times felt really... well, it was almost a bit too much. It's far from snuff, please, don't get me wrong here, since the utter disturbance is very beautiful in a way and very artistic, I'd say.For the plot, I can't pull off any complaints. Anyone familiar with the first two pieces and the plot of theirs, will recognize the atmosphere and the touch of the flick here. The acting is neat, no complaints there either. All-in-all, this is a well-made flick and among the best deliveries from Hollywood I've been confronted with in quite a while. I recommend it. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cutest Movie Since Finding Nemo,"Enter the enchanting world of Jigsaw, where your kids can watch as people explore a very special theme park with cool rides and fun games. Your children will love solving the puzzles with the characters step by step. This is a perfect movie for critical thinking, common sense, forgiveness, and being a good sport. Saw III tells the story of a sad man who must learn to forgive his best friend. On the way, he plays lots of games and sets a good example by following rules. Your child will also learn and grow with the main character as he demonstrates good sportsmanship. Such a sweet movie, and perfect for the family!",,Anonymous,Horror
Still going good...,"Surprise! There is a horror series that holds up well, even on the second sequel.It's difficult to explain the plot in any detail without ruining the storyline, so instead, I give you small chunks. A doctor must keep Jigsaw alive. If he dies, so does she. A grieving father must decided what he will do when confronted with the people that changed his life for the worse. Saying anything else about the story line is just criminal.Like the 2 movies before it, difficult decisions and some nasty secrets become a part of a much larger plan. It manages to explain events in Saw 1 and 2 that may have been considered plot holes. It spins the whole concept of the Jigsaw character and what he represents, and the message he is trying to say. By carefully placing events from the past in a certain order, and by introducing important sequences of the character's lives, Saw 3 manages to become a pivotal point to the series. It's not perfect, though. Constant flashbacks to memories becomes a bit tiresome. Some of the dialog could be a combination of dry, repetitive, or dumb, or all of the above. And oh yes, there will be the improbable & illogical. Big critics will focus on this, and consider the movie a waste of time.Of course, you can toss out the psychological-babble, tell the critics to go back to their coke snorting, and just have fun watching the movie as pure horror. Of the three, this is ultimately the most bloodiest. Those of low tolerance of gore, medical procedures and general dismemberment beware: the movie theater I went to here in Winter Springs had one movie-goer faint and fall to the floor. They had to temporarily stop the movie and take her outside, an ambulance came, and took her away. Even with this interruption, the movie kept everyone awake, wanting to see more. By the end of the movie, the audience clapped. We liked what we had seen. ""What has the world come to?"", you say? Geez. You are in the wrong place. I'm sure there will be some Disney movie to your liking.The traps were clever, original, and far, far deadlier this time around. To me, it beats out any psycho with a knife/ax/chainsaw crap movie that has been pumped out too many times. It's a shame that Saw producer Gregg Hoffman passed away before this movie was produced.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"On par with part two, but nowhere near as good as the original","""Saw III"" is a classic case of an ambitious sequel that has a few really nice ideas and some scenes that will make fans of the franchise very happy, but in the end it doesn't, it can't hold a candle to the original. It's a rule of the series by now that a ""Saw"" movie must include a lot of gory deaths as well as an unexpected twist at the end. While the first thing isn't so hard to come up with - and the makers definitely do a fine job thinking of the sickest, bloodiest deaths possible - it's the twist that seems more forced with each entry in the franchise. It's a disadvantage that we know for a fact a surprise is coming. What's worse is that in ""Saw III"" the final twist doesn't resolve a question we've been asking ourselves during the whole movie. No, it's question and answer in one and that doesn't make it particularly interesting. It's just a lot of explaining over some annoyingly edited flashbacks.Speaking of flashbacks, there are way too many in this movie. We see things that we really never needed to see. Loose ends are tied up that aren't actually loose ends. It's like the writers read too many threads on the IMDb message boards for the previous movies and decided to spell out everything that has been ambiguous until now to put an end to all discussions once and for all. It only goes to show that those things were a lot more intriguing when they were left in the dark.Jigsaw himself won't ever keep his mouth shut in this movie. The guy has thought of many cruel traps but his constant blabbering is his most sadistic device. He's already been overexposed in part 2, and this entry in the series continues to make that mistake. After the revelation about his identity at the end of the original, there really weren't too many mysteries surrounding him anymore, but part 3 still tries to come up with some (mainly about his relationship to his accomplice). Again, this is unnecessary and not very interesting information.Considering how quickly the ""Saw"" movies have been made, it's a little miracle that they still turned out to be quite entertaining. However, one wonders if the franchise couldn't be better if a bit more time was spent on developing the sequels. The production values in particular could use some improvement. The make up looks fine, but the stage design makes both sequels look like an episode of ""Star Trek"".So, yes, ""Saw III"" is as fast paced as its predecessors and the gruesome torture scenes don't disappoint. See it, if you're looking for mindless fun, but don't expect it to knock you off your feet the way the original did. Apparently part 4 is already in the works. Now that's just going to be a waste of time as ""Saw III"" already ends the series. Guess, Hollywood never learns. ""Halloween"" anyone?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
gory as hell!,"i decided, just as it was getting dark, that i was going to watch saw 3, and with much anticipation (after the first two), i did just that. the movie opens up, alike the first - reintroducing the bathroom, so i wasn't feeling too bad.the movie's a tad confusing, and i spent more or less, the whole time trying to keep the vomit down in my stomach, so that didn't leave me with too much mentality to make sense of the whole reminiscent, nostalgic, deja-vu way the storyline was written.the whole, disgusting gory, blood thing just isn't my style of horror. thumbs up for the excellent twists though! definitely, not for those with a faint heart, or a weak stomach. maybe my anticipation of the first two, brought my hopes up a bit too high, but it really wasn't as fantastic as i expected.go and watch it though, only if you've seen the first two.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
We have a winner,"SAW III in my opinion is tied with the original as the best in the series. For many reasons- one reason being that it keeps it simple. Instead of dealing with multiple characters that sacrificed any kind of character development like in SAW's II, IV, and V, SAW III, like the original, has much fewer characters, leading to a more intimate setting where we can connect to everyone. And while it does have sub-plots, they don't feel out of place, they're not just randomly thrown in to shock audiences. They feel organic, they all connect smoothly at the end and make sense as to why.If you've seen a SAW film, you know the story is going to have twists, turns, and violence/gore to accompany them. But at least SAW III does it very well. It expands on characterization and back stories for these characters and ties up the loose ends as believably as this franchise can do. We also get a deeper look at the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda, knowing more about how the two really look at each other. Jigsaw is the calm, cancer-stricken anti-hero who does these evil things to prove a moral standpoint. Amanda, on the other hand, doesn't seem to grasp this - instead using the traps to torture her victims as a way to get back at innocent people for the way she was tortured herself with suicidal tendencies and drug abuse. With these two extremes, we see how much Jigsaw is trying to mentor her in his vision while she struggles with her own demons. And when Jigsaw gets ill, we see that Amanda really isn't a fitting apprentice to carry on his legacy as her vindictiveness comes out.SAW III is also supported by the fact that the two protagonists are developed deeply. Maybe not as much as our two anti-heros, but we understand where they're coming from. From Lynn's dour nature to devastated Jeff's situation. The subplot with Jeff by the way adds some great underlying messages to the film. These messages shows us that hate, vengeance, revenge, and complacency brings more pain than anything else, and does not solve anything. It ruins families, destroys relationships, clouds judgment, and at the end: self-destruction. Leigh Whannell, who wrote the first two films with James Waan and flew solo writing the screenplay for this one, does a nice job giving the spotlight to all the characters instead of just focusing on Jigsaw and Amanda. He makes SAW III more of a character study than any of the other installments and that's one of the essential reasons why this installment scores high.Darren Lynn Bousman directs a much more subtle film than he did with SAW II and SAW IV. The quick edits are kept to a bare minimum (thank God) and the film has a lot of dread going for it. Very moody and darkly atmospheric. He focuses on the drama and emotion at hand, which was a vast improvement on SAW II and especially SAW IV. He lets the acting and the situations do the work for him instead of being extra-fancy with the camera work. Lastly, the cinematography is a plus. Darren shoots the film with a vibrant and kinetic feel and uses good, non-queasy camera movements. I love the lighting most of all though; he uses a wide arrange in the color palette (from lime green to icy blue). He definitely proves here that he knows how to grasp the material and visualize it. His direction of III ranks alongside James Waan's mindblowing direction of the original.The acting is hardly an issue. It's usually good or better. Tobin Bell can play John Kramer in his sleep by now for gods sake! He shows excellent range and is always effective in the role because he gives the character more depth than what the script probably provides. Shawnee Smith is superb as Amanda, who will always be one of my favorite characters in the series. This is without a single doubt her shining moment, her most dramatic portion in the series. You really want to hate her but you just can't because you pity her. Smith could have easily played the character as an annoying nutjob, but she gives the character substance and unbelievable humanality. Angus Macfadyen as Jeff is superb in his role as well; he makes Jeff the most realistic and sympathetic character within the entire series. As far as I'm concerned, McFayden nailed the mourning father act. Bahar Soomekh was decent but always outshone by Bell, Smith, and McFayden. Her acting was a bit flimsy at times, but for the most part she gave a nice performance and made her character likable.The suspense and tension, while not as impressive as the original, is still great. Hardly any other Saw film or horror film in general for that matter (with the exception of Eden Lake from last year and Inside from 2007) has been so edge-of-your-seat gripping, so exciting. The slow pacing allows you to gradually absorb everything in, and this makes it all the more better.There is a lot of extreme gore in this film, but unlike some other installments like Saws IV and V, it's done very well and serves a purpose. Jeff's bloody trials are in a lot of ways cathartic. You're enduring these horrific scenes along with Jeff, and the relief at the end that the horror is over really fits with the theme of redemption through forgiveness. Moreover, the revelation that the horror isn't over, and what you feel as a result, drives home the Shakespearean tragedy in a very personal way because you the audience have to keep enduring it.SAW III is clever, solidly written, has the best characters, succeeds with the emotional aspect it was going for, and ties up loose ends perfectly. For a third installment in a horror series, it's incredibly strong.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Saw III Not A Disappointment!!,"After seeing Saw III I have to say that I was surprised. Few films do good in their third installments but Saw does quite well. It's got more gore than the other 2, not tons more, but definitely enough to please a horror/gore movie fan. Above the gore though is some of the sounds of the film that make you go, ""That was INSANE!"" There is some crazy traps in Saw III that are very good but there's always room for more sick/twisted trap ideas. It's got better acting than Saw 2, but how important is the acting anyways. Most people just want to see some nasty traps. And NASTY they are! Saw III does have some noticeable actors who are good though they aren't really that famous. Its a well made horror film. Pretty good series for 3 years in a row. Hopefully if there is a 4 it wont ruin the series, but who cares. It's like throwing out Halloween 3 and loving the rest. This one also has good twists and like the other ones I was waiting to hear that Saw theme song music and sure enough, at the end, there it was. Good Film. Well done.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I think they should have stopped,Saw should have stopped after I and 2. By episode 3 my interest dwindled. The torture scenes were pretty much being recycled as they tried to come up with more imaginative ways to make the victims suffer. Sadistic in a way!,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Do you want to play a game?... no thanks,"While not being a huge horror fan I immensely enjoyed Saw 1 and 2 basically for their intelligent writing and great plot twists.There is a fine line however from creating an intelligent horror flick and just writing a gore fest, this was quickly crossing that boundary and losing what was great about the previous 2 films. It used the age old solution to creating todays movies, either shock the audience or wow them with special effects.If you took out all the gore from the film there would be very little of a movie left and it certainly would not warrant a release, as the story and acting alone are not enough to carry it. Whereas with the previous movies could hold itself up with the brilliant stories.Considering this I sincerely hope they don't create a Saw 4.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie will please hardcore Saw fans,"This movie, as always with the previous Saw installments, has once again proved to be worthwhile. The set-ups were great, the torture devices and scenes were unimaginable with NO limits whatsoever, and the ingenious traps Jigsaw puts on all of his victims were unbelievable. Saw 3 will keep you wondering what will be the outcome of the end. No doubt did this movie impress me and hopefully Saw fans as well. Now, as a warning, this movie did have some EXTREMELY sickening scenes with constant groans from audience in theater, but will nonetheless please its viewers.

Beats the previous ones,"Well, after watching Saw 1 i was really looking forward to Saw 2, which as far as i am concerned wasn't as good as Saw 1 and my hopes for Saw 3 went down, but last night i got a free pass from my friend for an advance private screening of Saw 3.I can promise you one thing this movie is just like Saw 1 and has everything and loads more of gore than Saw 1 & 2.The acting particularly is good, but its the story and the plot that is extremely well written and of course the Twists again like the first 2 are huge and much much much much more enthralling and shocking! This movie is a reminder of Saw 1 and really sets the tone for more Saw movies to come i would be heartbroken if this Saw series ends here because its getting interesting with each part.Thumbs up to Saw 3, a must see, go and watch it and experience the shocks! 8/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Expected More...,"Ah yes, Halloween. And for the past 3 years running, we have been as some would say ""blessed"" with the Saw franchise.The first one was compelling, simple, and smart, making it what could be said to be one of the best horror films out there.So in 2005, Saw 2 rolls along, and I'm expecting another Saw, perhaps even better. I admit, I did enjoy 2 rather than other cheesy horror films out there such as The Grudge, but I expected Saw one. Maybe it was the change in direction, actors, different story...So in 2006, the third installment to the series comes along, and I'm already hearing rumors about how it was the best one in the series and terrific. It was good, but still not the original Saw that I cherish in my heart.The traps, oh they were good. Maybe even the best ones out of the whole series. If you don't like blood, gore, and breaking of bones I suggest you skip this one.The story...similar to the 2nd's level of intensity. It could be said that Jigsaw wanted to go out with a ""Bang!"", like they said in the 2nd one. So he decides, as his final test before his death, to test human's and their ability to forgive one another (which is what he did in parts of the first 2, but he really takes it to a new level here).The whole series represented a test on human nature, mainly the ability, or inability in Saw's case, to forgive. The writer Leigh created a fantastic series and I look forward to more from him, but they just need the acting. Tobin Bell was amazing, yet all the other characters seemed too corny or whiny, in an annoying sense.There was a nice twist at the end, better than the one that was in 2. It'll have you thinking about it for a while, like I have been for the past 10 minutes.Final Opinion: Better than Saw? - No. Better than Saw 2? - Yes. Go see Saw 3 for your movie pick of this weekend, and prepare to be disappointed or amazed. Its your choice.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Last Test of Forgiveness,"Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) is an anguished man, who grieves and misses his young son that was killed by a driver in a car accident. He has become obsessed for revenge against the man and reckless with his wife and daughter. When Dr. Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh), who has troubles with her marriage, is abducted by the deranged Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith), she is brought to a gruesome warehouse to keep John Kramer (Tobin Bell) alive in spite of having a terminal brain tumor. Amanda puts a necklace gadget full of explosives around Dr. Lynn's neck connected to John Kramer's life support system, and tells her that if he dies the device will explode. Meanwhile, Jeff is submitted to a sick game of forgiveness with surprising dark consequences.""Saw III"" is the last chapter of the sick trilogy of the Jigsaw and also very good. The morbid, claustrophobic and gore story unravels maybe the sicker game of John, with surprising tests, twists and revelations. This movie keeps the atmosphere of ""Seven"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and Tobin Bell has another great performance in the role of and intelligent, sadistic and cold blood killer. The camera and the cinematography contribute with the morbid atmosphere of this film. The fans of this character will certainly enjoy the conclusion of the trilogy, but it certainly is not recommended for audiences with problem with psychological and visual violence. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Jogos Mortais III"" (""Mortal Games III"")",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Third Installment Of Extra-Spicy Violence,"Well, i didn't walk into this theater expecting the greatest horror movie of all time, and i wasn't shocked. I was happy though with the experience and found myself shielding my eyes, trying to keep up with what is at first a very disjointed plot, and eventually trying not to see the predictable outcomes of this film. Loved the gore, loved the traps (although they were a bit much in this version, and unfortunately there weren't many actual traps, just some excess eye candy lying about the workshops and scenes of instruments of terror.) Honestly, i saw more gruesome items of destruction in the trailer for hostel 2, but whatever. The movie was well worth my eight bucks, and i will likely rent it when it comes out to watch it again. Loved the whole trilogy, and as for this movie. i think it can't stand alone. If you liked the first two, you'll love this one, just don;t expect too much.

"Dreary and boring kids' ""horror"" movie","Well, after the disappointment of Saw 2, most people (myself included) figured that the only way this series could go was up, so you can imagine my surprise after seeing Saw III and finding out that it's actually worse! None of these films are very well written, and this dreary third instalment is no different as we're given an unimaginative central plot line that is nigh on impossible to care about, along with the usual amount of swearing, crying and sweaty people looking frightened in rooms that are often so dark that you can't see what's going on. Director Darren Lynn Bousman seems to have got it into his head that flashy editing equals good storytelling, but that is a ridiculous assumption, as all the editing does is make it hard to see what's happening - and that means that all the effort put into the film where the gore and ""inventive"" traps are concerned is ultimately wasted as you can never really appreciate it while you're squinting at the screen trying to make out what's happening. This all happens mostly in complete darkness as well, don't forget.The plot line is of the 'highly convenient' variety, as despite being bed-ridden with terminal cancer, Jigsaw has somehow managed to find a man who hates a lot of people for murdering his son. Naturally he wants to play 'a game' with him, and so he's bunged him into some grotty place along with all the people he hates, and they're all hooked up to grisly traps - the idea being that he has to forgive to win the game...etc etc. Meanwhile, Jigsaw has got the doctor in to help him with his cancer - the catch being that if he dies, her head blows up. Believe it or not, this plot gets even more convenient once we get to the final twist. I actually feel quite insulted that the writers of this twaddle actually thought that people would buy into it - there is no reason to care about absolutely anything in this film! The film gets messier still when the director tries to tie all three films together with a series of boring and distracting flash backs where Jigsaw's assistant 'Amanda' remembers stuff they've done together. All in all, Saw III is a load of crap and I'm struggling to come up with anything good to say about it - and that's not usually something that happens when a film is as gory as this one. The kids might like it, but serious horror fans will need to look elsewhere for their thrills.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not to impressed...,"Well, After watching saw 1, it certainly was a good film, so I was excited to see saw 2. Then i watched saw 2, which in my opinion was brilliant!! beating saw 1, so my hopes once again raised. I finally got to see saw 3 last night, but sadly, i have to say i wasn't to impressed. First of all, lets get one thing out of the way. On Gore factor, this film most definitely tops the other 2 for goriness and gross visual effects, so if you like those sorts of films, this one is definitely a must see. However, for actual plot and content, unlike the other 2 films, this one seems to be running thin. It does have a plot to some extent, but the actual content in the film seems a little rushed and although it does make sense, seems to lack what the other 2 did so well. The acting was to a fairly good standard, but Shawnee Smith (Amanda) Definitely takes the best performance for this film. Al in all, its not a bad film, I would still suggest watching it, but for those who have high hopes from the other two movies, I feel that the majority of you will be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

No Comparison To The First Two,"What a way to ostensibly finish off your franchise. This franchise has been the group of the most ideal horror films, at least for me. Once I got through Saw, it shot straight up to the top of my list of best horror movies. Despite what snobs may say about it, it has everything the perfect horror movie should have. It has a scary, claustrophobic atmosphere, characters that aren't stupid teens going camping, eery abstract music, constantly different killings, and never a happy enough moment. It really had an effect on me, an effect that really shuddered me, because I'm not used to being truly scared by a horror movie the way I'm supposed to be. Only a handful of other horror films have scared me substantially. Saw II, though it didn't scare me as much, still maintained a creepy if not claustrophobic atmosphere and effected me with gore the way very few other films have. Saw II has a great understanding of the sensitivity of body parts like eyes and veins and knows how to get the audience's goat by exploiting them. Saw III is lackluster in both the scariness of the original and the gore disturbance of the second one.Saw III was said to be gorier than the first two films put together, and what it really is is lacking in the amount of gore of either of them individually. Yes, it has some gritty scenes and plenty of blood and body parts, but it's far from consistent and never is it as terribly creative or shocking like it is with its predecessors. Its atmosphere is not very creepy, either. The way the first film was claustrophobic in that it put us directly in the characters' bone- chilling situation, this film is claustrophobic in that it's missing something by not expanding further. We keep feeling like there's supposed to be more to the story, more to the action, more to the violence and the horror, but there isn't.This third installment in an otherwise brilliantly frightening series of movies insults the audience's intelligence in the execution of its twists, it ends too quickly to be affecting, and its plot itself seems forced. A part of the story that I like involves its main victim, a grieving man whose son was killed who is pitted in games wherein he has to battle himself and control his vengeful thoughts. I also like seeing behind the scenes of the first film, the showcasing of the first film's backstory, even if knowing everything now that we didn't know when watching it---even if it's a severance for the most chilling parts of its story---detracts from the fright. It may not be as scary anymore with the footnotes Saw III provides.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too much gore not enough fright.,"Hellooooooo ""GORE ADDICTS"", somehow, SAW III is not gruesome or terrifying enough for me, personally. It is evident that there is a lack of the macabre and nail-biting tension that is so apparent in the opening scenes of the previous two installments of the Saw franchise. Especially with regards to the first Saw, where the budget was smaller and the gore effects were less animated. In Saw III, the gore is definitely top notch, and that is where it seems this franchise has gone astray. Relying too much on the blood and not enough on the true frightening of the audience this Saw never truly frightens, but always disgusts.Beginning where the last Saw, Saw II, left off, Jigsaw is still on his deathbed, since he has been dying throughout the entire franchise. He must stay alive long enough to see his very last test subject through a series of tests and torture machines, before he can say goodbye. Unfortunately, I was never actually frightened, truly scared, like I was in the first two. I never thought to myself, what would I do in this situation, how would I deal with this. The only thing to really think about during Saw III is when are you going to turn away from the screen out of sheer disgust and not fright. Dealing with Jigsaw's underling, and her uncontrolled anger issues, towards herself and her newly acquired victims, Saw III indulges in pure torture for the sake of it.Bringing a reasonable story, not as tight as the first, but still entertaining to say the least, Saw III does not leave much to be desired. One really does need to see the first two parts of the franchise, to really enjoy this one, and to enjoy the first two even more. Hopefully the Saw franchise will not go out with this as their last film, and will redeem themselves in a fourth installment.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A strong sequel.,This one is very twisted. Stories from previous installments get extra information. Questions get answered. The game becomes even bigger. We see returning characters and new characters and most work well together.The traps become increasingly more disturbing in some scenarios and even make you think about what you may do.The gore is up again though it's not always just for the sake of violence.Recommended.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, could've been so much better","This was generally a good Saw movie, it truly was. The only thing that I believe truly takes away from the enjoyment of this flick is the editing.

On par with the oringinal,"That might be a bold statement, but in terms of gore, which is the only reason to see these movies, unless you're talking about the first film, was as entertaining as the first. Thin plot, yes. Mediocre acting, yes. But a great ending, really surprised me, and lots of gore. Most frequently bloody saw film. Opening kill is very hard to watch, one of the most gruesome in the series. The pig scene is disgusting. The rib trap and twisted legs are very brutal. Final few minutes are quite gory.

There still going and there still good.,"Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is being cared for by his new accomplice, Amanda (Shawnee Smith). As his condition is worsening, she kidnaps brain surgeon, Dr. Denlon (Bahar Soomekh), to do the job. Attached to her neck is an explosive device connected to Jigsaw's heart rate. If by any chance he dies, she dies as well. Dr. Denlon's task is quite simple to keep Jigsaw alive until, Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), another victim has completed his own test. What they don't know is that the mastermind has a bigger sinister plan in mind. Saw III's best element is by far its practical effects. As more money is given to these films, the third entry gets to have more practical effects and therefore more blood and gore. The practical effects in Saw III exceed the quality of the first two and the film wants to showcase it to the audience. For example, there is a brain operation scene where the nurse drills holes into Jigsaw's cranium and while it's obviously there to disgust you, it achieves its goal with all around impressive practical effects. Aw III's best element is by far its practical effects. As more money is given to these films, the third entry gets to have more practical effects and therefore more blood and gore.

Gore is definitely a big part of Saw III and it utilizes it quite well. In III, the gore is used mostly in the torture storyline which continues to be the most interesting part of this franchise. We are to feel for our main character as he goes through each test and while it isn't as emotional it could have been, it's a decent study of grief, even when it feels a bit over the top. The driving force of this storyline also continues to be the anticipation of our character's decisions which is interesting and captivating.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Saw III dives deeper into its ""goreno"" identity and features an obnoxious secondary antagonist, but there are some good ideas at play","John Kramer (Tobin Bell) The Jigsaw Killer and his apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith) continue their work with Amanda taking a more active role due to John's deterioration from his cancer. On John's orders Amanda kidnaps Dr. Lynn Delon (Bahar Soomekh) and fits her with an explosive collar that will detonate should she try to escape or John die. Meanwhile a man named Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) goes through Jigsaw's maze confronting various persons responsible either directly or indirectly for the death of his son by a drunk driver and the miscarriage of justice from which came as a result.Following the release of Saw II Darren Lynn Bousman, James Wan, and Leigh Whannell had initially turned down the opportunity to make a third Saw film and it was only after the sudden death of producer Gregg Hoffman shortly after the release of the second film the three decided to make the film in dedication to Hoffman with the intention of this being the final film in the series and closing out the trilogy. Made with a much larger budget than Saw I and II combined at $10 million, the film like its predecessor opened at the top of the US box office. While the film earned $7 million less in the United States than Saw II, thanks to international numbers Saw III ended up becoming the highest grossing entry in the series with $164 million and has yet to be topped by any other entries in the series. With Saw continuing to rake in the Halloween dollars, the series would continue despite the original intention of the series ending with III, though Wan and Whannell would no longer write the films and would remain only executive producers. Saw III is where the weaknesses in the series begin to set in as the movie has some extraneous elements and a secondary antagonist that doesn't work, but it does have some solid themes and ideas on paper.Starting with the good parts of Saw III, the main trap/puzzle we go through this time around where Angus Macfadyen's Jeff goes through a macabre tour of those he hates and blames for his son's death and lack of justice and is forced to decide whether they die gruesome deaths, or he saves them. It's honestly a really solid deconstruction of revenge narrative wish fulfillment as Jeff is forced to face the ugliness of his deep seated violent desires stemming from neglected grief turned to festering rage. Macfadyen is really good in the role as Jeff and you buy his anger, despair, and internal struggle and this is undeniably the best part of the film. Unfortunately there's surrounding elements of this plot that lead to problems in Saw III.Much like the previous Saw films there's two plots going on in parallel as the secondary plot running alongside Jigsaw's test involves the kidnapping of Dr. Lynn Denlon played by Bahar Soomekh who is forced by Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda to keep John Kramer alive. On paper it's not a horrible idea for a setup and given the time the film was made I do have to applaud the film for a progressive casting choice Crash actress Soomekh in a role that didn't typecast her and played her as a normal if burnt out doctor. The main problem with this movie is in Shawnee Smith's Amanda who's very much the secondary antagonist in this movie. While I thought Smith was fine in the first two Saw films (even if I didn't quite buy the twist reveal in II) Smith is not interesting as an antagonist in this movie and spends most of the movie shouting, whining, and carrying a complex stemmed with daddy issues as she operates like a petulant 4-year-old who's not getting enough of John's attention. While I know Wan and Whannell sought to make a ""father/daughter"" type story, I can't help but feel they took it too literally with Shawnee Smith never evoking the sense of menace or authority we got from Jigsaw or even being interesting in her own right as she's just a brat with arrested development and an inferiority complex that she's now acting out upon.The movie also dives deeper into the ""gross-out"" factor of these movies with more elaborate gore work with moving parts and on a technical level it's well made but the novelty is beginning to wear off. The movie also feels like it has a lot of elements that feel extraneous this time around such as a lengthy sequence showing that Amanda's been involved with Jigsaw from the first film's Bathroom trap, or Dina Meyer's Detective Kerry who's been in all three of these Saw movies unceremoniously killed off with really nothing to say about her. Despite Detective Kerry having been here from the beginning and also been an extramarital affair of Detective Matthews' that resulted in him getting a divorce I can't name anything all that important she actually did in this series other than ""she was there"".Saw III ""closes"" the book on John Kramer, but much like other ""closed book"" entries in horror series be they Friday the 13th Parts 3 and 4 or Hellraiser IV: Bloodline that book's as closed as a 24-hr. Gas station. The series has pretty much fallen into a comfortable formula at this point, but assuming that formula works for you it does deliver on it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Woe is III,"I thought Saw and Saw II were great; you don't usually get gore and good plot twists in the same movie. Saw III however was sad and very, very boring. I just sat there through the whole movie waiting for it to get better, nay, waiting for it to get good at all. The gore was there, the twists were there, there was something of a plot there, but it all seemed so weak and it failed to click. After the first two I have to admit that my expectations were high, but was I really so out of line? What happened with III? I just don't understand how Saw could have come to this. Though I'm a fan of Saw I'm afraid III gets a 1. See it if you must, but consider yourselves warned.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Saw 3,"I had seen Saw  the first episode and I found it different, because it brings forth a new storyline told in a different setting, style and suspense. I missed Saw 2, and when I heard of Saw 3  I thought of seeing it. I read the reviews on IMDb, and all but one appreciated the movie, so I went to see it, knowing that there would be blood and gore; but also expecting that there would be an interesting story line.For the first time I saw that in Amsterdam there was an usher who was checking the age of audiences through their Identity cards. Also a vomit bag was provided with instructions on it about the gut wrenching scenes in the movie.With this background let me go straight into the story line. I found the movie totally absurd. Its only focus seemed to be showing different technique of how to kill people in the most disgusting ways. One after another it kept on showing it. The actors and actresses were amateurs and did not act well. The photography was as expected it would be  with more hand held camera  as if someone / or something is following the character which is being shown. The lighting throughout the movie was poor  as if fear can only be projected through dark images. There was irritating sound track added throughout the movie  that did not fit the scene. There were references and cuts to several shots  that seem difficult to understand for those who are seeing Saw series for the first time. I suppose they were from the previous movies. The directors managed to gather enough audiences to see the movie through their franchise and marketing skills.The movie was bad in all aspects of movie making. More disgusting than what was shown in the movie was when a few die-hard fans of Saw series stood up at the end of the movie and clapped appreciating the movie. What the world has come to be to appreciate? A total waste of time!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
As per the above review,"I was at the Celebrity release party on Thursday and direct from the directors mouth, ""Saw IV to be released Halloween 2007""So the stones will continue to be unturned. Saw III does create some closure at the end, but of course not all questions are completely answered. By not tying things up in a nice tidy way they leave the audience as unsettled as some of the gruesome devices used in the film. You walk out a bit freaked out, and at the same time something in the back of your head is going ""I want more"".I especially like how III, through flashbacks, gave so much more depth to the characters and situations from the first two movies. Unlike most films where they use archived footage with a soft edge filter, there are scenes from the first two movies that are completely redone from he vantage point of another character. Brilliant!",,Anonymous,Horror
"nice plot, too much gore","if you expect high level of violence and blood you will not be disappointed by this movie. in the theater i watched the movie, there were people who couldn't stand it and left the place. that was not shocking with all the irritating details about deaths of the ""subjects"". that's why the first two movies were simply ""better"". too much violence, blood and disgusting scenes makes this series hard to watch. comparing to saw and saw2, outcome was not bad. Nevertheless if you can take too much violence, the outcome is satisfying. This episode contains its own surprises. none of them makes the effect of the first saw of course but they are surprises anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's no use trying... (put on Phantasm or Witchfinder General instead).,"An unrelenting assault on the viewer's senses for 90 minutes does rate as something horrific, yet one becomes numb and disinterested, especially in the lack of the tempo... all fast - no emotional modality... no connections to the outside world. The whole story is so insular that it neglects to connect with the audience and fails to set up an alternative world that the viewer is welcomed into and finds inviting. In short, what this movie lacks is imagination and a storyline. It hath no substance - the non-stop shock card is played all too often by those lacking of true talent. In contrast, setup of the true horror films such as the Italian giallo - Dario Argento, Lucio Fulcio, Mario Bava and the Modern American horror slasher (with back-story) represented by John Carpenter and Don Coscarelli evoke a more authentic response of terror - such as a simple scene from Phantasm when the Tall man says, ""You play a good game BOY!!!"" is far more menacing, terrifying and enigmatic than any line of dialog from any Saw movie (especially the latest installment)... In fact in Saw III, the psychological element of torture is merely a poorly worded treatise relying upon convention and boiled down philosophy. It lightly touches on the psychological but never the metaphysical. It is a self-absorbed exercise at best... so a 6/10 for doing torture for no rhyme or reason for 90 minutes straight. At best, the movie is a representation of worthlessness which brings to mind Sartre's much more profound philosophical novel, Nausea - which deals with the metaphysical problem of worthlessness in an erudite enlightening manner. To see a film that truly deals with sadism, torture and man's inhumanity to man I recommend Michael Reeves masterpiece: the Witchfinder General. Check it out. tho its not available on DVD in the USA, only videotape. I recommend the UK DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nutshell Review: Saw III,"Jigsaw's back! But this time the modus operandi is slightly different. In what was a game of pain, life and death, this time round it seems that there's an overconfidence that the unfortunate prey will not get out alive. Hence the death traps being literal.But of course those who have not watched Saw II, will not know the suggestion at the change in MO. In order not to spoil it for you, I shall not mention a word, but hey, even without watching Saw II, there're ample flashback scenes, and newly created ones, to bring you up to speed. But trust me, watching the second film first before this, will help bucket loads, as it picks up directly where the previous film left off, with the return of characters played by Dina Meyer and Donnie Wahlberg.Like the previous movies of the franchise, you have those elaborate devices for those sick games that Jigsaw likes to play with seemingly innocent men and women, chosen for not valuing their lives, and wasting it away. Through such games, Jigsaw's warped aim is, for those who survive, to learn to appreciate life itself. Then again, just how many do survive, since to do so calls for sacrifice, often pain inducing in a massive way in a race against time.However, while the litres of blood continue to flow, the devices and plans here tended to be below par. Sure they're sick, but this time it really stretches it a little. Things happen to fall in place, and well, they just do. There seemed to be a bit of borrowing from Hannibal, with the use of boars (although dead ones here) and not since that film had I seen the power drill put to good use, with that unforgettable sound of the spinning drill. That skanky toilet makes a comeback too, and it probably ranks up there with toilets from Trainspotting and Crazy Stone.You can guess the direction of the film's narrative, predicting where it will head, and how, but what you probably can't guess right, is the rationale behind what's happening, the Why, until the answers are revealed at the end. It'll also put to rest some of doubts and queries left hanging at the end of Saw II, and in a certain sense, Saw III wraps up the trilogy. Unless of course there is talk about making another film on the now cult figure Jigsaw, which will have the franchise follow the footsteps of the in-thing to do nowadays - the prequels.While there are new characters introduced, it's kind strange that we do not care much about them, except to silently bet if they would be able to survive their ordeal. Perhaps gore movies are such, that an audience doesn't care what happens to them so long as blood is shed and bones are broken. Perhaps the influx of gore movies, each one trying to outdo the other, makes us just baying for blood to be shed by the characters, and nothing else.So for those who have already watched the first two, this one will bring everything to full circle. And I can't get that all too familiar tune, which is played each time Jigsaw reveals his intentions, out of my head.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Some Useful Information for ""Potential Viewers""","Now that the Halloween ritual is over, so is the only good reason to see ""Saw III"" at a theatre. So here are some observations for those reading these comments while trying to decide whether they should pay good money to see the movie.First off look at the situation objectively, by its third installment the ""Saw"" franchise has become what the film industry refers to as a ""pre-sold"" product. This means that during the pre-production phase it was known that virtually anything released to theatres with the title ""Saw III"" will do substantial business. For those (including myself) who enjoyed the first two, it would be a much-anticipated Halloween ritual. We would purposely not read comments or reviews (or even view trailers) to insure a completely pure viewing experience. Our tickets were essentially sold before ""Saw II"" had closed at our local mega-plex.Although these economics guaranteed the production of the third installment (and apparently a fourth one), they provide no incentive for producing a film worthy of the preceding two. The original entry had to be good or suffer a ""direct to video"" fate, and the second benefited from (but was not over-whelmed by) a more professional production process because of its higher budget. In addition for the second one there was considerable incentive to prove that the first was not a lucky fluke.Further red flags go up when you see that ""Saw III"" is using a ""worldwide"" saturation booking technique normally reserved for weaker blockbusters. This technique involves a lot of pre- release publicity and then opening it simultaneously in many theatres (3167 in the U.S. and thousands more worldwide). This is normally done with the goal of generating quick profits before bad reviews and word of mouth kill attendance. If a film is good it will be exhibited more discreetly because the producers are counting on positive ""buzz"" to promote attendance and reduce marketing costs.Finally, the critics have overwhelmingly trashed ""Saw III"", even those who were extremely positive about the first two.So as a potential (not a pre-sold viewer), you get on this site and sift through the comments to try to get a handle on the quality of the film while avoiding major spoilers; and you find an extremely divergent set of comments. My advice is to dig a little deeper into the source of the comments, click to see the comment history of each author. It is generally a good idea to give more weight to the more prolific writers-especially those whose comments about other films mirror your reactions.In the case of ""Saw III"", the extremely positive (and least detailed) comments on the IMDb are almost exclusively from people for whom this is their first comment. If this seems extremely odd and if you are into conspiracy theories, you should at least consider the possibility that these are planted as part of the film's marketing campaign.As for myself, I cannot imagine anyone who has not seen the first two films getting much enjoyment out to the third. Although there were times during the viewing process where I wished I was in this group because at least the confusion would have provided some degree of mental challenge during what turned out (IMHO) to be an extremely boring feature.Nor would I expect anyone who did not get off on blood and gore to find this an enjoyable experience. The ""Saw"" films are in the horror sub-genre made famous by Dario Argneto and Mario Bava. This is called the ""gialli"" (yellow) style. These two Italian makers of horror/ thrillers place a huge emphasis on the deed of murder whereas other styles emphasize the solving of the murder. Inherent in this style is almost constant self- parody, necessary to expand the target audience beyond the wiggers and drones who flock to the local mall. The parody element fundamental to the first two installments is in short supply in ""Saw III"", deliberately inserted into only one scene-the pig rendering trap.Checking my watch every ten minutes I kept hoping that something would happen to give an interesting tilt to what I had already seen, as had happened in the first two. But by the midway point I had abandoned this (not the checking of my watch but the expectation that any magician could pull a rabbit out of this lame hat).Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A True Trilogy,"I was able to see this movie at a midnight showing at the movie theater I work at and, having been a big fan of the other movies especially the first, I had high expectations for this film.The movie is loaded with gore, as I had expected. With a strong background in survival horror, thrillers, and slasher movies, I was even shocked at the amount of gore in this film. So any other horror-head will appreciate this too. Like any trilogy in the past,this movie did an excellent job of returning back to its roots. In true ""Saw fashion"", there is a twist. One which will be somewhat similar to the other two, but will have a distinct difference. In the end it seems that James Van and Leigh Whannell have made their mark on the horror industry. Great movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
So so,"While I liked Saw I and haven't seen Saw II, Saw III is just so so. It has a new story but it also interweaves an explanation of what happens behind the scenes of Saw I. The good thing is that this movie is gory and has some full frontal nudity. The bad things is that there is no character to care or root for and that Dina Meyer, who is reunited with Costas Mandylor after their excellent but short-lived Secret Agent Man TV show, gets only a short tertiary role. The main problem with this movie is that the Jigsaw character is neither scary-the mask is stupid, nor likable in a twisted sort of way, in the way one would like Jason. In the first Saw his philosophizing about life and pain is quite interesting, here it's not. It's the same stuff: you don't appreciate such and such, pain this or that, it's your choice bla bla. He's supposed to be a new Pinhead but Pinhead's thoughts on pleasure and pain were actually memorable. In Saw III we find a guy trapped who we are told is suffering due to the accidental death of his son and now he is bitter and vengeful. His life is shown in photographic flahsbacks so we don't really care much about him. He's on some sort of scavenger hunt designed by Jigsaw that takes him to different people-in-a-trap scenes. The traps are somewhere interesting, but again, that story line is not really emphasized. The main story line is a dying John trying to get himself cured. This movie is awefully long. I could swear it was nearly 2 hours long. It's too loud as well, a means filmmakers use to keep you from falling asleep, every step someone takes sounds like the whole theater is going to come crashing down. As is typical for bad scriptwriting, the whole thing is supposed to unravel in the last five minutes, everything is explained- of sorts, not just what happens here but also what happened in Saw I. Frankly by then I just don't care. While the twist is alright, the story line of the trapped guy is not given enough character depth. Everything is just too convoluted and we are expected to believe that Jigsaw is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent. For his plans to work out, and they always do, so many factors have to go his way, it's just absurd. And when you think it's over, guess what, he knew that, too and that was part of his plan. Personally I'm not a fan of Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith, the main actors here. They are good second-tier actors but they can't carry a movie. This series has potential but someone else needs to be Jigsaw and the stories need to be less convoluted.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Didn't live up to expectations...,"I know all you hardcore Saw fans are going to kill me (or click that 'no I don't agree with you' button) when you read this but well... Saw III wasn't really that good.Firstly, it's hard to do these films. You need a good premise (which Saw had) and an even more elaborate plan for any sequels, which Saw II did very well in that respect, no matter how cheap the ending was. Saw III on the other hand, did nothing to liven it up.The story is predictable (I figured it out pretty clearly by the second last quarter), the characters do so-so in terms of acting (no creepy intellectual conversation like in Saw II... aww), and the movie, on a whole, didn't live up to its expectations.Sure there was some mild suspense and the occasional jump-out-of-your seat moment (which I'll admit, there were a few) but frankly that's about it. The traps, which is why people essentially watch these movies, were pretty lame and not powerful enough -- nothing to truly make you cringe. However, there's gore galore! The plot had a few rare good points and the ending rocked. I really hope this is the last Saw for at least these characters because it ended so fittingly.All in all, any horror fans (or Saw fans) will definitely appreciate this movie, no matter how many faults it carries. Personally however, there's nothing much here. It's more of a rental.Pros: Gore, Gore, Gore! Cons: Iffy script (notable in the Saw franchise), weak story but fitting ending.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not worth my time or $8.50.,"The night it came out, a few of my friends came back telling me how much they liked it. Some of them mentioned that the acting had gotten better and that it was indeed better than the second one.Now, seeing as how I didn't really like either of the first two I should have suspected the same with the third installment of this trilogy. I figured I'd give it a chance, however. The only added benefit was that a few of my friends were getting dressed up and went out on Halloween night to see it. That turned out to be the only good part of the night.Saw III tries to be an eye covering gore fest and fails miserably. I thought it made a better comedy than anything. At no point during the movie did I ever feel tension. I sat watching the movie in complete disappointment waiting for a moment of tension to build. It never came.I was suspecting the movie to rely on pure shock and ""surprise"" scares, which it did. The only problem with it is that none of them worked. Every time something happened that was meant to scare people I either was filled with a, ""Is that the best you can do?"" feeling or I laughed.The acting has not gotten any better and by the end of the movie I was really getting tired of hearing Jigsaw say he wanted to play a game. I suppose after three movies it's bound to get annoying.Super fast cuts fashioned into strobing type of shots and constant change from very dark scenes to highly contrasted scenes filled with white light only supported a headache through the film.Don't believe the hype of this movie. If you want to see gore or be truly frightened, look elsewhere because Saw III definitely does not deliver on either point.I should have went to see The Prestige instead.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"more of the same; a horrific, bloody mess","Completely unnecessary, regrettably unpleasant third installment to the obscene horror series adds little depth or relevance to the franchise, but instead just offers viewers an opportunity to watch victims suffer needlessly cruel and merciless deaths.

c'Mon...it's SAW!!!,"wow...there really isn't a whole lot you can say about this movie. First of all, it is by far the WORST of the three Saw movies. SAW 1 had some originality and good twists, but lacked acting and directing skills, SAW 2 lacked in the plot department with way too many flaws and far- fetched ideas....and finally, SAW 3 is over-the-top, unnecessary, predictable, cliché, and most of all, POINTLESS. The gore scenes are far to bizarre for any human to possibly construct without being caught. where do Jigsaw and Amanda find all of these mechanisms and who supplies them with it. Without giving too much away, Jigsaw is bed-ridden with heart monitors, hospital bed, and other supplies. Where does he get all of this stuff? it's almost ridiculous. At least the first two were somewhat realistic in just making him sick or in a wheelchair, but this has transformed his ""Home"" into a hospital. This is just one of many flaws i can point out. The killing scenes go above and beyond what is necessary for anything to be rated R. I've seen things far more gory than this, but all of them have bared the NC-17 rating. i found myself cringing and looking away at several points. i could never enjoy this movie because i was so worried about shielding my eyes from the ridiculous gore. The ending just doesn't do it...it makes sense, but it does not fit. It seems as if the directors ran out of ideas and threw this in there. Its a sloppy movie with far too many holes....THEY TRIED TOO HARD!!!!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Despite Some Deep Flaws, this Film is generally solid, although fans might be heavily split(no pun intended).","** out of ****I went to see this one opening day on the 26th or whatever, and i have to say that i got pretty much what i was expecting. Gore. Now don't get me wrong. I was pretty much positive that this film wasn't gonna scare me, despite high theatrics, good plot, and a generally dark tone. Well, it had all that, but the main attraction here is the violence.The plot consists of a low level nurse being forced to try to keep Jigsaw alive for as long as another man can pass tests in some other rooms in the area whilst Jigsaw is dying of cancer. In case you haven't seen the first two films, i'll fill you in. The Jigsaw killer's hook is that he never really kills anybody but rather gets people to kill them out of their own foolishness. This film has a nasty, awkward, weird vibe to start with in the first few minutes when people are stuck in traps that are pretty much impossible to survive no matter how hard they try or no matter how smart they are.This film is really strange because the first two films were pretty much puzzle films. Many people probably liked the first two films because of the puzzling aspects of those films. But unfortunately for sAW3(at least until the end, where the twists occur) there really aren't any aspects of the film that really make you think about the situations.What replaces it are some truly painful and disturbing scenes of torture and gore that become nearly unwatchable for the faint-hearted. This film is a true gore-fest in the latest tradition, and while I'm glad that they totally topped HOSTAL in that area, I'm hesitant to recommend this film. But if you are a fan of gore, which many who saw the first two films were, boy oh boy are you in for a treat!!! This film is probably the goriest film so far this year. For example, there's a device called ""The Rack"" in which a man has his head, arms, and legs all plastered up to a big machine. And every once in a while, the spokes twist and twist his arms and legs and neck with it. Needless to say, there is a lot of snapping bones and compound fracture complete with overdone sound effects and gore. In another awesome scene, a woman has her entire ribcage torn out while attached to a metal apparatus.So yeah, generally i'd say if you love gore, check it out, if you're looking for a good puzzle film, try to sit through it till the end. If you have a strong stomach and are looking for something scary for Halloween, check it out. Although certainly not as scary or intense as THE DEPARTED, it has a couple edge of your seat moments that should get you good. Check it out.Rated R for strong grisly violence and gore, sequences of terror and torture, nudity and language.",,Anonymous,Horror
I just want to.....gross you out,"As I saw the first 2, really liked the first, found the 3rd OK and heard that this is pretty gory I thought I give it a shot.Straight to the reason of my vote, those 3 stars are ONLY for the gross-out value of this movie. Congratulations, you succeeded here.If you watched the first 2 (which you most likely have) and have half a brain you already suspect a ""twist"" ending, so this one is not all that hard to predict. Even if you don't, this movie has way too many stupid scenes and is sometimes so unrealistic to be considered even remotely good.I don't feel writing down everything that p***d me off, so I'll just elaborate the worst of them all.I guess that brain tumor gives Jigsaw the ability to look into the future or to mind control others. For a normal human being that he is, its just impossible to predict certain actions of Amanda, because, well, they were not only stupid (which would be human, at least), but downright unfitting. To make things worse, exactly those actions lead to the twist. A very honorable mention goes to the fact that the ""you are there for a reason and have a chance to escape"" factor just doesn't exist for some of those poor suckers killed.My conclusion....Film ""feels"" closer to the 1st than 2nd, but ultimately its just an empty, ugly and blood spilled shell with none of the original filling left.Don't believe the 10s. Also looked up the vote history and the people who gave this the highest votes overall are........women under 18. Well, you make off that what you want.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
The original trilogy comes to a close,"While it´s weaker than the previous two, it´s an emotional and engaging send off written by the original team behind the conception of the first film. It hurts, shocks and disgusts as much as it works as a fine addition to the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant story but a bit slow,"They set the scene well & the storyline was top tier. Notably - the ending was done brilliantly. The quality of the set-up & nature of the games - looked great visually, and were clearly well considered.Just a few critiques:1. Re the storyline: (a) In the prior movie, I really liked the whole Jigsaw Vs the police force situation - and I would have liked to see more of that here.
(b) The whole premise changed, because most of the time - the victims had no chance of escaping, or the odds were heavily against them. And that took away some of the charm that existed in the prior movies.2. Pacing was off. Particularly the scenes with Jeff, as I constantly wanted him to hurry up and decide. I think they could have benefited from cutting down those scenes, in order to add one more room.3. Dumb & uninvestable characters. I kept questioning why certain characters acted (and kept acting) illogically. Particularly towards the end of the movie, where certain events could have been avoided. Also I wasn't invested in Jeff as a character, and Amanda was annoying.Overall - it's okay & worth watching if you want to see the whole Saw series.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Seriously.,"This film is the worst of the three, and it was obviously written in a week. Because the twist ending and the storyline was weak, they decided to fill the movie with backstory. Granted, some of it was interesting, but it hardly answered the fans questions. Those who will see it, will realize that they've written the story into a corner and a 4th film will be extremely contrived--as if these films aren't already. The film gets a 3 because the imagery is pretty good. Although, shooting the whole film in muted tones takes away from changes in mood. Then again, this is a one-trick pony. Notice the similarity in a number of the traps. I will say that Shawnee Smith is easily the best part of the film.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best Saw movie,"Saw III is an intense and thrilling addition to the Saw franchise. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat with its cleverly constructed plot, grisly traps, and unexpected twists. The acting is top-notch, with Tobin Bell delivering a chilling performance as the infamous Jigsaw killer. The emotional depth and character development in this installment elevate it beyond just another horror movie. Director Darren Lynn Bousman masterfully weaves together the horror and drama elements to create a truly unforgettable experience. Overall, Saw III is a must-see for horror fans and anyone who enjoys a well-crafted film. I give it a perfect 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Jigsaw returns to form.,"The internal logic of this movie will not let you down. If you can stomach the grotesque imagery then this dark twisted romp will satisfy in the end.The film makers have returned to Jigsaw's name sake and put together a puzzle that fits together very nicely. Once again Jigsaw seems to have a twisted code of ethics which got lost in the second movie. He states: ""I hate murderers and do not condone murder"" And by the end of the film we can believe he meant it.Like many recent horror films (The Descent, 28 days later) this film doesn't insult the intelligence of the viewer but rather tells a good story with believable characters.

Jigsaw @ it again,"The only reason this movie gets one star is because that's the smallest value IMDb allows to give. The reality is that this movie is about a negative 2 or 3 on a scale of 1 to 10, and isn't close to as good as the first one. The plot outline of the movie is simple. On Halloween day in 2004 Saw was released to the world. It made so much damn money that the producers, directors, and writers at Lionsgate just had to make a Saw II. Saw II came out on the surprising day of Halloween 2005, and guess what? they made a sh*tload of money again. So that leaves us with Halloween 2006 and the release of Saw III. Saw III will rake in another $100 million and undoubtedly pave the way for Saw IV. This is definitely the new generation of horror movies. And just like the old generation (Jason, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street), Saw will sadly have 50 million sequels and gladly make $50 billion. The first Saw was great, and definitely is considered one of the best horror movies to recently be released. With that being said, the sequels will get no better than the original, but will continue to be released every Halloween for the next five to ten years. It's a good movie to see on Halloween, and I guess some people may be be awed by the gore, but the MPAA will only allow so much, so don't get your hopes up. The number one goal of this movie is MAKING MONEY, nothing less, nothing more. Saw had a moral at the end of the story; ""Don't take life for granted."" The morals of the Saw II and III are ""With the right marketing and advertising, you can make millions of dollars off of garbage material."" If one positive thing is to be said about this movie it's that the marketing and advertising team involved are FU*&ING GENIUSES.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Three movies in, and the franchise is still going strong...","While the 2006 movie ""Saw III"" is a good movie, it was just lacking that special something that the 2004 ""Saw"" and the 2005 ""Saw II"" movies had. But it was by no means a bad movie, far from it.The storyline in ""Saw III"", as written by Leigh Whannell and James Wan, is a nice continuation of the previous two movies, and it expands exponentially on the Jigsaw/John and Amanda characters, which certainly was a nice thing to add to the lore of the franchise. And while the movie was lacking a bit in gore, gruesome contraptions and torture devices, then the narrative more than made up for that by some great, in-depth character growth and storytelling.The acting performances in the movie were good, and it was nice to have Tobin Bell (playing Jigsaw/John), Shawnee Smith (playing Amanda), Donnie Wahlberg (playing Eric Matthews) and Dina Meyer (playing Kerry) returning to reprise their characters from previous movies in the franchise. And the movie also brought in new talents such as Angus Macfadyen and Bahar Soomekh.""Saw III"" was a bit toned down in terms of deadly contraptions and visceral mayhem. Sure, there were some, but in comparison to the 2005 ""Saw II"" movie, then ""Saw III"" was a walk in the park. Sure, it could have benefitted from more of such, but I found the narrative to actually be sufficient and adequate to make up for that.If you enjoyed the previous two movies, then you will certainly also find some enjoyment in director Darren Lynn Bousman's 2006 ""Saw III"" movie.My rating of ""Saw III"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

But if You have already watched parts 1 and 2 then Saw III will be like Christmas to a child - full of wonders and surprises.I had counted myself to those people who thought the second part to be lame. How could such a weak girl like Amanda become a successor to someone like jigsaw, who by all means seemed to have shuffled off all his mortal coils? It didn't make sense to me.

It lost all sense of suspense, and horror for that matter. While the gore was good, I felt it unnecessary, and gratuitous at best.One of the many reasons I loved the first two was not just the gore, but the plot twists and suspense along the way. Sadly, one of the only plot twists in the entire movie came at the very end.Save your money and wait until it's on HBO.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disturbing and powerful...exactly what you expect from these films,"*BEWARE THERE ARE SPOILERS TO SAW AND SAW II IN THIS REVIEW...NO SPOILERS TO SAW III, BUT SPOILERS TO THE FILMS BEFORE IT*I've been waiting for this film since I watched Saw II. First off, I must say that it doesn't disappoint true fans of this series like myself. While Saw II was a good film, it didn't even come close to the original. Saw III is an even better film, and comes a lot closer to matching Saw I, but it too is not at the same level. Darren Lynn Bousman's direction behind this film is very well done again, and I'm very glad he stayed around to direct both sequels. The best part about this film is that Leigh Whannell AND James Wan, the original minds behind the epic trilogy, are back and in top form as the helm the story and screenplay. While telling you the plot line in detail is a gigantic slap in the face to you, the reader, I'll give you the basics of it.Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is dying. Things don't look good for him as his cancer is beginning to catch up with him more than before. His apprentice, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) is following all his orders, taking care of a few victims every now and then. Her next task is to get a doctor, namely Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh of Crash), to keep Jigsaw alive for as long as it takes Jeff (Angus Macfadyen of Braveheart) to finish a series of tests. Lynn must be careful, because if Jigsaw dies, she dies. No question.The technical aspects of these films are what makes them so psychologically powerful. The lighting, mood, and music define this series, as of course does the legendary villain Jigsaw. Darren Lynn Bousman has such an extraordinary vision for these films, and it is portrayed beautifully on screen...it just plain looks like a dark psychological horror film. Granted, this is not a film for the faint of heart. The gore in this film is near vomit-inducing, and I'm saying this even after the last film I saw before this was Jackass Number Two. Saw III makes its predecessors look like child's play compared to the blood and gore in this film, which will make you feel very uncomfortable at times. This, and the fact that it loses some realism throughout the film (which is one part of why these films are so good) are factors that keep it from getting a 10. The acting behind Saw III is also very well done. At last, all the main characters act near perfectly, especially Tobin Bell and Angus Macfadyen. Bell's John Kramer aka Jigsaw is easily the most fearsome villain of the past two decades. How this actor can make you know he's in control while being stuck to a bed is just inexplicable. He brings you in, and never, ever lets go. Shawnee Smith is good as his right hand woman, the secondary villain of the film. She can be scary at times, but nowhere near Tobin Bell. Angus Macfadyen's Jeff is a wonderful character, and he really takes advantage of this well-written character and makes it his own. A conflicted father is not really an original character, but this one is. Bahar Soomekh as the hostage doctor Lynn Denlon is very good. She is really a great actress, because we are always aware that she has some control over the situations because she holds Jigsaw's life (and of course, her own) in her hands, despite the fact that she's a hostage.One element of Saw that is always present in all the films is the unpredictable twist at the end of the film. In the first film, Jigsaw arose from the floor between Dr. Gordon and Adam, a twist no one could have predicted. In Saw II, Amanda was revealed as Jigsaw's apprentice and heir-apparent. In Saw III...well, you'll find out for yourself ;)SAW: 10/10 SAW II: 8/10 SAW III: 8/10--spy",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Saw 3 is Hollywood Trash,"This movie was terrible, so bad that I actually have a duty to comment on this. If you like movies that do not build tension, have no sense of suspense, like to whip the camera around, and then throw a loud noise at you, with out focusing on what actually happens. maybe this is a movie for you? This movie is as bad as House of Dead. I saw parts of Saw, and I believe that is a really good movie. And I heard Saw 2 was decent and pretty good for a follow up. Then i waited and checked IMDb and seemed like Saw 3 had done really good, considering it was a third horror installment. So I went to see it, big mistake. I would have walked out and left had I not gotten a ride with a friend. The one good thing I can say about this movie is that it was pretty damn gory. ANd pretty damn funny, only not intentionally.

How many of us torture ourselves with those memories and vow to get revenge? How many of us are crippled because we won't let go of those who wronged us? Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) was doing the people he tortured a favor by exposing them to the demons that possesses their lives and helped them release those demons. Maybe he went a little far to prove a point, but he had some pure motives.Enough moralizing. The movie was creative and exciting.

Funny horror movie,"This is one of many horror movies made by the producers similar to James Bond movie production, loaded with gadgets and full with goof that makes the movie funny rather than horror filled. Most of the film is shot in complete darkness to provide the sensation of horror. Producer forget that he wrongly use the line ""It is amazing to know how much pain a human body can take?"", he doesn't understand the true meaning and limit of pain. e.g. there is one shot with black guy nailed to the cross having his body parts twisted till it is broken one by one before twisting his neck. Human body can only take a certain level of pain and the brain would shut the systems off to prevent damage to brain cell. If this tormenting machine would work, the black guy should have fainted when his arm is twisted to the extend of his bone braking. Actually twisting can only remove bone from its ligament. There is too much inconsistency. Guess this movie has no intention to reflect what will really happen scientifically.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The SAW series's rotten apple.,"When I watched SAW II, I said to myself, ""This could've been better."" But after watching SAW III, I changed my mind about that. SAW III was mediocre but not the best one in the series so far. The only time it felt like the original SAW feeling is the first 20 minutes of the movie. After that, it felt the movie landed into somebody else's hands. The gore in this one was amazing and brutal but flashing all that blood to me did not cut it for me. The flashbacks were cool, but the current events were just bland. I did not like John's two new victims at all because they didn't feel like they were connected into the story. The acting was decent and the actress, Shawnee Smith played Amanda, was incredibly hot in this one. I notice there were a lot of mini cliffhangers throughout the movie which is a sign for the fourth one which i totally liked. But what turned me off the most was the ending. I'm not going to spoil it for you but lets put it this way. My reaction to the first ending: ""Whoa! OMG! I didn't see that coming!"" My reaction to the second ending: ""Really?! Damn! I never thought of that!"" My reaction to the third ending: ""WHAT?!?!? C'mon!!! You gotta be kidding me!!!!""See? So anyways, if you are a fan of the Saw movies, it's OK to see it.

Ho hum,"I saw this, the third entry in the now annual Saw franchise, last night, at a midnight showing with a rowdy crowd no less, and despite the fun atmosphere, the entire experience was rather ""blah."" That's the only word I could come up with to describe this film... Admittingly, I was never really a fan of the SAW films... I found the first one's climactic pseudo-clever twist to be irritating, and the second film simply LOOKED awful. Nothing is new the third time around... the story line is more convoluted than usual, and by the end we're waiting for the ""twist"" so when it finally comes it has virtually no impact. Visually, the film is repellent to look at... it's damp, dark, purposefully ugly and oppressive, and while some may laud the film's ability to sicken, I find little to applaud in filmmakers who choose to color their palette with various shades of vomit green, murky browns, and cold rusty steel. The film's soundtrack is also rather off-putting, making this the most audibly irritating film since Nekromantik's off-key violin scrapings.Violence-wise, I suppose the film delivers, as we are treated to various mutilations, torture methods, and power-tool brain surgeries, all to the giddy delight of the audience who cheer, gag, and dry-heave in unison... I can't really explain the satisfaction of witnessing violent and disgusting acts with a large crowd, and I myself let out a few audible groans and, yes, a few cheers, but in the end I'm left wondering what's the point. The film is a really depressing experience, perhaps more-so than the second one, and the highlights are its sadistic torture set-pieces, which the filmmakers ludicrously attempt to justify with lame attempts at poetic justice.It's ultimately this ridiculous sense of self-importance that make the Saw films fail. Yes, Troma films also attempt to shock and gross-out their audiences, but they don't take themselves nearly as seriously as these films do.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Every game has its loopholes,"I liked the first Saw (2004) because it has a good mystery and was suspenseful, and the sequel Saw 2 (2005) was not as good as the first, but I still liked it; Saw 3 (2006) is not as good as the first, and I think Saw 2 (2005) is better than this first movie, but I still like this movie. The plot of this seems simple and unravels what is happening by the end of the movie, which was a good reveal, and it was in a way I could at least understand what is going on.The acting is good, especially Tobin Bell as Jigsaw because even though he is on a medical bed the entire movie, he still gives a superior performance that is believable and a little creepy since he has planned certain things out in this movie. The performance from Shawnee Smith as the apprentice Amanda was believable when she talks about how Jigsaw took her in, and how she starts helping to set up the brutal traps or tests the victims go through, which was interesting to see. Also, the person getting through his tests in these multiple rooms I did not care despite the backstory he has about his son getting killed, and the doctor working on Jigsaw was not bad since she is someone doing something against her will.The traps in these tests were not bad and they have connections to what these people in the traps have done in their lives, and the connections to the earlier two movies were interesting. There is a certain thing that happens in the end that I thought should not have happened involving Jigsaw and Amanda, and the ending of the movie felt abrupt when it could have been a bit longer to wrap up the movie better. There are some choices made from the characters that was stupid or crazy, but even though I liked the interactions between Jigsaw, Amanda, and the doctor, the main test in the movie that the person is going through was not that interesting even with the disturbing imagery.I would recommend watching Saw (2004) and Saw 2 (2005) before watching Saw 3 (2006) to understand certain things that happen in this movie, but for the people who cannot handle this movie or the other two for the brutal content in them, this not a movie to force yourself to watch if you cannot handle this kind of stuff. The first movie is better than this movie, and the second movie is better, but despite its problems it is entertaining to watch, and you do get what you want to see.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
This could be the PERFECT Trilogy...,"This installment to the original ""Saw"", once again written and directed by James Wann and Leigh Whannell, I find to be one of the scariest, and yet one of the most creative and most intelligent horror films ever made.In this, two test subjects are taken by Jigsaw and his new ""companion"", Amanda. The duo puts these two subjects through the uttermost difficult tests both physically and emotionally, while also slowly revealing the long-hidden reason behind the two subjects' capture.I would've given this film a full 10/10, had it not been for an unclear ending. This could very easily wrap up one of the best trilogies ever made. However- it could also, in my opinion, be completely ruined by adding yet another sequel. The legendary story of Jigsaw would be completely corrupted if another was made. If you see it, you may very well agree.These three films are WONDERFUL together. But is this the end? Is this going to be the concluding chapter of what could be one of the most successful trilogies of all time? It'd probably be best that way, but, of course, it's very rare.

Saw III (2006) **1/2,"I saw this installment originally in the theater, but this is the first time I watched the extended ""Unrated"" version. I hear there's also an even longer third version that's a ""Director's Cut"", but this is getting confusing. In the third chapter, Jigsaw is literally at death's door, so he has his devoted assistant Amanda (Shawnee Smith) kidnap a young female surgeon named Lynn to force her to operate on him to save his life. The doctor and her husband Jeff are currently facing a rocky road in their marriage, so Jeff is now simultaneously forced to undergo a series of tests in Jigsaw's maze of horror and death contraptions, with Lynn's own survival hinging on the outcome. Jeff has also been living a life full of anger and bitterness ever since a drunk driver killed his son, and his journey through Jigsaw's torture chamber may hold the key to confronting the man who was responsible. This entry has a few good ideas and boasts some of the most inventive death traps in this series, and we also get to feel some sympathy for Jigsaw and his dedicated apprentice Amanda. A slight drawback may be that - at least with the extended Unrated Edition - there is way too much over-abundance of blood, gore, and guts, to the point where it takes a little away from the effectiveness of the film as a whole, even for a SAW sequel. However, this is a SAW movie after all, and all things considered it's a strong enough entry that should satisfy fans of the series to one extent or another. **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Gripping visceral entertainment.,"Third entry in the popular Lionsgate franchise of intense and graphic ""torture"" films catches us up to speed before soon diving into another insane Jigsaw mixture of heavy handed moralizing and brutal punishment. This time, we get two main concurrent story lines, as Jigsaws' protégé Amanda (Shawnee Smith) kidnaps a weary doctor, Lynn (Bahar Soomekh) whose purpose is to keep his sorry ass alive for as long as possible, and the latest in the line of unwilling game players turns out to be Jeff (Angus Macfadyen). Jeff lost his son when the latter was killed by a drunken driver, and he's been consumed with rage and a need for vengeance ever since. So, as we can see, Jigsaws' latest lesson to a slow learner is not to let hatred poison ones' heart. These story lines create a pretty compelling story that keeps one glued to the screen, and things get just mean spirited enough to appeal to some tastes if not all. Of course, the torture devices get more and more elaborate and sadistic, which will absolutely delight gore fanatics, as various extremely unpleasant things happen to a succession of victims. There's a strikingly detailed brain operation, a head that blows up real good, a body being drowned in pig innards, throats being sliced, body parts being mangled, bloody gunshot wounds, etc. The ""rack"" is particularly insidious, especially as it twists body parts around. One unfortunate thing is that assorted flashback scenes tend to bog the story down; they're good for establishing character, but also slow the pace too much. This is a noticeably long entry in the franchise, the theatrical cut running 108 minutes and the uncut version running 13 minutes longer than that. Another thing that could trouble some viewers with this franchise is a lack of sympathetic characters, although others may appreciate the fact / point that the people in these stories are markedly flawed and not perfect. The crew, including production designer David Hackl and cinematographer David Armstrong, once again prove up to the challenge of shooting in some claustrophobic sets, and things look as grim and grimy as they ever have. The cast is deeply committed as per usual, including Tobin Bell as the sickly Jigsaw, hot 80s icon Betsy Russell in the first of her performances as Jigsaws' wife, and series regulars like Dina Meyer, Costas Mandylor, and Lyriq Bent. Series fans should like what they see, while the faint of heart and weak of stomach should stay far away. Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worst of the Series,"After seeing the first two Saw's I began to vastly enjoy the genre it was digging into. The first film was and still is one of my favorite to date ""horror"" gory movies. The second was nicely structured and dug into the plot nicely. Though this third installment was a slight let down. I enjoyed it... and it did serve most of its purpose. Though many moments during the film I didn't feel like i actually needed to pay attention. A few things seemed irrelevant and slightly random (though were cleared up later), that didn't immerse me in the action as the other films did quite fine. The plot that had increased in flavor in the second Saw, was watered down during this Saw. The gore seemed forced at some moments and not as ""thought about"" as the other films, but it did work in making me feel uneasy...ish. If you liked the first two Saw's you should see this one, and get your own opinion, then come back and respond.that's me cheerio",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really was for the Fans,I truly believed this film was gonna be better than it was... I felt disappointed with the ending and was hoping that this would end the trilogy and make for a good series... How wrong was I??? I think fans will love this and trust me I'm as hardcore as they come... I just wished they had spent more time on the characters than the gore... If you really want to watch this but have not seen one or two - i suggest you do so cause you will be in the gutter if you don't... I suppose the premise seemed good but things obviously changed as it progressed... I would recommend this and hopefully Saw 4 will be even better...This was for the fans...,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Please God Close The Book On Saw,8/10OK before you ask I'm not making this up i have seen saw 3 (went to the cinemas last night ended up watching Texas chainsaw massacre the beginning which was OK very predictable and basically everything i expected just more gory) anyway through some contacts i got invited to watch saw 3 some of the staff were watching it late night.Hmmmmm OK its hard to comment on the film much because i really want to tell you the main spoilers but would get shot.......all I'm saying is half the people on the saw3 board are making spoilers up from what I've just read.This film reminded me more of saw 1 than of saw 2. I think in saw 2 jigsaw was taking the p*ss and having fun with his plan this one jigsaw goes back to actually being like he was in saw 1. Yes the film does answer most of the questions people want to know about the entire series and at time is flashbacks before the original saw.The traps seem to unrealistic unlike saw 1 where the traps were accepted as being able to pull off. Putting people in big mechanical traps considering jigsaw is basically near his death in this film seemed very far-fetched but this is another long awaited saw film so who cares.The gore was more violent in this film and i think at times was not needed because the original saw was implied horror you didn't actually see much apart from a few quick shots of blood.There are quite a few twists in this film and i recommend watching saw 1 and 2 before seeing this one just so you fully understand certain characters relationships to the past character. Basically this is still a class film and the twist although is very good didn't seem as shocking as the previous two films but was well written and remains a strong trilogy.OK not Leigh or James writing the next film then there should NOT be saw 4.......this film just about pushed the franchise too far but was really great to see jigsaw back in action but didn't seem as original as the past 2 films. Anyway its hard to rank the films in order i need to watch this at home again when on DVD. But the original saw was the best even though i loved saw 2 it was a great follow up. I was a little bit disappointed to be honest at the way SAW 3 ended but it could of been a lot worse i suppose but still a great film which i was expecting way to much from.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
An absolute gorefest!,"***NO SPOILERS*** I loved this film. In my opinion, it eclipsed SAW I and SAW II in terms of horror and just pure terror, with enough gore to give the Living Dead Series a run for it's money and completely run over The Evil Dead like it was some comedic joke. Saw III kept me at the edge of my seat throughout, it was thoroughly suspenseful and interesting.The visuals, traps and scares in this movie are endless and Jigsaw takes this one to a whole other level. Music was also great. All around it was a terrific movie, definitely worthy of being enlisted in almost anyones ""Top 10 Horror flicks"".",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gorefest,"The twist at the ending didn't justify the amount of senseless gore throughout the film. This film was much more predictable than all of the others, and by the time you got to the end, you didn't even care because you just wanted the shards of agony to stop piercing your eyes. The first film was done just right, and the second film wasn't too bad either. After leaving this movie, I had the feeling that Saw III was just trying to compete with Hostel for gore-factor. I have a friend that was obsessed with the Saw series, and I warned her about Saw III, but she was determined to see it anyways. She left me a note on facebook later confessing that I was right, and she wishes she would've gone to the matinée so that it didn't cost her $8.00. Don't waste your time or money on this movie, you'll regret it if you do.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A bad way to finish the trilogy,"What I don't understand is how people are saying this is like the very first saw when in my opinion it is nothing like the first saw.The problem with this movie is that the first saw ever made was so good. It was about time someone made a horror movie that weren't a typical teen one. By that I mean sex scene, axe murderer comes up behind kills person number 1, runs after person number 2. Person number 2 falls over a leaf and then is killed *this bit to graphic to explain*.The very first saw was not that it was graphical but it was psychological. You never knew what was going on and through out the whole film you were guessing. The film was excellent at controlling your mind.It makes me wonder what happened to the ""psychology"" that made that film so great. Saw 2 and Saw 3 are nothing but gore fest films. All films have a good ending but only 1 film concentrated on the storyline on the way to the ending which was the very first film. I like Saw and Saw 2 in a way. But when I heard Saw 3 was like Saw 1 I was left disappointed. If you think you're in for a psychological treat that'll keep you guessing then you're going to be disappointed. In fact the whole movie is just a little bit predictable. A bad way to finish the trilogy in my opinion.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you didn't get it before, don't expect to now","If you check out critic websites such as Rottentomatoes.com and read their reviews you'll see a lot of people who just don't understand the kind of audiences that enjoy these kinds of movies. I consider myself a hardcore horror fan, and even more so a lover of all movies. SAW 3 is not by any means worthy of an Oscar, but does fill the special voids that horror fans like myself have. It ties up all of the loose ends of the previous two installments and concludes rather strongly. Yes it is gory, yes it is violent, and no you're not going to be impressed with the intelligence behind the story. However if you liked the first two movies as I did, you don't care. With the SAW series, it's not really the events in the movie that are meant to scare you, but more so the idea behind every one of them. It's the idea that people don't appreciate their lives, and the whole philosophy about that which Jigsaw explains to us and his victims. That's what created the franchise's fan base. The gore is really just icing on the cake for enthusiasts. In short, if you liked the last two SAW movies then you'll like this one. If you didn't like them, then you just don't get it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
And the horror story continues...,"""Saw III"" is the third movie of the Saw series and in this one we have Jigsaw who kidnaps a doctor to keep him alive and in the same time he plays with his new apprentice who put in a brutal test.I liked this third movie because of the connection with the two previous movies of Saw and because of the interpretation of Tobin Bell who plays as Jigsaw and John Kramer. I also liked very much the interpretation of Bahar Soomekh who plays as Dr. Lynn Denlon and I believe that she was really outstanding.Finally I have to say that ""Saw III"" is a really nice movie and I was not expected to be such a nice movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

I should have known from the previews of movies such as Hostile II that this was going to be a bad experience.I thought the ending was terribly predictable, Jigsaw's ""test"" itself was obvious, the immediate death of certain main characters... all useless. This movie is more proof that as a trilogy goes on it just gets worse. The only reason these movies are still being made is because people (like me) continue to pay good to see them.For all of you who love these terrible excuses for cinema, no worries the movie perfectly sets up Saw IV.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

The third is always the worst,"Never has there been a a third film in any trilogy that beats the first or second. SAW 3 is no exception because its the worst of the three. But i can always say its the best trilogy out there and i am proud to have them on my DVD shelf.SAW 3 continues from the second. SAW 2 finished with Detective Eric Mathews (Donnie Whalberg) locked in the bathroom from the first. He gets out by bashing his foot in with the lid of the toilet. He manages to slide is crippled foot out of the chains and escape the bathroom.SAW 3 is plain sadistic but is still excellent. Its got real hardcore gore showing someone getting frozen to death, rib cage pulled out and someone almost getting drowned in pigs blood and guts. The film follows Jeff who has to go through a 3 stages of hell and meet the people who were involved in the death of his son. This is a witness, Judge and then the killer himself who ran his son over. He has the choice to let them live or watch them die. Its sick and gruelling torture film. However what he does not know is that is wife who is a nurse has been kidnapped to aid the dying Jigsaw. She is forced to wear a death collar thats connected to jigsaws heart monitor. When it drops to zero she dies.Its not for the faint hearted and its the worst Saw but don't believe for a second that its a rubbish because its not. Its a great film that pushes the boundaries of screen violence and gore.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disgustingly Horrible,"Saw III was horrible, terrible, disgusting, disturbing, bad, worse, *all of the above.I got dragged to see it by one of my friends who loves the Saw trilogy, but I was the first out of the theatre. I still can't believe I stayed for the entire thing... I could stand the first two; they were watchable, I even thought the second one was better than the first, but when I heard a third 'Saw' movie was being released, all I could do was shake my head in disgust.This movie is rated 'R' for a good reason. I am under age to see this movie by myself, and let me tell you, the theatre had tighter security than the Mona Lisa. And it was all for a good reason. The theatre actually said, 'This is really disturbing, if you get too grossed out, come back and ask for your money back.' My friend's mom did so very quickly. All this horrible movie was, was blood, guts, gore, tears, unneeded and unwanted nudity, and terrible acting. It made me sick to my stomach.One positive note: it made the first two movies make more sense.Thats about it...

Best out of the 3,"When i went to go see Saw 3 at cinemas, i went with my boyfriend and my best friend. My boyfriend having already seen it wouldn't tell me what happened. But i have to say i'm glad he didn't! I was amazed and grossed out during the whole movie. It certainly is A lot gorier than the previous 2 but well worth a watch. I would certainly recommend it to gore fans.The story was well planned out and kicked straight off after the previous saw. The plot was detailed and you didn't know what was going to come next! the characters were well played and the acting was brilliant. Amanda's character has definitely developed from the last film and this definitely stands out. A personal best. Well done lions gate! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
good themes but lacks a lot,"Once again this franchise is personal to me and therefore the review will seem biased. I'm not gonna lie though this was the beginning of the end of good Saw movies. While I still think this movie is good it takes a step down and delivers a more bland and slow movie.Jigsaw is not during great. He is getting towards the end of his life and with the help of his adversary Amanda Young, kidnaps a doctor named Lynn. She is tasked to keep jigsaw alive unitill another person named Jeff, is done with his game.The preformances in this movie pales in comparesent to the movie before. Tobin Bell as jigsaw is limited by a hospital bed and playing sick whitch puts Amanda Young in the forefront. Sadly Amanda's actress is not during a great preformance half the time, whitch is a shame for the movie focusing on her. The parental bond they gave jigsaw and Amanda is replaced with a wierd sexual tension whitch doesn't suit the charecter well.This movie is about Amanda's struggle with coming to terms with being the next jigsaw. Sadly the movie has some focus issues and this isn't comuicated well enough. This movie should have moved some things around and have more focus on the game at hand and Amanda's struggle. Sadly a lot of the runtime id used on nothing. The beginning of this movie seems unessesary (except setting up future charecters) and could easily be replaced with more focus on more interesting things. Setting up sequels is fine but is for the most part distracting and takes away from the movie you are watching now.The edeting is as always a bit amateurish and chaotic and in this movie I wished there were an epilepsy warning. In the middle there is a scene with quick flashing white lights that actually made me look away from the screen. While saw edeting and camera work always has been experimental, this movie highlights it for the worse rather than for the better.While there are some good traps and sequenceses in this film like the rag and the angel trap, most are forgettable. The movie is now focusing more on gore and grotesque ideas without much thought. It adds little and is sometimes too much. For example there is a brain surgery thrown into the movie that lasts too long. While it's important for the plot, it drags on and is again only there to make the movie more grotesque.Plot wise in terms of Jeff's game, this might be the strongest thematic game. A father has to accept his son is gone and that acting revenge solves nothing. It's a strong theme and is executed well. Sadly the traps doesn't fit into the narrative whitch would make it even better.This game plays into the larger narrative in a good way and creates 2 good twists. As said the movie is wigheted down by a lack of focus and that makes the tvists less impactful that they could have been but overall it delivers a clever plot. The movie also marks some conclusions and by that a great preformance by Tobin Bell and a thematic strong ending to a lot of build-up.This movie is far from perfect but is still a good movie. It has some great moments and properly the strongest thematic game. It is built around a twist that is overall well done and well written. It is sadly weighted down by a lack of focus, lackluster preformances and being to focused on being grotesque and setting up future events instead of making a more interesting movie. It's still a good watch and the last Saw movie I ask people to watch. Everything after this is only for fans.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Weakest One So Far,"While there are more traps in this movie than the others and the fact that they're more gruesome can only carry the movie so far. This one is missing what the other two had in terms of pacing and it really shows.While Jigsaw is being operated on, there's someone else trying to make their way through various tests. When we're watching the new person, the film grabs your attention. When that's not happening, the movie loses a lot of steam very quickly because there's not much to watch during the operation. In fact, there's so much pacing that's lost that there are numerous cuts back to the other films to fill in various parts of the story in an attempt to keep it up. I'm guessing they just used extended footage from filming before because they're all built around scenes from the previous two movies. In addition, there are lots of quick cuts. Sometimes that makes it harder to understand what's happening including one scene where a mysterious woman is in the park which is then never explained in any sense. I know the quick cuts are a staple of the Saw franchise but they went overboard here.This one also isn't really scary. More often than not, it shows things with incredible graphic detail which might make you turn your head away more than they'd make you scream.Great writing fuses the two parts together beyond the ending you'll probably see coming and does manage to tie everything up so the typical cop-out ending for other modern horror films doesn't apply here which has always been a strong point for the Saw series. Then there are WAY too many quick cuts to sum up everything that has happened in case you weren't paying attention to most of the movie.In the end I can't recommend it as highly as the other two films.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not that bad of a 3rd entry! I expected worse!,"While this movie's plot and premise isn't as captivating or as well-executed as the first one or even the second one, I enjoyed much of this movie. The gadgets/traps were clever and the tension felt real with what the stakes were. Sure it was completely and utterly disgusting but by the time you get to the 3rd movie you know what you're getting yourself into. Amanda was a pretty decent character in this and I also liked Bahar Soomekh. As always, Tobin Bell performs his role perfectly as an actor meant to play this character. It was also cool how they showed the set up to the main setting in the first movie with the original characters at one point. It's not as good as the previous entries (and there was another scene where a guy seemed to walk around without any issues with a nearly missing foot, but in only one part of the scene he couldn't!). It's still pretty good horror as far as I'm concerned!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

i got what i expected = Punishment!,"Just saw this in the cinemas today, while its the most grotesque in the trilogy, it can also crown itself as the worst. It reminded me more of a 2 hour music video rather than intelligent storytelling. It also had the worst acting as well whereas the first movie had some semi known actors and the 2nd had some actors from sitcoms/series, this has none of the above. Jigsaw reminds me more of a low budget Christopher Walken, and the main characters like the female doctor and Jeff doesn't create some kind of attachment or compassion for the viewer. If u have seen Tobe Hoopers ""Texas Chainsaw.."" classic, and remember it had a blonde female character that screams a lot in approximately 30 minutes somewhere in the movie, then just imagine seeing that in a 2 hour cocktail like Saw 3. Thats what u get, people that keeps screaming, cameras that switch around nearly every second and a story flow that never captivates you. The first movie was a blast and the 2nd was at least enjoyable, but the 3rd is a blend of frustration and loud noises. It certainly destroyed my view on the Saw series as a whole.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not one of the best examples of the genre, but a bearable conclusion to the series for fans","Most people who go to see Saw III will already know what they are letting themselves in for. A continuous helping of stylised gore, violence and torture where the only tongue in check will be one that is literally chained there in a macabre and psychotic trip that needs no justification other than an audience demand for video-nasty type scenes with the slightest pretence of psychological storyline to justify prolonged physical and mental cruelty that makes the Nazis look uninventive.The moral dilemmas seem pretentious in the extreme - a lovely doctor is forced to save a monster's life or be killed herself. A man bereaved of his son in a car accident has to 'forgive' all those vaguely involved to win his own redemption.As standard fare, Saw III delivers - no more and no less than Saw II (or The Hills Have Eyes or The Devil's Rejects and so on). Deranged serial killer, Jigsaw, devises complex games for his victims, often involving self-mutilation. Clues are left on cassette recorders, and the captives follow instructions to try and win a reprieve. Saw III reprises some of the themes and loose ends from the previous two movies, but stands up equally well on its own. Sadly, after so many films of this ilk have been made (particularly ones with the sophistication of say Hostel or Audition), Saw III loses much of its shock value and is little more than a late night gore-fest to wind up the series. The overuse of loud and jangling sound effects from the very beginning is distracting and unnecessarily sensationalist and I found myself weary within the first three minutes. You might want to concentrate hard as several lives are being tortured at once and separately, but all is joined up at the end by the bedridden mastermind (and if you were half asleep or drunk, he goes over the 'answer' more than once, slowly). This flesh ripping feast should not be attempted on a full stomach. Anyone tired of happy-slapping will doubtless get inspiration.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
On the Cusp of Grate,This movie in my opinion is better than Saw II in that instead of constant escape room problems it focuses on raw human emotion. While gore is still ever present it serves as a catalyst to the story instead of the main attraction. All this being said the end feels a bit forced in that each Saw movie thus far has had a dramatic twist/reveal accompanied by the same music and seemingly endless cutaways. The movie keeps the franchise alive and holds attention with it's storyline that forces the viewer to consider what they would do in the same situation. This movie takes the Saw franchise in a slightly different direction and is worth the watch.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
'Saw III' isn't a focused entry into the series,"Saw 3;; Jigsaw is back. The third installment picks up where the second left off, where we learned Amanda is part of Jigsaw's game. This time, she is appointed as his apprentice. This time, Jigsaw kidnaps a doctor to perform surgery on him in order to keep him alive, while Amanda kidnaps an unlucky man and puts him through an extremely twisted test.I really liked the original Saw. I thought it was clever and atmospheric. Saw 2 retained a decent amount of the same elements while pumping up the gore factor. The problem with Saw 3 is how far it veers off course from the original two. Installments one & two had their share of gore, but didn't rely on the gore to make the movie. Saw 3 is all about gore shock-value. And I don't mean that in a complimentary fashion.The plot literally feels like an excuse to string together a handful of shocking, gruesome death traps. The director has no intention whatsoever to keep the series ideas going, veering so off course, and paying so much attention to how much blood can spill and how many bones they can crack, you feel like you're strapped into a chair in an execution room, seeing person after person get brutally slaughtered.Saw 3 does have it's strengths. The twist in the final sequence is surprising and satisfying, although it's an alarmingly weak set-up for the next installment. Acting is solid, and the film does have some creepy, well-done flashback sequences.The beauty of the original Saw film was the gimmicky set-up was pulled off with ease. The second film had it's weaknesses, but improved on the plot of the original. The third film lacks focus on what originally made the Saw series a box-office smash. It focuses on what body part will get ripped off, burned, or torn apart more than it focuses on plot, direction or acting.2 from 4.",,Anonymous,Horror
Are you all delusional?,"I can't believe anyone with their brain still intact would give this movie an 8 or a 10 out of 10. This is trash. It's a poorly made sequel to a poorly made sequel to a poorly made original. You might get a kick out of it if you enjoy watching people get mutilated, but even the death scenes in this flick are so unimaginative and meaningless it's hard to care. The camera-work manages to be even more awful than in the original, with lots of quick cuts creating a series of badly lit, confusing nanosecond shots during what is supposed to be key scenes. The acting is awful, and not in a funny way, either - but hey, you knew this already, this is SAW we're talking about.Before anyone attacks me for being stupid enough to watch the sequel to a film I hated, let me point out that I was literally dragged to watch this film. I feel ashamed of myself for making the filmmakers richer by actually paying to watch this garbage in the cinema. What a pitiful freaking mess. Trust IMDb users to vote this tripe as the scariest movie of 2006.

If you liked the Saw movies than you'll love it,"Every Halloween for the past 3 years I get excited. It means that its time for Saw. The violence, storyline, and always shocking twist endings combine to make a very enjoyable movie for me. As far as that's concerned Saw 3 delivers perfectly. It is just like all the Saw movies. The gore is everything to expect from a Saw movie lots of blood and horrible things. The traps and violence make me cringe and so far Saw is the movies are the only real movies that have been able to do that. The storyline is great for the most part and evens provides insight into past Saw movies, explaining back stories and such. As usual it has a twist ending that wasn't quite as good as Saw 1 or 2 but was still surprising compared to the endings of other movies. Don't expect anything to shocking but it is surprising. Like most Saw movies it does have its flaws. Saw 1 had its acting, Saw 2 had an overly complicated ending, Saw 3 combines a little of both. The acting is definitely a step down from Saw 2 which is saying something because no one from Saw 2 was exactly Oscar-worthy. Also while Saw had a surprise ending that was an instant shock, Saw 2 had a long ending with several twists, Saw 3 goes the Saw 2 with a long ending with several shocks one of which it pulls out of the bag way to early in the movie causing me to figure out a lot of it before it actually happens. However, measuring Saw 3 up to other movies it is a lot better than most crap that Hollywood dubs ""horror"" movies and so for that I give it a high rating. If you like gore or any of the other Saw movies you'll love Saw 3. If you like horror movies you'll like it. If you're squeamish you should go no where near it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Definitely The Worst In The Series,"Part 1 was excellent, Part 2 was great, and from the trailers it felt like this one would be the best in the series, but to my surprise, it was the worst! I hated it, i guess showing jigsaw a lot was pissing me off, like part 1 how they kept him a secret and no one knew anything, now he's like, i don't know i guess i just didn't like it at all. It was bad. It's not even worth a rent, it was that bad. And i was actually surprised that i hated it this much, as much as i wanted to write a great review, i cant, like I'm not gonna lie. And NO i am NOT looking forward to saw 4! Anyways if you wanna rent this, good luck, but if you are let down, like me, don't say i didn't warn you!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Facing the philosophical aspect of forgiveness,"After a grilsy yet intellectual first movie and an intense psychological duel for the sequel, this third entry in the franchise deals with the philosophical aspect of forgiveness. Serial killer John Kramer is on his deathbed but he keeps organizing his twisted games in order to make people value their lives until his final breath. He asks an accomplice to kidnap a doctor who must make sure the serial killer survives until his latest victim succeeds in completing a series of particularly intriguing tests as a broken family father must decide whether he forgives those who are responsible for his son's tragic death that also destroyed his life. However, it's not only his latest victim who has to decide to be forgiving as another person is also playing a game without even knowing it.The strongest element of the movie is its philosophical depth when the viewers needs to wonder how they would react under specific circumstances. Could you forgive a driver who hits your son so badly that he dies? How would you feel about a witness to this accident who doesn't intervene? What would you do to a judge that spares the reckless driver from a harsh sentence? The movie teaches us that we are all monsters inside but have different capacities in controling them.This third entry is also the one with the greatest depth regarding the dying serial killer. One understands his motivations better than in previous installments. He is open to discuss his points of view on his deathbed which gives us a strangely fascinating yet gloomily repelling insight.The film's stunning conclusion manages to surprise yet again as all loose ends are tied together and lead to a dramatic showdown that viewers won't see coming. The scriptwriters still manage to add intellectual depth at the most unexpected moments. The clever ending is rewarding and already leaves the viewers wanting to watch the next installment.The philosophical aspect of forgiveness makes this movie stand out. The dealy traps are slightly less twisted than before but much more personal for the test subjects. Thanks to this fresh approach, this film is only slightly less intriguing than the strong immediate predecessor. Fans of the series can't get around watching this film. Saw III underlines the franchise's status as greatest horror film series of the new millennium.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
god awful,"seriously? seriously???? Can anyone actually have enjoyed this absolute abomination of a film? I thought the first saw was DECENT at best, with acting that rivaled the best 9th grade media productions, but this is just embarrassing. It plays like it was edited by a rabid 10th grader on crack. And after two prior films that have proved they can make money, it still looks like it was made for about seven dollars. The ""plot twists""...are you serious? It calls for a complete suspension of reason, and then tries to act like it's morally and intellectually superior to every other horror film ever made. The sophomore philosophy major college dropouts who wrote this should be banned from making a film ever again. I found myself looking around the room for ANYTHING to distract me from how god awful this movie was. Stay far, far away. Really, though, when our taste has fallen so far that even when we seek cheap, easy thrills we turn to such dryvel as this...what hope is there?",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
could be a lot better,"It's more sick and twisted than ever. But highly unrealistic  there wasn't enough blood when someone was cut, the characters didn't seem to mind when they was tortured. The ordinary people would at least loose consciousness when they are put through those kinds of things; obviously the people in the movie are extraordinary/super humans. I have felt pain and I know how the human body react to pain. Apparently those people haven't because they couldn't even act as if they were in pain. I got up three times and if the movie was a little longer I wouldn't have stayed till the end, which would've been the only mistake. I have to admit that the ending is very good and surprising (as any other Saw movie). I await Saw4; Hopefully it would be better and more realistic. :)",,Anonymous,Horror
"continues well, gory and surprising as ever!","Okay, now i heard from my friends that this 1 sucked. I looked online and they seemed to kinda agree, but it was awesome.First things first, the plot. Its about a married couple with problems that has been captured by the so-called serial killer named jigsaw and one has to keep jigsaw alive at all times from cancer while the other is playing a series of deadly games.In this saw, they focus a lot about the character Amanda who has a story quite interesting. I am not going to spoil anything, but i can tell you this, do not watch saw III without watching the other 2. The character jigsaw is once again, such an awesome villain, and the acting from others was pretty good. The complaint i might have for the film is that they went a little overdone with the gore it was not at all necessary, but i wont slam the film hard for that.Overall saw III is a clever and well done sequel, so hopefully saw IV does not ruin the franchise. By the way,there are three twists in saw III and they are pretty cool 8.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Goriest Movie In Past 20 years!!!,"I waited for ""SAW III"" about 7 months and I finally watched it. It was definitely gory as the creators said. Today I almost lost my reserved place, which I was reserved two days ago. About 88% of all watcher was reserved heir places, because this movie is very very popular and all people are crazy about it.The beginning of this movie was too dark and I cant see anything. But the creepiest thing was showed very good. Everyone in hall was freak out. I was expected the chains scene first, but the bathroom was OK.When they kidnapped a doctor Lynn, then begins THE MOVIE. The rules was really smart and it was definitely entertaining. I don't knew, that Jeff had to revenge for he's angriness. Thoes three traps was not that good, that the original and first sequel, but it was much torture, that psychological nightmare...Actors acted the same wonderful, like in the original. There was more twists and it makes this movie to be ONE OF THE BEST IN HORROR. Script was the same too, because James Wan is the same good, as like in past three years. If it will be a part IV, I will go there sure (if it will be a world premiere). I give a 8 for the one of goriest movies of all time...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disgusting,"I thought that this movie was the most gross and frankly has the most disturbing torture scenes around. It crosses the line between acceptable and something that you would find on the black market showing real torture scenes.It has a totally confusing, complicated plot that twists and turns like the bones it breaks in the movie, leaving the watcher scratching his head with ""What just happened?""

More gore than story,"Finally! I saw Saw 3! I was scared I'd have to wait for the rental, but my boyfriend finally got up the courage and we saw the film last night and man, this movie was one heck of a film to get through. It was so so so so much gorier than the first two. I was flinching the whole way through this movie, especially the brain operation scene, gah! Nmgah! I can't even describe an English word for that scene. The contraptions are scarier and seeming more impossible to get out of in the third installment, and while we do have a main story, this Saw seemed more focused on grossing people out.The jigsaw killer is back, but the first three games seem impossible to get out of and ends up killing everyone. We find out that the jigsaw killer is also very sick with a brain tumor and Amanda kidnaps a doctor with a troubled marriage and family, she has a contraption on her head, in order for her to live, she has to keep the jigsaw killer alive. In the mean time, there is a game going on in the same building with a man who has sworn vengeance on anyone who hurts his family, including the death of his son and to kill the man who ran him over.The story was an average contender considering how well put together the first Saw was, it was good, just didn't thrill me as much as the first or second one did. It just seemed like the sequels were more based on grossing people out though, but I can guarantee you though that Saw III has more gore! That was for sure, but the ending is a good one as you figure out another jigsaw puzzle, I smell another sequel!6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
They should be ashamed,"Let me preface this by saying that i am HUGE saw fan. I did a philosophy paper on the morals of saw. The Film makers of saw three should be ashamed. This was not the same concept that the saw movies tried to make. This was as much a Saw film as Batman and Robin was a true Batman movie. When you see saw one, there is little gore and violence. Its all about psychology and philosophy and mystery. Its a masterpiece in that it doesn't make you wince at the action, it makes you ponder. The storyline is phenomenal and the whole dialog taking place is genius. When you see saw 2, the acting has improved. There is a little more gore, but the movie still isn't driven by it as much as the movie is about the dialog and philosophy. When Matthews and Jigsaw are discussing the will to survive and the cure to cancer, that is genius in that is gives the audience something to ponder. There are a couple of ""wince scenes"" but with good reason. Saw 3 breaks the tradition. Yes, there is still some dialog, but it gets lost in the movie between the scenes of gore that drive saw 3. It isn't about philosophy, its about the inventiveness of the traps, and that makes this movie nothing more than a really creative slasher film. Most of the violence was unnecessary and overly graphic (not a saw trademark by any means) and the movie makes you sick more than it makes you ponder. Even the twist, which is suppose to be Saws trademark and specialty is predictable and doesn't shock you as much as make you feel stupid. This movie excels as a ""gross you out"" film and fails as a true Saw film. Mix that in with constant seizure-worthy strobes going off (a couple people in the theater had seizures from all the strobbing) and this movie is packaged for 15 year old goth in every family. But thats not a what saw was about. I know Saw. Saw is a personal friend of mine. And THIS FILM, ladies and gentlemen, is NO SAW. Don't waste your time hoping for another Saw. This movie is intellectually devoid on every level and is only good for mind-numbing violence.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
I will SAW to see another one!,"Saw & saw 2 are two good films i think. The first one had a much better story than the second one, but the acting wasn't better in the second one. Cary Elwes doesn't really do it for me as a serious actor. Anyway. When i saw the second one for the first time i was pretty shocked. In a good way though :) So i was really looking forward to seeing this one!!! I went to the movies with my girlfriend the day after i showed her the first ones. She's not a horror-fan at all, but kinda liked them. We SAW the third one and she actually was angry with me after-wards. She didn't think the movie had anything but gruesome and pointless torture scenes. Me on the other hand had a blast.

To be honest, it was pretty hard to top the ""jigsaw"" methods from the first two parts, but at least you could feel the sympathy for the torturing ones, while in this parts the characters are too week to feeling sorry for them. Except Jeff (Angus Macfayden), who's role is well performed.Still, if you are ""jigsaw fan"" or just dig the first two parts, you'll find some interesting moments, but you won't talk a day after about them, as you did in the previous parts.

Comparing the trilogy,"I saw Saw 3 at a Saw marathon. They played the first, then the second and then the third. it was the day before Saw 3 actually came out. im not kidding when i say that that was the funnest night of my life. Out of the first two the second was my favorite. Now my favorite is the third. The thing that the writers did in the Saw trilogy is kept making the next movie better. the second is better than the first and the third is better than the second. in the third Saw there are many different ""games"" with people. If you throw up easily watching disgusting stuff then bring a little baggy with you if your going to watch in a theater. Cause it can get pretty sick. The movie quality keeps getting better and better, and the acting is also SO much better than it used to be. Its always confusing what buildings they're in. You never know if its a block away or across the street or in a whole other region of the city. I think they meant to do that tho. it makes it more.. mysterious, and confusing.

To be perfectly honest, I have an extreme reaction to blood. When watching Blade, I fainted and almost had a seizure but when viewing Saw, I was not very uncomfortable. However, Saw III is nowhere related to its parent dollar-maker. I had to leave the theater in the first 15-20 minutes of the film because I thought I was going to throw up.If you enjoy being scared by seeing humans mutilated, butchered, frozen alive, sliced open, burned, and/or broken then take a look at this.

Chief GoreMongral's Movie Review: Saw 3,"It's Halloween and it's time for another (and apparently) final Saw movie. The cast is in place (with the crafty Tobin Bell and the sexy psycho Shawnee Smith) and the game is beginning, but is this a good closure or another cursed part 3 in a long line of bad part 3's? Saw 3 throws us right in the mix, picking up right after the end of Saw 2. We get to see former New Kid Donnie Walburg and what really happened to him after the credits rolled (it's fun!!!). After this the movie goes on to its new story about a female doctor that has been having marital issues and seems to be a bit drained with her job and life as she has resorted to pill popping. What better a person than Jigsaw and Amanda to come in and help with that problem.A proposition is made as Jigsaw is needed to be kept alive for one final game that will put every character in the movie in situations that will require them to make the right choice or the usual repercussion will follow. This leads to our other test subject that has had issues with releasing his anger and depression over his son being hit by a car. Leave it to Jigsaw to put all the possible ""pieces"" in place for the man to make choices for those involved to ""live or die"".In the end both stories intertwine which leads into a double wam bam ending that should end the franchise in a good way. To say anymore would be spoiling it but also to add anymore movies to this trilogy would be an injustice. These movies should be remembered as being a solid example of 3 good movies and proof that if handled correctly you can make 3 solid movies, similar in nature yet each with its own characteristics that allow them to stand on there own.Also this movie will shed light on the first 2 movies adding elements that allows us to see things from Jigsaw and Amanda's point of view. The only question for me still is what happened to Dr.Gordon? Anyway thats besides the point. In the end we get a good horror and gore film (oh yes there will be gruel!!!) with some sadistic torture and mayhem just in time for the Halloween weekend.In closure I give Saw 3: 7/10: Good closure (hopefully) to the Saw Legacy. Fans of the first 2 will really get something out of this, new fans may want to watch the first 2 before entering in to the series. To do so will shed light on a lot of the foreshadowing that takes place in the film!!

What a waste of time...,"As much as I love horror movies, this was a huge waste of time. I thought this film paled in comparison so much to the first two, that it's almost albino. I am so mad that I actually spent money to see it.There were so many flashbacks to the first two films, that it loses your attention. And the fact that they left this one open for another sequel is just crazy. My only hope is that with the fourth installment, the film-makers redeem themselves from the tripe I viewed last night.The scenes of gore were well done, I will give it that, but the fact that the plot pretty much sucked just took away from the film. I don't believe a successful horror film can be made just with blood and guts. These films actually need a decent story to go with them.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
MA15+ is too lenient,"I can understand why people would be walking out and fainting from this film. And when I say ""people"" I especially mean the 15-17 years olds that shouldn't be seeing this film. I work at the cinemas, and I've never seen people walk out from a film because they felt nauseas. I've also never seen so many people leave to go to the ""toilet"" in the first half hour. This is almost definitely due to the first three scenes, which are all pretty non-stop violence, and they're needing to get out to have a break from it. I can't understand why this film doesn't have an R18+ certificate here in Australia. I'm 20, and I wouldn't be able to sit through all of those scenes. The most appalling, however, was a man taking his son aged around 11 to see it. This isn't allowed to happen with R rated films.

Game over? You wish...,"Saw II, while good, lacked the odd charm of the first installment by trying to be more complex, a fact that also derived from the previously unrelated script having been adjusted to fit in the franchise mythology. Saw III, which was written by ""series"" co-creator Leigh Whannell (and based, reportedly, on an idea by the first film's director/co-writer James Wan), was meant to finish the planned trilogy in a glorious way. That didn't happen, and sadly, the only one to blame is Whannell himself, despite his best efforts (he even manages to elicit some sympathy reprising his role as Adam in a harrowing flashback).This time, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) has reached the end line: his brain tumor has reduced him to near immobility, but since he still has one more game to play, he needs to stay alive for at least a few more hours. Hence his decision to have his apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith) kidnap Dr. Lynn Denlon (Sakar Boomekh), a surgeon who has to keep the killer alive while his plan is set in motion. The caveat: she has an explosive collar attached to her neck, meaning that if Jigsaw flat-lines, she dies as well. Meanwhile, Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is still missing after being kidnapped in the previous film, and a guy named Jeff (Angus MacFadyen) has to face the toughest challenge of his life: he will cross paths with three people who were more or less directly involved in his son's death and, in pure Jigsaw tradition, he will have to choose whether to save them or not.The moral question at the center of the Saw films has always been intriguing to say the least: if your life depended on it, would you sacrifice someone else? Saw III changes that format in that Jeff is in no immediate danger, but has to decide if those who are in such a situation deserve to survive. That idea is quite strong, and MacFadyen conveys the ambiguity required in those scenes with the right dose of doubt and desperation. Acting-wise, the other performances are as decent as one can expect from these movies, with Bell once again being the best of the lot, even when the role essentially demands nothing more than him lying on an operating table and explaining his view on life, death and the ""necessity"" of torture.Even Bell's work, however, can't cover the weaknesses that emerge from Whannell's plotting: whereas the main storyline is, as said before, strong enough to justify the film, the flashbacks involving Wahlberg's character are nothing but a lame excuse for pointless brutality, swearing and Shawnee Smith screaming like a madman (or woman, more correctly). In fact, Smith's turn seems to have no real purpose for most of the movie (not that Amanda had any real depth previously, but that's another story). And that leads us to THE late-night conversation topic of choice when the Saw universe is involved: the final twist, which worked superbly in the first chapter, less successfully in the second and comes off as a major disappointment this time around, mainly because it contradicts Whannell's intentions - he set out to make the Saw films a complete trilogy (which is why he takes time to explain what many perceived as a plausibility error in the original movie), and yet it's obvious that his ""definitive"" epilogue was going to leave the door open for further installments.As such, Saw III, while brilliantly filmed and appropriately upsetting, is the weakest link in what was meant to be a mere trilogy. There's almost a sense of cruel irony to the bit where Jigsaw, for the ""last "" time, says: ""Game over."".5,5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A nasty little film.,"Saw 3 follows the rule of decreasing quality and increasing gore that horror films continually find themselves in when they become sequels.I felt that the plot was quite implausible, and I found it hard to take the film seriously.And those messages left by the doll or the mini-tape players.....oh! purlease! Spare me your pathetic lectures on how each victim has wasted their life and 'deserves' their fate, unless they torture themselves to get free.It seemed clear to me that the target audience was American teenage boys, who find the torture scenarios 'cool' and debate endlessly on whether or not the victims deserved their fate.This film is not suspenseful, it's not very watchable, it doesn't grip hold of you, and there are moments when you think you're going to be sick by the horrible torture sometimes on display. In other words, it's just not Saw is it? Now that was a much better movie.I advise fans of this series to watch this movie once, it's all you'll need.And for those who've never seen any of the Saw movies, avoid this like the plague. You'll think all those people who rave about the Saw movies are sick morons, but really it's just the ones who rave about Saw 3 who are the sick morons!

So naturally, when I saw the reviews here claiming that the movie was horribly violent and gory, I thought nothing of it.Big mistake.I'll tell ya, I thought Hostel was gory, what with all the decapitations, vomiting, and dismemberment, but wow... this one takes the cake as the goriest movie I have seen since Silent Hill, and probably the goriest movie I've ever seen period.

Wicked and gruesome entertainment! Almost as good as the original,"The Saw franchise gets so much hate. The films get hate for being 'torture porn', and while I liked it a lot, if I had to label any film that, it would be Saw III. The opening scenes, the one involving Detective Matthews, the one with the man in chains, and the one with Kerry's final scene, are all probably the most disgusting, gruesome, disturbing scenes ever in a horror film. I was flinching so much, and maybe the strong opening is what got a lot of critics mad, and from then on, they decided not to like it. I actually had that same attitude. While Saw was disturbing, but did not show much, and the sequel more gruesome, none of them ever came close to the torture scenes in Saw III, and so I was prepared to hate it. But as the film went on, I noticed how different it was from Saw II. I loved the mystery and tension in the original, and while Saw III does not compare, I actually think it comes close to being just as good. Saw III is actually a much better film than Saw II, which I would never have imagined. Saw II goes the formulaic way of horror films, with a group of people trapped in a scary house, each getting killed one by one. Saw III is not like this. It revolves around two stories, and giving us more information on Jigsaw and how Amanda came to be his assistant. It is all very interesting, and while I thought Bahar Soomekh was the weakest, I found Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell are very strong actors. They completely made these characters be what they are, and while we had already seen Tobin Bell's great acting in Saw II, we had not seen Smith this important before. She really creates a very compelling and scary character. Her facial expressions, her moods, she gives one heck of a performance, and good for her! Towards the end, the film does become more messy, but I loved it all! The signature twist did not disappoint, although we can hardly be shocked or surprised as much as in the original Saw because we know every time there is a Saw film, there will be a twist at the end. But props to this film, I can see the reason many critics hate it is because of the gruesome and bloody torture scenes, but the film does have central themes about human nature that doesn't make it a brainless horror film. Saw III is actually better than Saw II, and almost as good as the original! Now, I have to see the next installments!",,Anonymous,Horror

Truly Awful,"The Midnight screening of Saw III was only about half full, an oddity for a 12:01 unveiling of a new movie at one of LA's most popular theater. Actually, there were more film-goers there than I had invasion, and I was shocked that there were still as many people remaining when the credits rolled.Saw III is a much too long, much too ridiculous, much to gory, and not at all frightening piece of B-Movie-with-money trash. If Saw was clever and mildly gory, Saw II was contrived and very gory, than Saw III is bland and ultra gory. The gore in the first one shocked as well as served a satisfying purpose; here it just mortifies for the sake of mortification. The two-hour movie would have been thirty minutes if all flashbacks were eliminated, I found myself thinking this film should come with a warning label that says, ""This film contains 25% new material."" Its amazing the amount of places that the audience is told Amanda (Shawnee Smith) back-story and what she has done to ""aid"" Jigsaw in the past. The audience is given no credit for; or incentive to, watch the first two movies. Everything is spelled out in gory red detailed flashbacks. Folks if you want to sit through the first two films again, and you don't want to pay $15.00 to do it, I suggest you close your eyes and remember the parts of the first two films that stick most in your mind. Piece them together like a montage, and play it on a continuous loop. If you do that for 2 hours you would have just watched saw III.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Only for those who see beyond the screen!,"I think we all know that SAW 1+2 were excellent not only because they play with us and gave us an unexpected end beyond every imagination but personally i believe that SaW movies are not only a movie that we see just for fun or killing time.NOTE THAT DOWN , Saw movies are a lesson for life that we all need , not because we are unable to find it out alone but is a chance to see our life again from the beginning and understand what finally is that meaning of life at a point.After my long prologue i finally get to the point , SAW 3 is maybe not as prototype as SAW 1 or as dark as SAW 2 but is gives an important lesson that I will never forget in my whole life (i am not about to mention it for not destroying the end). Thats what you must keep from the movie the lessons it gives.Sometimes while i was watching that movie i felt that the work that was done was not such professional as the other two films and the end it was somehow quick and i didn't enjoy it but i forgive it to it.WATCH that movie and remember me that the peoples with eyes that see beyond the movie will enjoy it the others will say that is an ordinary movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A dud, read this review.. no spoilers.","I am a real big fan of the first saw movie and it has gone downhill from there. The drop from 2 to 3 was a big one indeed. Bad acting, and unsatisfying ending and plot spells doom for the saw franchise. This movie was so concerned making innovative traps (that weren't even impressive), that they forgot about the rest of the movie. The sad part about this is that it had room to become a great movie, but it just simple faltered.. falling flat on its face. I really hope that when we look back on the saw franchise, that we remember only the first movie and appreciate it for what it was..Thumbs down... way down",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

AN OK SAW movie,"Saw was outstanding and original. Saw II was interesting and effective. Saw III was gory but too messy! Saw as a whole is a good series of films that a nerve wracking and written with ingenuity, except for this latest addition. Saw III set the tone that it would be a gory film and it delivered but it's fault is that the storyline became too messy and at times convoluted. I feel that the scriptwriter try to add in so many add ons from the previous two films that it lost focus.Although as i stated earlier this film was gory and it did make me squirm at times in the cinema e.g. Donnie Wahlberg breaking his own foot ouch! It is a fair film and is watchable, do enjoy. I thought that this would be the last on the series and ended well, but they have just announced a fourth check it out.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The pros and cons of formula film-making,"Probably the most obvious thing a viewer will notice about SAW III is that it follows the formula of the first two films. That's not always bad, of course: It worked for Last Crusade and Die Hard With A Vengeance, for instance. Unfortunately, the third film of a trilogy can often end up noticeably inferior to its predecessors. This is far more common, apparent in films such as Jurassic Park III, Final Destination 3, T-III and many others. Sadly, Saw III falls into this last category.Don't despair, however; for there are benefits to a formula, too, namely that you can count on a movie providing an entertaining if not spectacular experience--assuming you enjoyed the first two, of course. And that's where Saw III works. If you want gory traps, daring escapes and a mysterious master plan that's not revealed until the very end, then Saw III will deliver! Also keep in mind it's not completely formulaic. The relationship between Amanda and John has been developing for some time now, and continues to do so in this new film, which adds a different dynamic. The point of view is increasingly focused on John, which also gives a unique flavor to this sequel.The problem, though, preventing me from giving a completely positive review, is twofold: Firstly, the character development of the new faces is very lacking; secondly, for a formula based on plot twists, this film is a little too predictable. Given the pros and cons of the final product, I'd give it a six out of ten. In my rating scheme, that basically means it's worth watching, but I'd wait till it's out of the theater.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the first; more on par with the second,"The Saw franchise is one of those guilty pleasures that you don't necessarily have to keep secret. The first film was a refreshing horror film with an innovative script and enough chills to keep you wanting more. The second was more a by-the-book suspense film with more gore than frights.Saw III sits in the same arena as the second film in that it bases its shock value on gore, not suspense. There are very few moments that actually jump out and scare you (actually, I can't remember even one) which is unfortunate since that is what true horror films need. As well, the cinematography is so dark for most of the film that it is difficult to know exactly what is being shown.However, the audience is treated to more of the innovative torture devices and twist endings that made the first film work. I ended up figuring the ultimate twist of the story well before it was presented, but it was still a worthy payoff. And the slight open-end to the film is a little but of a cruel way of leaving things hanging, though in a good way.All in all, like the second film, Saw III is a fun little gore fest that's not incredibly unique. In that, it certainly won't stand out as one of the better horror films of all times, but it will certainly entertain for an evening. And sometimes that's all you need.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A daily comment from Midget Emma: Saw III (2006),"The darkest and most emotional Saw movie. This time they take the gore to the next level,the traps to the next level but take the twist down a level.The twist felt empty and was very forgettable. But don't worry when you see Saw IV the twist makes much more sense.The gore in Saw movies never bothers me. But if you you have a weak stomach you may be covering your eyes.The acting was 50-50. Some of the actors that find themselves in a trap don't always come off as believable. But it will do.I recommend this if you have seen the first two films and make sure you see the first two before this. My friend watched this one first and then watched number 1. Big mistake.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
pretty lame,"Saw III is not that great; in fact, it's not even scary. I heard that it was much better than Saw II, so I decided that I should give it a try. Although, Saw III has a plot with as many twists and turns as the other two movies, it could never bring me to the edge of my seat. If gore scares you, then this movie could put you into a state of shock. It is one of the goriest movies that I have ever seen. Unfortunately, gore alone cannot make a movie great. Saw III lacked the originality that the first had and the plot could be guessed by anyone who had seen the first two. If you love to ""play a game"" with Jigsaw, then maybe this will still be an ""instant classic"", but for me it was like a lame, bloody game of Operation.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Perhaps a bit over done, but well done just the same","Like a great many millions of fans, I have come to enjoy this series since being forced to watch the first film.A friend of mine told me I would like the first Saw and made me watch it. I was impressed. Like the first Scream, the ending blindsides you.So of course I watched the second one... I was left a little hollow there and glad I waited for it to air on HBO, but Saw III made up for my lack of enthusiasm for the second.The thing I most enjoyed about the first Saw was the compelling story and fine acting. And being a true horror buff, naturally I enjoyed the blood as well. While Saw III takes the viewer to new places and the lowest of lows (""lows"" in a good way), I also think it overcompensates for the shortcomings of Saw II.The story of Saw III was well written and well cast. However, they over indulge in the gore just a touch. I have little doubt that the producers took the fan's criticisms of the second film (not enough gore) and went out of their way to shove it down everyone's throat by doing everything in their power (short of taping our eyelids open) to make us watch and potentially, make us sick.By which I am referring to the length of a few of the scenes in particular, they drag on and on, forcing as much gratuitous gore upon us as the MPAA would eventually allow. And don't you dare shield your eyes, you are best suited to watch due to those scenes being laced with flashbacks and important plot points... thus my reference to: taping our eyes open.While it also obvious that the producers are pushing the story to a degree simply for the sake of setting us up for more sequels, the story did have a natural flow to it. Jigsaw is more defined and we are allowed to get to know him. Amid all of the violence and peril he thrusts his victims in, you can actually see his point of view and almost come to accept it.Bottom line, I am a fan of the series, and although I would love to know that with every October I can count on a movie with the word ""Saw"" in the title, I hope they don't push this series too far... Because it is all to possible that Saw could fall into a trap of it's own and die a horrible-gruesome death because it couldn't head it's very own message.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
what a crap !,"These movies are so ridiculous i cannot even get upset with them... We have a poor guy that is dying of cancer, a few months left to live according to SAW I... Yet, this person is capable of organizing such evil plans, finding big isolated apartments and buildings to use for his purpose (probably he is renting them, so he has to find the landlords as well to agree on a price), sets up all the equipment he needs, cameras, traps, state of the art electronics (some of them should be patents as well, they are not commercially available, maybe this guy is in close collaboration with researchers in MIT Media Lab...)Not mentioning the fact that the guy must have a ""fat"" bank account since he is spending thousands of dollars for all these...OK, now in SAW 3 we have the cheap excuse that 'hey, he is not alone, he has help from his young student that was charmed of the professor' but it's still ridiculous and impossible things to just swallow...And we have the best !!! The reason why he is doing this ? Well, he woke up one morning and made the conclusion that people don't appreciate life, so he has to take it from them'. So cheap and childish excuse to depend a whole film upon it, but i am sure some people opened their mouths in the cinemas and said ""wowww, impressive, that's the reason, that explains everything !!!!""Come on guys, the movie is a piece of junk !!!!!As a bottom line, there is a limit in the number of flaws and the degree of stupidity a movie should have, if this limit is exceeded, then we make a movie without reason just for the people to go and give their 8 euros...",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Still good, but more predictable.","I loved Saw, it was a while since i felt so uncomfortable by watching a horror flick. I thought saw II was good, and saw III is definitely worth watching.The reason why i thought that the first Saw is so wonderfully refreshing, is that you do not know what is coming. You just go along with what the movie brings you. Not only is the whole 'game' concept unclear, but it is also a very unpredictable movie. Anything could have happened! and it did!In saw 3, there are more predictable, standard-scare, setups. Things they use to scare you with, but you know beforehand they will not happen because it would ruin the rest of the film. Furthermore, the movie uses a lot more gore, which by itself is not bad, but again, it is a predictable, proved horror movie path.Despite those predictable in-between scenes, the final piece of the puzzle in the plot of saw 3 manages to lift the level of the film up to its predecessors. So, definitely worth watching. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Third Time the Charm,"Saw 3 (2006)*** (out of 4)Jigsaw is on his death bed and kidnaps a nurse to help keep him alive. If he dies so does she. Also on hand is another man who must play Jigsaw's game. To say anything else would pretty much ruin several surprises that happen towards the end of the film. I'm not a fan of this series and while I found the first two film very well made, I think they crossed the line that no horror film should cross in the fact that they were mean spirited and sadistic. I was worried at the start of this film because we once again entered that sadistic violence but thankfully this ended after the first thirty minutes and when the ""game"" started we actually got a pretty good little thriller. The torture scenes are a lot tamer and take a back seat to the story, which is why I think this is the best of the series. The character of Jigsaw has always been an interesting one but we really didn't get to know anything about him in the first two movies. He's on full display here and it was interesting to see him interact with the people playing the game. I viewed the unrated DVD and I'm not sure how much is different from the R-rated theatrical cut but the brain operation scene is certainly well done.",,Anonymous,Horror
Mind numbingly boring,"Lord. I have nothing against violence, so that's not why I hated this movie. The problem with Saw III is the fact that once you get past the violence, it's a boring film with next to no originality. The characters are worthless, so why care when they die? The ""atmosphere"" is non-existent, unless you count dim lighting as atmosphere. There is nothing frightening about the movie, no interesting plot, no character development or empathy. This leaves two things violence, and boredom, and to be honest, violence with nothing to make it interesting is boring in of itself, which means this movie really has one element: Boredom.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
What is Saw 3 to me?,"About two or three hours ago I sat down and pre-screened Saw III at my theater. I wasn't sure what to expect, except blood, gore, and twists.

I never thought the first one was bloody or anything, but while watching this movie, I had to look away a few times. Great right? Yes. I liked the movie. I felt the movie was created beautifully (ironic huh?) and lived up to my standards. I thought the twists were a little predictable but still GOOD. One of my friends made the comment ""This movie is a setup for Saw 4."" I am not sure I agree with that. Some of the death scenes could have been a little more drawn out and just more UMPH to them.The story line plot is simple....well....sort of. Jigsaw (Bell) is dying, just like the other two movies. Doctor Lynn has to keep Jigsaw alive long enough for this man to complete several ""games."" If they both succeed, they win. The movie also gives flashbacks to other victims in the other two movies.I felt there were several plot holes in the movie. I am not going to get into them because that would cause spoilers.

"""Saw III"" - A Gruesome Spiral of Pain and Redemption","""Saw III,"" released in 2006 and directed again by Darren Lynn Bousman, marks a turning point in the franchise, as it delves deeper into the lore of Jigsaw while pushing the boundaries of gore and brutality. While it offers some intriguing character development and a few memorable traps, the film's relentless focus on shock value begins to overshadow its storytelling.In this installment, we see Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) on his deathbed, continuing his twisted work with the help of his protégé, Amanda (Shawnee Smith). The story follows Dr. Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh), who is kidnapped and forced to keep Jigsaw alive long enough to witness another of his gruesome games involving a grieving father, Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), who must decide the fates of those responsible for his son's death.""Saw III"" delves deeper into Jigsaw's motivations, exploring his relationship with Amanda and revealing more about his philosophy of redemption through suffering. Tobin Bell continues to deliver a compelling performance, bringing a surprising amount of gravitas to a character who could easily have been a one-dimensional villain.However, the film's increasing reliance on graphic violence and elaborate torture scenes begins to feel gratuitous. The traps in ""Saw III"" are more brutal than ever, but the focus on spectacle comes at the cost of narrative depth. The film's pacing also suffers from its extended runtime, with some sequences feeling drawn out and repetitive.The twist ending, while effective, lacks the impact of the first two films, as the formula begins to feel familiar. The emotional core of the story, centered on Jeff's struggle with forgiveness, is interesting but ultimately overshadowed by the film's relentless gore.""Saw III"" is a mixed bag, offering some worthwhile moments for fans of the franchise but beginning to show signs of fatigue. While it deepens the series' mythology, it also marks the point where the balance between story and shock starts to tilt too heavily toward the latter.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I enjoy it.,"There aren't many movies that can make me squirm in my seat and make me look away. This is one of those few movies that made me squirm. The gruesome torture scenes are creative and original, and the effects, what they do to make us believe that all this might just be real because it looks like it is just brilliant. If you think the director has run out of trap ideas, believe me when I tell you that there are plenty of traps that caused horror movie fanatics to cringe when it comes into play.It is has much gore, more than the other SAW movies.

A disappointment in an otherwise great series,"Saw III isn't that bad. It's just that after an amazing Saw and a great Saw II, it comes out as a disappointment. The acting is decent, like in most Saw movies. Shawnee Smith has a different approach to her character: she acted well in this movie, and I did feel sorry for Amanda throughout this movie. Angus Macfadyen is okay as Jeff, though I didn't really like his character. He turned out to be plain dumb at the end of the movie. Tobin Bell is excellent, needless to say he's probably one of the only actors who will never disappoint in a Saw movie, and sadly to say, some of the best acting moments come from Lyric Bent, who has two minutes or so in the movie and Donnie Wahlberg who has close to five minutes in the movie. The girl who played Lynn was just plain awful.The story is well written, but it comes out as pure torture-porn, with each ''test'' being an excuse to show as much blood, gore and guts as possible. It has a decent ending however, but it just doesn't make up like the first two. The traps themselves are cool, but to me it takes more than just traps, blood, gore and guts to make a Saw movie. Overall, this is a disappointment, though I probably wouldn't mind watching it again, but it's not the type of movie I would buy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not that bad...could be better though,"I was surprised! Saw was great, Saw II was equally good. But this...this WASN'T. I mean, it was good, had unique traps and everything. But it just...had fallen from the first 2. I guess my biggest grievance was Amanda. I didn't like her since we all knew she was helping John, and she wouldn't let us forget it! Lynn also wasn't that great. A couple of times I wished the contraption would just go off. Also there were TOO many unanswered questions. Not that there weren't in the previous movies, but this movie seemed to live off of them. Torture seems to have taken over rather than fear in this movie. The first 2 movies dealt with fear and panic while this relied on pure torture and agony. This also seemed to rely on gore for its scares rather than sudden climaxes. However...it IS a Saw movie. I did like the storyline and some of the contraptions. John was good, Jeff was very convincing. I also liked the twists in the movie. 6/10, not bad...but please, try harder next time Bousman.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Probably the last good sequel,"Saw III, here we go, this is in my opinion the last good film in the Saw Franchise, and to me is my second favorite in the series.Basically John Kramer, the original Jigsaw Killer, is about to meet his fate from his Brain Tumor's issue, and Amanda Young, his only assistant must search for help to cured his severe problem, so she kidnaps an Doctor who was originally an assistant of Kramer's ex-doctor, to figured-out an way to end it. Meanwhile, an new victim, who lost his son from an DUI Incident a few years prior, and ever since then felt vengeful towards his killer, must plays Jigsaw's game to shows him that Forgiveness exists, by coming upon a few more Victims in traps who are in any way connected to his Son's death, and it his choice of letting them live or Die because of what they do with his personal incident.The characters in this movie, I got to admit is a-bit better than some of the ones in Saw II. John Kramer and Amanda Young are still interesting to watch, the Doctor is a-bit forgettable however, but her relationship with Amanda was kinda nice to see. The Vengeful Father, was in my opinion, a very interesting character, just having someone who is really vengeful about someone who he seems to loves a-lot is great to see and his search for he thinking will be his Son's killer during the game Jigsaw have him participate in was enjoyable like a snack. The traps in this movie are again good, and once again I have a favorite, this time is The Rack, which was pretty intense of a scene, probably remained my second favorite trap in the whole series along-side the Amanda Young's trap from the first one. Now I have said positive things about this film, that does not means there aren't any negative things to say, there is unfortunately. Firstly is the Kristy's trap (Kristy by-a-way is a character from the previous film who is a former partner of the Juvie's father of an Corrupt Detective) which is shown to be unnecessary in this film as they never mentioned it the rest of the film, and they only continued it's story in the following one, it just seems like they just wants to show us a trap already but this is the third Installment and according to the first two films, we already know there going to be traps like that, so what the point? Secondly, this is what a-lot of people would kinda agree which is the ending, now a-lot people complains by saying it was all an mistake, but honestly it not really like that which I have an problem with, it just the craze it shows to people who watches that then make them confused about how there will be sequels in which this started the downhill of the series with the follow-up ""Saw IV"". Personally, I thought this would've been an good way to end the series because there obviously no other way to continued, but then they decide to do that anyways by releasing the ever god-awful fourth film.Now I would recommend this if you only see the first Saw movie, if you didn't see Saw II, it really doesn't matters, because the whole twist they pull off with Amanda turning out she was an Assistant not an victim this time was pretty much almost spoiled by it's trailer. This movie, along with the first Saw film, are like the only ones I would probably sit around and watch again, I absolutely loves this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The murders have become like the films that made up the spate of slasher films from the late 1970's and early 1980's which degenerated into clever ways to die with nothing to hold them together.Worse is the films lack of logic. Never mind that Jigsaw has expired any number of times, how do this very elaborate death traps get made and built and attached to unsuspecting people in such short notice. It makes no sense? I know its not suppose to, but there should be an internal logic to it all and any hope of that ended with the first film.This won't matter to any fans who are looking for the cool ways to die.

The storyline was incredibly well-written, everything was well-explained and it was very clever. The characters were very interesting and well-developed, but most of them weren't really likeable. The killcount was very bloody movie, super gory and probably the most gruesome one, so far. The traps of that movie were definitely EXTREME, very difficult and so disgusting. Also, it was very intense movie, breathtaking and super shocking. The ending twist was definitely unpredictable, mind-blowing and I really enjoyed it.

"Another October, Another Saw","The plot is about people in traps made by Jigsaw and his assistant, Amanda, and they must get out of them to live. That's obvious but there are two victims. The first victim trapped under Jigsaw's game is the Dr. Lynn Denlon who must keep Jigsaw alive. If he dies, she dies. She must keep him alive as long as it takes this other victim, Jeff, to complete a game of his own, which is trying to find a way out of this house maze.Apart from the very bad Saw II, Saw III was a very good film. It's not a great one, not better than Saw, but a lot better than Saw II. Now, there are a little bit of characters, which leaves room for character development, unlike Saw II which had many characters probably just for the kills. There's a lot more gore and it makes the first two films look like Disney films. And there's the extreme again, where the second left off and in which Saw had.There are a lot of more traps in this film and they are very creative. This film also connects to the first two films very well so that's another good thing. In this film, we actually care for the villains (in my opinion). And in the end, you expected it, there's another twist. This is not the greatest twist of them all, probably the weakest but I didn't care. I didn't really get the ending because the ending feels a little bit rushed which was a problem.Some other problems, called cliffhangers, or left for a sequel, are unexplained sub plots. Not all things were explained in Saw III, but we all know it'll be in Saw IV, which there will be one apparently next October? This film is suspenseful and some parts are thrilling and there are scenes that wants to make you throw up or cover your eyes.This film is a great recovery from Saw II.

He reminds me of my seventh grade bio teacher, the sort of character who runs around with licorice dangling from his pants pockets. (Bell is also a poopy actor, but that's neither here nor there). The whole Jigsaw concept reminds me of a really bad episode of The Crotch Chronicles. I felt dizzy.Also, was anybody in that theater buying this cockamamie plot about the dude kidnapping the doctor? What's that all about? Or the part where he maims that guy? I felt like I was watching a different movie. I'm comfortable in saying I'd be more frightened watching Bull the bailiff from Night Court. To infinite and beyond!On the plus side, I have to commend young Angus Macfadyen for his memorable role as Jeff. This guy is going to be the next Derek Daypuk! He had me believing all this warped nonsense was really happening right there in front of me. I had heartburn!Overall, I do not recommend Saw III.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Let the blood spill!,"The original SAW was gruesome, but did occasionally leave things to the imagination. It had genuine tension, and a pretty intriguing mystery. SAW II was at least inventive and fun to watch. SAW III is easily the most gory, twisted, and nasty entry in the series, making it solid gold for the gore hounds out there. Unfortunately, the sense of mystery from the first two films is completely gone, you won't give a crap about the characters, and the pacing is clumsy. The film drags in many scenes, and just plain goes on for too long. If you're hard-core SAW/gore fan, you'll enjoy it, but there's only so much left the filmmakers can do with the premise. This is the kind of movie you're probably best off catching on sci-fi one night, rather than going to the theater.And seriously, how many ridiculously elaborate set-ups could a serial killer (even an inventive one) come up with? How big is the size of this warehouse--a city? How many billions of dollars were spent on these schemes? Where did the money come from, and how did a highly-wanted serial killer come up with it? Just a few questions to ponder..",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Feed your screams.,"No Spoiler.There was a time when Hitchcock shook the theatre with Janet Leigh's scream in Psycho (1960). People were unaware of the gore and gritty atmosphere of Hitchcok's creation. Perhaps this was the movie that created a new trend in the Horror/Thriller genre. Then it was The Exorcist (1973) when Linda Blair walked down the stairs on her hand and feet while lifting her body in a backward arch. This was the beginning of yet another trend. I believe then came SAW (2003) to create something you have never sen before. A serial killer with a gift of forgiveness only when his victims escape the traps he sets up. SAW has created a whole new meaning to Horror/Thriller. This movie fed to the new generations' needs of pure gore. SAW III stands to its expectations of blood, gore, cracking of bones, hacking of flesh, peeling of skin and crushing of skulls. I seriously do not believe how this movie escaped NC-17 rating. The last NC-17 movie I saw was Haute Tension by Alexandra Aja, another member of ""The Splat Pack"" along with Darre Lynn Bousman. The opening scene in this movie has similarity to one of the scenes from SAW I. But it has a ""little"" more outcome than it had in SAW I. With that little more I mean a sound effect and when it happened everybody in the auditorium went AWWWW. It was a ""Ladies and Gentlemen your attention please"".The acting department? I would be highly insensitive to comment on acting. Nobody expects acting from SAW franchise. What I can do is perhaps compare with SAW I. There is a flaw in the direction. Darren may not make you glued to your seat. The traps are new but they are designed for something else other than just for the victims to try and escape. I would say Darren has managed to make those 1hr 40 minutes interesting enough for a thriller with a non-linear screenplay by Leigh Whannell and the gore content.The twist is little unexpected. But it is something that only a few people would care for. At least SAW franchise has no ghost stories, UFOs or witches that create something supernatural. This is a movie that could come up with some explanations to stand for. Thats why I would choose this one over The Grudge or Silent Hill any day of the week.So if you are having a bad day and want to go and scream your guts out then I suggest go watch this. This will feed your emotions.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great storyline but too much useless gore,"Saw 3 delivers what it promises: blood, gore, pain. These go down to certain extremities which are unbearable to many people. I can understand now why the Board of Classification couldn't lower the Age Certificate.The storyline is pretty good with a great twist/conclusion but in certain points the movie let's go too much on the gore side and this annoys everyone. A friend of mine, who is a fan of gore movies, was even disgusted with certain scenes of barbarism.Oddly enough the movie sends out a good message: don't live your life consumed by vengeance as in the end it will turn against you.Saw 3 answers questions left open in the 1st and 2nd parts and in the end seals the trilogy as it should.

"almost made me puke, in a good way...","managed to check out a free screening of Saw III tonight with some friends.to tell u the truth it made me dry heave at least 2 or 3 times, it was really, really disgusting. i'm probably as big a gore-hound as the next horror fan, but i really haven't seen a horror movie that's made me want to actually puke in quite awhile so i was quite impressed. i'm not a huge fan of the Saw series by any means, in fact i thought Saw II was garbage to tell u the truth, and the fact that they'd keep pumping out sequels like that in such a short time frame showed they were incredibly eager to cash off on the basic concept/premise that made the first one so successful. however, at least they did it in a very excessive, over the top manner that pretty much pays off. this was definitely the most brutal and intense of the series...and while they sort of have to push the envelope in that regard since it's probably the last, it also ties in a lot character-wise with Jigsaw's new protégé we learn of in Saw 2, whose methods/death traps contrast (they're much more brutal and harder to escape) with that of her teachers in a very important way that...well, i don't want to give too much away.a few flaws in the film of course, one downright terrible actress who plays a lead role as this Doctor, but the stylistic low grade tool music video-esquire look of the film masks most of the bad acting, although i guess the most important aspect of acting in a film like Saw is selling the pain and torture that's being delivered and at least that much is achieved. the pacing was a bit unbalanced at times...they go from like death trap to death trap to death trap without anything juxtaposed between those scenes until about midway through the movie when they slowly set up the roster of characters and back story etc.a pretty effective horror film, if something like Hostel disappointed you as it did me, and you're looking for something that pushes the bar, in mainstream American horror at least, a tad bit more than u thought that film would, you might get what you're looking for here.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Death is a surprise party.""","Holy cow, I know the reviews for this series get worse and worse with each film, but personally I'm loving each one more and more! I swear, no other franchise can top Saw when it comes to endings. Twist after twist after twist. It's phenomenal. And I loved the dynamic between Jigsaw & Amanda too, and when it comes to the latter, Shawnee Smith was simply outstanding, as she really shined brightly here. However, editing has been a big complaint of mine with this series and it's still a bit shoddy in this third installment. But in saying that, it seems as if the editors are ever so slowly learning their lesson, as there were a significantly reduced number of those weird edits, and with the few that there were, they actually had a very strong effect which intensified the uneasiness and even anguish of some of those incredibly gory scenes. And so far, this sequel has the best gore out of the first three films. My personal favourite was the one where the guy was chained at several points on his body, it made me so squeamish! And even the dialogue had a small improvement too. Compared to Saw II (2005)'s dialogue which I described as ""ok"", Saw III (2006)'s dialogue I would describe as 'alright', so take from that what you will.I think that's all I've got to say, so overall I found it to be an incredible movie. Once again the finale is what skyrocketed my rating so high, as well as the highly engrossing story, which took an interestingly rather different approach to the two prequels, as we sorta got to see things from the killers' perspective this time. Very enjoyable.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The movie, with the actual play out minus all the hype.","This was a rather disappointing movie. People say that when movies come out with sequels and trilogies, they are usually not as impressive. Though many movies have exceptions, this movie unfortunately fits the stereotype.Without citing any examples or spoilers, I must say that the characters in this movie did not seem real enough to connect with the audience. While it would leave me at certain times thinking ""That's what I would do,"" other times the characters seemed a little fake.The first ""saw"" movie was rather okay, being thought provoking and making you breathe just a little faster during the movie. The second one was rather unimpressive, but worth watching just for the sake of going ""I watched 'Saw 2,'"" However, I believe that this does not come close to taking the cake of the three. I unraveled the plot in a matter of about 10 or so minutes into the movie, and I was unfortunately proved right at the end. People may dispute the intense violence and gore of the ""Saw"" trilogy to be a thing needed in all the movies, but there will be moments when even the most stomach strong gore enthusiasts may begin to think they are a little unnecessary.Is this movie worth watching if you've never even seen the first two? No. There are people that can pick up on the storyline of a sequel, even if they haven't seen the first one. However, this one is just way too ""out there."" It will be a senseless slasher (its not a slasher film, but there are moments of slashing), gory, torture, mind breaking inducement hour and however minutes it is long.Should you watch this movie if you liked the fist two? I guess so, but I would say not to expect too much from it. As an individual movie, if not trying to milk the first two, this movie is not one to be enjoyed. It appears that the hype created from the first two ""Saw"" movies were overestimated, and this is probably the least impressive of the trilogy.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good,"It manages to explain events in Saw 1 and 2 that may have been considered plot holes. It's the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. It's not perfect, though. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. Some of the dialog could be better. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. This is probably the worst of the sequels, with nothing to laugh at. By the end of the movie, the audience clapped. We liked what we had seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lives Up to the Original,"The cut of Saw III I saw was 2 hours in length; the unrated director's cut.I definitely preferred this entry over Saw II. The budget and stakes are both much higher in this sequel. Mixing in enough of the previous two to satisfy fans who are in it for the long haul while mixing enough compelling story to entertain those who may make this their first entry in the series, Saw III is a worthy sequel that holds up every bit as well as the original.That being said, this film is also much higher in terms of gore. It's a bloody, acidic, raunchy torturous adventure that's both fun to watch and cringe-inducing in its high level of pain inflicted on the victims. If you're not the kind to go for a horror movie with a gorey body count, this will probably be a skip for you.I'm told these films progressively get more and more graphic, but I'm seeing the franchise for the first time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still Great... But not as good as the others.,"OK so on Friday (opening day) and Saturday i saw this movie. It was an awesome movie no doubt. It was packed with loads of gore, I am talking like more than Hostel. But the story was not as good as the other two Saw films. This one relied on making the movie good based on gore and violence instead of cleverness like the other two. Which is understandable because that is what teenagers these days like to see is gore. When the first film was made it was extremely low budget so they could do what they wanted with it. But once that got great ratings and the second one as well, i think they got a bit pressured to make this one extra gory just so the film would do extra well. My personal favorite thing about Saw was the twists that it provided. This ones twist was a bit weak but still clever. So don't get me wrong the movie still kicked, but it was not as clever and as well put together as the other ones. Still a must see.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Desperately lacks the suspense of the original,"A couple of decades ago, sequels were made with some air to breath between them. That didn't mean they were not commercially motivated (at least not in this genre), but it meant that the audiences were able to recover in between. Now, here is the third installment of a series that started only two years prior with the invention of Saw, one of the most creative and delightfully vicious horror films in a long time. The problem with releasing two sequels in two years is that (as with The Matrix) follow-ups of a lesser quality will threaten to weaken the reputation of the original. Creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell might make more money, but their brilliant prodigy now has two mediocre siblings to compete with for attention.Whereas Saw II was to a large extent a structural rehash of the original, Saw III is a more protracted and unrefined effort. It desperately lacks the suspense of the original, and has nothing new to say. The plotting, by Whannell himself, isn't all that bad, but it is conducted by Bousman with a serious lack of vision and subtlety. For one thing, the film is overloaded with flashbacks, which makes it very exhausting. And secondly, the graphic horror is less enjoyable, because here it serves no purpose. The best aspect of Saw III is that we get to see more inside Jigsaw's head (literally), but every other storyline is just repeating itself in a degenerative manner. By the time the movie has finally reached its ending, there isn't really much to reveal, even though Bousman seems to think so. Stay untuned for the next installment.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Jeff is the worst!,"Saw III (2006) is the third entry in the Saw Franchise and was once again by Darren Lynn Bousman and it was another pole of garbage in this franchise.Positives for Saw III (2006):
Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith are still very good as John Kramer and Amanda. I thought that Angus Macfadyen and Bahar Soomekh were decent as Jeff and Lynn. There are some great practical effects with these traps which is something I forgot to mention with the previous two movies. And finally, I liked that Amanda has to face the consequences for putting people in unwinnable traps.Negatives for Saw III (2006):
This is another Saw movie that I can't get myself to like at all. First off, the movie introduces a character who will play a big part in the next couple of Saw movies which is going to be a pain in the butt given my hatred towards this one character. I also don't like that Jigsaw is forcing Lynn to play a game just cause she's a grieving mother which is really messed up. The character of Jeff is one of the most annoying and pathetic characters I've seen in a horror movie and I've seen a lot of them. This guy is so slow and whiny that he won't help or forgive certain people who were involved in some ways with his son's death even though these people do feel bad about what happened and lets them die. He won't even be a good father to his daughter or be a good husband to his wife. And for my final negative is that after all of that crap he went through, he learns nothing from those losses and kills Jigsaw which leads to his wife's death and is forced to play another game just to find his daughter.Overall, Saw III (2006) is another Saw movie that I just don't like and another reminder why I hate this franchise.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good enough, but not great.","My summary pretty much speaks for itself: the movie is good enough for horror fare, but it's not great. The main flaw is that it tries too hard.The first Saw had a great twist ending - so great that, even if you saw it coming, it still worked. The sequel, while decent, seemed to have only two goals: be more sadistic than the first and try to have an even more shocking twist. The third installment was obviously made with similar goals in mind. Unfortunately, ""the big twist"" just isn't. Sure the games are more sadistic this time around, but they are just more of the same that we have seen in recent films (Saw, Saw II, Hostel, Chainsaw: The Beginning, etc.).I enjoyed the movie, but I felt there was too much time spent revisiting the first two films. Not just revisiting, but rewriting. I won't give specific details here because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but when you see it, you'll understand. The revisiting and rewriting of the earlier films works as far as the storyline goes - that is, nothing shown in this film is unbelievable or inconsistent with the first two films - it just seemed unnecessary to me.The film as a whole worked well, and it was a fitting chapter for the series, but I don't think it benefited from the approach the screenwriters took. However, if you just want to see some great sadistic scenes in the ""Saw style"" and are willing to take it at face value, I think you'll enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tumbling down...,"I loved first movie. I am aware that sequels are often worse than original, but I expected them to stick to formula that worked so well in first movie, so even if sequels have no quality they would at least be fun. I saw second Saw that pretty much keep up with first one and I could not wait to see more. I never expected such unpleasant surprise. I knew this franchise will in time most probably lose some of its awesomeness, but such drastic drop in quality between two contiguous movies really surprised me. Saw III is not so bad by itself, but in comparison with first two this is complete catastrophe. First, it is boring. Few scenes twist stomach pretty successfully, but to achieve that effect one does not need much skill. Tension, suspension and fear are nowhere to be found. Second, this movie insults my intelligence. Unlike in prequels, story is completely linear, boring and predictable. And in addition to that it's full of holes and illogicality. Characters and their actions are unconvincing, especially Jeff. He lost so much time in every room for no obvious reason. If himself was threatened in any way I could understand his hesitation, but he was not. I have no nerves to get into the details, cause it would take to long. Further, flashbacks are lousy and have no purpose in story. For those who saw previous two films they just make this one more boring and unnecessarily stretch it to almost two hours. Last and the biggest disappointment was the end. Regardless of your taste and opinion about first two Saw movies, one thing you have to acknowledge and it's genius mindfak twist that ends them both. Here, they could not make effort even to achieve that. Ending is totally predictable. I knew how it will end, but I hoped that movie made me think that on purpose so they could make even bigger surprise when it ends differently, but that did not happen. It ended just as I suspected and I felt deprived. Movie ends in manner of low-budget gore horrors. In those it's not a flaw cause they do not pretend to be more than they are - movies based on disgusting scenes that do not need intelligent plot to achieve their purpose. But in Saw franchise that present itself as intelligent mystery thriller this is unforgivable. First hour I was bored but hoping that it will get better in time. During second half I was just sad and had to force myself not to give up before the end.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Uncut,"Saw III is one of my favorite saw movies of all time and it is honestly better than the original in my opinion, it's a film that just like Saw II, focuses more on the psychological aspect of the main character rather than super gore heavy trap scenes, now when I say that, don't be mistaken, this film has brutal and incredibly unique traps which is just a supporting factor to it.Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith are some of the best they've been in their roles and Darren Lynn Bousman's fingerprints are all over this film, the film has a great opening sequence and a harrowing ending to it, one of the most painful looking traps in the whole series, and a brilliant plot twist with amazing music, it perfectly shows a complex side to Jigsaw and Amanda's relationship and also has a fantastic use of suspense and themes of guilt and how vengeance can overtake you, and this film is terrific.I'm gonna give Saw III an A.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A excellent addition to the Saw series,"Saw 3 builds on the foundations of the two previous installments of the series, and to that it should take credit.It follows almost flawlessly from the story of the previous movie, seamlessly integrating the unique themes, storyline and motives.

"""Saw III"" a gory fun time, and worthy conclusion to the series...","I was a giant fan of the original ""Saw"" film, which I feel crosses a lot of lines when it came to genre. Most would classify it as a horror film, while others would call it a psychological-thriller, and others would merely call it a splatter-movie. I think it covered all these categories, making it fresh and original in terms of modern thrillers.""Saw II"" tried very hard to be a more psychological film, but in my opinion fell short, though it did deliver the gore it promised and was still an over all fun movie.Now, ""Saw III"" is out, the third and presumably final ""Saw"" film. It dabbles slightly in the psychological side of the characters, but only enough to justify the film's true purpose... blood... and lots of it. It seems the filmmakers Darren Lynn Bousman (Director) and James Wan and Leigh Whannell (Writers) have embraced the gore-fest aspect of the first two films full on this time.The story goes something like this... Jigsaw, the brutal man who tests his victim's will to survive is finally dying. His new apprentice Amanda has kidnapped a young nurse to keep him alive. If she can keep him alive long enough, she will be let go.At the same time, a man in constant mourning after the death of his son is being tested as well. He can chose to let those indirectly responsible live or die. And each step brings him closer to the man who actually killed his son.These parallel story lines both work as one unit, being intertwined by Amanda and Jigsaw. The nurse must keep Jigsaw alive until the man seeks his final vengeance (or forgiveness) of his son's killer.However, I wish the storyline involving the man and his dead son was a whole movie on it's own. It works as is, but would be more powerful as it's own stand-alone film.Overall though, the film delivers what it promises, and is a worthy conclusion to the ""Saw"" trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

When he is saying, I love you...I love you...and he is directing this at Lynn the doctor, is Amanda jealous? What was in the envelop that Jigsaw gave Amanda? I thought maybe it was his will?

Complete rubbish,"Okay, the first was reasonable and looked impressive but was not exactly worth a sequel never mind a second sequel. Saw 3 is quite simply awful. A poor script badly performed is hidden by flashy CSI style editing and horror-style aesthetics in a lacklustre story about inhuman characters whom no-one in their right mind should care for. Parts of this film aspire to become almost as notorious in extreme cinema as the fire extinguisher scene early on in 'Irreversible'. It is horrifically gratuitous and misguided and the alleged plot twist is so obvious from an early stage that I felt later on like I should have walked out from the auditorium in disgust.

In the Grip of Despair,"Good evening, everyone! I'm Mr. C Reviewer, and tonight we'll be diving into the film Saw three. I had the opportunity to watch the movie on Netflix. This movie originally premiered on October 26, 2006, and has a runtime of 1 hour and 48 minutes. It is rated for viewers aged 18 and older. Notably, parts of the film were filmed in Ontario, Canada. The estimated budget for Saw three was around $10,000,000, and it grossed approximately $164,874,275. As someone on the autism spectrum, I found subtitles to be incredibly helpful, greatly enhancing my ability to follow the dialogue throughout the film. The film was directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and written by Leigh Whannell and James Wan.Summary: As John fights against terminal cancer while confined to his bed, his apprentice Amanda takes drastic measures by kidnapping Dr. Lynn Denlon, a highly skilled surgeon. Under duress, Lynn is compelled to keep John alive as he orchestrates a chilling game for Jeff, a father overwhelmed with grief and fury after the tragic loss of his son to a drunk driver. Jeff is thrust into a series of harrowing challenges that force him to confront those he blames for his son's death, testing the limits of his ability to forgive.Review: -The film begins with a seamless connection to its predecessors, skilfully establishing the groundwork for the narrative that follows and immediately enveloping the audience in its sombre themes. I appreciated how the film explores the intricate dynamics between revenge and forgiveness, delves into the nature of suffering as a potential avenue for redemption, emphasizes the importance of personal choice in shaping one's destiny, and offers a critique of overly simplistic moral frameworks. I found the pacing of the film to be commendable, as it skilfully heightened tension throughout. The gradual unfolding of the plot facilitated a more profound exploration of character development, especially regarding Jigsaw and his underlying motivations. I appreciated the incorporation of flashbacks, reminiscent of the rest of the series, as they effectively enhance the storytelling within this series. These flashbacks enrich the narrative by offering crucial context regarding the characters' motivations and backgrounds. I appreciated the casting choices in the movie, particularly the return of familiar faces from the series, which added continuity. The performances were impressive overall, with Tobin's portrayal of Jigsaw standing out for its depth and complexity; he skilfully balanced menace with vulnerability, transforming Jigsaw into a tragic figure rather than just a villain. Amanda's character was portrayed with intensity and conviction, significantly enhancing the film's emotional impact. Additionally, Eric's role introduced urgency and conflict, as his desperate yet determined demeanour heightened the film's tension. The film's score, composed by Charlie Clouser-who also contributed to earlier instalments of the franchise-masterfully crafted an intense and suspenseful atmosphere that aligned perfectly with its dark themes and graphic content. The thrilling soundtrack significantly enhanced my viewing experience, particularly during pivotal scenes filled with tension and emotional depth. The blend of industrial sounds and haunting melodies instilled a pervasive sense of dread, especially in life-or-death moments, effectively elevating the stakes and keeping me on edge.-I admired the costumes and makeup in the film, as the meticulous attention to detail significantly contributed to its realism. Many films tend to neglect such subtleties, prioritizing a polished and tidy appearance for actors while steering clear of a more gritty or sombre aesthetic. It was invigorating to see this film embrace authenticity without reservation. However, I did notice some inconsistencies throughout the movie, particularly when certain characters appeared cleaner in later scenes compared to their earlier portrayals. The film's depiction of gore was notably realistic, showcasing a commendable effort that, while not extraordinary, surpassed that of the first two movies. I enjoyed the film's cinematography, which employed a variety of shot types to enhance its narrative. The gentle lighting established a nuanced atmosphere that I found appealing; however, while all the essential elements in each frame were distinctly visible, some parts could have benefited from additional brightness. Personally, I often adjust my screen's brightness for a better viewing experience, which proved particularly helpful during this film. The energetic camera movements during critical moments further amplify the tension inherent in each sequence.-While I appreciated the conclusion, it wasn't among my favourites in the series thus far. The twist didn't strike me as particularly shocking compared to others; I found it less surprising. However, I believe it effectively sets the stage for the next instalment in the series well.I rate each film I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it a 8.9 Remember this was what I thought about the movie personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A very satisfying end to the trilogy,"This movie is easily the most tense of the trilogy, the storytelling is also at its best with very deep and well developed characters. The movie has a lot of interesting dynamics between lots of characters and every character is interesting to see. The movie also takes the opportunity to clean up the plot holes of previous entries and expand the backstory of characters. If you care about the saw storyline this may be your favourite movie. The issue with this movie is there are no puzzles instead it goes more for a questioning of morals and how far someone can go, it fits very well into the saw franchise however the lack of puzzles is relatively sad. The gore is the most violent out of the trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Still not as great as the first, but much better than the second","I went in with high hopes, hoping it would be a return to the first movie. After seeing the second and being utterly let down, I didn't think they could do worse (especially since it was an original idea and not just reformatted from another script like the second) Definitely not let down. Although I really enjoyed the first for the atmosphere and sense of creepiness, it can never really be achieved again since we've pretty much been revealed to everything.Some scenes were gory for gory's sake, but will satiate anyone's need for that kind of stuff (so many hooks and chains...) I have to say I saw the twist coming from a while away, but still enjoyed it and the way they did it was surprising. Also marring it was suspension of belief with things having to go exactly right and a few too many flashback scenes. Actually way too many.All in all a gripping ride, with a few pointless flashback scenes and god awful dialogue in the beginning, I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Shockingly Bad,The first Saw was a Masterpiece that I still enjoy to watch now and then.Saw II had some really fun moments in it. It was a blast to see it in the Theaters.So I was expecting this one to still be a lot of fun. Boy was I wrong! The movie can be summed up in one word: boring!!! I honestly can't think of one reason why I would want to see this movie again.I was really counting on this one to satisfy my Horror/Gore cravings for Hallowe'en. I simply can't believe that I just walked out of a Saw movie and I'm still feinting for some Gore.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
It was more beautiful than part 1 and 2,"""Saw 3"" was the beginning of a new era of the series that continues to this day. A film like ""Saw 3"" happens when the creators decide to repeat the features of the previous parts in larger dimensions and forms instead of dealing with a new aspect and angle of their world. Therefore, ""Saw 3"" was the first movie of the series, which turned fans into two groups, opposing and supporting. Some people think that ""Saw 3"" is the best movie of the series and some others mention it as the beginning of the free fall of the series. There is no doubt that ""Saw 3"" was the beginning of the sequels of ""Saw"" which lacked the genius, skill, freshness, and the fear under the skin of the first and second films, but I also disagree with the fact that this film brought the series into a sharp decline. The truth is that when faced with the ""saw"" series, you should know in advance that you will face two types of ""saws"". The first type are the first and second films, which have a more serious atmosphere and follow some of the most basic principles of storytelling, and the second type, which are the third to eighth films, are films that only inherit the representative elements of this series and aim to present something completely different from the two It is the first movie. If you accept this difference and go to the third film and its subsequent sequels, the probability of enjoying them or being surprised by their absurd events increases, but if you go to the third part expecting a direct continuation of the mood of the first and second parts, the probability is that ""saw 3"" It goes way up there to be the worst movie you've ever seen. I am a fan of this episode.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Saw III,"The third movie in the ""Saw"" series. We knew it was going to be made and the hype would be high for the movie. I came into this movie with very high expectations seeing how it was rated ""R"" but then got dropped down to 18a. Since the rating dropped so did my expectations seeming it to be not as good and gory as I first presumed it to be. But I still expected a lot from it.First of all the plot was pretty nice and interesting. The subplot onto this movie made it better and more thoughtful. The way it was directed was pretty interesting and well done. But I have to say the 'games/traps' were pretty lame. Like in comparison to the last two, these traps were bad, and I was really disappointed in them.Saw movies, supposed to be filled with gore. The first one held its word, the second one, kind of, the third one, not at all. I was extremely disappointed in the amount of gore or blood was in this movie. There really wasn't that much, I don't see how it could have deserved the ""R"" rating where I live. There was a bit of blood but nothing that made me go 'wow this is awesome'.Saw 1 and 2 started off quickly and kept me entertained. Did this one do that? No, not at all. I got extremely bored in this movie, there were large chunks that were boring, nothing happened. The only good parts were the beginning and the end.In conclusion I was horribly disappointed in this movie, and if I go see it again I will only go to see the beginning and the end, which is the only reason why I gave this movie a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
very gory but doesn't come with much of a story,"In this movie, however great the end twist (usually associated with saw movies) is, does not even begin to justify the means. The movie's gore level in the first ten minutes far exceeds that of the first two movies combined. In the previous saw movies ***spoiler for saw 1 and 2*** the endings were by no means happy endings, but ****spoiler for saw 3**** this movie's ending is so terrible that it left no room for thought like the others had. Now that is my personal opinion and by giving you no specific details I will let you formulate your own opinion when you go see the movie. In other words me saying that it is gory and that it doesn't have a great plot aren't spoilers. That's why I don't have standard spoiler warnings but rather my own because this ""in my opinion"" is the best review done by a proclaimed saw fan. If you haven't seen the first two saw movies and you aren't going into the theater with high, and biased because of the other two, expectations then you might think that the movie is okay, but you wouldn't understand some of the things that are going on as they relate directly to the first two movies.As a big saw fan, this movie was a tremendous letdown. Like I said though, if I hadn't had such high hopes and if I hadn't been waiting so long then the utter terribleness of this movie wouldn't have been such a bad thing.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not a Movie,"First off i was never a fan of the Saw series, i found them to be just another cliché dumb horror movie. When Saw III came out this Friday all of my friends voted on going to see SAW III while i wanted to go watch the Prestige. I hated the movie from the very start with the over use of language that is so unnecessary (that goes for all the saw movies.) I then only last 15 minutes and left the theater for home. My girlfriend was on the verge of fainting and was in a cold sweat and she turned her had and didn't see half of the gore.I came to realize that our society is messed up beyond belief when masses file in to watch fellow human beings be torn apart. When i ask people about the saw movies what is so good about them they all answer with how gory and cool it was. Personally i am disgusted by this ""film"" and wouldn't watch it if it was the last movie on earth. (that means i'd take Ultraviolet or Godzilla over this movie any day)Among the blood and guts there may be a story but no matter if its good or not its not worth the 98% of the movie which is figuring out how we can best kill someone.

There Will Be A Saw 4,"There will be a saw 4 and Jigsaw will be in it.Mathews and Dr.Gordon are both still alive. The same writers and directors will be returning. This was confirmed to me via an IHS.Saw 4 will clear up all the Questions about Mathews, Obi, Adam, Amanda ( Who is dead). Tobin Bell will return and play his part as Jigsaw. Adam really had a task. The only way he could have lived would be to get the key out of the bath, but as we see, he lost the key in the very first seconds of the game. The saw was only meant for Adam, that was his way out. Killing Adam was Dr. Gordon's rest off, yea, it was great when Dr Gordon snapped, you could see he had finally had enough and needed to do anything to get out to help his family, Adam had no such urgency so he didn't saw his foot off, neither of the 2 had urgency to save themselves but Gordon did for his family.And yea, Jigsaw was drugged, thats how he was motionless all that time, as for the electrocution, the first one was done by Zepp when he was watching on the monitors that were inside the mirror, but the second time he electrocuted Adam himself when he tried to shoot him (Adam was out of bullets anyway).I think the situation was lose lose for Adam, because ether way he would die, if he saw his foot off, Zepp would have had to kill him and Gordon after the time limit (or was it just Gordon, only seen it the once so I cant quite remember). But if Gordon shot Adam Zepp would have had to let him go to get the antidote for the posion from jigsaw. I'm sure if they both cut their foots off they could have jumped Zepp when he came in to kill them and tried to escape, but we will never know, sucks about the key going down the bath plug hole though.I'm guessing you haven't seen Saw 3 yet? thats more gory than Saw 1 and 2 put together.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I Want to Play a Game.,"Ok, Saw 3! A new film that will bring up new trap ideas, story, and of course characters with a twisted past, that has to go through Jigsaw's violent and gory traps. I was skeptical to this one because I was so satisfied about the first two and I thought that this could be a letdown and bring in kind of the same stuff. But, no, this Saw film did something different again. So far, each of them had differences that made them unique. Of course, the concept of traps, the symbolic meaning of them and the terrified people that desperately tries to escape, all of that things is repetitive. Some traps felt less original, while others brought in new elements of gore and fear, and the concept behind them were cool, too. Especially the last trap that is probably one of the most disturbing that I have seen so far. Speaking of traps and killers, Jigsaw is getting a partner, Amanda Young, a young women lost in fear and depression that escapes the ""meaningless circle"" to start a new life as Jigsaw's second hand. And the connection between those two was probably one of the most important parts of the whole film. The story was very well developed, as well as showing small peaks from Jigsaw's backstory. I could get an idea on his suffering, especially with his poisonous brain cancer, and the life he had before, and that not everything went well. Amanda's story shows multiple flashbacks about her unite with Jigsaw, and that was a good thing too. It links to the previous movies, but unfortunately, it had a problem. First of all, the flashbacks took sometimes too much of the runtime, they could be showed shorter, and secondly, looking at the past in Jigsaw's killings, Amanda's story feels kind of ""pushed in"" and she doesn't feel that necessary before this film. You know, this film was her moment, her biggest showtime. Anyway, the rest of the characters in the film were convincing, mostly because of their high value for the story and how much they actually meant to the plot. Going through emotions, traps and truths, the ending comes. And I have mixed feelings about it. It could have been better. The plot twist they did here didn't felt that good compared to the two previous movies ones, but it did conclude it well at least. The ""Hello Zepp"" theme is good as always and marks that this is a Saw movie. The technicals were nice. The camera filming and editing is very much like in every Saw movie, and still works with the atmosphere and dynamic. The scenography was dark and creepy, and the location felt isolated and gave the trapped people limited space. The traps were real and graphic, did impression. Concluding everything, Saw 3 was a nice sequel to the previous ones, had some good story development, interesting action, but a few things could be better. Yet, it was still entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Cutting Deeper,"Saw III, directed by Darren Lynn Bousman, plunges the Saw franchise into darker, more intense territory, exploring the psychology and motivations of its central figure, John Kramer, also known as Jigsaw. As Kramer's health declines, he enlists the help of his protégé, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), to continue his twisted tests, with the focus shifting to Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), a man consumed by vengeance. While Saw III amplifies the gore and stakes, it also delves into character-driven horror and moral dilemmas, offering a layer of complexity that resonates beyond the bloodshed.Tobin Bell delivers a powerful performance as Jigsaw, infusing the character with a nuanced, almost sympathetic edge as he grapples with his mortality and the future of his legacy. Bell's portrayal elevates Jigsaw from a mere horror villain to a man driven by a twisted philosophy and conviction. Shawnee Smith's portrayal of Amanda adds intensity, capturing her character's internal conflict between loyalty, identity, and her violent impulses, enhancing the emotional weight of the film.Bousman's direction leans into the franchise's signature style, with intense close-ups, fast-paced editing, and elaborate practical effects that make each trap feel visceral and immediate. The traps in Saw III, from the Rack to the Freezer Room, are among the series' most memorable, both in their design and psychological impact. The pacing builds suspense effectively, balancing gruesome moments with quieter, character-driven scenes that provide a deeper look into Jigsaw's complex worldview.However, Saw III sometimes relies more on graphic violence than on subtle suspense, which may not appeal to all viewers. While the exploration of themes such as forgiveness, vengeance, and redemption adds depth, the relentless brutality may feel overwhelming for some. Despite this, the film's commitment to its moral themes and character arcs elevates it, offering a thought-provoking horror experience.In conclusion, Saw III is a gritty and intense entry in the Saw series that adds psychological and moral complexity to its narrative. While it might be too graphic for some, its exploration of its characters' motivations and the deeper themes of the franchise make it a memorable and impactful chapter that continues to build on the legacy of Jigsaw.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Lot's of blood and traps for those out hunting and, refreshingly, it meekly offers something a little more in the way of study.","There is a common phrase throughout the third edition of the Saw series, namely: 'face your fears'; perhaps a sly nod to the audience themselves as they go through this ordeal of watching someone else go through a further ordeal - psychologically as well as physically. You have to hand it to the people that make this stuff; the marketing is disturbingly effective. Initially, we were 'dared' to see Saw and Saw II. Maybe we did, maybe we didn't. Now, we have 'face your fears' pasted over most walls and doors in the film as the beginning of a new 'test' is established to about to happen and we inhale, grab hold of something and get ready for the next gross-out/squirm-in-your-seat moment. They've roped us in via the dare to see the first two, now we cannot help ourselves.The third Saw film was not the disaster I was expecting, in fact it actually attempts to flesh out a character and, for the first time, presents us with a delicate protagonist at the film's core who is given the chance to essentially 'play God' with some previously set up traps. What the film wants us to think he undergoes in the long run is a transformation from vengeful, depressed individual to a man forced to come to terms with his emotions; forced to forgive those responsible for his prior feelings and undergo some sort of journey of redemption. But that's not what anyone is watching a Saw film for, that's for sure. The ideas are there, and they're developed in a certain regard but the film is clearly more interested in the blood; the gore and these traps that the screenwriters and producers, in some manner or another, manage to dream up.The man undergoing the ordeal is Jeff (Macfadyen), a man whose son was killed in a hit and run accident in which the 'guilty' parties involved were the driver himself, whom got a very short jail sentence; the judge that gave him that short sentence; the onlookers that saw the incident but ran off and the doctors that couldn't actually save the boy. Each of them are rendered helpless in a series of audacious traps that tap into: medieval torture; the sensation of drowning; the sensation of freezing to death as well as out and out decisions based on whether you can find it within yourself to execute a man. Some are more gruesome than others, and after each trap before venturing into the next, Jeff seems to remove a layer of clothing such as a jacket or a cover or something; perhaps a shedding of a persona or a 'skin' as the film progresses.But again, no one's come to notice those sorts of things. The film's immediate beginning sees a hapless individual hooked up to several chains, but a preceding scene is set in the dungeon he is trapped as the police investigate several dismembered pieces of flesh following a small explosion. The cutting to the chained up prisoner trying to escape is a futile exercise as we already know what's to come and this is just an excuse to show us some of the material that gives Saw its reputation as this senseless; mindless passage of traps, horror and blood. Following this, a female law enforcer is snatched for merely doing her job and is 'punished' for love of her work through a device linked to her ribcage – it's as nasty as it sounds, but it's completely unnecessary.Mercifully, and I do mean mercifully, the film ditches this short passage of play and actually gives us a narrative plus protagonist to latch onto, he being Jeff and the series of scenarios he finds himself in. On a strand happening parallel to Jeff's crusade, Jigsaw (Bell) himself must rely on assistant Amanda (Smith) and nurse Lynn Denlon (Soomekh) to see him through some gut-wrenching scenes of brain surgery as Lynn is charged with performing a life saving operation – the catch is if he dies, an explosive collar attached to Lynn's neck will go off thus killing her.As a lead character, it's easy to connect with Jeff. He's given a meek amount of pre-crusade build-up as we see him dejected and vulnerable in his suburban house, dressed in some pyjamas. It's all rather manipulative, but in Jeff we have a very specific reason to engage in the text and will someone through the film rather than just sit back and observe people we don't really know that well, quite possibly getting cut up. Saw III will no doubt appeal to those that are fans of the franchise; much in the same way Episode Three of the Star Wars franchise might or recent prequel Hannibal Rising might to fans of those respective franchises. This is due to said films' attempts at the deconstructing of the villain and Saw III looks to further Jigsaw's deconstruction that began in Saw II. It attempts to humanise its chief antagonist – the reason so many nasty things happen to so many 'bad' people. In this regard, it succeeds but like mentioned examples, only on a very, very basic level.I think it would be too harsh to say Saw III 'masquarades' as a study of morality, redemption and forgiveness, but it is this sort of study 'dressed up' around a lot of gore and dismemberment. Fanatics will enjoy the traps and the horror of it all; those such as myself whom view it with a neutral eye might get a kick out of the study plus twists and those specifically out to hate it won't take to it at all. But the most interesting thing about the film, for me, was that amidst all this gore and all this blood, the most distressing scene involves an oven, some raw emotion and a few stuffed toys combining to make something that's a bit gruesome for very different reasons.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

THE WHOLE MOVIE Disappointed ME!,"The SAW trilogy was a great go. I loved SAW, and I thought SAW 2 was even better. So when I (saw) the previews for this movie I was very, very excited about it.

Now do not get me wrong, I liked the premise of the movie and the new but also famliar direction it was being taken. I just think it fell flat to the high expactions of the other previous movies.The acting by the actors was sub-par and the story line had a few holes. As seen by the flash back parts of the movie. They tried to tell you more of the back story but just made it a bigger mess. The plot was not as I was expecting at all. It was very weak and it seemed to be thrown together to put this movie out on the market.The special effects for this movie was up to standard and the gore and shock value was there as well. It looked to me like that was what they were most interested in were the ""traps"". They wanted to try make new ""traps"" and go on the whole (shock and awe) treatment.Again this movie is not what I thought it would be. To me the whole movie just falls flat on it face.

Saw: The Bloodbath Edition,"It is telling of our culture that 'Saw III' is the highest grossing film of the franchise. It also possesses the largest quantities of blood, until 'Saw: The Final Chapter'. If you are going into Saw III expecting a deep, complex, held back horror, then this is surely not the film for you.Jigsaw's now on death's door. He has the help of his newly appointed apprentice Amanda. She will carry out his remaining traps and ensure that his life's work goes on, even without him. This time he tasks Amanda with kidnapping Lynn Denlon, who works at the local hospital. Lynn's objective is making Jigsaw survive long enough to see the outcome of another victim and his tests set before him. Jigsaw's next victim is Jeff who is filled with vengeance after the death of his beloved son who was hit by a car. The driver left as quickly as possible and Jeff has no room in his heart for pity, kindness or redemption. Jigsaw figures that it is now Jeff's time to be tested. Jeff has three tests, tests of forgiveness for the witness, judge and suspect. Jeff must complete his tests in the allotted time or be trapped in the abandoned factory to die in.'Saw III' contains some of the franchise's most vile traps and the only effective sentimental one. It's an odd mix. But the filmmakers manage to pull it off. People, who have seen the film, will know which traps I am referring to and they occur within the first fifteen minutes. Bring a bucket. The classroom trap needs some description, however brief in order to explain it. The victim in this instance is a convict by the name of Troy. Jigsaw believes him to be ""more comfortable in chains, than you are in freedom"". Troy has chains linked to almost every body part; he will need to rip them out of himself before the bomb detonates. The thing is even if he did make it in time; he would not escape the room alive. The door was sealed shut and the Police had to break it down through force. Detective Kerry who has been on the case since the first killing, decides this is not the work of Jigsaw but an imitator.The same thing happens again. The victim is harnessed into a device that is hooked into her ribcage. She grabs the key out of a vat of acid. It does not matter. The device will not budge. This is the work of perhaps the very same imitator earlier.These traps are not effective. Well in a sense they are, you are sure to feel nauseous. But they are devised for shock value. They do not have half of the weight found in the original because they involve gallons of blood. The only factor that makes them worthwhile is Jigsaw's instructions to the victims. His rasping voice is absorbing to listen to. If only the same could be said of the traps.There is one though that resonates throughout the series. In one of Jeff's tests, the judge is in a huge metal container, lying on his back. It is slowly filling up with the guts of pigs. The only way Jeff can retrieve the key is by burning his son's toys. The look of pain on Jeff's face is palpable and highlights that you do not need to have a barrel full of blood to make an impact on the audience.The acting here is shockingly the best of the series. Angus Macfayden as Jeff is the right amount of disturbing, never under or overplaying to his horrifying predicament. Shawnee Smith as Amanda undoes her excruciating performance from 'Saw II' and for sure is better served in her scenes with the deranged Jigsaw. Tobin Bell brings his character to life and offers the only humanity that can be garnered from someone this psychotic.'Saw III' oversteps the mark frequently. The gore is often far too much to handle and the first couple of traps derivative at best. But once Jeff's game begins, the film hits its bloody stride and delivers fans with a hard-core horror with well-defined characters (for the main cast), who would have thought it? As well as a surprisingly thoughtful story and great acting (for a horror film at least.) If only more Horror sequels were this entertaining, in a sadistic way.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A disappointment. The concept is worn out already.,"OK, I am one of those few, that did not like the film that much. And I can hardly understand why people find SAWIII such good film...First of all, throughout the movie I kept asking myself how one that is obviously in a very bad condition (the killer) has the power, wit, logistics, money to come up with all the mechanic torture devices.How is he or Armanda able to get the victims where they are? Where the hell does all this take place without being noticed by authorities - the killer is no stranger to the police, right?Lack of logic everywhere. My mind confronted me with a lot of questions all the time and that took away a lot of entertainment.SAWI had a lot of elements. It had gore, suspense, police-investigation, hope, despair. All of which were put together with excellence. It worked on a lot of levels.SAWIII lacks almost everything except the gore. I don't like when I get the impression that the lack of plot-ideas is compensated with gore-scenes that make you cringe.There was almost no investigation-scenery going on. It was focused basically on one theme - the torture&despair of the victims. I find this to be a bit one-dimensional.However, and maybe that was simply the intention, it was hard to watch the whole thing, I did feel uncomfortable and I was not in a good mood after wards. It had a moving finale, but more because I felt very sorry for the two main-characters, instead of being surprised by some awesome ending-clue. OK, there was something greater going on with Armanda but that did not convince me.SAW I had the most striking final seconds a film can have.The ending of SAWIII is just terrible sad and drama-like.I did find the film to be entertaining because of my latent voyeurism - watching people die is one reason we watch horror, but if it is reduced to this one basic concept it does not succeed to fully entertain me.Since SAW IV is already planned, even SAWV: I wonder what sense this makes? The concept is pretty much dead, and the ending of SAWIII somewhat makes it hard to continue the story.Sorry guys, this was a disappointment, However if you enjoy watching people die by sick torture-devices, this is for you. If you want an interesting story on top of it, i guess you should look elsewhere.Oh yes, I apologize for my somewhat strange English.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Let the Games Begin,"Lately Dr. Lynn Denoln (Bahar Soomekh) has been going through some marital problems and the anxiety is beginning to affect her work. Late one night after finishing her shift at the hospital she is kidnapped and taken to an abandoned warehouse. Shortly after waking up, she soon meets the notorious Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). He is currently dying slowly as the minutes pass and Amanda (Shawnne Smith), Jigsaw's sidekick, tells Lynn she has been kidnapped in order to keep him alive. Alive long enough for someone else that's also been kidnapped named Jeff (Angus MacFadyen), to complete his very own game. While telling Lynn this, Amanda places a collar around Lynn's neck that is connected to Jigsaw's heart rate. If his heart rate drops below zero before Jeff completes his game, the shotgun shells on the collar will all simultaneously go off at the same time. Amanda then preps Lynn as Jigsaw explains, ""it's a test of will. It's a test to see just how willing you are to keep someone alive"". Lynn realizes she has no choice, and so the game begins. Jeff must now navigate through a series of tasks where he is promised his chance to get revenge on the man responsible for his son's death. Something he has wanted every day for the last three years. Both Lynn and Jeff are now each tangled in a horrid game of survival. What they don't know is their games are merely stepping stones to the true reason they are involved with Jigsaw's latest puzzle.First off, I have to admit I was a little turned off to 'Saw III' earlier this week after months of having much anticipation, when I heard it was guaranteed that there would be a 'Saw 4' if 'III' did well opening weekend. I feared then, and still do slightly, that the 'Saw' franchise will become what 'Friday the 13th' did: a series of films where only the first few were considered good. Once I was sitting in my seat at the theater though, and the film began I was vastly interested far more than I imagined I would be. This 'Saw' has so much story in it than the previous two had, and really more than most horror films today do. Much of it is told generally with various flashbacks. Even by following the story closely, the final twist probably won't be known to you until its unveiling. It's in the twist that a tiny smidgen of a problem exists.It's obvious that the twist was meant to shock the audience in a big way. Maybe it does catch most people by surprise, but for me didn't. Not that it isn't good, it just didn't come across the way it should have. It gave me a, oh...okay feeling rather than a, holy sh*t reaction. This minor flaw doesn't hinder the film's poise at all though. It still remains interesting to the very last minute.The only real letdown in the film are some of the traps. In all there is a total of six physical ones. These devices of torture and terror are what many of people who love the 'Saw' series look forward to most. Out of the six, only two were what I'd say good. Yes, all of them can kill, but four of them seemed boring and livid. I'm not sure what happened here. Although, this doesn't destroy the movie, in a small way it does take away from it. Even so, the two good traps almost make up for the others.So basically, 'Saw III' is somewhat better than I expected. It borders very closely to the feel of the first, which is a definite plus. Most satisfying though is that it wasn't the least bit dismal. Never was there a dull moment, even with the few shoddy traps. Now that 'Saw III' is done and over with though, it only makes me question what '4' have in store for us. Yes, Tobin Bell was contracted for five films permitting each is considered a success, but now that director Bousman and writer Whannell have decided to step aside and leave the series alone, I can only wonder two things. Will 'Saw' become a victim of its own game? Just how long can the series go on before it suffers the fate Jason Voorhees did?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good film with bad choices,"When Saw was released people even mentioned that it was the one to beat Se7en in this style of films. And while in the same style as Se7en (Suspense, action, dead bodies, high violence and mystery) it was a very original film, with good acting and intense story full of twists.This is a good sequel, but has some problems of wrong choices. The story is as smart as the ones from previous films, but the way it's told doesn't work well. It seems they wanted to get to the tension scenes and the ""games"" right from the start of the film. Problem is that by doing so, there was no presentation of Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) and his life outside the ""game"". While previous films always showed us something to feel for and understand the main character. By doing this, it's hard to understand or at least accept the father's reactions over the people trapped. We have not enough background information about why he acts this way or at least to know that he acts this way. People in traps have no development at all and are only in the film for the gore fest. In the other Saw films, the traps were made so people could learn their lesson, not only to kill innocent people. The important thing about character development is not to remember names but the actions they take, why, and the changes they go trough the whole film. And though the father had really bad development, Amanda and Dr. Lynn Denlon are great characters and very well developed trough the whole film, as you get to know them more. Jigsaw, though we don't get to know more about him, is as good as in the second Saw.Other bad choice is the amount of gore in this sequel. Though a lot of fans like it, they are the fans who never really liked the film for what it was meant to be. A good story with violence, not lots of violence with story. There is so much gore that you actually stop felling tense during this scenes. Saw I and II kept you watching those sequences because of all the tension, not the gore. While in the previous ones you would be as tense, nervous and desperate as the characters, in this one you might even start telling yourself ""good make-up effects"" and won't get involved with the scene. The gore in the first and second was only shown when important.The story is actually good and follow the previous events very well, and the acting is on the same level as in Saw I and II. One problem with it's story is the ending. Though it's full of twists and as good as the other endings, it is too unhappy even compared to Saw I/II endings. There is not enough hope in this film. During the whole film and in the end. While in the other films you feel like wanting to watch the next one, this one makes you feel bad and wanting to get out of the cinema as fast as you can because you feel like the characters have no reason to go on.They tried to push the film to the next level, but unfortunately, they've chosen the wrong things to push. The gore fest feels like loss of originality, since we have films like Hostel, which brought back the senseless gore to the screen. The traps are a lot more complex, but lost their meaning. Characters are not the most important piece in this one. And the story, though not worse then the intelligent stories of Saw I/II was not pushed to the next level as we hoped it would.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Doesn't disappoint,"I have never been so excited about a movie coming out until saw 3 and it didn't disappoint.This film, in my opinion, was amazing and is up there with the best films i have ever seen and believe me i have seen a fair few.

Jigsaw kind of reminds me of pinhead when he talks. This sequel picks up where 2 left off, Jigsaw and Amanda are back. And this time the traps are more deadlier. Jigsaw is dying of cancer and Amanda kidnaps a doctor to relie on her to operate and save Jigsaw's life. She is part of a game that invloves another victim who is playing a game.

"Great for Saw fans, but not for those who haven't seen the first two","I would highly recommend that anyone who hasn't seen the first two Saw films, and want to see them, not to go and see this one just because your friends are and you want a night out to the cinema. It will ruin the first two for you and it will be pointless watching them after this. This is what two of my friends did and now they know the endings to both films. It gives away so much from them, not so much the plots, more the endings and the twists which is exactly what you won't want to know if your planning on borrowing your friends dvds after seeing the 3rd one.For Saw fans who liked the first two, then this will explain a lot of things which you didn't even think too much about after the first 2. It wraps up a lot and links together a lot of the story making it a very complete trilogy.As to be expected, there are twists and turns at the end, and the ones in this film made me want to go back and watch it again, this time from a different angle, even more than the first two did.Overall, a great film, as to be expected, but not so gruesome or scary as the first two, which was a bit of a let down as its what Saw is known for. This one focused more on a stronger and more complicated story.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Crap is Crap is Crap,"Maybe it's just me, but the horror genre has no real artistic merit. The only horror films that matter are Rosemary's Baby, Rosemary's Baby, Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, Psycho, The Exorcist, Halloween, and even Evil Dead (not the other two, it became a parody of itself like the other long winded franchises). Otherwise than that, how could anyone feel confident about the American cinema today after seeing garbage like this? I certainly can't, as Saw III (just like its predecessors, possibly the two worst films ever made) takes the title as worst film of 2006.The reason why the Saw franchise is considered great by the fans that believe in it because there is essentially no difficult content: there's blood, guts, and gore right in your face, plastic dialogue, screaming, yelling, and predictable plot twists explained at the end of the movie instead of having the viewer feel free to interpret things on his or her own. This is the sad status of mainstream Hollywood today: the executives notice a trend and exploit it. The horror genre was never good to begin with from its inception unlike the comedy genre, which was very intelligent in the beginning, but now we get films such as Employee of the Month with that jackass Dane Cook. An interesting film genre was exploited by the studios many years ago. Sure, they were in it for the money, but one little movie caused an uproar. It was called Citizen Kane, and it was a major player (not the only one) that kicked off the film noir genre. While film noir was not the most uplifting of genres, it had different narratives, was cleverly written (see no further than the Maltese Falcon or Sunset Blvd), and effectively reflected the mood of the times. So, I suppose the pointlessly bloody gorefest flicks with possessed children and stupid puppets in videos serves as expressionism of people's frustrations over America's status in the world? No, absolutely not. What 14 year old kid is going to think about this stuff when seeing Saw III? The only thing I was thinking about was how much money I wasted over seeing this crap. I could have seen a relatively unknown picture (with a lot of critical buzz) such as Brick or good mainstream fare (The Departed, even though it has the pretty faces of DiCaprio and Damon present).The sad thing is that Saw III will be so much of a rousing box office success this weekend that studio execs will be pressuring for a forth one, but real film fans know full well that 2 sequels to the original were definitely unnecessary.The only things that uplifted my spirits after seeing Saw III was that I will not have to see it again because it was so bad, Borat comes out next week, and that I went home and watched a real work of cinematic art entitled 'The 400 Blows' by Francois Truffaut. If you think Jigsaw teaches a valuable lesson to ungrateful people by torturing them, Francois Truffaut teaches a lesson 10000000000 times more worth the value: you don't want to be a punk kid wandering the streets of France without parents who don't love you.See that instead or any foreign film for that matter instead of Saw III.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not the strongest in the series but it's still an enjoyable horror flick!,"Saw is back for another installment in the series as Saw III carries on from Saw II however is it any good? The story is mediocre this time round and isn't very friendly to people who are watching the series for the first time. You'd have to watch the first two to actually make sense of the story. The characters aren't very well created except for Doctor Lynn and obviously John and Amanda who were in the first two movies. You didn't really feel connected much to the rest of the characters so you didn't really care much. The character development was okay but it was mainly between Amanda and John (or Jigsaw) as she starts to care for him like a daughter would care for her father, trying desperately to cure and heal him. The acting is average except for the talented Shawnee Smith as Amanda and Tobin Bell as Jigsaw, both of them were yet again brilliant and the relationship between them is great. The direction isn't bad and the writing is great except for the fact that the story is more for the people who watched the first two movies than newcomers. The special effects and the blood and gore were yet again realistic and the traps were inventive but there was one scene that I think could have pushed the blood and gore scenes a little too far.Overall, I enjoyed it. It's a good horror movie but it's definitely the weakest at the moment. Another thing that was bad was the amount of blood and gore in this one. Even though I'm okay with blood and gore scenes in movies, there was one scene in particular which made me feel uncomfortable watching because it went a little too far (you'll know which scene I'm talking about if you watch the movie) and I felt that the movie didn't really need to cross that line as the story was very good anyway. The twists and turns in the movie won't let you down however, as there are plenty of them in the story.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Jigsaw returns in the third installment of the Saw series and it's a,"Film Review: Saw IIICast: Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith and Bahar SoomekhThe terminally ill psychopath Jigsaw is agonizing through his final moments. As he lays there on his deathbed, he has one final trick up his sleeve. His dutiful apprentice Amanda, played by Shawnee Smith, has already proved herself to the master tactician. She acts as his hands, eyes and ears in procuring his new test subjects.The sadistic Amanda leaves her victims little chance of survival, setting impossible situations for them from which to escape. With only one certain outcome, each of her distraught subjects writhes in agony.In his final hour upon the stage Jigsaw enlists the help of a nurse to perform a lifesaving operation on him. Their lives are dependent on one another and upon the success of a third person within the elaborate maze of death.Naturally there is a plot within the mangled plot and it is there that Jigsaw has the last laugh.This is a harrowing, macabre and sinister tale of unimaginable proportions. The moral depravity of the characters is beyond belief, especially when one considers that at the film's conclusion the audience tends to side with Jigsaw's vile conduct.With a modest budget of $10 million, this film has raked in hundreds of millions worldwide  another huge success for twisted pictures.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The traps in this one are more gruesome then the first 2, well not exactly the traps, as some involve no blood at all, but when there is blood, it pours. The main premise in this movie is not as interesting as the first 2, and the twist is not as clever as the first 2, but you still have a movie that will keep you interested.

It wasn't really good, but it was a !little bit! entertaining. But then, I saw SAW III at the preview and I nearly fell asleep. It was so awful. The story is so artificial andm unrealistic, that it hurts. Jigsaw's games are now really stupid and bad planned. And there's no real context. The Actors, without Jigsaw, are also chosen very well :D. All in all, its hard to believe, that James Wang made this third movie of SAW. He made the 1st and it was great.

A Sadistic Triumph ....,"This film is both well done and somewhat sadistic - so it's hard to get excited about it. There is a lot of graphic horror. Usually, horror movies are pretty ridiculous, but this one's done well enough that it's actually hard to watch.This movie picks up on the themes from the first two ""Saw"" movies: people are put into positions of having to make truly horrific choices. These usually involve a person causing a permanent self-inflicted injury in order to survive - or to allow someone else survive. This last component is prevalent in Saw III.The principal cases here: a doctor is fated to save a patient ... or die with the patient, and a man is put in the position of having to save the people who were involved in his son's death.There are some twists and surprises as the story unfolds. If you can make it past the first 15 minutes of the movie, you'll survive the rest. The horror is genuinely strong, the story is reasonably engaging and the acting is decently good. If you're a extreme horror fan, this is the movie of the year to see. For everyone else, it's a little too disturbing to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very Much A Let Down,"First of all, I am a huge Saw I & II fan. Quite possibly my favorite movie series ever made. I had very big expectations going into this and was very much let down. It almost seems like the writer was searching for a storyline. The movie is pieced together and does not flow well at all. And just as the comment before me says, it is incredibly gory. The blood and guts is way over done. The great thing about the Saw movies was that they weren't solely revolved around the gruesomeness. The Saw movies have incorporated incredible writing and wit, but this one changed that. It seemed like the goal of the movie was to show as much blood as possible. There are a lot of loose ends that need to be tied up, but I can't really see them justifying yet another movie. Basically, the soul of the Saw series was lost in this one.

Saw 3 is amazing,"Saw 3 was for me much better than saw 2. I think that i even liked it more than the first one. If you re looking for a gory and suspenseful movie with an unbelievable plot you should go see Saw 3. It has the best torture scenes by far out of the three Saw movies. It will keep you thinking about the movie for days and maybe even weeks after you see the movie. Saw 3 also explains many unanswered questions from the first and second movies. I absolutely loved Saw 3 and the other saw movies and i think that if you have seen the other saw movies and liked them you should definitely see Saw 3. Also because Saw 4 was announced and from reading the plot summary of it, Saw 4 seems that much of the movie is based on Saw 3, so if you plan on watching Saw 4 it is probably very important to see saw 3 to understand it.

Brutality and torture...On multiple levels.,"The signature for the Saw series is to kill off characters in creative, agonizing ways and to mix it all up with sharp wit and dark, contrasting atmosphere. Saw III delivers just that, and goes out of the way to please fans of it's predecessors.While entertaining, bloody, and gory as a good horror film should, it does move rather slowly. Almost like a television episode, extended for a feature film. It doesn't help, that while it's a Saw movie and the red stuff is in nearly every shot, it includes several clichés/dull moments. That being in comparison in what the movie could be. It fails in that department, mainly because the film focuses on the continuity of Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and Amanda (Shawnee Smith). The former not at 100%, for storyline reasons and not performance. And latter, though, does a great job at filling the screen with an aura of desperation and hate, which more than anything else in the film, makes you believe you're watching ""Saw"".But buying the ticket for 'III', I know the intelligence of the film was second on my mind. How these people were going to bite the dust was top priority. The camera/editing may have been too jumpy for some to see anything, but it's there in full force. Hands down, more violent and hard-hitting than the first two entries. It constantly garners that ""god, I'm glad I'm not him/her"" or ""sucks to be you!"" feeling.For storyline purposes, it barely passes, but does pass, for a gap between 1-2 and the inevitable 4. If you're wondering whether or not to see it, go and see it. It's a cool film, if nothing else. And it might prove inspiration into choosing a career in surgery.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Why aren't you listening, Hollywood?","After listening to the bitching and moaning exhibitors put on about how films are making less this year than last year, one has to wonder who is in charge there. Saw III proves a few things, not least of which is that spending two hundred million dollars to make a film is unnecessary. There is also a claim made by studios that a film has to be aimed to ""please everyone"" in order to make back its money. Saw III also turns that claim right on its ear. Saw III is indeed the first horror film, and indeed only the second film period, I have seen this year that could solidly be labelled as being for adults. And it grossed back its production budget three times over in one week. Why Hollywood does not take a cue from this is beyond me, and it seems to be beyond Hollywood, too. Although reception among critics and fans is sharply divided, Saw III is also easily the most intelligent and philosophical of the series to date. Although most people will miss the fact, it has quite a lot to say about our ability to confuse justice with revenge.At heart, the Saw films are about people undergoing tests. Where Saw III distinguishes itself from its predecessors is that the tests are no longer about survival. The penalties for failure are still fatal, but the tests are a little deeper than those of the mere will to live. And everyone, save for the ringmaster that is Jigsaw, is being tested. Viewers who wondered what kind of apprentice Amanda would make after Saw II will be shocked and satisfied. In contrast to Saw II, however, the plot does not revolve around a group of individuals arguing with one another. Jigsaw is less in control of his games this time, leaving us with less cryptic (yet exceedingly obvious) clues to laugh at. Yet there is nothing he has failed to think out in advance, with every angle and variation accounted for. In another life, he could have been a championship chess player. However, one loose end remains for him, that of who will succeed him when the tumor that caused his epiphany in the first place finally gets the better of him.Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell are literally on fire in this film. Smith plays an emotional wreck so convincingly it makes one wonder what she had been up to in the time she had seemed to disappear from the media. Anyone who doubts her acting chops will be floored as she acts out the consequences of Amanda failing to realise that she is being tested. The big drama of Saw III is that Jigsaw is now so frail that he can no longer set up his games unaided, and thus Amanda carries out most of the work for him. Kerry, the detective from the other two films, investigates the latest of the Jigsaw killings. She suspects something is afoul when she deduces that this trap was impossible to escape from. Fans of the first two films will remember that Jigsaw is all about playing by the rules, or at least being consistent with the rules he sets. I do not believe it is giving much away to say that Amanda has been playing a little game of her own in between carrying out Jigsaw's wishes, and that Jigsaw is not terribly impressed by this.Woven into the story is the test of a man whose son was killed in a car accident, and forgotten by the justice system. In most Hollywood films, this would dissolve into a comment about how liberal our justice system is. Not so in Saw III. In Saw III, Jigsaw places his victim on a path to confront the people most directly involved both in the son's death and the minimal punishment the offender received. His challenge is to overcome his hatred of these people for long enough to be able to save each individual from some of the most ludicrously cruel contraptions seen in the series. Of course, it would not be a Saw film if people did not die in ironic ways, but the change here to leave the lives of several participants in the hands of another is exactly what is needed after familiarity with the standard scenario had been enforced by the other two films. The most peculiar variation on the original scenario comes from the fact that Jigsaw knows his death is imminent, and he delights in weaving that fact into the tests he sets those around him.In case I have not made it clear enough, credit is due to the creativity of the filmmakers. Robert Rodriguez has said in at least two audio commentaries that once you turn on the money hose to wash away creative problems, you cannot turn it off again. Every dollar of the twelve million spent on filming Saw III was used to much greater effect than a lot of films that spend ten times that amount. Having seen the insides of my own arms and one of my feet, I can say without hesitation that in contrast to almost every other effect in horror films, the removal of a fragment of Jigsaw's skull made me ill. Special effects is meant to be an art of fooling people to believe they are looking at something they are not, and Saw III is one of the few feature films of recent years to accomplish this. I am sure a neurosurgeon or effects artist would be able to point out flaws in the scene other than the varying mark indicating drilling depth, but this scene alone is enough to put the fear of mortality into even the most jaded viewer. Rarely do I walk out of a theatre feeling this satisfied.I gave Saw III a ten out of ten. If you are like me and prefer your horror uncompromisingly brutal, then it is essential viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
shocking and explosive,"The definition of suffering and macabre is explained going into detail and with irresistible flair. The torture, apparently torturing the victims for their own good, is this time much more perverse than in the first two movies, so no fan of the series will be disappointed.

Saw 3: Thy Name is Revenge,"Well, not being a huge fan of the first Saw, but enjoying it. Saw 2 showed up and sucked. I thought it was just a mess of a film, acting above all. Well thankfully Saw 3 has taken a step forward. Saw 3 is better than the first two. It doesn't have the mysterious charm of the first, but it's story is deeper and the deaths are bloodier, gorier and overall just better.Story is about the bedridden Jigsaw needing help due to the tumor growing on his brain. His accomplice (the chick from the 2nd) is helping out, and she manages to get kidnap a doctor to help save Jigsaw....obviously a deadly game is involved. The story/game in this flick is on a much larger scale than the previous two films. There is also a couple throw in ""games"" and a side story (my favorite part of the film) which is thrown into the mix.I kind of thought Saw 3 was a little long. They kept showing you what you were supposed to be thinking through short clips....I would say this is the most predictable Saw 3 yet, so these clips weren't really needed. But they are helpful. I also didn't like the accomplice to Jigsaw...she's a little too good at what she does, for being an amateur. I can complain about stuff till the cows come home, but I'd rather just say that this movie will most likely be a huge hit for Saw fans and Saw haters won't hate so much anymore....maybe not. It's not a bad movie...I wouldn't say it's a great movie. But it was pretty unique and gory. Pretty good flick. 7 outta 10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not Mind-Blowing, But Quite Good By Sequel Standards","Jigsaw and Amanda kidnap a doctor to keep Jigsaw alive while a man who lost his son to a drunk driver must survive a handful of tests.This film was not the greatest horror film I've seen. It certainly didn't leave me the way ""Saw"" left me. But as the third film in the series, hastily written, it was actually pretty good. The traps were decent (though less creative than before) and the story takes an interesting new direction. Best of all, flashbacks that help fill in the gaps from the first two films (many of us figured out how Jigsaw remained motionless so long in the first film, but now it's no longer a debate).Some critics said the film had gadgets that were too high-tech or too reliant on medical knowledge. I disagree. They showed how devoted Amanda was and I find it plausible she spent countless hours perfecting the devices and studying anatomy (one scene makes it clear she has a solid knowledge of pharmaceuticals).Others have said the film was gory. I say it was not gory enough! For me, the most disturbing scene was in the first five minutes. Later scenes that could have been incredibly bloody (a woman's rib cage being pulled forcibly open, for example) took the camera off the action or made the scene too dark to really enjoy. The generation of horror fans today grew up with Mortal Kombat... they can handle body parts getting ripped off. Give them what they want. (Not to mention the growing influence of Asian horror film gross-outs like ""Imprint"".)The pigs in the grinder... delightfully perfect.I also thought the plot was incredibly contingent. For it to work out perfectly, everything would have to happen exactly as it did with the right people living and dying and certain people being out of their homes long enough to rig things. (The Mysties are saying ""it's just a show, you should really just relax"" and they're right... but it saddens me to see such intelligent film makers leave these danglers.)I'm not sure why the father of the drunk driver was targeted. Unlike past victims, his ""crime"" (wanting revenge on his son's killer) wasn't even really that bad. Very natural, in fact.The visuals as usual are good, and the film is both dark and filmed through a blue tint to give a more sterile feel. Sterile as in isolated.I feel there's so much more to say, but I'm drawing a blank. But really, if you liked the first two films you have no excuse to miss this one. It really clamps down the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Didn't make it to the end.,"Half way through the movie my husband passed out. I would love to describe at what point in the movie this happened, but if you've seen the movie or plan on seeing it, you'll know what part it is when you get to it. He and I watch a lot of grotesque movies and I was very surprised to look over and see him out cold! I thought that this movie definitely deserves a 10 if a man like him can't take it. We would like to see the ending some day, but that might be a while. They might have gone a little too far with the grossness of it all, but if you take it that seriously then I don't think you should be watching it. Maybe next time I'll leave my husband at home!

"SAW III (Darren Lynn Bousman, 2006) *1/2","The first film was compelling and highly original; the second was below par and forgettable; this third entry is among the most repulsive I've ever watched: its relentless gloating (in glorious close-up) on pain and flesh ripping is positively insulting; I've yet to catch up with several recent horror titles but there's no clearer indication than this of how low the genre has sunk - it has literally gone down the drain! The plot itself is mildly intriguing and even features a nice final twist - but the film's parade of gore, creative torture devices (God only knows where the moribund 'avenger' picks up the various parts, not to mention the energy to build them!) and self-pitying characters makes for unintentional hilarity all the way through!",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Saw fans will not be disappointed.,"Saw III has all the gore and gruesomeness you could want, but that isn't the reason that we watch, is it? It's Jigsaw that fascinates us. He is such an amazing judge of the human condition, though his methods are quite.... disturbing... We understand why he does what he does. Maybe not to the full extent (yet), but enough to make us come back and see Saw again and again.The Saw movies are more than just a bloody horror series. They make us think. Too many ""horror"" films these days are about the cheap scares, maximizing the use of today's technology, making the bloodiest, goriest movie they can disgust us with. Saw is so much more than that. Movies like Hostel and Texas Chainsaw Massacre don't haunt you, mess with your mind like Saw does. A horror movie that does more than try to scare you is my definition of a well done movie.""I want to play a game. The rules of the game are simple.""

"Overall a pretty tacky excuse to move from one sadistic, stomach-churning scene to another","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter taking care of two random victims, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) goes in for the kill and traps Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) a man in a deep state of grief after losing his son in a drink driving accident. He sets him a series of challenges to save the lives of those caught up in his sons death (including a female driver who failed to stop and help, the judge who gave the killer a pathetic sentence, and finally, the killer himself) to test his resolve and to stop him languishing in a state of veangefulness. Meanwhile, he also takes Jeff's wife Lynn (Bahar Soometh) a brash doctor who pushes everyone away from her to operate on the tumour that is killing him, with the help of Amanda (Shawnee Smith) his former victim.All three of the Saw movies have seemed to pride themselves more on delivering stomach-churning gore than genuine scares and they've reached a crescendo with Saw III, a truly nasty piece of work that reportedly had paramedics being called in to deal with fainting cinema-goers who couldn't handle the movie's sheer level of blood and gore. There's plenty of morbidly imaginative Hellraiser style death scenes on display that see some characters die some of the grusomest deaths imaginable (check out the terrifying looking thing the drunk driver is attached to at the end and the torture he is made to endure!), but it's actually the most realistic gory scene that proves the hardest to stomach, where a drill is used to go into Jigsaw's skull and operate on his brain. Somehow seeing the real sort of thing is even nastier than the most unpleasant death device the screen-writers could dream up.Plot wise, the movie's pretty defunct. We open with two murders that bear no relevance to the 'story' that's about to unfold, which basically consists of moving from one gory set-piece to another in a none stop attempt to turn the stomachs of the viewers as much as possible. There seems to be some ridiculous rhyme and reason to Jigsaw's motives, wherein a sadistic killer tries to make a man feeling justifiable anger and vengeance get his humanity back as well as trying to get people to appreciate life by making them crawl and scream for it. There's some fairly good acting on display though, Macfadyen raw and determined as the tragic anti-hero as well as Bell's calm, rationalizing psychopath but, unlikely as it seems, one just hopes this is the last of the odious Saw movies before the series gets the chance to get anymore morally adventurous. **",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Saw III,"Saw III is a good contributing part of the Saw franchise since it keeps intertwining the previous films together like a puzzle itself. The story lines and twist endings with Saw III is definitely the reason to watch this relatively sub-par horror flick. It's quite remarkable how well each twist is, even though the viewer might be able to sniff some of them out, they keep on providing surprise after surprise. The actors in the film are alright, some really bad script dialog and overacting (especially Shawnee Smith) but not unbearable. The Saw films however are best viewed in sequential order in short periods of time to pick up past characters, subplots and tidbit hints. I'd have to say Saw III (6/10) didn't hold up to its previous successors but it manages to be a fun ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The best bit was the trailer for the Tenacious D flick,"Nothing, as in a blackness, a depravity, a hole into which maladjusted deviants, masturbate their crippled humanity into twisted shapes of death.Violence has it's place in cinema, in places it makes a film. Kill Bill, Dawn of the Dead, Irreversible, all those films and their genres benefit from a bit of blood. But it's blood with artistry. Those zombies didn't die in vain, the Crazy 88 Gang were slaughtered and we cared. But in Saw III, I just didn't care. Not one bit. I just sat wondering where can filmic violence can go? Now mainstream cinema can show 'wound shots' and other graphic, horrendous violence, where does it go next? I wondered whether the main protagonist women would have sex with the people she was killing. It might have raised an eyebrow. Or made me think I should raise an eyebrow. Because in actuality, I didn't care. And you shouldn't. Saw III crosses the line. But you shouldn't care to watch it. It's a dreadful film. People have been throwing up and passing out all in cinemas across the UK in vain. You come out feeling violated, but it's all for nothing, because it's no badge of honour that you've seen Saw III. It is a poor excuse for cinema. It's strange, I've never felt bored and violated at the same time, but that sums up my experience.It doesn't even tie up the series, there's another one to endure.

agree with shinn1,"Saw I = amazing and original. Saw II = wow, for once, a movie is just as good or better than the original. Saw III = WTF ????Extremely disappointed. The whole plot was screwed up. The Doctor was 3 breaths from dying in Saw II, eaten up with cancer. Now all of a sudden you spend 50 minutes leading up to some stupid operation that's only going to prolong the life of the doctor another, what, 2 hours? Plus you've got this guy Jeff that no one cares about, and we're not sure if we're supposed to be rooting for him or what, going through these tests, but he passes them all quite easily. In the first 2 Saw movies, you were -with- the poor saps going through these tests, and horrified with them. But Jeff just quietly bumbles through them. Leads up finally to the guy who ended up hitting his son with a car, all about vengeance and all that crap.Then the whole intern, which was awesome in Saw II, starts getting all emotional and stupid in Saw III. This movie was such a waste. Flashbacks meant nothing. They probably filmed the scenes while doing Saw II, and Wahlberg realized what a crappy script Saw III was and he bailed, so to make some kind of transition seem to fit in, they threw in some flashback-deleted scenes reel from Saw II, showing Wahlberg trying to escape.I was really surprised when i saw it was the same writers from Saw I and Saw II, i figured this was some new intern writer or something working on this one.

Nowhere near as good as the first two,"""Saw III"" doesn't possess many of the qualities that made the first two movies so good. There are still crazy death-traps and excessively gory scenes, but that's about it. The twists are weak and predictable at that. The acting is mediocre. The plot is actually somewhat boring. There aren't any genuinely scary scenes, just graphic images that make you cringe. This movie seemed dumbed down. Everything was over-explained. The connections to the previous two films are weak and poorly done. I loved the first two movies, but this one is a significant departure.

Seen,"While some people are calling this gore flick the best of the three, I would have to say the opposite. Saw III has neither the plotted suspense of it's original nor the fast paced bloodletting of the amped up predecessor- yet the film plays like a half-assed amalgam of both. I can imagine hardcore fans of the morbid franchise or people who have never seen a Saw deriving the most pleasure out of this latest mechanized entry. Fans will eat up any bone these practical jokers (screenwriters) throw whilst trying to provide some sort of deadly scenario, usually giving way to an inordinate number of flashbacks, all in the name of allowing the franchise's sole saving grace (The blissfully creepy Tobin Bell) opportunity to chew the little scenery his tired ass can. Likewise, those who have never indulged in the current heavyweight champ of box office masochism may find a squeamishly fun time, guided by endless twists and brutally unique gore. For all those that fall into that third group which have seen these previous entries and are not die-hard fans (and over 20) will probably have a hard time swallowing this rushed, misdirected cash in on the silly little craze that was once unique, graphic, and entertaining but now merely feels monotonous, cheap, and exploitive. Desperately trying to weave an ambitious narrative to help explain some of this sorry excuse for a trilogy, the movie instead comes across as a convoluted hodge-podge of throw away ideas, weakly connecting the over-the-top and less frightening set piece death traps, with all the personality and character development of a soap opera.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

"While there's enough for horror enthusiasts to find it watchable, there isn't enough to consider this a good movie","I recently revisited Saw III (2006) on Prime. The plot delves into Jigsaw's ongoing battle with cancer and his mentorship of Amanda. They decide to abduct two individuals: a nurse tasked with keeping Jigsaw alive, and a man thrust into a series of life-or-death games where tough choices await. As they navigate the perilous games, the question looms-how are the two scenarios intertwined?Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (known for Spiral) and featuring Tobin Bell (Mississippi Burning), Shawnee Smith (The Blob), Angus McFadyen (Braveheart), Bahar Soomekh (Crash) and J. LaRose (Insidious).This installment in the Saw series feels somewhat lackluster, resembling just another Jigsaw movie and falling short of the cleverness displayed in the first two. The kill setups and devices are decent, but the execution is only average, lacking the intensity of its predecessors, though the gore remains outstanding as always. I will say there is a particularly well-executed brain surgery scene that is hard to watch and cringe worthy. References and flashbacks to the first two films feel forced and unnecessary. The ending and resolution, on the other hand, provides some entertainment value.In summary, Saw III signals a decline in the franchise's momentum. While there's enough for horror enthusiasts to find it watchable, there isn't enough to consider this a good movie. I would rate this a 5.5/10 and suggest viewing it once.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Saw 3 is better than its predecessor, even more so if we take into account a maturation of aesthetic language. The traps never were so sadic and there's a good plot","Despite the coercive beginning, it's interesting to see that director Darren Lynn Bousman managed to rescue some of the suspenseful perspective of the original feature to compose his new onslaught. However, the focus is not exactly on the continuation of the Matthews saga, but rather on how Amanda is the ""true heir"" to John Kramer's legacy, and how, after going through countless ordeals, she appears to have what it takes to continue the deliverance. Morality and the granting of a second chance to those who do not enjoy life. Now, the difference of Saw 3 is that we follow the last moments of Jigsaw's fragile health, lying on a makeshift stretcher and asking Amanda to capture Dr. Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh), a surgeon whose working life is in bad shape the worst, impacting even the safety of its patients.As a way to guarantee her a ticket to the new life, the game about the doctor is simple: keep the machines and John's body running until his other victim manages to get through all the necessary challenges and get out of confinement. Otherwise, a device built by Amanda will shoot and kill her without thinking twice, preventing her from returning to her family - which, for now, we know to be composed by her unknown husband.Sacrifices are needed for the cathartic and irreversible transformation to come to the victims of the serial killer. He has never directly killed a person, but he understands that certain individuals need an extra push to understand timeless and intrinsic meanings to human beings, such as happiness, family and life itself. And as far as we know, it is precisely the opposite of this that takes possession of the troubled and traumatized mind of Jeff (Angus Macfayden), a man who lost his son in a car accident and whose long-awaited justice never arrived, since the person responsible for the running over she was sentenced to just six months in prison and then responded on parole.It's interesting to see how the puzzle Jeff faced is perhaps one of the most complex puzzles ever seen in the franchise: forgiveness. He is not subjected to any physical surrender to save the other participants, but must bury his vengeful feelings in order to keep anyone alive. Unlike previous films, we don't have an explicitness saturated with bloody explosions or a raw gore in the sequences: the traps composed by Amanda are very functional and dangerous, but they also assume that it is necessary to find something that will allow us to evolve.The subplot, starring Angus Macfadyen is interesting, but because it is inferior to the psychological impasse between Jigsaw, Amanda and Dr. Lynn, it inadvertently gets thrown into the background, which is something fatal for a ""Saw"" movie. When we remember the first one, bathroom scenes immediately come to mind; when we remember the second, the house full of traps and infested by a deadly gas comes to mind... while the third, it's hard not to associate it with the image of Jigsaw stuck in a bed, instead of the real game. Still, screenwriter Leigh Whannell was careful to come up with interesting psychological approaches to Macfadyen's character so as not to let the pace slip.Darren Lynn Bousman's direction is identical to the previous film: appealing to the extreme for quick cuts, blurred digital cameras, focuses on sordid details... and always leaving that impression of the film resembling a music video. But this time, he managed to make the viewer more into the disturbing mood of the plot, and never forgetting to keep the lighting dim so as not to leave the people even more stunned. Bousman's jugglery works well when you have to transition from one scene to another. There are a variety of time jumps in the film, going back and forth in the timeline even before the plot of the first Saw, and the way the director blends non-linear elements into the same shot - Amanda (Shawnee Smith) walking through a hallway and out in some event months before, for example - are a mannerism that works, especially to mask the limitations of space.Jigsaw's intention to make people appreciate life is much deeper in the script, and manages to effectively unite agony with reflection. The relationship of the ""serial-killer"" (those quotes have a greater weight in this third film, believe me) with his pupil Amanda is the great high point of the plot, as the way the script approached her care for the old cancer patient and the teachings of his ideals to the woman was quite intelligent. The most curious thing is to delve into the explanations that Jigsaw hates murderers! Believe me: the climax is mind-blowing.After all, as Jigsaw makes clear in yet another incredible plot twist - which, as always, is one of the great highlights of the franchise - that Amanda actually values suffering and condemnation, without the possibility of an arc of redemption; in this way, traps do not arise as a means to an end, but as insurmountable and impossible to break cells. In one of the first sequences, Officer Kerry (Dina Meyer) is captured and put into a game where she must search for the key that can free her from a device stuck in her ribs before time runs out. But, as we realized, escape from it is not an option, leading her to realize that death is the only certainty.By the way, speaking of traps, they only evolve in creativity and sadism. This third episode is a delight for fans of the authentic by torture. Anyone who enjoys delighting in the suffering of others through the bizarre traps of Jigsaw will certainly approve of the result, as they are more agonizing than ever. Acid, rings, pigs... there's creative carnage for all tastes. The way exaggerated violence was approached has always been interesting, and this time, director Darren Lynn Bousman and screenwriter Leigh Whannell (who, for those who don't know, plays the photographer who is imprisoned in the bathroom in the first film) took it to new heights. Not seen in the seriesThe cast, as it has been since the beginning, is basically made up of faces unknown to the general public, with the exception of Jigsaw himself and his assistant Amanda, who by this time have become stamped stamps. The pair, played by Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith, show themselves once again in the domain of their characters. Angus Macfadyen, who plays Jeff, and Bahar Soomekh, in the role of Lynn, are also good additions to the team.Even correcting some mistakes from the previous film by efficiently delving into the psychological side of the characters, ""Saw 3"" is the one with the most flaws. The main one is the excessive use of flashbacks in order to ""chew up"" everything that was done in the two previous films. The franchise is interesting precisely because it presents the agony in a spontaneous way, throwing us into tense moments exactly as it happens with the characters (remembering that they are drugged and already wake up trapped), and check how everything was planned, and also see what happened in what had been omitted at the end of the second was totally unnecessary.The atmosphere remains tense, gloomy, dark (even too dark) and Darren Lynn Bousman's directing is starting to become cliché: the quick cuts, the rotating camera and close-ups on the anguished faces of the victims. But what really causes a bit of discomfort is the ""film summary"" that happens at the end, like the previous ones, to chew up the conclusion and which is totally unnecessary. As usual, the ending is inconclusive, open, but no less elaborate and intricate as the previous films. However, it doesn't quite impress as before, mainly because there weren't many pending revelations, since in the first film the true identity of the killer was shown, in the second the identity of the accomplice and what is left for the third does not have the same impact. Which is not to say it's not surprising, but it's clear that there aren't many alternatives left for the script and for the audience hungry for another bombastic revelation.Are the subjective and the construction of facts in our minds often much more frightening than the concrete image in front of us? On the other hand, these flashbacks fill gaps in previous chapters and please many of the series' fans: We know, for example, what happened to Adam after the end of the first chapter, as well as a glimpse of the fate of detective Eric Matthews; we see who kidnapped Adam and, most interestingly, how the preparation of the trap of Adam and Dr. Gordon was done in the bathroom of the first film by Jigsaw and his new apprentice, Amanda Young. Even a quick flashback of John with his ex-wife Jill appears while the villain is being operated on by Dr. Lynn.""Saw 3"" has everything to please those looking for more violence, and even excels for having an interesting story. But, unfortunately, they didn't know how to take advantage of this story very well, leaving the franchise too repetitive. And that was the final impression: ""Saws"" had three good movies, but there's nothing more to invent, but to bathe the screens with more blood. Saw 3 is essentially better than its predecessor, even more so if we take into account a maturation of aesthetic language. But that still doesn't say much, as the slips remain there and bring with great relief a conclusion to the first ""journey"" of Jigsaw and his sadistic games.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointing,"I enjoyed Saw and Saw II, but Saw III just left me feeling very underwhelmed and even slightly bored.One of the most enjoyable aspects of the first film was the chase by the detectives as they hunted for Jigsaw, and that perspective was sorely lacking from this film.It also suffered from mediocre protagonists who I never really connected to. Placing Jigsaw and Amanda at the forefront of this film was very tiresome as the film tries to conjure up some twisted moral arguments that are just awful to listen to.The overall plot was just a bit unsatisfactory as well compared to the first two films and it just didn't conjure up as much excitement or mystery compared to the other two, and the twist was not as shocking.Overall a bit of a let down following two really strong films.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Perhaps the worst of the 3 but a good ride,"Saw 3 relies highly on the games played in numbers one and two. With Killer Jigsaw stationed in a bed throughout the entire movie speaking words of wisdom to his sidekick Amanda.Jigsaw takes to kidnapping a doctor who once treated him, her mission to keep him alive as long as it takes Jeff (Angus Macfayden) to complete a game of his own. The only problem is, if doctor Lyn (Bahar Soomekh) fails to keep Jigsaw in the land of the living a device around her neck will explode ending her life as well. Racing against the clock, and with the ever watchful eye of Amanda baring on her every action life couldn't be more horrid for the poor doctor. During this the audience are shown many delightful new traps conjured by Jigsaw designed on inflicting pain.The acting from the Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) is sound and very professional, Shawnee Smith (Amanda) annoyed me throughout, but you begin to settle with her towards the end. Missing the acting ability of Donnie Whalberg as a back up apart from in a small number of flashbacks Saw 3 isn't one for the Best Actor in a leading role award, but that's not really why we watch saw movies.In terms of twists there is one big twist at the end which will make you think and consider for some time after. However the absence of the Saw theme tune which worked brilliantly in one and two is missed (however you can hear it in the new Denzel movie Deja Vu).A must watch for any Saw fan but if you want a taste of Saw go with Saw One 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Saw III was very satisfying,"Gorier and darker, this great sequel ties the first two together with complete genius in writing.I love the acting, the plot twists and different types of situations and trials all the characters go through.A great addition to the Horror department of films.Rent Saw and Saw II before going to see the 3rd, it will enhance the flavor brilliantly.Seeing films with as much blood and gore as this does not sicken me but kind of excites me to how much our movies have changed and improved over the years.This new and thrilling trilogy is just what the new millennium needed.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
suitable for fans and others with strong constitutions,"Assuming you have a strong stomach, this is a worthy addition to the Saw franchise. Almost all the survivors from the last one are back for another go, the death scenes are spectacular if gruesome, and just like the first two you have a killer surprise twist ending, no pun intended. Only reason I didn't rate it higher is due to the volume and over the top nature of the violence, which might turn off some people. What performances there are are workable within the context of the storyline as presented, if have a reasonable constitution and no real problems with blood gore and grisly death scenes you should have no problem here.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intelligent and interesting wrap up to Saw series.,"The first thing I have to say is that this final installment of the Saw series shouldn't be considered a horror flick. It's more like suspense+gore. I didn't scare once, and I didn't hear anyone else in the theater jump either. Although one girl did jump for a preview of Sarah Michelle Gellar's The Return. Saw III just didn't deliver with the thrills. But it did bring the gore in spades and if you enjoyed the previous installments you shouldn't walk away disappointed.What I enjoyed the most is the writing. I feel like the writers really examined the previous two films and set out to wrap up all the loose ends that had been made with Saw II. Every question that was raised in regards to the motives of Jigsaw and his rules was answered. Which, in this genre, is often the first thing that is tossed out the window in an effort to focus on the killing. They delivered a great twist with the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda. And the subplot was a fantastic test of the human psyche and morality.I can't say I enjoyed the movie, because after seeing Hostel, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and now this- well I don't like shock/gore movies. But I was pleased with the effort and seriousness the writers and producers had to deliver a movie that would really honor the intelligence of the community that enjoys these flicks.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great gore, but the longest 2 hrs. of my life.","When you go to see any of the ""Saw"" saga, you go for the intense plot twists, the eerie environment, and let's not forget the cringing gore. Well Saw 3 delivers on all of these. The plot twists more that you can count, the environment is one of the freakiest I've seen, and the gore is second to none. In fact is seems like the Saw 3 team focused all their attention on this gore factor, because honestly that is what draws ""Saw"" fans. Saw 3 makes hostel look like a Disney flick, showing the audience everything you're hoping not to see. However with all the hard work these guys put into the details and violence, they happened to make one of the slowest moving movies I have ever seen. When the lights in the theater came on I was certain that I had just watched a 3 1/2 hour movie. This is definitely NOT A DATE MOVIE! This is the movie you go to when you have nothing else to do. Because as I said earlier it moves slower that ""Return of the King"" on a good day. Serious Saw fans and Gore lovers will definitely get their yearly fix with this one.

A mere shadow of its predecessors,"In 2004 the world was treated to Saw. Saw was a brutal horror flick with excellent gore, a thrilling story and a superb plot - it combined the absolute best of a lot of things and with that became a new standard. Not too much later the follow up came - and that sequel confirmed the myth that some sequels can withstand the comparison with the original. Saw II was in my eyes just as good as the first one. Now... In 2006, Saw III sees the cinemas. Does it withstand the comparison? IMO, no. Not by a long shot.The premise to the story stays the same: a criminal going by the handle Jigsaw puts people that deserve a lesson in his eyes to a test. The setup for the film is the same as well - lots of (excellent) gore, fear and agony burning on the screen. The background story is different. The plot attempts to make the film fit in by adding tie-ins to the other parts and succeeds to a certain level, yet it fails pretty hard as it makes a number of jumps that just don't make any sense at all. It also misses the one thing that made the previous two films twist and turn - a severe twist of plot in the end that made them unpredictable. This film is very predictable.I guess it will now draw to a conclusion in a fourth part, but I can't say I am really looking forward to seeing it - it can only mean further downfall.5 out of 10 mutilated victims",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great way to end trilogy though a sub par horror film.,"Unlike the lame Saw 2, Saw 3 actually has a point and a story to it. There is actually some character development going on and I give a lot of its respect to the writers.However I think Bousman wanted a very gritty documentary feel to the film kind of like the others by using all hand-held camera shots. I think he took this too far and the shaky quick moving shots with the fast MTV style edits just ended up giving me a headache and not moving the story along or creating any tension.When I go to a horror film I want to not just be scared but I want to watch as if i am actually there in the film and see everything but these MTV flashes and edits always take me out of the story and make me feel like i am watching a movie which is not the right thing to do.All in all this movie was much better than Saw 2 but not the same rush as the first saw. Great gore and great writing. Worth checking out for any horror fan and a must for any Saw fan.As for me I can't wait for Hostel 2 cause I know Eli Roth CAN direct a horror film.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
There goes the intelligence...,"Upon having myself my very own Saw Marathon to catch up on the horror series I missed out on, I have decided to end it here. The reason? In all honesty, I no longer felt comfortable with the way the series was heading.But let's start at the beginning. Saw 3 picks up where the second left off, with Detective Eric Matthews still chained in the infamous unused bathroom featuring the corpses of past Saw characters. Here, the film promised a lot, as I enjoyed Donnie Wahlberg's irritable, takes no nonsense portrayal from the second film. But with a bang, boom and snap, the character just disappears from the story. The film is then split in two, following a father going through a series of traps in Jigsaw's test for forgiveness and Jigsaw/John himself, being treated for his cancer.Firstly, lets tackle the most well known section of any Saw film, the traps. As Jigsaw's latest are presented, it is very clear the makers were now going for shock over substance. This reliance does not bode well for the final film, as I personally found myself cringing and looking away, hoping that these elongated gory scenes would hurry and finish. I no longer had the fixed, morbid curiosity the first two played on so well. The horrified thought process of 'what would I do in that situation?' was gone. That creepy intelligence the first two had replaced with dumb, slasher-like kills. My first disappointment.The acting, which I didn't expect to be top-notch considering this was a third installment to a horror franchise, wasn't especially atrocious but it wasn't exceptionally good either. Tobin Bell is as 'meh' as ever and from what small amount of time Donnie Wahlberg had was entertaining due to his understanding of his own character. Other returning members of the cast include Dina Meyer (who was unforgivably underused) and Shawnee Smith (who was unforgivably overused). New members of the cast are extremely average, most memorably Angus Macfayden who portrays the tragic father character mentioned previously. I must say the actor deserves an award for playing one of the most unlikable protagonists in cinema history. Everything this character does is idiotic and frustrating. Macfayden seems to do the best he can to work with such a horrible, horrible part but it's just not enough. My second disappointment.As much as I despised the disgusting trap sub plot, I can't say anything better for the ill Jigsaw plot itself. Although initially interesting, tense and a breath of fresh air from watching pointless suffering, it quickly turned to nonsense and became quite a bore. I don't know why the makers are adamant on the audience caring for the villain. I was far more interested in Bahar Soomekh's brain surgeon present, but perhaps that's a matter of opinion.But, as a trademark, eventually these subplots came together in a twisting revelation delivered in the final ten minutes of the film. I'll admit, I spent much of the film watching only to hear a reprise of that oh so good 'Hello Zepp' theme traditional in the Saw films. But this pay-off was so lazy, confusing and layered it only came across as humorous and silly. My third disappointment and, as you know, three strikes and you're out.Overall, it's a poor film and the fact that the Saw films were reduced to this is sad. Although I can't expect anything else from a cheaply made, studio ordered sequel only made for money over purpose of story, I still expected something, anything, that would be enjoyable. But no. The story is flawed, the characters are awful and the traps/tests are almost unwatchable in regards to gore. Horrible. If you're thinking of watching this after you enjoyed the first two, do yourself a favor. Stop there, and remember the series as two successful, clever films and not as the torture porn, ridiculous series it has become today.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Halloween trick, no treat here!","I am really reluctant to give this film even a 2. Wow how many takes on the same old story can we conjure up. Yeah saw was okay, but please. Can someone please tell us a new story, 2 was bad and 3...well I reluctantly give this a 2. Halloween trick, no treat here. Oh I guess if we add more gore, then everyone will love it.

Yeah there's tons of guts and gallons of blood, but the one thing they forgot was...a story. Yeah that would help.

terrible.,"I just came back from viewing saw III, and I must say that it is probably the most intricately woven piece of crap I've ever seen. Fortunately for my sake, I went into the movie with low expectations so I ended up being only slightly disappointed. My main problem with the film is that it makes a very tired attempt at masking it's characteristics of a snuff film by throwing in a shoddy storyline, sub-par dialogue, and a handful of excessively mediocre plot-twists. HOLY S*** SAW-PEOPLE! YOU'VE PIECED TOGETHER NOT JUST ONE, BUT SEVERAL WEAK MONTAGES OF RANDOM FLASHBACKS SUPPORTED BY THE SAME LAME MUSIC FOR EVERY SEQUENCE... unimpressed. In addition, the logical inconsistencies are beyond abundant, but the film's realism (or lack thereof) is a factor of considerably less importance in determining the value of this film. To be honest- I don't have the motivation to expose what a travesty this movie really is, because it's more than capable of proving this without my assistance. In summation, I do not regret seeing this film, because it has provided me with some much needed blog-fodder. To the reader I must say: I could care less whether or not you see the film or not, but consider yourself warned, because if you do choose to watch this train-wreck of a motion picture you'll have no one to blame but yourself for ""wasting 8 bucks"". Not since Mel's Passion of the Christ has a snuff film attempted to pass for something more. What's even more disappointing is that, through the unintentional support of viewers like myself and the intentional support of the legions of retards comprising the movie-going public, the saw enterprise will continue to discharge more cinematic dysentery for many a Halloween to come. What's even more disappointing is that it's received a collective rating of over 7 stars, am I the only one who's shocked? That's it for this review- I'm going to watch something with some redemptive values like Monty Python.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing,I have seen this movie and I loved it! I bought a Fangoria magazine that has information about the movie before I ever saw it. I read about the fact that the writer and the director were tired of people calling it a slasher film and calling Jigsaw a crazed serial killer when once you think about it he really isn't it is totally up to them to get themselves out. Seriously though the movie is spectacular! The make up the tests everything was amazing the storyline actually surprised me when normally I can predict horror films but this totally took me off guard.

I sat I saw I sank.,"I have racked my brain to see what limits I can put on my sadness and disgust at this SAW franchise. So far I have made it through 1 2 and the vile 3. These films are a celebration of hatred and mutilation presented to 20 year olds to develop their taste for pitiless violence towards distressed victims. As graphic as pornography and as pulverizing as a steel-mill, these films are made to traumatize..... and then promise the spectacle of victim violence mixed with humiliation irrationality and plain viciousness. It makes a recipe for some sort of Corporate mind destruction towards young people who have not had much experience in humanity... so these films are designed to pour acid onto their young optimistic minds, to vandalize the senses and to entertain criminals... and develop a taste for inhuman destruction of the human body as 'a fun experience'. It also saddens me greatly that the original films were created by immature Australian boys who were seized upon by the American Corporate Machine that specializes in making sure these vicious pitiless traumatic exercises in evil reach the widest audience possible. These films are designed to show you hatred. To make a spectacle of the hatred and for you and your kids to enjoy watching the hatred. The relentless destruction of the human form pantomiming as 'scary fun' is probably the biggest most insidious evil permeating our 'culture'. Hooray for Hollywood as it is from there that this emanates; no other country exports so much visual hatred as America. No wonder less and less people go to the cinemas. Seeing other humans screaming in pain begging for their lives and dying in agony from mutilating wounds is so very sad in any film. For it to become a 'horror genre' is an absolute tragedy and a massive challenge in this early part of a bright new century. This section of what was an exciting vibrant film industry was once applauded for 'cinema verite' .........now it is to be condemned for what has mutated into 'cinema cruelite'. There is nowhere for these torture chamber films to go.... unless baby beating is forthcoming. (Eli Roth? sounds spossible)....",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Paw,"Oh dear.Firstly, I thought Saw to be a fantastic film. I'm not a fan of films who boast about torturing people, but the violence in Saw was kept to a minimum considering the circumstances - finally, a horror director who substituted blood and guts for a gripping storyline. The flashback story-telling device worked nicely, it was wonderfully written, and had a fantastic conclusion - one of the best I have seen. I then found Saw II to be a creditable film. It was totally different to the first instalment, and despite being much more violent, was also quite well written. Despite Jigsaw's traps edging towards the realms of total absurdity, the film overall was entertaining - and in these times I think its about as good a sequel as your going to get, especially for a serial killer idea such as this. Despite number 2's merits, I still wish they had just left it after the first one. But due to their ongoing success, they just couldn't let it go.It seems Darren Lynn Bousman is contempt that if he thrusts a load of graphic violence in your face, he doesn't need a good script. Saw III opens with 20 minutes of torture scenes which are quite unnecessary. In the first 2 instalments, references to Jigsaw's previous traps were brief, and made for effective scenes. For the traps in Saw III, the makers have obviously ran out of ideas. They are now ridiculously unfair, and are totally stupid. How rich is Jigsaw? To get all these traps (and places to put them) he must be a multi-millionaire. The writers seem contempt to think about clever traps, and then ignore the plausibility of them. The only problem is - they aren't clever either. Traps now include getting drowned in pig juice. That's all I have to say on the matter.The story contained some pretty stupid things. Despite their constant claiming that Jigsaw has good motives, he now has moved on to torturing innocent people. Most of the people he also targets to torture in this film, is basically for doing their job well. For instance, a homicide detective is targeted because she spends her time trying to figure out how people died - baffling stuff. Also, they try to make us sympathise with Jigsaw, with a scene with his presumably ex-wife. What the hell, the man is a sicko. That's the whole premise of his character. Don't try and make him human. Why must people try and ruin the most wonderful film villains? There are also numerous flashbacks to the previous films, which are just annoying, and proves the writers' have nothing fresh to add to the franchise.To top the film off, they've once again they've gone for a twist ending - but this time they have 2. Saw's ending was superb, and Saw II's was acceptable, but both twists here were totally awful, and made no sense whatsoever.One final criticism. The lighting. Okay, it's not a happy film, but a bit of light here and there wouldn't hurt would it. There is a scene between a ""protagonist"" and his kid in his house, and the place was shrouded in darkness. What the hell, you put the lights on at night-time.I am sad to see that the Saw franchise has been influenced by Hostel it seems. They've taken away all that was good from the first film, and just turned it into a regulation horror flick that anyone could think of. Despite the fact both villains are supposedly dead, yet another sequel is about to be released. Will they ever learn? I would have given this a 4/5 if it wasn't for the dismal ending. Some of it wasn't that bad, although never enjoyable.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Saw 3 mistake? About Jigsaw!,"OK, Jigsaw is known for punishing ""bad"" people and trying to make them ""good"" again, you know what I mean.

"Amazing, Gory, and Perfect","Since 2004, the Saw series has been thrilling horror fans around the globe, and is hailed by many as a new life for a dead genre. The box office intake for each film has increased with each movie made, pleasing not only the fans, but also the film's creators. The movies are all made on a very small budget, which makes their success even more of a delight. After seeing Saw III, I can safely say that this may very well be the best horror trilogy ever created. While Saw IV is already set for a release next Halloween, I'm not sure that they can ever top what happened in the first three movies. Saw III is directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II) and written by the brilliant Leigh Whannel (Adam from Saw, writer of Saw and Saw II) and James Wan (writer and director of Saw).In Saw III, Jigsaw is on his death bed. His cancer is finally about to end him, and he plans for Amanda, his apprentice, to take over once he dies. As a sort of going away present, Jigsaw plans one final game of grand scale. This time around, Lynn, an experienced surgeon, and Jeff, a troubled father, become entangled in Jigsaw's grizzly web of torture and violence; Lynn must keep Jigsaw alive until Jeff finishes his tests.Saw III would be the ideal ending to the Saw franchise, with loads of flashbacks, explanations, nearly perfect closure, and the most gore of any film in recent memory. The gore is really piled on here, with bones snapping, pig carcasses grinding, rib-cages ripped off  it doesn't get any worse than this. But this is, perhaps, what makes these films so great for horror fans. With all of the blood and guts displayed on the screen is a well-played-out story with plenty of twists and turns and interesting characters.The traps are also an important part in any Saw film, and we get plenty of them here, including a twisting, mechanical crucifix crudely titled ""The Rack"", a device that attached to ones ribs that tears them out, and many others which involve chains, shotgun shells, and other such horrors.The film also delves much deeper into the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda, and gives the audience a behind the scenes look at what makes these killers tick. The acting is superb, perhaps the best so far in the series. The writers and directors seem to have learned what the fans really want, and delivered an amazing horror movie that is an instant classic.You'll shield your eyes, you'll look away in disgust, you might even throw up  it really is that nasty. Saw III is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film, which makes it all the better. While Saw II is still my favorite movie of all time, Saw III is definitely on my Top 10. Rating  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Snuff film,"It's been a while since I saw this movie, and I have given it a lot of thought since. I couldn't feel anything but disgust at the end of the movie, and something tells me that is not a good sign for someone who can take a lot without being offended. Some of the teen girls who were there were almost crying, perhaps because they felt they had to endure it, just as I did. Why did I not walk out? Because I expected that there might be a lot of gore in the beginning, and then some twist and a little purpose, but when I wiped the blood from my face, the scrolling credits were on. As someone else mentioned, Jigsaw is not the villain of this movie, the ones who made it are. They made a movie to satisfy a psychotic audience. I feel so ashamed to be counted in this group. I was there, but I wish that I wasn't, because I didn't enjoy it at all. It's a snuff flick, no doubt about that. They abandoned all elements of horror and suspense in exchange for visual gore. Saw 1 was excellent, and Saw 2 was pretty good too. But Saw 3 was just a void trap that took my soul!! This will probably be the last Saw movie too. Maybe they felt that they could cross the line this time, because there wasn't going to be a number 4, and people would rush in anyway, because #1 and #2 were good. Damn it.. don't watch this movie if you still have the chance and still have some human dignity. I'd rather watch terrorists decapitate hostages (although I'd never watch that).",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wraps all three movies up well,"I was intrigued by the release of Saw3, my main hope was that it wasn't a ploy to cash in on the success of the first two films a la Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th etc. Thankfully this isn't the case, if you were a little confused by the second one, this film goes along way to explaining some of the detail behind the first two films as a whole, it also gives more of an insight into Jigsaw's rationale, and a bigger chunk of Amanda's history and her involvement. The trap scenes are up to, if not beyond the standard set in the first two films and trust me if you are squeamish you may find one or two of them hard to watch. Once again there are main characters that the story centres around and plays with the emotion baggage they are laboured with, and it is done to great effect. What I found especially good about this film is the pace of it. It doesn't let up from the opening scenes until the end, it keeps you in suspense and also as with the first two there is the niggling feeling there is one final twist that you may have missed or not expected, does it have one? Well to find out you will have to go and see for yourself, suffice to say, in my humble opinion, if you are a fan of the first two films, you will not be disappointed by this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
3rd time unlucky,"Having watched and loved the first then being slightly let down by no.2 it came as no surprise that the latest installment of the hugely popular Saw franchise is a real stinker! Unfortunately there will be a forth installment but if you watch number 3 until the end credits as I did, then you may ask yourself this question ""where do they go from here?"" Anyway we'll leave that up to the powers that be.As for this one well the less said the better. Jigsaw is back with understudy Amanda and they're up to the usual tricks. Some poor schmuck, or in this case schmucks are going to be made to jump through hoops of torture only to have to jump through even more. As a sign that the producers knew the plot was tissue paper thin the gore factor has been turned up way past 10 to ensure there is plenty of look-away moments.In the end however it's all in vain and after all the blood-splatter and bone breaking we are left with a pretty poor follow up to what was once an original and gripping idea.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie is intense beyond words,"First off, don't see this movie if you haven't seen the first two. Now, this movie is awesome. It has twist after twist in the end. The acting is much better than the first and there is MUCH more gore than the first two. The screenplay, plot, story writing, and script were all intense. Go see it, u wont regret it. This one actually explains a lot about he past two yet not enough. It's obvious there is going to be a Saw 4, but there are no guarantees. The producer just doesn't cease to amaze me. In the first one i was like ""He can't do anything more. We know who hte killer is now!"" the second one i was like ""He can't do anything more, the guys dead!"" and now im like, ""he cant do anything more cuz it's just too hard to top that!""",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I Want To Play A Game...,"...It's called Contrived Horror Movie, which has a contrived horror movie villain, who has a contrived horror movie villain voice and is represented by a contrived horror movie puppet, that engages in contrived horror movie puppet laughter.Can you withstand the torture of sitting through yet another Saw movie? Make your choice....Same crap, different pile. The tag team duo of Jigsaw and his obedient apprentice Amanda, who have way too much time and money on their hands, return in ""Saw III"" to trap, torture and kill more of their hapless victims. This time they've managed to find the time to kidnap a man named Jeff, who recently lost his son in a criminal accident, the perpetrator in the case, a witness in the case, the judge in the case and, oh yeah, Jeff's wife...and daughter too.If you're willing to suspend your disbelief and forget about the chances of Jigsaw and Amanda not getting caught, and you get a thrill out of watching people get trapped, brutally tortured and killed, then ""Saw III"" is your movie.

"Sick movie, don't't watch it","This is the sickest movie I have seen so far. No story really, just makes a person sick. I am out of words to describe its sickness. This movie only shows flashes of scenes rather than showing actual scenes in continuous motion. Even though after being Saw III, they story didn't end after all. I would suggest viewers to see some comedy movie right after watching it. I was sick to the stomach after watching it. Since IMDb requires me to display at least 10 lines of comments to describe the movie's sickness I will utilize that opportunity to do so. The movie starts as usual as you would have seen in other versions of Saw. In this particular sequel every scene tries to clarifies the previous versions. Every victim is lied about the promise of the game, therefore every victim dies.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
I love this film,"I'm going to make this review nice and short. On Friday when Saw III came out, I couldn't help but myself but watch it on the opening day. Having loved the Saw Franchise so far, I knew that I was in for a treat. And oh boy--it was quite a bloody treat. Perhaps,at times, I felt the film was too bloody, but still--it was packed with violence, suspense, great acting (though I wasn't too impressed with Bahar S...could've been better) and a great script with a nice twist at the end, and a nice way of connecting the previous films with reasonable explanations.Acting: 9/10- Tobin is Jigsaw--no one else can play the role. I really admired Shawnee, the girl who played Amanda--she was great. Like I said earlier, Bahar S. didn't really do it for me... she was like on and off... and the guy who played Jeff did a great job.Cinematography- 10/10- I love the way this film was filmed--very professional and nice.Music- I actually noticed the music in this film...it was creepy and upbeat... and i digged the piano part. 8/10 directing: better job directing this one than Saw II--more stylish, more gore, just one casting mistake...everything else= perfect. Bravo 10/10 Script: Apparently, it was written under a week; though, the ending wasn't as twisted as the first two, it was memorable still... cool deaths--very creative 9/10 Gore- 10/10-- this is the goriest film I've ever seen. If there's a gorier film than that, please email me with the title. I'd like to see what beats this film in terms of gore.Would I see this movie again? Yes, in fact, I'm watching it tonight with a bunch of friends on halloween--nice, eh? If I was the filmmaker, what would I change? Cast someone else other than Bahar S.I am waiting for an uncut DVD, and if anyone has a title of a bloodier film--please E-mail me with it.Thank you, H.

Slowly getting worse,"I loved the first Saw (9/10). Saw II (5/10) was quite a disappointment, but honestly, I didn't really expect that much, as I knew they were not going to build upon or go in a new direction with a sequel, and that it would be just a rehash of old ideas. Saw III is pretty much the same as II. Nothing new added, same old territory.Although this one I found was worse that II. Mostly because half of the movie was in flashbacks, which really didn't add anything to the current plot or do much for character development of Jigsaw and his apprentice. It was just filler because the writer/director had such a weak story and didn't know what else to do.Also Charlie Clouser, the composer, created an excellent piece of music at the end of Saw 1, and unfortunately he knows it, because he uses it over and over again in this film. It was great the first time, but, it gets tiring hearing it over and over again.Finally, I also found the quality of acting, writing, directing, also quite shabby, when compared to the other two films. At least though, we did have a strong ending, but again, one that was totally predictable (unlike the great unpredictable ending of Saw 1).",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Genius! But should we expect anything less?,"If you loved the first two movies this third instrument (and hopefully not the last) will not let you down.

Awful,"I liked the first Saw...Saw 2 was not even watchable. This one is a bit better then Saw 2 but still awful.

Granted there are some good gory scenes but they are thrown in parts where the movie is slowing down and I can't help but feel like they were thrown in because the script was so lame they needed to keep people interested. And get ready for 20mins of flashbacks just to make sure the audience knows what is going on.....nice idea but it just gets annoying.

"3 for the gore, but please... no more!!!","In this second sequel to James Wan's inventive 2004 low-budget shocker Saw, an ex-drug addict and a terminally ill psycho once again play sick games on those judged guilty of 'wasting their lives'. After the lamentable Saw 2, which upped the gore content whilst overlooking the need for a credible plot, I expected the makers of this one to go back to the drawing board, but instead they opted to go one step further and deliver the sickest of the series so far and saddle it with the lamest plot possible.This time around, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), assistant to creative killer Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), kidnaps a doctor in order to keep her mentor alive to witness the outcome of one final game. Amanda, who has somehow become a top machinist and designer in between abducting people, has created some really nasty traps this time round, and these provide the film with its raison d'être: to disgust the audience in as many ways as possible.Now I'm no stranger to gory films, and have been known to enjoy some pretty dreadful movies solely on account of their high level of bloodletting, so when I say that I found Saw 3 very tedious despite of its extremely graphic violence, you can take it as gospel that the film sucked big time.Between the unbelievable death scenes, the movie is as dull as ditch-water and very far-fetched, with Jigsaw spouting more drivel about 'giving people a second chance at life' via his sadistic games, whilst Amanda looks on adoringly. This crap is obviously seen as some kind of justification for his evil doings, but when an innocent doctor is threatened with having her head blown off by multiple shotgun cartridges, the sicko's spiel loses its resonance.Packed with the annoying grungy, MTV-style editing that is so over-used in horror movies these days, some really awful acting (particulary from Shawnee Smith), and saddled with the most ridiculous 'twist' ending since M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, Saw 3 is the kind of tiresome bilge that is giving the genre a bad name.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Neither disturbing or puzzling,"Finally saw all the 'Saw' films prior to seeing 'Jigsaw' (as part of my wanting to see as many 2017 films as possible this year, during a quieter and less intensive period). Heard a lot about the films, good and bad, but wanted to see them for myself to know what to expect.The films as an overall series are a very mixed bag. The original 'Saw' had a great premise and while it was problematic it was still pretty good and one of the best in the series. 'Saw II' had its own problems but it was still one of the few follow-ups to be just as good and have what made the first click as well as it did. However, whereas there was the sense that the novelty was still there with 'Saw II', in 'Saw III' it's the opposite, not just gone but almost done to death. It just goes over the top in some elements and forgets what elements were instrumental in the series' appeal.'Saw III' is not unwatchable by all means. Credit is due for providing origins for Jigsaw, one of those characters where his modus operandi, impulse and justification sets him apart from most characters of his type, and his enthusiastic helper. The music score is suitably eerie.Acting-wise, the film is also performed surprisingly quite well, especially a suitably tortured Angus McFadyen and a bone-chilling Tobin Bell, if there is one thing that hasn't lost impact and continued to not do so it's Bell. Donnie Wahlberg continues to show that he is a vast improvement over Cary Elwes, but he doesn't have much to do here.On the other hand, a big problem with 'Saw III' is that it isn't that disturbing or puzzling. There aren't the truly ingenious traps, just as imaginative demises or the devilishly clever twists seen previously (primarily the twist ending of the first). They are instead replaced by rambling exposition, a flashback-within-flashback framework that just confuses the story and the viewer and a distastefully overblown over-reliance on violence and gore. It was just overkill, and actually made the film exhausting and almost unintentionally funny in places.Will admit that the script was not a strength in either of the first two films, but even they weren't this flat or insultingly contrived. At least too they had clever and intriguing moments and were easy to follow, this cannot be said for the script for 'Saw III'. The story is basically a retread that's both overdone and anaemic and has little sense of unease or suspense, the exposition/flashback-heavy structure and the very flawed execution of it hurting it severely. It also multiplies any credibility lapses and ridiculousness of before by a hundred and doesn't really go to anywhere much until the climactic moments, which felt so unresolved it was almost like a cheat.Missed the effectively claustrophobic look of the first 'Saw' and the more elaborate and no less creepy one for the second film. Here the production values just look rushed and amateurish, especially in the editing. Bahar Soomekh does her best as Lynn, though believing her as a surgeon is a bit of a stretch. The direction doesn't seem as assured and the film really could have done with being 15-20 minutes shorter.In conclusion, okay for 'Saw' series completests but neither disturbing or puzzling. 4/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

That's funny....why can't Jigsaw practice forgiveness?,"This third installment in the ""Saw"" series is full of pretentious, self-righteous nonsense that should have you begging for it to just end already. I certainly was.Plot in a Nutshell: A dying serial killer forces a kidnapped doctor to keep him alive long enough to witness the outcome of his latest deadly 'game.'Why I rated it a '3': Some reviews here made much of the idea that this film contains 'thought-provoking themes' and explores 'the philosophical aspect of forgiveness.' They are saying this, I suppose, because part of the plot revolves around Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), a man who has lost his son in a car accident and is unable to forgive the driver. He can't let go of his son and curses the fact that the driver 'got off light.' The serial killer ""Jigsaw"" has come to the conclusion that Jeff has not been grieving properly (yes this is as stupid as it sounds, and don't ask me how Jigsaw knows who Jeff is and how he is grieving) and so Jigsaw has determined that Jeff should endure a series of 'games' that perhaps will teach him how to forgive. As if Jigsaw has any moral standing when it comes to forgiveness! Here is a person who has sent countless people to their grisly deaths because of their perceived sins. Why couldn't Jigsaw forgive any of them, instead of setting them up to die? Hmm? Anyone? And now he's going to preach about forgiveness? Hey Jigsaw, how about practicing what you preach, buddy? Moron. Wow what a stupid plot line. Colossally stupid.Coupled with this is a dreadfully uninteresting concurrent story about Jigsaw on the verge of dying (due to his terminal cancer). A doctor has been kidnapped and been forced to administer to Jigsaw with the challenge of keeping him alive at least until Jeff finishes his game. So the doctor must perform a crude operation with limited tools to get the job done and, if this sounds like it could have been part of a TV hospital drama, you're right. That's not a compliment.As if all of the above isn't bad enough, it gets worse. How's that, you ask? How about if I told you that this film - which is supposed to be a horror film, right? - is in fact, a love story. I am not making this up. Here is a direct quote from the guy who wrote the screenplay, Leigh Wannell: ""It is a love story. It's a love story between Jigsaw and Amanda. Essentially they're like father and daughter."" Oh yeah? That's great. You know, when I'm in the mood for a scary horror film, there's nothing I like better than to have it centered on a good father/daughter love story! Gee, what should I watch tonight? ""Saw III"" or ""Father of the Bride?"" Wow.""Saw III"" has all the markings of a film that was thrown together as quickly as possible to take advantage of the series' popularity. In other words, it's not good. It's not even average. It's bad. There is a scene where one character shoots another and Jigsaw admonishes - in all seriousness - 'you just ruined four lives.' Uh, what? How about all of the people Jigsaw has sent to their deaths in the first three films? How many lives has he ruined as a result of his actions? Does this self-important idiot even listen to himself? This is laughable. The writing here is so poor it's mind-boggling.3/10. Would I watch again (Y/N)?: Never in a million years. Hell no.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
SAW Does it again...,"When I went to see the first of the Saw movies I could not believe the twists and turns that the movie led me through. Not in my wildest dreams did I think the movie would end the way that it did. Saw 2 did the same thing. It kept me on the edge of my seat; I am pretty sure I didn't blink the entire time. Saw 3 did it again, one of the only horror movies that really didn't disappoint me this year. Sure you can say that it is way too gory, and it is the downfall of our civilization to consider it entertainment, etc. Really, one has to appreciate what the kind people at Twisted Pictures have brought us. The Saw franchise has brought the viewer something that I believe no one has ever seen. The blood is only dyed water, and the marks on people are only makeup. As for people reenacting the Saw traps, everyone is so quick to blame the movie and not the person. I think it is funny how that works. No one ever complains about the violence in war or action movies, so why complain about this. I believe this movie to be a real must see for Saw fans, and if you don't like it don't complain.

An OK sequel of a Sequel,"I saw this movie in the theatre at a late night show, and I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I will admit that it had its up and downs, but it was really sketchy.First of all, I am fairly sure that this movie was hard to make, because Saw fans wanted to see more gruesome killings than anything. This was given to them, but at a sacrifice in the plot. This story was very predictable, and it was easy to figure out what was going to happen in the ending. The plot follows two victims, a doctor and a father, who each have their different tasks. They both have their fair share of bloody and disgusting scenes.The plot doesn't explore any of the places it could have, such as deeper into the father's life, but for a horror/thriller movie, I guess it was expected.Secondly, the acting was iffy. The only decent actor was Tobin Bell, who I personally thought was great. The supporting cast(even Shawnee Smith) didn't meet up to the standards of the second movie.However, this movie did tie up some loose ends from the first two movies very well, meaning, the first two movies made a lot more sense. I liked some of the traps (they still could have been better) but the movie just didn't live up to the Saw Series standards.I give this movie a 5/10 (All I can say is they gave it a shot, and nice try)",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

I'm glad it was a free view - how can people pay US$10 to see this kind of trash? I would really like to understand how so many people here can comment that this was great or the best of the three? Did we watch the same movie? It's hard for me to believe that at all. It's also hard to believe that Amazon, er, the IMDb has such a strange way of counting ""lines"" and thus, making me add additional commentary when the simple summary I wrote originally should have sufficed.Don't waste your time on this - read an old Clive Barker book - it'll be a better use of your time.

Saw 3 is way over the top.,"When i first left the movies of SAW two years ago i was shaken. I loved that movie, it wasn't just a normal horror movie with some old guy with a chainsaw chasing after teenagers. It was different, smart with an amazing twist. I felt this way also about SAW 2 but it wasn't as great as SAW 1 but still good. When i saw SAW 3 i can say i was very disappointed and should have been expecting this. All SAW 3 is, is just a repeat of the other movies, a lot of sick games, you discover more behind the characters such as Jigsaw and there is a shocking twist. In my opinion SAW was a smart idea, a killer with the motivation to kill people who don't appreciate life and using their problems to link to their traps/deaths. I believe the makers of SAW should have STOPPED there. SAW 3 is not smart, all it is, is porn. For people who get off others suffering.

Not at all what I expected,"I absolutely loved Saw and Saw II.

Needless to say I have no problem seeing someone being ripped open. I can't say that about Saw III. It made my stomach turn, which I guess, you would say, the movie succeeded in its goal. However, in the past movies, when Jigsaw played his game, he made it possible of a way out. There is no way out.Basically, instead of having a plot, a story, with characters to make the story believable, it's just a movie of a fest of torture. I liked Saw because of the whole ""being ungrateful of your life"" and it has not followed the same paths in the sequel. I was in a big surprise and it wasn't a good one.It was my first movie I walked out on within the first hour, not because it was too gory, but because it was not worth the $15 dollars I paid to watch something that has no plot, no believable characters, and is not anywhere near the original.

Respectable sequel is better than subsequent sequels but not as good as previous films,"The first ""Saw"" film was an excellent grizzly thriller and the first two sequels were surprisingly good even though they were taken over by another director, Darren Lynn Bousman. I think what I liked most about these sequels is that the director was willing to kill off many main characters from the earlier films. This sequel also benefits from James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the writers of the original film, returning to write the film. This time Jigsaw, Tobin Bell, dying in a hospital bed, but with the help of Shawnee Smith is still able to carry out his games, kidnapping a doctor who's son was killed in a hit-and-run accident and putting him through a series of games/choices/situations where he can exact his revenge on those responsible. The first ""Saw"" film was unfairly written off as torture porn, when it's really a terrific suspense thriller that happens to be excruciatingly gory. However, the subsequent sequels, this one included, are the typification of the torture porn genre, which is either a good or bad thing depending upon your feelings of the horror sub genre. As films of this disreputable genre go, ""Saw III"" is nowhere close to being as good as ""Martyrs"" or ""Hostel,"" but is far better than the worst of the genre (i.e. ""Turistas"" or the ""I Spit on Your Grave"" remake). Donnie Wahlberg, Dina Meyer, and Betsy Russell also appear in the film, and composer Charlie Clouser returns to provide another effectively unsettling score.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Impressive modern gorefest,"Before you go see this movie, just realize this is nót the 'thriller with horror-tendencies' like part one was. This movie brings a lot more gore to the screen (flesh is being ripped, ribs are pulled out, arms and legs are twisted) and manages to beat part 2 in terms of sickness, and thus becomes the goriest film of all 3. Is that a bad thing? Not for me.Saw III starts off slow (even though with already a few tortures), but as soon as you see Jigsaw and Amanda again for the first time, you know this movie isn't going to disappoint. This time, the tone is much more put on the tortures itself, rather then the actual murder. And thats one of the things that makes this movie interesting to watch, because it never leaves you bored.My first guess was that part 3 of Saw was going to progress more into the typical cliché psychological horror-thriller thing with stuff you've seen already. But instead the creators aimed more for a more hardcore horror-audience, with obviously more violence and gore, and even a hint towards the horrorclassic Hellraiser. And gore and violence is not the only thing that this movie presents; it also unvolds a clever plot as the story develops towards the end of the movie (like only a movie like Saw can deliver).Even so, it has to be said that you have to be a Saw-fan to fully enjoy this, or at least a fan of the genre. For those who aren't: leave out your lunch before watching this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Barely there.,"This movie hardly met my (relatively low) expectations. It was more gory than the last two, but the violence seemed to be the only thing the movie was about. It seemed to me that they came up with some of the most violent and creative ways to torture/kill someone, and then wrote a storyline around it. The plot was compelling, but somewhat shallow and the ending was (as expected) open-ended. I left the theater irritated and wishing that I had saved my $8.50.The acting was good, though one of the main characters, Amanda, got to be extremely annoying by the end of this film. Jigsaw's character was no different from ""Saw 2"", though by the end he was starting to sound like a broken record with his ""games"" and ""tests"".All in all, it was entertaining to watch (it definitely made me cringe, squirm and freak out), but don't expect something that will blow you away, as it's lacking in most of the elements that make up an all-around good movie. Definitely doesn't have the charm of the original ""Saw"".",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
All I want is just a SCARY movie!,"All I want is a scary movie, don't show me the weird love between the characters. All I want is a scary movie, don't tell me how the freaky killers grew up and find for them so reasonable excuses to kill so many people. Because a lot of stupid movies have done before. like perfume: a story of a murderer. All i want is a scary movie, don't give me a open ending. Don't make the monster never die, we need a strong, quick and bloody hardcore end, like The Hostel. All I want is a scary movie, but not the saw 4. The only reason I give this movie a vote 5 but 4, 'cause it's much better then the saw 2. So, actually, all I want is just a simple scary movie, is it too difficult? All I want...till the 10th line.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The charm is waning,"Sequels are a funny thing (or a tragic thing, depending on who you ask). It seems that the formula for sequels in Hollywood is ""more is more"", not ""less is more"". So with SAW that formula equates sicker traps, sicker games and of course more blood. In that regard, the third movie is a completely logical step.What i liked about this movie is the whole set that they have built. It's a really disgusting warped reality with rotten pigs, disgusting smells (i imagine) and plenty of rooms with sick games. This time two people have been kidnapped for apparent and not so apparent reasons. The formula is basically the same, although the characters are beginning to reach the end of their arc. Amanda is obviously deranged and Jigsaw in worse shape than ever. Also that's one of the things i found quite admirable, that the film-makers were actually able to keep any interest in what was basically rather simple characters to begin with. Sure, Jigsaw had a motivation and an idea, but that didn't exactly make him three-dimensional. But here i find myself actually caring what happens.What i didn't like so much was that the level of disgusting effects and gore has been turned up another notch or two. Most of all i felt it was quite unnecessary. The amount of blood in the first movie was quite enough, the amount in the second movie was pushing it, and here it's excessive. I guess most of the audience (at least the real fans) won't think so though, so i understand why they do it.This is not a bad movie. It's not as entertaining as the first two though. Mostly because the charm of the concept is really beginning to wane. I would say that this should be the last movie in the series, but i know that there is already at least one more film in the making. I doubt that i would watch that one though, to me the SAW-franchise has been milked enough (and then some) after this movie. I rate this 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome,"Wow Saw 3 was GREAT! Since I saw the first one, I had high hopes for Saw 2...and that was great as well. The third, in my opinion, was the best out of the other two. They couldn't have chosen a better team to play Jigsaw and Amanda. Those two worked awesome together. The ending really threw me for a loop. I sure wasn't expecting it at all. I'm such a sucker for scary movies...I LOVE them, but I get all queasy and can't watch half the time. Although I had to turn away a few times during the film, overall it was probably one of the best movies I have seen all year. If you haven't seen it yet, get off the computer and go buy a ticket to the movie! I'm surely going to buy this once it's out on DVD.GREAT movie! Saw 4, anybody?",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I saw Hellraiser too,"By 2006 the now-passe torture porn sub-genre was in full swing. The producers of Saw were enjoying the profits made from cheaply and easily grossing-out morbid audiences with icky gore and people screaming. It's not clever, and it's not even remotely classy.Clocking in at just under two hours, this is the longest of the Saw series, but the constant flashbacks that bloat that running time are already becoming very tiresome and gives the movie the feel of a TV show. Chopping the heavy plot into vignettes is not very theatrical or interesting.With Jigsaw still at large and Donnie Wahlberg's angry cop now missing the cops begin to suspect that Jiggy has an accomplice. This is all forgotten about by the five-minute mark as the movie then sidetracks into a story about a man who has lost his son in a car accident and wishes for retribution. Jiggy arranges for the retribution to happen, but advises him to save the people responsible from gruesome death instead of letting them die.Jiggy's judgement and justification is already becoming dubious and morally suspect by this point. I half expect him to start kidnapping and setting-up people for watching too much Nickelodeon or flying too many kites. The morality should go both ways. If Jiggy is subjecting so many people to unbearable agony then he should have experience and knowledge of much, much more than simply dying of cancer and surviving a car crash. Who does he think he is? Ultimately, he's just as bad as the people he is judging.The story is worthy of a higher score, but as usual it is bogged down by horrendous editing, cheap photography filled with fake filters, a loud sound design filled with nonsensical effects, and characters who do not think logically.It reminded me a lot of Hellraiser, only with none of the magic. Unfortunately, for anyone watching the whole series, it's vital that you digest every minute, overwrought plot point.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The weakest in the series,"I am a big fan of the 'Saw' series and I was naturally anticipating Saw 3. To be perfectly honest, it really was the worst out of the series.The horror and gore is on top form and the various traps that a fluent in the movie are inventive but my problem with this film is that it is TOO relentless and I don't remember a single character surviving (even though there was many chances for a few of them to live through the story) it kin of got repetitive because I knew that EVERYONE was going to die.My other problem is the painfully irritating main character who seems to take forever to make up his mind on whether to forgive the people 'responsible' for his sons accidental death, then just as he decides the good option, they end up dead! That really annoyed me.With a franchise like this, you have to tread very carefully that the story doesn't dwindle and fizzle out and I thought the series was dying out with this movie because it didn't offer us anything new or anything to care about. The only difference is we find out a few twists at the end but wasn't enough for me.Don't be disappointed however, as Saw 4 was much, much better.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Eh,"Saw III, the 3rd out of 7 Saw movies. This movie is pretty good, but not that good either. I mean, the traps and 2nd storyline are good, but most of the movie is bad.

Here is what the movie is like, First Scene- Oh my gosh! 2nd Scene- I'm bored. 3rd Scene- Oh my gosh! 4th Scene- I'm bored! 5th Scene- Oh my gosh! Next Few Scenes- I'm bored! Ending- Oh my gosh! The movie is a boring movie, but it still should be a little enjoyable. The twist ending is pretty big, but not that special. Also, be warned, the movie is the bloodiest movie of the series.

"Better than both Saw 1 and 2, but...","During the time I was watching this movie, I was fidgeting in my seat almost the whole time.Because it was scary? No. Because of the five billion ways of torture that is visualized. Not really.To me, Saw has become a series that walks back and forth in its own footsteps; trying so desperately to shock that it fails. This time it's ten times the gore and ten times the pain and somehow I feel that it overshadows the good part of this movie - the parts that makes it a bit different from the other two.The movie starts with the usual ""hey ho, Jigsaw's killing again"" where different kinds of funky ways to kill a person are displayed. This is basically just a gore fest which doesn't bring anything to the movie except for being simply that. Gore.This time, Jigsaw (with help from Amanda) kidnaps a nurse, who is meant to help him survive while he's helping some other poor, lost soul finding meaning in life. Truth is, I enjoyed watching the conversation between the three of them far more than the actual process of the game. Most of the time I was simply wishing for the movie to speed up a little because watching a man deciding what he should do for several minutes is hardly entertaining; at least not in this kind of movie.I won't say it's all bad. In fact, it's better than both the first and second one. Why? First of all it has character development. An important element which was slightly forgotten in Saw 1 and, mainly, Saw 2. Secondly, the plot is better. People's reasons for doing certain things are more logical and they put in a couple of unexpected twists which makes it a whole lot more interesting. The third reason is that the actors are better. Saw 2 was, in my opinion, a disaster in that area and thankfully they seemed to pick their actors more wisely this time.Despite all the efforts to make the characters human, this movie bored me. Most of the time it felt like nothing really happened, despite the makes of the movie actually moving the concept up a notch.The problem with Saw is that the unexpected becomes expected and when a movie depends upon it as much as this movie does, it just ends up being boring and predictable.But if you can get through the first 20 minutes of utter blah, you have an interesting movie that, unfortunately, is slightly ruined by the fact that it is too similar to the older, less good, ones.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Glorification of Death,"It is perfectly understandable for the creators of Saw to incorporate this series into a franchise, focused on generating dollars at the expense of the quality of the product. What started out as innovative and genuine story telling, has deteriorated into the pool of bland horror flicks which it had distanced itself once before, and will only get worse the more they continue to generate (e.g. Hellraiser, Halloween and Friday the 13th).Let us look past the fact that there was great anticipation preceding the release of this film. I'm sure that I'm not the only one that believed that this would be the end-all-be-all conclusion to the series and thus deliver the hardest punch to the cinematic world. To look at this film for what it is, it is just another horror flick sequel.Despite the good acting, they could not overcome the bland script. What once were cruel but ingenious lessons on the value of human life, have now become exhibitions in death. There attempt to go out with a bang was a dud.The first movie was great. The second one stepped it up like very few sequels can accomplish. The third installment took away everything that made the series stand out.Good, but not as good as it could have been.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just Plain Out Awesome!!!! One of My Favorites of ALL TIME!!!,"OK, let me start by saying that this is without a doubt the best ""Saw"" movie of the three, and possibly one of my favorite movies of all time!!! There's just SOOO much to love about it: the great acting (especially Tobin Bell, who chills you to the bone), the relentless pacing, the crazy traps, the magnificent story (yes, story in a horror movie), and the gruesome gore! Hell, we even get a shot of boobs. Nice!*Mild Spoilers*We get some good characters back from the previous two movies, like Donnie Wahlberg as Matthews and Leigh Whannell as Adam. It shows a lot more of what was done to Adam and what ended up happening with Detective Matthews. THERE IS NO DR. GORDON IN THIS MOVIE! I personally wish there would have been, but the simple fact is that he is not in this movie, so let let all the asshole low-lives on the board fool you with those COMPLETELY FAKE endings they're making up. But anyways, this movie is just an all-out blast. The only thing I'm missing is the big twist that we've some to expect with the ""Saw"" movies, although I have absolutely no problems with the ending and thought it was very strong. if I remember correctly, the total body count is about 10, including Adam, although we already knew he was dead, it just showed us exactly how it happened.Bottom Line:Saw 3 is a relentless, gruesome helluva ride that never cuts away, even when bones are snapping and ribs are being ripped out. It's anchored by great performances all around and by-far the best Jigsaw traps we've seen. It's the most gruesome, sadistic, smart, disturbing, and entertaining in the Saw trilogy and possibly my favorite movie ever.

Nothing lasts forever I guess...,"Well I guess it was bound to happen eventually...I wasn't expecting the decline to be this damn fast, but here we are with Saw III, and it's a load of rubbish. The acting's still pretty good (with a few notable exceptions), and I guess the traps are still creative, but everything else going on here is just...I mean, you're reading the thoughts of a guy who thought Saw II wasn't too ridiculous to enjoy, and I'm the person telling you that this one is utterly pants on head preposterous.But before we get into that, I'm gonna take a moment to say that I don't know if it's just not clever at this point in the series, or if it's actually worse than it was in the first two films, but the series' trademark hyperfast zoom in/quick cut editing is seriously starting to piss me off at this point. It was pretty clever and unique in the first one, tolerable in the second, but now it's just a pain in the neck.The dialogue has gotten pretty ridiculous too, with some cringey lines, and some lines that mean nothing but pretty desperately want to, and pretty much every character that isn't Jigsaw is a total dumbass. Then again, everyone in this film would look dumb next to this omniscient deity. Speaking of, spoilers lie beyond, cause I need to talk about how dumb this is.*Spoilers ahead*So Jigsaw kidnaps a guy whose life has been consumed by thoughts of vengeance against the people he blames for killing his son, and he is the guy who will be put through the funhouse of the hour. Nothing about this is anywhere near as clever as the first, or even the second film, which actually had another fairly clever and meaningful twist in my opinion, and a pretty interesting group dynamic to boot.None of that is here, it's just one guy going through the traps that have more obvious and markedly less painful solutions than ever before, and by the end, we find out that Jigsaw (deep breath):knew that his wife was cheating on him
knew that she was a brain surgeon, so in addition to making the game more interesting for the protagonist, she could help Jigsaw's brain cancer while the game played out
knew that everyone the protagonist was supposed to save would actually die, giving him no help at the end
knew that Amanda was building inescapable traps behind his back and decided to get rid of her by having the protagonist kill her, and gave him the motivation to by having Amanda kill his wife, which he knew she would do out of very stupid jealousy
knew that the protagonist would learn nothing, and as such also kidnapped his daughter as one last screw you for when the protagonist killed himLook, you get the idea. This film is utterly bonkers, and even when it's not being stupid, it's either being boring with some surgical drama scenes in Jigsaw's lab, or it's wasting considerable amounts of time by showing things that Jigsaw and Amanda have done before behind the scenes of the two previous films and god almighty they had no way to take this series in any better direction than this?*Spoilers end*In the end, well...it's what I said earlier. Absolutely bloody bonkers, and also really, really bad. And I'm certainly not expecting the series to get better again after this point.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

Experience were not as memorable as SAW II,"In my mind the title ""SAW"" itself used to suggest the most astounding horrorific cinematic experience you could imagine from a horror and gory movie.

The pace of the story itself has deteoriates; where in SAW II the story progressed really fast and many things happened with multitude characters - SAW III is rather slow, unconvincing and sometimes offer chessy and lacking of solid story line and suspense.Some gory scenes and tortures may moved my butt to the edge of my seat - but other than that, the story itself and the movie did not move me at all.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Suffering? You haven't seen anything yet...,"Director Darren Lynn Bousman and writer Leigh Whannel were not 100 percent on board with doing another Saw sequel despite the first two films performing fairly well. But, writer James Wan was able to convince them to do another film. So, in continuing the tradition of releasing a new Saw film every year around Halloween time, Saw III saw it's release in 2006. We see Darren Lynn Bousman return to direct and the film stars Shawnee Smith, Bahar Soomekh, Angus Macfadyen, Tobin Bell, and Dina Meyer. The film performed well financially and it did what it needed critically at the time. Now these days, it is mostly put in the middle in terms of series rankings.John Kramer aka Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is literally on his death bed. But he has one last test. He, along with his apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith), capture a nurse (Bahar Soomekh) who is tasked with keeping Jigsaw alive while a man named Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) goes through a series of tests.I am a fan of the first two Saw films. They have clever writing and twists without the film's more gorier scenes being of the torture porn nature. Saw III is the beginning of this venture into the torture porn genre. Yes, this film is rather gory and to be fair it gets gorier as the series goes on. Well, I need to praise the film where it is necessary and I can say that the special effects look fairly good. The acting is not terrible, this time we have a focus of main characters and luckily the characters are performed by competent actors. Since that focus does not break away too much, we don't get to see poor performances of lesser characters which, if plenty in numbers, can be a tad bit annoying (as is the case in Saw II). Our main characters are a mix of old and new. We have the old characters in Jigsaw and Amanda. Then we have the new characters in Jeff and the nurse lady, Lynn. Tobin Bell does a fairly good job in his role (though I prefer his role in Saw II). Also, it is kind of weird seeing Tobin Bell/Jigsaw/John Kramer look so sick. Like it is very unsettling. Now I do not have much to say about Amanda or Lynn but I got a bone to pick with our main antagonist Jeff. Most of my negativity circles around Jeff. Jeff as a character is an alcoholic who had a son get killed and he is fueled by anger and wants revenge of sorts. We get some truly emotional scenes at times surrounding Jeff (and a few outside of that) which is what Leigh Whannel was apparently going for here. Jeff's plot revolves around forgiving those directly or more so indirectly involved with his son's death. Essentially he gets to decide to forgive or not to. For me, this might work thematically if he should decide to let them die but morally, it is wrong for me and especially in such a gruesome manner. Also the game itself is not very clever because it could end up setting up Jeff for failure. Especially because he is so slow. He is the worst. His slowness really drags the film on. Let me just note that this film is about two hours long and with slow Jeff, it really makes for a gruesome two hours of watching an inept subject fumble his way through his tests. Personally, I think had the film focused more on characters that were present in the previous film like it starts off like, it would be fine to watch all around. But, we have to wait till the next film to see our main character as someone we have seen previously. Saw III is the start of a new breed of Saw films. The ones that like to go back and explain the setup of events in the past movies, which in some cases loses the tension already in those scenes. The film then likes to setup for anything to happen in the next few films but you won't know that until you watch the rest of the sequels. Saw III still retains the flashy editing that is ever so present in this franchise. I should also note that this is the first Saw film to have any nudity as well.Saw III is not as clever as the previous two films. It ends up being gorier than the two sequels and gives us a glimpse as to what will eventually become the rest of the Saw franchise.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Jigsaw's Health Issues are not as Interesting as His Games.,"Saw 3 is a step down from the first two. It also doesn't work well as a stand alone movie. Given all the flashbacks to the previous two stories, this movie won't be as interesting unless you've seen those. Rather than the focus being on the games and the characters trying to escape those situations, this movie focuses more on Jigsaw and his failing health. It's simply not as interesting as the games. This movie feels too long. It's choppy in filming style, with all the flash-frames and whip-pans, and choppy in story with all the jumping around between past and present and one character to the next.

It definitely lives up to the standard of the Saw series in that factor, but the plot of this movie is what really amazes you. To create a movie like this requires a great imagination and Wahn and Leigh should be well credited. The direction was good too. Bousman allows you to have emotion for the characters in this film. You begin to have sympathy for some of the characters. The fact that a movie from the horror genre can achieve that is very admirable.This movie is by far the best in the Saw series.

"Pork, the other white meat","Greetings again from the darkness. Third in the Saw series developed by James Wan, this one is significantly better than the second, but falls short of the first, due mostly to the lack of freshness. Three is (as Two was)directed by Darren Lynn Bousman who benefits from a much more complex script and less complicated gadgets and contraptions.This story centers around Jigsaw (the eerily great Tobin Bell) playing one of his infamous games with a brilliant, yet detached doctor (played well by Bahan Soomekh) who is charged with keeping Jigsaw alive during his last test(s) on his protégé Amanda (played horribly in her third turn by Shawnee Smith). The twists are minimal in this story, but as opposed to Saw II, the twists and turns make sense.Be prepared for even more gore than the first two, but again we have no character that we really care about or pull for. Amanda may be one of the least sympathetic film characters ever. The flashback scenes are not very effective ... the exception being Donnie Wahlberg and his poor foot. As always, the best scenes include Tobin Bell and his lessons of life for the misguided souls who end up on the wrong end of his ""fair"" tests.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely the BEST Saw.... so far?,"I went into the cinema with a hopeful but open mind. In my eyes, Saw was good but not brilliant, if the acting and direction had been better, it would have been an awesome movie... Saw 2 was not as good as the first, but still had it's moments... Saw 3 TOTALLY blows the first two out of the water! The irony (well, sort of) is that without the first 2, the third would make no sense (well, duhhhhh). Very rarely do sequels out-do the original, but Saw 3 kicks arse! Once again, the acting isn't brilliant, but it delivers a much darker and wicked movie. I only wish the first two had been made this way. It was indeed a very clever formula that made for an enjoyable, if at times cringeworthy (i mean the torture scenes and booby traps) 90 or so minutes. I loved it being a big horror fan, go see it....

The Review: Saw III,"Here we go again: Jigsaw is back, does more torture.....and bores us to death with it.Dull story meets an even duller twist that was less a twist, but more a side note.The first was good, but that's where it should of ended. Now, we have sequels and rip-offs (not to mention a horrible new genre of horror)that do nothing but suffocate theaters with crap in place for real film.This heap of sh*t can go right back up the dog's ass it came from.Rating: * (of 4)Entertainment: negative ***** (of 5)",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing Movie,"I went to see this movie earlier today, and I knew it was going to be good from start to end. Some cool traps, and I couldn't even look at two of them. The story is great, and twists just keep on coming.This is definitely the best of the three, because it ends a great trilogy, which you don't see very often. The acting was very well done, and a lot better than the previous films.Tobin Bell manages to capture the role of Jigsaw perfectly yet again.Shawnee Smith seems a little more evil in this film, especially with some of the stuff that she reveals to Jigsaw at the end.Go see this movie if you haven't already. It is well worth the money.I will definitely buy this movie on DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fixes plot holes and questions and is quite gory,"Man I love Saw. But Saw II was only good. Saw III just OK. All this movie really does is answer all the questions, plot holes or complaints people had on the first two Saws. With that being said it was also quite bloody. The story was pretty good but very predictable. With the first two Saws, I did not predict the ending (especially the first SAW.Such questions that are answered are - How did Jigsaw lay on the ground so long without moving? - What happened to Adam? - When did Amanda meet with Jigsaw?

"If you can take the gore, its excellent","I did not come into this movie with any expectations whatsoever. If it was a bad third installment, well, we're getting used to them (Final Destination 3, Santa Clause 3). Well, this is one of the better endings to a trilogy.In this sophomore sequel to 2005's Saw II, John Kramer aka Jigsaw is sick and near death. He is terminally ill, but apparently refuses to accept the fact. To keep him alive, Jigsaw and his protégé, Amanda, kidnap Dina, an anti-depressant-taking doctor in a crumbling marriage. Dina is forced to ""play a game"" to keep Jigsaw alive. As long as Jigsaw stays alive, so does she.Angus MacFayden gives a magnificent performance as Jeff, a father who feels that he failed his family when his son was struck and killed by a drunk driver. He is also kidnapped by Jigsaw and put through a series of tests. At the end, Jigsaw promises that he will meet his son's murderer. Jigsaw's tests are about Jeff's morality and forgiveness.With extra gory scenes of torture and decapitation, the third installment in the Saw series is by far the most graphic, but also the greatest. I was told that it had lack of surprise. This may be true, but the movie makes up for the lack of surprise with a surplus of suspense. It will keep you going until the end.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Even more gruesome horror.,"This is the second sequel to the gruesome horror movie Saw, where Dr. Lynn Denlon is kidnapped and locked in a room with the cancer-ridden Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda. The doctor is forced to keep Jigsaw alive so that he could see another one of his game victims, Jeff, complete his deadly game.The story uses the same elements as in the previous two films: mind-playing games, revenge, and people in despair. There is no shortage of blood, gore and graphic scenes, which make this more of a gory rather than a scary horror film. Like the previous movies, this sequel is very disturbing - just the bloody intro will give you an impression where this sadistic film will take you.The acting was pretty good, but the rest of the movie's elements is just dark and depressing. I'm sure most, even some horror movie fans, don't find downright sadistic and gross plot elements captivating.Grade D-",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty bad but not as bad as expected,"After being very disappointed of SAW II I expected another lame movie. Well, with this one the movie makers really tried. But somehow I couldn't get excited for it. Many of the strange things in the movies are getting clear at the end of it, so I won't complain about them though I didn't like the way the policewoman was treated. What I missed was suspense, was psychological pressure on the people. Despair, anger, being really horrified. The people killed in this movie...they had almost no personality, none of them. That's what I don't like about this one, that's what I didn't like in movies like Hostel. You don't feel anything about the people because you don't know them or you don't like them. It doesn't matter to you if they are tortured to death or not. You maybe think: ""Okay, THAT was rude"" but nothing more. The family father in SAW III, he was chosen because he was so sad about the death of his little 8years old son. Really? Come on, what the hell?! Is that a crime? This is pretty far-catched. The conclusion at the end of it was unfortunately not so surprisingly and so well prepared like in SAW I. How could it?, it was just part 3. But somehow I had the feeling that the people working on the movie really tried to make an exciting movie. But in some way, I think, it was more or less boring, the more I think about it. So, 3 stars is okay. It was bad, the story wasn't too good, but it wasn't as bad part 2, which was a relief. See it once and then forget about it.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Spoiler - Saw III, IV & V","Hey, I happen to be a close acquaintance with director and writer Darren Lynn Bousman and would like to clear a few things up about the 3rd film Saw.First off I don't know how much of you remember in which order scenes in the film took place but the tape which John (Jigsaw) pours hot wax onto occurs as Amanda informs him that Jeff has got past the 3rd test. Darren has plans to go into more detail about this in the fourth film, of course he isn't the soul writer but tells me that saw 3 has been made with an intention for a fourth and has been left with a lot of options to refer back to all three films.I don't won't to ruin the fourth film for everyone so I won't go into much detail. In the fourth film you will get to hear what's on the tape, containing some very interesting info on Dr Gordon from saw 1. slightly bigger spoiler coming up so you've been warned...As far as I have been told in the fourth Dr Gordon will be back and will be set as a prequel to saw 2 and 3. (a sub sequel to saw 1) Gordon will be involved in another one of saws games, working for saw NOT out of free will.That is all I can think of for now, that and that there is plans for saw V to be set before, during and after the story of saw 3.

The worst from the series,"I remember two years ago,when I watched ''Saw'' from the first time...What a wonderful experience.The best cop film ever.A compelling drama,which unlike most of today's films,shocked you with it's plot,instead of it's violence.And a revelation was made in the end that left me with my mouth wide-open,looking at the screen even when the credits were playing. One year later,''Saw 2'' came out.Very good film,but I was disappointed.Although the plot still grabbed you tight,the direction was still cool as hell,and Jigsaw's philosophies were more researched(along with his past),the problems were that you had a(boring) main character who always did wrong choices,even during the game,and other characters for whom you never really learner much about,concluding with a very obvious revelation,which was anything by surprising.Still,very good film. So,when I saw the teaser for the third installment,I was curious to see what's going to happen.However,the teaser grew in me a ''fear'' that the third will be all about gore,something that unfortunately has been confirmed... I was greatly disappointed by this film.The amazing plot and emotionality of the first two films have been replaced by useless and over-the-top sick images and violence,which are too sick even for the Saw franchise(the first film never really got after that 'too sick and violent thing' that much-neither did the second film). The revelation is very much expected for a viewer who keeps guessing possible endings during the film,but although the revelation here is more surprising then the one in the previous film,the big problem is that this revelation is completely uninteresting and boring.It's like the ''revelation'' for Zep in the first film:Only there you just knew that was a fake ending,so you enjoyed that misdirection from the makers.Here,while I was waiting the true ending after the revelation,when the end credits rolled I discovered that was it... On the plus side:Really cool music by Charlie Clouser,good direction by Bousman,nice points in the story about revenge and forgiving,some interesting flashbacks about Jigsaw's and Amanda's history and work,great performances by all the main cast members.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""I'm human. I'm human just like your son was.""","And there was me thinking he'd probably be a labrador, or a small goat. It's bad dialogue, though surprisingly it's not the worst offering in this tired, repellent sequel.I was shocked to discover that the writing team is exactly the same as it always was through all three movies, meaning that the same hands that were behind the inspired and original Saw are responsible for this repugnant dross. As Darren Lynn Bousman was behind the first sequel - which was also inferior, though nowhere near as bad as this - then it's possible that it's his direction that kills it. Certainly he's not able to get a decent performance out of Angus Macfadyen, or give us characters to care about. His obnoxious jump cut cinematography only serve to distance the viewer from what's going on in the fiction of the piece.Whereas once Saw was about the inventiveness of the situation, here it's just about the grotesqueness of the mutilation. Borderline misogynist at times, there are even traps with no escape, just a high level of blood count. The news that a fourth film with Bousman but with new writers is in pre-production is sad news indeed. The original Saw was a striking movie, but sadly the $ talks, and more of these will continue to be made, to ever decreasing returns...",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disjointed Jigsaw,"If it's been awhile, you need to review the events of ""Saw II"" (2005) before starting on this one. This will help explain the prologue, which is really only a tidying up of a teased sequel starring Donnie Wahlberg (as Eric Matthews) that does not really happen here. Next, ""Jigsaw has disappeared. Along with his new apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith), the puppet-master behind the cruel, intricate games that have terrified a community and baffled police has once again eluded capture and vanished. While city detectives scramble to locate him, Doctor Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh) and Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) are unaware that they are about to become the latest pawns on his vicious chessboard,"" according to the home video sleeve scriber...This ""Saw"" does not have the earlier films' structure. We begin with a series of violent torture sequences that seem to have no connection. The do become connected, but after you care. As usual for the series, the gore is (or should be considered) X-rated. The story would have worked better if one suspenseful story strand had framed the film and provided a foundation, with the rest providing pieces to the overall puzzle. It would have been interesting if the contest between Tobin Bell (as John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer) and Ms. Soomekh provided the foundational story, with Mr. Macfadyen's quest leading up to the climax and final revelations.***** Saw III (10/26/06) Darren Lynn Bousman ~ Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Angus Macfadyen, Bahar Soomekh",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
3rd installment  the natural progression and the best in the series,"i'm not sure where to begin with this,the 3rd installment in the Saw franchise.i guess i'll start with the gore.this film is much gorier and graphic than the first 2.However,it is not gratuitous.it all fits with the story and is essential to the movie.however,there is one sequence which i found stomach churning,which had nothing to do with gore or violence.it's just a sick scene,which really wasn't necessary and i could have done without.for me,this actually lowers the rating of the movie slightly.there is some nudity in this one,and i don't recall the 1st two having any.the traps are more complex in this film,as is the storyline.that is to be expected at this point in the series.while the first film had a rough unpolished feel, as did the 2nd to a lesser extent,this 3rd film is almost slick in its texture,but that doesn't detract from the quality of the film.for me,it is a natural progression for the series.Saw 2 being the best of the franchise to this point,set the bar high and although it's close,i think overall this 3rd film sets a new standard,not just for the series but for the genre.it has more of an emotional impact than the 1st 2 films,and that is no small praise.i give Saw III a 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A sequel to one great film the second not as great and the third and I hope final film which as sequels go isn't too bad!,"Both me and my Fiancé went to see Saw 3 tonight and I felt like walking out after 10 minutes if not less! Don't get me wrong I know it's just a film but it just goes beyond the extreme in terms of gore. I like to watch a film and let my imagination do the rest but this way too graphical. I watched quite a lot of the film looking through my fingers and at some points I had to close my eyes and cover my ears. I know I might sound mellow dramatic as ""It's Just a film"" as my partner says but it's just the concept of it. Other people had to look away as well so needless to say it's definitely got the realism factor.So apart from the fact that it is very gory and a couple walked out 10 minutes before the end, the sound and visual effects and acting were very good. If you enjoy these type of films and don't take them too seriously like me then I'd recommend. Also because I couldn't overlook the sick factor I didn't pay as much attention to the story which is a shame really because it had the scope of being an excellent film like the first one.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
don't really care about Jeff,Jigsaw victim Troy had to rip out the chains implanted to his skin to escape a bomb but he fails. A SWAT team breaks into the devastated room. Detectives Mark Hoffman and Allison Kerry continue their investigation and haunted by the missing Detective Eric Matthews. Kerry is kidnapped and set up in her own Jigsaw trap. She's too slow killing her. Troubled ER doctor Lynn Denlon is abducted by Jigsaw apprentice Amanda Young to treat her master John Kramer suffering from brain cancer. Lynn is fitted with an explosive collar to be released if John is still alive after finishing with his present victim Jeff. Jeff is obsessed with avenging his son's death by a drunk driver.The start is fine. I like taking Kerry as the next victim. I also understand the temptation to surprise kill her. However it would be much more compelling to switch Jeff with Kerry. I don't care about Jeff or Lynn. I don't care about Jeff's story. Jeff's flashbacks are boring. The body horror is still there but it doesn't have the shock anymore. This is not scary. Amanda is back and that's good. The ending is disappointing because it doesn't take the natural successor. This franchise insists on killing my favorite characters instead of continuing the series with them.,5.0,Anonymous,Horror

The whole story is extremely clever and it makes saw 1 and 2 look like Disney films. I can't wait for saw 4 hopefully they will make it better than this film which at the moment i think is impossible!

This should b 2,"The best compliment I can pay to this movie has already been said but I think I'll give my 10 cents worth. Saw 3 takes you mentally back to the atmosphere of Saw.

Which could never beat 1 but is pretty good. So its a shame that we now have to bid adjour to the Saw trilogy but please don't try to add onto 3. Unless you do a Prequel which is the rave right now!

spoilers...,"For all you people that ""loved"" Saw 3...all I have to say is COME ON. This movie was bad. I didn't like the 1st one, but it was tolerable. the Second one I did like because of character development and the twist at the end made sense.so OK, if you saw saw 3 (haha) heres some things that I thought gave it a 4.. warning spoilers 1) No guy that your cheating on your husband with would ever say ""I want a divorce"" the writer only added that to trick us, so its shoved down our throat that they are married 2) When the judge gets shot by the shotgun, he had to be standing in the exact right spot.. if he was standing 2 inches to the left or by the door or something, I am pretty sure the end would have been ten times different as he would have helped angus mcfadden.3) The dialogue was extremely lame, come on (you died inside and your a shell of a man) thats so cliché.4) The ""Apprentice to jigsaw"" actress was terrible, I didn't know what she was trying to be and she would always make her eyes really wide.5) SPOILER: Jigsaw tells Angus McFadden to exact a pound of flesh any way he choses, Jigsaw has killed lots of people so lets just cut him on the neck.. no torture.. (I mean they had to end the movie right? it was getting long).6) There were lame scenes that were added to move the story along but in retrospect served no purpose. Like when Jigsaw thinks of his lover or when the detective got her ribcage ripped out. Lets not forget Donnie Walberg, who had potential to be something great in this movie.. but I guess he walked off the set so they just mentioned what happened to him. If you show an actor... show what happens to him. If he walks off the set and cant finish what he started...please edit his scenes out.7) The last tape recorder about his daughter being captured was rushed and out of place.I am not some fat guy with a pony tail ranting about a movie cause I have nothing better to do (or maybe I am, what does it matter?) but when I saw the 7 out of 10, i didn't want people to get tricked like I did.I guess the only real plot twist was that this movie was made by music video directors and not a Hollywood movie crew.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent Addition to a Bloody Fun Trilogy,"Ahh...the sweet taste of blood. That metal taste that you just want to spit out. Luckily, the third installment of the SAW movies, is worthy enough to not be spit out. Although, there is plenty of blood to taste.The movie is, in my opinion, not as good as the previous two, but still is a good time. The new characters are interesting and seem real, as does Amanda as Jigsaw's new 'apprentice.' She really works it. The writers delivered yet again an exciting, layered script with other story lines and twists. Awesome.The sad part is that the movie is longer than the first two and it is really noticeable. It doesn't drag a lot but it just doesn't have enough entertainment to fill up that time slot completely to my satisfaction.It is a good movie, though.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The second best in the Saw series.......which is not saying much,"I find the Saw series very overrated. The first was watchable and something a bit different. The second was the biggest piece of s$#t sequel in recent years. So I went to see this with low expectations and was actually surprised that they did something very different.Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is dying. That's not to say he still isn't devising traps. Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) is put through a series of tests. He is wandering through different rooms where he meets different people involved with his son's deaths. He needs to save these people from various traps. Meanwhile Lynn (Bahar Soomekh) needs to keep Jigsaw alive, or the device strapped to her head will explode.....There is much more character development in this one than in the others. I cared for the victims and there was a lot of insight into John and Amanda's characters. The acting was actually good in this one and the special effects were top-notch. That said, there were a few things that really bugged me about his movie. One major problem was the editing. Like all the other Saws, the editing is quick and flashy and it's very irritating, as is the music. Also, this movie relied way too much on sadistic gore to scare the audience. It gets quite boring after awhile, rendering the movie absolutely scare free.2/5",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
