"For Val, a role of a lifetime","I wont review the film here as it has all been said before. I did want to praise Val Kilmer's portrayal of ""Doc"" Holiday. Throughout the entire film, his acting and character embellishments are so nuanced and well done that by movies end, we feel his loss in a very personal way. Credit must also go out the the costumers and make-up artists for their contribution to the overall effect of his role. All the way through the film, he looks sickly, pale and world-weary. His mannerisms and intensity of gaze profoundly establish this character as a focal point in this production. But as for what I started this off with, I consider this role as probably the very best for Val Kilmer. It required subtlety and careful restraint and made the viewer believe that we weren't watching an actor merely regurgitating lines and hitting their foot-marks. I, for one, was entranced by the carefully studied body language and facial expressions...the sweaty desperation of a man who sensed his own mortality but strove to enact his own justice for justices sake. This was just very well done!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Val Kilmer steals the show,"Tombstone, Arizona is a boom town from silver and is hounded by an organized gang called the Cowboys. It is led by Curly Bill Brocius (Powers Boothe). Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) is a cold-hearted killer. After success in Dodge City, Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) moves to Tombstone to find riches and a more simple life. He is joined by his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott), Morgan (Bill Paxton), and close friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer). Despite having his wife Mattie there, he becomes infatuated with actress Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany). The Earps get into confrontations with the Cowboys which eventually leads to the shoot-out at the OK Corral.There are a lot of good actors as both good guys and bad guys. Kurt Russell may not be the most impressive of the lot but he does a solid job. Val Kilmer is really hamming it up. He steals the movie with his memorable performance. Other than him, this is a straight western without much comedy. It's not camp. If there is any problem, it's that the movie is too ambitious. There are a lot of characters. It tries to be grand. It's quite a western. It's slightly better than the even longer Lawrence Kasdan's Wyatt Earp which came out 6 months later.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Terrific Homage to Classic Westerns!,"TOMBSTONE, one of two epic westerns about Wyatt Earp released within a few months of each other (1993-94) lacks the lyrical, 'warts-and-all' quality of Kevin Costner's WYATT EARP, but is a more successful film, with tighter pacing, more clearly drawn characters, and a reverence to the genre that has made it the most popular Western of the last twenty years.From the opening scene, narrated by the legendary Robert Mitchum, a nod to the great Hollywood Westerns of the past is evident; a gang of outlaws calling themselves 'The Cowboys' break up a Mexican wedding in a small town, ruthlessly killing nearly all the men, including village priest Pedro Armendáriz Jr. (son of the legendary Western actor), in a scene reminiscent of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. Led by two of Hollywood's flashiest character actors, swaggering Powers Boothe, and coldly psychotic Michael Biehn (playing Johnny Ringo), the presence of such pure evil sets the stage for the Earps' arrival in Tombstone.A powerful cast is essential for a great Western, and you couldn't find a better group of actors as the Earp brothers; Kurt Russell, chiseled, squinty-eyed, and razor-thin, is an ideal Wyatt; Sam Elliott, one of Hollywood's best Western actors, plays Virgil with a growl but a twinkle in his eye; and Bill Paxton, soon to achieve stardom in APOLLO 13 and TWISTER, makes a terrific Morgan. Then there is Val Kilmer, as Doc Holliday...While Dennis Quaid, in WYATT EARP, gave the most realistic portrayal of the dying dentist-turned-gambler/gunfighter ever recorded on film (he was superb), Kilmer, relying on bloodshot eyes, an ambiguous sexuality, and a Brando-esque line delivery, literally steals TOMBSTONE, and has become the 'Doc' everyone remembers. He is so charismatic that you nearly forget that the Earps are the focus of the story! Watch for his early scene confronting a shotgun-wielding (and chubby!) Billy Bob Thornton (three years before SLING BLADE), out to kill Wyatt, and you'll see my point.The events leading up to the famous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral are clearly and decisively presented, from Wyatt's first meeting with future wife Josie (Dana Delany), to the murder of Tombstone's Marshal (Harry Carey, Jr., son of another legendary Western star, and a staple of many John Ford films), which leads to Virgil taking the badge and making his brothers (in Wyatt's case, reluctantly) deputies, to the friction with Ike Clanton (GODS AND GENERALS' Stephen Lang) that explodes into the short but bloody shootout that became legendary.Where TOMBSTONE and WYATT EARP both excel is in presenting the aftermath of the gunfight. Unlike MY DARLING CLEMENTINE or GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL, the true story doesn't tie up neatly with a happy ending at the Corral, but becomes darker and bloodier. The Earps are placed under house arrest, and after they are acquitted in court, friends of Clanton (in TOMBSTONE, Ringo and other Cowboys), cold-bloodedly murder Morgan and cripple Virgil. Wyatt explodes, and grimly sets about, with Holiday and a small band of gunmen, to execute every possible Clanton ally he can find (""You tell him I'm coming! And hell's coming with me!""). Becoming a wanted fugitive himself, he only stops his mission of vengeance long enough to take the ailing Holiday to a friend's cabin (Charlton Heston has a brief but memorable cameo as the rancher), but the gambler returns in time for the gunblazing climax of the film.TOMBSTONE is the kind of Western that critics love to say aren't made anymore, a throwback to the golden days of Ford and Hawks, when Good and Evil were clearly defined. Director George P. Cosmatos grew up on those films, as well as those of Sergio Leone, and he said, of TOMBSTONE, that it was made to honor the Westerns he loved so much.It is his love of the Western that makes TOMBSTONE a truly superior film!",,Anonymous,Biography
One of the finest westerns ever filmed.  Excellent...,"One of the finest westerns ever filmed.  Excellent action.  A very good script.  The cast was amazing.  Val Kilmer should have received an Oscar for his role as Doc Holiday.  The movie was probably about 90% accurate historically, but was one of the best retellings of what had occured.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Revenge for Being Born...,"Delivered to the big screen at a time when the Western was as fashionable as flared jeans, this semi-factual presentation still uses the oft used effect of yore; to load the bad guys guns with blanks to demonstrate the super human capabilities of the heroes. It's still done today but with laser guns and any number of exotic weapons replacing them - and we still forgive it regardless. Notable, primarily for an unforgettable rendition of Doc Holliday or, Val Kilmer not playing Val Kilmer for a change, this ultimately represents another closing down sale for the Supercowboys franchise as the encroaching Superheroes drive them out of town. It has all the ingredients that made the genre great in its day but, remove the sentimental value from the mixing bowl and the reason for its decline is as plain as plain flour for all to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Good Wyatt Earp Film,"Proof that westerns can be fun, Tombstone delivers an action-adventure popcorn movie that doesn't have to be campy and one-dimensional to be enjoyable. Here, Wyatt Earp biography is told like a fable. Sure, the facts are often recalculated in this film. But this is not looking to give a straight-on accurate view of Wyatt Earp's life. This is trying to take a man's life as a basis and then add to it to make a cinematic joyride. As opposed to the overlong and plodding ""Wyatt Earp,"" this film decides to have a good time with the story and not get too bogged down in the misery. Kurt Russell is powerful as awful, and no man can deny that Val Kilmer, in his finest performance to date, was fully due for an Oscar nomination, if not an Oscar win. And Michael Biehn also gives a first rate performance as the sadistic Johnny Ringo. This is a thrill ride for anyone who loves westerns, or a good film to try to get others to start watching westerns.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Overrated,"I was expecting more from this one, which unaccountably has acquired the reputation of a modern classic. Russell is good, Kilmer steals the show, and Delany is miscast in a role that required a more fiery, vivacious persona; her scenes with Russell generate zero heat, and their romance, such as it is, goes nowhere.The earlier parts of the film have their moments (notably the Bird Cage scene, which probably captures the reality of Wild West entertainments pretty well), but in the third act everything unravels in confused montages of Peckinpahesque ultraviolence. Apparently the film was conceived as a much lengthier epic before being whittled down to its present dimensions; in the process, the story was condensed, rushed, and jumbled.For a true modern classic in the Western genre, see Unforgiven.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Soap opera crap,"The film starts out promisingly enough but then shoots itself in both feet by robbing its villains of any kind of threat and wrapping an affected romantic plot around its already emaciated waist. The romantic subplot is silly and carried off in a lighthearted manner reminiscent of corny '80s TV serials, but the worst thing is the villains. Though Earp does deliver some wrath upon their heads by the movie's end, we've already seen them act in too casual a manner, to the point where any threat they may have had is gone. Now it's just a bunch of guys shooting each other with no emotional kick for the viewer to really make him put his fist in the air and say, ""You get that son of a B!"" Mainstream types will gush all over this, which is what it was made for. But if you like your Westerns down and dirty, with real stakes at hand and real villains about to get theirs, stay away from this popcorn crap.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Val Kilmer's Greatest Performance,"Now Tombstone is a film that I would call the last great western of its genre so far.   It has every sub plot you could want in you're average film and especially in a western.  They have a great cast on board also to establish this gang of ragger muffins.  Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp is just as good as Costner and Lancaster were.  Val Kilmer is probably the main reason why every fan of it's genre talk about it so much as he is not just a fine actor in this but you believe that Doc Holiday and him were somehow related as he takes on the exact same sense of humour which I have read in books and his likeness is there also from what I have seen in pictures.Val Kilmer has been in a lot of films but only half of them were good and this goes into one of his best along with Oliver Stone's The Doors and Willow without doubt has to get a mention.   There is a superb cast here which makes up of Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot, Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, Stephen Lang, Billy Zane and of course Charlton Heston.   I could go on for even longer mentioning some of the great actors that star in this but the sheer action of vengeance of it make it one of the best action westerns. There are your two type of westerns like High Noon and The Searchers which are very calm but intense films.  Then you have The Wild Bunch and Tombstone which are just blood thirsty with plenty of action to cater for all tastes of films.I am not to familiar with the director but he is surely missed as far as making a western like this is concerned.",,Anonymous,Biography
"No awards, just rewards to cinema patrons.","God bless George P Cosmatos. To anyone who is a fan of the old west genre, holy smokes!! This little piece of western history hit with a thunderous explosion. Tombstone, was in theaters around the time that Eastwood's-- ""Unforgiven"" was just heading out. That (Clint's western saga) won a lot of awards, but to my dismay, it seems as though ' they ' missed this one. To me this is what Oscars are made of . Steely-performances that bring the viewer to a place of awe. Simple. This film of the old west, that some will quibble about the fact that they didn't go into further detail on the lives and events that were part of each character here. Or that some of the facts were traded or missed all together in Tombstone. The director had set this western up and many others on their heels. Everybody mentions Val Kilmer in this as the incomparable 'Doc' Holiday. No doubt that he was indeed just that.But add to it the way that Russell and Elliot with Paxton were the brothers that fell right into cinematic place. They were picture- perfect in their places. Then you bring in Dana Delaney, who is made for this part of the love opposite Wyatt, feisty, smart, educated and beautiful. and Stephen Lang another 'Pro' in about anything he takes on. I think he has multiple acting-personalities, his range is as broad as lake Superior. From a confident Jewish Lawyer David Abrams in 'Crime Story' (1986-88) to a quivering voice scumbag criminal outlaw in this, he has all the talent and a few other actor's talents too! Along with him, Michael Biehn, who was prime as Ringo, oh yeah! Charlton Heston as ' Henry Hooker' the solid standing rancher, who aides 'Doc' in a time of trouble, to Powers Booth, as the smart-Aleck's, oddly likable but equally slimy instigator 'Curly Bill' . The guy you love to hate. There was many moments that were the blocks that built the story, the one in particular that seemed strangely authentic, was when Wyatt and Virgil (Russell and Elliot) walked with Allie and Mattie, from the train after meeting up, and stopped at that storefront window and stood there, as if posing for a portrait. Wyatt sort of directed them to take a moment and take a picture of it to remember in their mind. That was a pause for reality in this for me. This had both tragedy and hard fought victory. The Arizona sky and scenery was dreamy in some sequences and the camera crew and sound was top-notch. I still can't really say there is another 'West' picture that stimulates my senses better than Wyatt and the whole gang, with 'Doc' the wild huckleberry, at your service....The crew that played together in this film, helped make it a smash hit!! There are the other actors that took part as well, too many to list with the 'word' limit on IMDb, but, it was so good, you could feel it even after the movie was over! I highly and gladly recommend to western lovers and action movie seekers.Tombstone...Justice is coming.(*****)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Are you gonna do something, or just stand there and bleed","Tombstone is a 1993 western that centers around a successful lawman whose retirement plan gets disrupted when a gang of outlaws invades his new home of Tombstone, Arizona.I'm not a very big fan of western films, but I think this movie is absolutely fantastic. The story of Wyatt Earp is one that has been told several times, but this is my favorite adaption of all of them. Kurt Russell's performance is superb, and with the rest of the cast bring the story to life with a raw realistic quality that really helps you get behind the characters and invest in what's going on. It's full of great action, terrific sets, and a lot of memorable dialogue that you'll be quoting for years to come.This is an all around great movie, and if you like westerns and haven't seen it before, I would highly recommend checking it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Earps & Doc vs.Mean Cowboys as early Organized Crime,"A late entry in the western genre when already not too many were being made, this is one of those re-watchable mini-epics, with strong entertainment value. It begins with a bang, an intense shoot-out after some supposedly historical footage narrated by actor Mitchum. We are introduced to The Cowboys, this era's version of the Mafia, led by the charismatic Curly Bill (Boothe). These first few minutes manage to unnerve and surprise the audience right away: we are also introduced to the psychotic gunslinger, Ringo (Biehn), but he's revealed as the most dangerous of the bunch only after the shoot-out, a sleight of hand by the filmmakers - they made him look sympathetic in those early moments while everyone is blasting away and he just stands there looking dazed and bothered. Only afterward do we realize he's a lethal lunatic of the damned - it's a powerful beginning.It's amazing how well this film turned out considering all the rumors of a troubled history. Credit must be given to director Cosmatos and the actors. It's a fairly huge cast, with numerous speaking roles, and everyone seems to have at least one good moment during the story. Then there's Kilmer as Doc, who is good or great in every scene he's in - this is easily Kilmer's best role. Doc is already sick as the movie begins but he manages to stay in the game to the very end, more dangerous than any 2 cowboys, using supernatural willpower & sardonic wit to distract everyone and himself from the fact he's nearly a walking ghost. Russell is just super-solid as Wyatt; he conveys a strength, tapped from unknown sources (whereas Doc draws from within), standing tall when other tough guys quake in the knees. These two make a terrific team; it's not the usual buddy stuff of most pictures. All the supporting cast is fine, including Elliott and Paxton as Wyatt's brothers, though there are some overly obvious moments. Earp's on - off relationship with the actress (Delany) has its ups & downs, there's not much room for subtlety as Earp's wife looks on quite upset as Delany strikes another of her bemused expressions. Also, due to the large number of characters, some of their stories have a heavily truncated feel (Priestley's, for example). The Vista director's cut special edition DVD has some restored footage to improve this problem. The better scenes are the confrontations between the men, the threats swung high & low, and the sheer thrill of watching Russell slap an overweight Billy Bob Thornton silly.And we have the villains, ah yes, the villains. I've already mentioned a couple of them - another one is Lang as Ike Clanton in a deliciously cheesy, hammy yet mesmerizing performance. By the last 3rd of the movie, I was so wishing he would get his - please, someone - Earp, Holliday, anyone ! - blow this bastard away! Ike is one of the great unsung villains of movie history, a tribute to Lang's abilities. The conflict in this true-life story stemmed from the notion that there were no real villains. It was a matter of which faction had the rights, based on gun power and political ambition. In other words, the Earps were just making a political power play in the view of some and there was little difference between them and The Cowboys. But this film wastes no time in establishing Wyatt and his brothers as the decent side of the coin and when you have characters like Ike, there's no mistaking which side are the bad guys. For a different take on this piece of history, check out the original Star Trek episode ""Spectre of the Gun"" from '68. Oh yeah, there are also other films like the Lancaster - Douglas opus from 1957. But the Gunfight at the OK Corral in ""Tombstone"" was just one set piece out of many.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Justice is now in session...,"When you think of the 'Wild, Wild West', saloons, sheriffs, shoot-outs, and cowboys are some of the things you might think of as essential to painting a portrait of the old west. Well, this movie shows just that, but not in a cheesy, run of the mill sort of way. This is the story of Tombstone.Tombstone stars Kurt Russell as the legendary Wyatt Earp, the U.S. Marshall known for 'keeping the peace'. He and his two brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) decide to head out to the town of Tombstone. It's a place where you can make it rich and quick, too. Wyatt decides to grab a share of the local saloon/casino called The Oriental. Making all of this money and having a good time is all they want to think about. They just want to leave they're past behind them. Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer) wants to do the same thing. With his lung condition worsening, he is trying to live life to the fullest...that is gambling, drinking, smoking, and doing his ""marital duties"" with his wife Kate. A traveling group of actors and performers roll into town put on a show for Tombstone. Josephine Marcus (Dana Delaney) and Mr. Fabian (Billy Zane) sweep the town off of their feet with their charm and talents. Josephine is attracted to Wyatt's ruggedness and mystery. Wyatt tries not to be tempted even though his drug addicted girl friend doesn't help his cause much. With all of this going on in Tombstone it seems like it will be easy sailing for Wyatt and his crew...until they have a run in with the Cowboys.Led by Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), this gang has been terrorizing the west for a number of years. They are the law in the town of Tombstone. They influence everything from the sheriff to the saloons. When the local marshal is shot by Curly Bill, Wyatt locks him up this is when the cowboys start to make trouble. Virgil and Morgan soon sign up as the new Sheriff's in town and Wyatt doesn't want any part of it. Doc has become enemies with one of the quickest and skilled guns in the west named Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). When Wyatt is forced into help keep the peace, there is the showdown at the O.K. Carral that would just become more of the legend of Wyatt Earp and his band of law men.Tombstone is a great film with a lot of action, drama, and even some comedic moments. The screenplay is fantastic with Wyatt Doc having some great conversations. Russell, Kilmer, Elliott, and Paxton all give good performances. Kilmer especially shows his range as an actor with his charm and charisma not scene in this way before. The ailing Doc Holiday is an interesting character to portray and Kilmer nails it. Along with Doc, Wyatt couldn't be just another law enforcer. He had to have a soft side and a mean streak as well. Russell give Wyatt a feeling of accomplishment, like he has done what he has set out to do. But when things go wrong, he is the first one you want on your side.Fans of westerns, have no fear because Tombstone is hear! This magnificent film is worth more than one viewing and I'm sure you'll agree.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lots of flash but you can bury this one,"""Tombstone"" is one of those stylized movies that has a lot of good qualities--some fine players, nice camerawork and a couple of tense scenes. But, overall, it's a mess. Nothing hangs together. It's really just a series of scenes strung together and called a movie. Kurt Russell, no stranger to action hero roles, is Wyatt Earp but you never get inside this guy. We start off with a sense of family with Wyatt and his brothers but nothing develops. We just have scenes. Hugh O'Brian may have provided a clearer characterization on the old TV show. But Val Kilmer is good, playing the sharp-witted, weak-lunged Bat Masterson. The whole thing starts off like a documentary with Robert Mitchum intoning something about the old west while some silent picture is shown. It might as well have been the one of ""Beef--it's what's for dinner"" spots. I don't know who this director is but he was obviously trying unsuccessfully to recreate the spaghetti westerns of the 1960's. The violence is layered in like a cake. I think there must be a UCLA film course out there that might talk about the need for subtlety when trying to establish a sinister characterization. Otherwise, it's just another shooting gallery. If there isn't there should be.  This film is good for a couple of clips but it needs to be buried on Boot Hill otherwise.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
good god y'all,"As a Tucson Native, I was totally impressed. Most people from other parts of the world will believe any western with a saguaro in it. This movie is one of the best of all time, and I worked at Old Tucson. If you're looking for a historical timeline, forget it. It's condensed for dramatic purposes, but still it flows, it's got love, action, comedy(mostly Kilmer) and a serious story of what the old west really was like. Amen for this one as opposed to the tragic The Quick and the Dead which was kinda silly if your brain is turned on whilst watching it. Watch for Priestly's, um, unusual performance. It also has a great back story on Earp's life, which makes for much more than a shallow shoot'em up movie.",,Anonymous,Biography

The cast alone makes this worthwhile...,"TOMBSTONE is yet another retelling of the famous story of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and the gunfight at the OK Corral. The subject is a well-rehearsed one having been covered elsewhere in the likes of John Ford's MY DARLING CLEMENTINE and the Kevin Costner epic Wyatt Earp. However, TOMBSTONE is well worth a look despite the familiarity of the material, and the reason for that is the cast.This film has an exemplary all-star cast of famous and future-famous faces. Nearly all members of the violent 'cowboy' gang ruled over by a scenery-chewing Powers Boothe are famous; we get the likes of Thomas Haden Church, Stephen Lang, Michael Rooker, the excellent and sinister Michael Biehn, and many others besides. Due to the sheer wealth of numbers not everybody gets much of a look in, but it's still eminently satisfying on a purely visual level.The heroes are given the most depth in terms of characterisation in the movie and the actors don't disappoint. Val Kilmer has never been more convincing in what is possibly his best role playing the sickly Holliday. Kurt Russell is all gravitas as Earp and as good as he ever is. Bill Paxton and Sam Elliott help to make up the numbers and certainly enhance the experience. And yet there are still more actors in support; the lovely Dana Delany as the love interest, Billy Zane as a pompous actor, Charlton Heston in an old-timer cameo, Billy Bob Thornton (back when he was fat) as a no-good card dealer and Terry O'Quinn as the mayor.The film itself is epic in length but the strong production values keep it watchable and engrossing. The Old West is brought to life in a convincing way. The first half of the movie is all build up and occasionally slow, but the suspense builds and pays off in an action-packed latter half with some great shoot-outs and choreography. TOMBSTONE is a violent, vibrant film and a fitting tribute to the heroes of old. It comes highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting but shallow,"I just watched this movie on television recently and was not very impressed. Sure, I was interested but the movie was more like a photo montage than anything else. There was almost no character depth and little character development. It was if the director was trying to cram as much action in as possible. I felt as if I were watching one big commercial for over two hours. While I am a fan of many of the actors in the film, they weren't given much to work with by the director so their performances were less than stellar (but they did a valiant job). I did like Val Kilmer's acting a lot though. So, the acting was good but mainly the character depth was terrible.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Energy; pot boiling; characterisation and ultimately heart sapped out of a film of its time, but Tombstone suffices as a basic, action orientated flick.","George P. Cosmatos' loose 1993 remake of John Ford's Classical Hollywood era western My Darling Clementine is a relatively daft and wavy film; a piece that announces its intentions very early on with a big shoot out after some bandits inflict a large amount of cruelty on a bunch of townsfolk, whereas the original built to a climactic shootout in which characters we'd spent the entire film with rode on in and put themselves in the face of danger. Tombstone feels the need to establish, in the most basic of manners, that the 'bad guys' are the ones cackling and free willingly executing whilst a bunch of gunshots sound off for the sake of it. Tombstone veers more towards actioner than it does western, providing basic arcs for its characters and hand-holding us through whom we ought to be rooting for; but what else can you expect from the director of the second Rambo film?There's that wonderful instance in Ford's version of the story which sees a character by name of Doc Holliday, who has spent most of the opening forty minutes giving Henry Fonda's Wyatt Earp grief, have the Clementine of the title walk back into his life and put him through an emotional grinder of forlorn memories and drink. The shift in balance was stark, an informing to the audience that just because a character gives grief to someone we might assume to be whatever protagonist the film has lined up, does not mean he cannot be a human being; with respective flaws and characteristics. Tombstone tiptoes around this naturalistic air of plight, opting for archetype more often than I'd have liked whilst spending a gross amount of time plodding along before breaking off into bouts of shooting and chaos at intermittent times.The Wyatt Earp of Tombstone is played by Kurt Russell, an ex-marshal whom we know is good natured at the core due to stopping of a number of horses from having further pain and harm inflicted upon them by a certain perpetrator; an entire sequence which stands in stark comparison to the opening bandits and their attitudes towards the innocent. Journeying to the Arizona town of Tombstone with his brothers, where they hope to settle down, Earp is mangled into defending the town from the aforementioned group of a group of bullyin', gun-totin' cowboys; led by Curly Bill Brocius (Boothe). Doc Holliday is this time played by Val Kilmer, a laid-back; black-clad; smooth talking' card player whom we observe beat the system, win a card game, engage in a bar-room brawl of some nature before swinging his way outta' there with the money in one hand and the gal in the other – yes, it does feel a little fabricated. Holliday's relationship with Earp is certainly more low key in this one, something that fast-tracks character relations between the two and forces the film to focus on the cowboy gang as a primary source of antagonism, something that doesn't crop up nearly as much as Earp and Holliday's banter in Ford's version; hence the reason Tombstone comes across as the plodding piece it is.Italian born Cosmatos has his lead reflect what might very well be his own view on the material, in the sense Russell's Earp has an opinion on all the death and what's going on around him but it's a vacant feeling. A character's attempt at raising theological discussion with Russell's Earp near the beginning of the film is somewhat dismissed; amidst all the killing and hurt, it's established he doesn't care much about it – it's more so how Earp 'does' it rather than how he 'feels' about it, something that echoes the director's approach to the subject matter, in the sense he is more interested in black and white heroes and villains than looking at what these people think about those around them and particular predicaments. Holliday's easy truce with Earp is representational of this.Earp doesn't initially want the responsibility of keeping law and order. His smart and well dressed brothers stand in articulate contrast to Boothe's ragtag bunch of sloppy, roughly dressed and ugly looking bandits; although the film implores, in a bizarre manner, that practically everybody in the town is bound by a theatrical performance of a Shakespere piece; and that when the poetic nature of something so beautiful begins, everybody keeps quiet and observes. The film is one in which the focus is on men, and their relationship with one another and how they come to exist within the enclosed space of the town of Tombstone; a place that two different factions see two different, distinct futures in which they are at the respective centrefold of it all. In a film about men, men co-existing; men sorting out their relations with one another, it ought to be no surprise that the female characters are pushed to the back row - relegated to staying at home; staying silent and being seen out and about beside their man.Regardless, Tombstone isn't a bad film but it's certainly a lot less interesting than films that have taken on the story of Earp in the past. As an actioner, it works relatively well but as a character piece, it limps along for over two hours purely so that it can boil down to a showdown between good and evil. The melodramatic thunderclaps complete with lightning in the background as a key character dies about half way through exemplifies this, in the sense Cosmatos needs aid within the dramatic thunderclap sound effects to bring about more emotion out of the occurrence, rather than rely on all the previous character driven content for it to genuinely play out effectively. I like a good film about a power struggle in one locale between two groups of men, each with their own ideologies and attitudes towards life and Tombstone does suffice, it's just a little drawn-out; limp and mysteriously uninvolving for most of the time.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A timeless classic!,"Tombstone is one of my favorite westerns of all time! The movie features big time stars and big time shootouts. Kurt Russell casted as Wyatt Earp was pure genius. Sam Elliott, Val Kimer, and Bill Paxton were all terrific as well. Trust me you will recognize a lot of big time stars in this one. Even Billy Bob Thorton shows up as a side character who probably has less then 5 minutes of screen time. I absolutely love the story here and the drama/action throughout makes this movie go by at lightning speed. I miss westerns like this and hope movie studios start to release more like them in the near future. Tombstone might not be perfect in critics eyes but it is a picture perfect film in mine. Tombstone gets a perfect 10 stars out of 10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Hey, Let's Play Cowboys and...","What this movie comes down to, without a real need for review, is do you like westerns? If you can't stand them and have no desire to see one, you'll dislike this film. If you like them, even a little bit, you'll probably love this film. It's the telling of the true story of Tombstone with the best cast of any Western: Kurt Russell, Bill Paxton, Val Vilmer, Sam Elliott, Terry O'Quinn, Michael Rooker, that guy from ""Wings"", Powers Boothe and others...And the drama is there: a man torn between two women while his family is gunned down. And the action? It's the Old West! Gun fights everywhere you look! But the real story is the mustache parade. Val Kilmer in a silly mustache. Kurt Russell's mustache is a bit large. Both seem rather fake. Terry O'Quinn looks like his is real, not unlike the one he had in ""The Stepfather"". Bill Paxton's mustache is unremarkable. And the best mustache award goes to Sam Elliott. But that's obvious, because Elliott's mustache is his second-best quality (behind his gravely voice). In ""The Big Lebowski"" his mustache was massive. In ""The legacy"", his mustache actually had a co-starring role on the opening credits. One time I saw Sam without his mustache, and it was like Samson without his long hair. It destroyed the man.Anyway, this film s recommended if you need a western. Otherwise, maybe not. You have to be in that mood, if you know what I mean.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Right Off The Hollywood Assembly Line,"Muddled story about gunslingers in 1879 Tombstone, boom town of the Old West. Too many speaking parts and a lack of character focus make a mess of the plot. Cast extras number in the hundreds if not thousands. This is a big-budget Hollywood production, bombastic in tone, with lots of violent action, and not much depth.The film's casting is generally atrocious. Kurt Russell, complete with ugly mustache, looks too young to play a retired Wyatt Earp. Powers Boothe, who was quite good as preacher Jim Jones, is not convincing in a story set in the nineteenth century. The cast even includes old-man Sam Elliott, a has-been actor from the 1970s. And the women, cast mostly as ornaments, make no significant impression.Despite being too young to play Doc Holliday, Val Kilmer gives a fine performance as the alcoholic but eloquently spoken Doc. Unlike other actors who phone in their performances, Kilmer at least tries to imbue his character with some uniqueness.Wyatt Earp yearns for some peace and quiet amid retirement. Of course, things don't work out that way, as a gang of thugs invokes Earp's wrath. Lots of shoot-em-ups initiated by scowling villains who, in stereotyped fashion, have no sense of humor. Even the dialogue is clichéd. Costumes are way over done, and feature black suits and capes, Hollywood stylish in the 1990s.Cinematography features an unfortunate widescreen projection that leaves lots of black space above and below the images. Some of the dusk scenes are evocative, with human silhouettes set against an orange sunset. Most of the film looks like it was shot on studio sets and back-lots. The film's thundering score is overbearing and manipulative, totally in keeping with a film that is in-your-face blunt. Sound effects are needlessly exaggerated.There's nothing subtle about ""Tombstone"". Except for Doc Holliday, there's no depth to the characters. And there's no depth at all to the contrived story. This is a film that's benefited from lots of marketing and a big-name cast. Like most Hollywood assembly-line films, the effect of ""Tombstone"" is momentary. It will leave no lasting impression.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"We're not cross, are we?","First of all, I love the movie. Now some may say, ""What a moron..."" and others will undoubtedly agree with me. But I think it's great. When I first saw the film as it debuted in theaters eleven or so years back, I came away thinking, Men doing a man's job. Sounds a little chauvinist, I'll admit, but there you are. The movie is a tribute to men being men, living their lives on their own terms. The fact that the story is about the Earp saga is almost secondary to the film. To enjoy this movie, I don't think that it's so important for it to have historical accuracy to the letter or even have rain falling consistently through the shots. I would only advise viewers to let this Remington-painting-come-to-life wash over them and just go along for the ride. As long as we remember that this is Hollywood, all is well.Then there's reality. As real aficionados of Tombstone history will see, the movie sacrifices or distorts some of the facts and compresses time. In the end it's a shame, really, because the film never realizes its full potential. I'm convinced that if this movie was true to history, it could only have been better. Previous reviews talk about and compare with Costner's Wyatt Earp. I think elements of both films combined would have made a great movie. For instance, I would have lifted much of WE's script from when Wyatt arrives in town (the story, not the dialog) and used it in Tombstone. And then get the rest of the facts straight. The true story is compelling on its own, and would still be entertaining.The special edition DVD includes deleted scenes, that for the life of me, I can't figure out why they were deleted in the first place. But the scene when Wyatt and Josie rest after their spirited ride still has the payoff of the scene cut out - Josie and Wyatt getting it on. I get tired of directors thinking that the audience is sophisticated so we'll just let them figure it out on their own. Come on George, some of us didn't know that Wyatt was cheating on Mattie.Finally, I've got to say that the movie was cast well. And the costumes were true to life - men liked to be colorful and unique in that time and place. The guns were accurate, as were the holsters (low slung and quick draw is a Hollywood invention). As for the scenery, I lived in Arizona for a while, and I do miss the big sky.If you want to be entertained, this is the movie for you. If you want a history lesson, better hit the library...",,Anonymous,Biography
"""They Drag Me Back In Again""","Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp must have felt a whole lot like Michael Corleone being brought back into the law business which he thought he'd left behind in Kansas. Of course when you and your brothers settle in a wide open town like Tombstone, Arizona you've got to expect your talents will be called upon.As long as films are being made, filmmakers will never lose their fascination for the saga of Wyatt Earp that culminated in the famous gunfight at the OK Corral in 1881. Kurt Russell join an incredible pantheon of Hollywood's best actors who've gotten a crack at Wyatt Earp, like Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster and Tom Mix. However this film bears the closest resemblance to Hour Of The Gun which had James Garner as Wyatt Earp which also showed, in fact it concentrated on what happened after the famous gunfight.Unlike in Hour Of The Gun where Jason Robards, Jr. as Doc Holliday upbraids Wyatt Earp for becoming a killing machine, nobody's really caring about that here. In fact the tubercular Holliday quite approves of what Russell is doing. He's given plenty of cause after the OK Corral as you'll see.When he's on the screen Val Kilmer steals the film. In fairness to Russell and the rest who've played Earp, especially as a straight arrow the way Burt Lancaster did Gunfight At The OK Corral, the role of Holliday is such a colorful one, it's an actor's dream. Kirk Douglas walked off with that picture as does Val Kilmer here and Russell isn't quite the straight arrow that Lancaster was.For the first time the Earp brothers are shown as the family men they were. All but Wyatt were married in fact and Wyatt was keeping company with Dana Wheeler-Nicholson, but he drops her for Dana Delany who in fact he was with for the rest of their lives together and Earp died in 1929.Robert Mitchum whose unmistakable voice narrates the film was supposed to play Old Man Clanton, but health considerations knocked him out of the part and he only narrated. I'm sure the rewriting also reduced the parts of Ike and Billy Clanton. Another film legend, Charlton Heston, plays rancher Henry Hooker who shelters Wyatt and his posse.The bad guys who get their due here are Powers Boothe as a vicious Curly Bill Brocius and Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo who's definitely not gambling with the Earps and Doc Holliday with a full deck.My favorite Wyatt Earp film still remains Hour Of The Gun, but Tombstone which follows and embellishes a lot of the story line of that film is definitely a worthwhile film. I understand according to commentary made during a showing of this on the History Channel, Kurt Russell did a lot of the directing himself.He and credited director George P. Cosmatos deserve a lot of credit.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Rambling and occasionally unfocused, Tombstone is far from perfect but the fine ensemble cast make it worth a look","Successful lawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) heads to Tombstone, Arizona with the intention of retiring. However, when the citizens of Tombstone are threatened by an unruly group of cowboys, Earp and his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) take it upon themselves to stand up to the cowboys and protect the citizens.I've seen quite a few westerns in my time and the best ones usually have Clint Eastwood's name attached to them. Tombstone had a 5 star rating and on the basis that this one was based on a true story I had hoped that this film would be exciting and informative. Well, it does achieve both objectives to a certain extent, but isn't what I would categorise as a brilliant film.After an impressive start, the film seems to go into rambling mode with several scenes in the first half presumably existing to establish Wyatt Earp's heroism and perhaps why he was both feared and respected in equal measure. It's admirable to a degree, but unfortunately at times it feels a bit boring (the entire sequence at the theatre, for example, could have been omitted entirely as it has little effect on the story given how much time was devoted to it). In fact, the only reason I can fathom for its existence was to create a crass and somewhat unnecessary romance sub-plot. It's around an hour into the film before the cowboys make their return and it is here when the film starts to get back on track; there are some good showdowns and suitably tense moments - although again not as many as I was expecting.One major problem with this film lies with a lot of its characters; the female characters in particular are very poorly written and as for general character development...well if I were to call it 'sparse' that would probably be an understatement. The fact we learn so little about each of the characters; particularly important characters such as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday make the film all the more frustrating when you realise how good it could have been if it would have just had a tad more depth.Although the characterisation is a little flat, Tombstone does at least boast a fine ensemble cast. All the big hitters are very good, but perhaps special recognition should go to Val Kilmer whose character is perhaps the most difficult and complex one to bring to the screen and Kilmer does an excellent job making Holliday both pitiful and cocky in equal measure.Tombstone is rambling, sprawling and at times a bit superficial and unfocused. However, it has a fine cast, some tense moments and some terrific performances. I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't slightly disappointed with Tombstone, but overall it was still a fairly decent offering.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Never saw a rich man that didn't up with a guilty conscience""","It certainly didn't feel like it at the time, but the early nineties were now thirty years ago; so what at the time seemed a nostalgic wallow itself now seems a relic from a bygone age when Harry Carey Jr. And Charlton Heston could still be in the cast and the actual Robert Mitchum was the narrator.Although it goes the extra mile to convincingly recreate the period by giving the Earp brothers enormous moustaches (and even more enormous hats) it doesn't fall into the usual trap of taking itself too seriously; with Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer exhibiting amusing guile like James Garner in 'Support Your Local Sheriff'.Unfortunately it has the modern vice of going on far too long, but it also gives the fair sex a crack of the whip with choice roles for Dana Dalaney and Joanna Pacula as a lynx-eyed saloon gal.The most criticised aspect of the narrative (which I won't divulge because it constitutes a spoiler) I actually quite liked because that's pretty much how it happened.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worth it,"Comparing Tombstone with Wyatt Earp (Costner) they are two totally different movies that were released around the same time. Tombstone focuses on an event in Tombstone, Earp focuses on Wyatt's life from boy to man. Because of the latter there is a bit more emotional investment in the characters, rather than a plot, which to me is always better.Tombstone is filled too much with exposition. In Earp they took an hour to introduce characters and build the story. Tombstone introduces all the characters within 10 minutes, which felt rushed. Every second a new name was spoken out loud to introduce them. Earp was not without its problems, but I think at the end of the day Tombstone is the inferior movie. When we see Matti we are immediately shown she is already poisoning herself (within first 10 min), unlike in Earp it was slowly introduced over time. Both films suffer from the Hollywood formula, but at least it's the old Hollywood, which does work on some level unlike today where it's mostly all CGI, action and the cliffnote version of characters and relationship.Some of my criticism would be if you make a movie called Tombstone where the main focus is on the shootout don't meander into long side stories like love stories unless that IS the focus of the film, which it wasn't here. Dana Delany was miscast as the seductive maverick Josie.In other words, Tombstone struggled between wanting to make personal bio and a plot driven event at the OK Corral. Earp (Costner) stuck to the bio which made it more focused. And although Tombstone did distinguish itself by focusing on the villains too, they showed them as one dimensional bad guys, which is a lazy way to treat characters.At the end I think it's fine to build some love story so we care, but I think it should have been between the brothers not Earp and Josie. And I think the feud between the Earps and the outlaws seemed weak, rushed and forced. In summary I had more, though not many, cringe moment during Tombstone than Earp.Like Earp this also felt a notch above a TV movie. The music was too much and too forced.Nevertheless, it is worth watching..",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
I'm Your Huckleberry,"Oh Nostalgia, my old friend. When I was young, my grandfather and I would sit there on the couch, bowl of popcorn between us and watch Tombstone on a regular basis. I was probably the only teenager in my area that would call people a huckleberry or tell someone hell's coming with me! I haven't seen it in years though, a decade at least. As soon as this started it all came back though, like slipping under a warm blanket I was back in a happy place watching Russell command the screen as Earp, Kilmer transform into Holliday, the grizzled gravitas of Elliott, the charisma of Boothe, the villainy of Biehn. Yes, it gets saccharine in parts. Overly cinematic I suppose. That moment at the river when Earp just starts yelling out NO! And turns into Boris the Bullet Dodger feels a little sillier now but I so don't care.

Western Non-sense.............For Children ?,"Tombstone is a ""good looking movie"""". That is one of the few reasons you should watch it. It is about 1% historically accurate. The story is absurd. The script is weak. The acting is poor. Val Kilmer is hysterically funny with his ridiculous ""camped up"" version of Doc Holliday. He should have won the razz in 1993 (he was robbed). Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) tries too hard to be cool, and wearing his whiter than white shirts is highly amusing. I was not there, but I can assure you...the West was not like this...Tombstone was not a ""cosmopolitan American Town"". The story of Wyatt Earp, Tombstone, The O.K. corral, Etc. was nothing like this. Maybe this was made for young teenagers...Or maybe this is just a bad movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

Even if your not a Western fan (like me), you'll still at least enjoy this film.  Excellent lighting, cinematography and sound design.  Intense pacing and story telling.  All the classic elements of good guys and bad guys.  Great story development and plot buildup.  You have to see it at least once.",,Anonymous,Biography
very exciting western action and great cast,"In all me years of seeing western movies, this definitely a favorite mine. And I grew up in the 50's when the B westerns were still popular, though a few years old, so I remember well Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Johnny Mack Brown, Rex Allen, Bill Elliott, and Rocky Lane; naturally i remember John Wayne also.
The cast of ""Tombstone"" was well-picked. Kurt Russell was very adept at playing the lead as Wyatt Earp, a mean yet loving man when it came to his brothers. Val Kilmer was excellent as John ""Doc"" Holliday, a sometimes amusing yet at heart a very serious killer. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson was one who convinced viewers well that she, as Wyatt's wife, was a bitter, unhappy lady. Dana Delaney-and what red-blooded male could not be taken with her?-was very appealing as the actress who became Wyatt's love interest in no time at all, and she his. Powers Boothe, Stephen Lang, and Billy Bob Thornton each fit into each one's individual role well. All of these contributed greatly to the excitement brought about. And though his role was brief, Charlton Heston was good as the caring man Henry Hooker, even if his exterior was somewhat rough. I did like the color and the movie set Old Tuscon as well. For all these reasons it is definitely a favorite western of mine, and maybe even a favorite movie of any genre for me personally.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Still Quite Remarkable,"Not sure how it happened but somehow I ended up reading about one of my favorite American anti-heroes, Doc Holliday, the other weekend and by golly I was inspired to dig out my tape of TOMBSTONE. And gosh darnit this is still a very enjoyable modern day western, with a fabulous cast, some great laugh out loud moments and a sly sense of humor that sets it apart from some of it's more lead-footed contemporaries.It's far from a perfect film. Kurt Russell isn't quite larger-than-life enough for Wyatt Earp (he's still the COMPUTER WORE TENNIS SHOES guy, even thirty five years later), the screenplay & cinematography is hit or miss in spots. The music is stirring at the right moments but doesn't have the resonance of something like Walter Hill's THE LONG RIDERS -- still my personal favorite of the modern era westerns -- nor the novelty of a good old spaghetti western score.The comparison to spaghetti westerns is inevitable, as far as I can see, mostly because TOMBSTONE is a cartoon of sorts. A graphic novel for grown-ups that just happens to use the legend of the Gunfight at O.K. Corral as it's departure point. It's colorful, bloody, bombastic, funny, pop oriented, and yet it has some very memorable moments that are perhaps more important than the work as a whole. Westerns in general are usually more about their individual moments than their story arcs, an attribute that directors like Sergio Leone or Sergio Corbucci understood very well. I think both of them would have enjoyed TOMBSTONE & gotten a kick out of how some of their own ideas were recycled by the very industry they themselves were recycling.The standout attribute of the film is still Val Kilmer's delightful interpretation of Doc Holliday. With his southern drawl, cultured mannerisms, sly quick wits (""I've got two guns, one for each of ya."") and still quotable one-liners he created a role that was uniquely his. Whether or not it was as historically accurate as Kirk Douglas or Jason Robards or Dennis Quaid's versions isn't important. And like him or not as a person, the moments where Doc gets to shine are the movie's high points. The best part of his role is that Kilmer seems to have been aware that TOMBSTONE was a cartoon, and caricatured himself accordingly. As did many of the supporting players, particularly Powers Booth, Michael Biehn and Stephen Lang's delightfully scummy Ike Clanton.Part of what makes the film so remarkable is what a star crossed production it was in the first place. Originally a Kevin Costner envisioned project, he departed quickly to make his own Wyatt Earp movie upon creative disagreements with writer + original director Kevin Jarre, who was promptly fired when Kurt Russell came into the project and changed it's focus. Robert Mitchum was injured before he could play his role, a sitting director could not be secured until the late George P. Cosmatos agreed to helm. Kurt Russell apparently directed the bulk of the project himself just to keep the production alive, which perhaps explains some of the more awkward moments.The most awkward being Dana DeLaney's role as Josephine Marcus, Wyatt Earp's love interest. Her part was either inflicted on the script hastily or is sadly under-written, a conclusion borne out by stories about an original three hour version that might have explored her character in a bit more interesting of a manner. I also can't get around Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, who makes bizarre facial expressions through the whole film that aren't helped much by that cookie duster mustache he grew. Then again one of the historical accuracy traits the film boasts is that all of the mustaches and period costumes are real, which explains why Val Kilmer is sweating there in a wool suit for the entire movie. No air conditioning in the old west.So while it may not have the poignancy of UNFORGIVEN or the breadth of THE GOOD THE BAD & THE UGLY or even the macho swagger of an EL DORADO John Wayne film, TOMBSTONE is one of the great American westerns and a marvelous entertainment & deserves to be seen again. Here's a movie that's worth owning your own copy of.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

His laconic, brave, and whimsical take on a western icon is at all times fascinating and richly textured.  He may be difficult, he may be arrogant, but Jeez can he act.

"Perhaps the last, greatly-overrated American western","After finally viewing this movie in its entirety, I am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike. Is it the worst Western ever? No, I wouldn't say that. But ""the last great American Western"", a phrase I saw applied to it more than once? Not even close.A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that I've ever seen. The movie can be measured in groaners per minute; as in, how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life? There's so many instances of this that it's distracting. Cheesy lines come at you in waves; predictable, unoriginal, and often.If bad dialogue doesn't bother you, then how about bad gunfights? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously. It's okay if there's a comic edge to such gunfighting, such as in Silverado, but in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good Westerns. The final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score, but by then, I was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving.Other than those flaws, I can say the visuals are stunning - the movie's well shot and the settings all look great. The acting is passable, especially considering what the actors were given to work with. However, if you're looking for the last great American Western, do yourself a favor - go rent Unforgiven instead.3 out of 10",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Everything That ""Wyatt Earp"" Wanted to Be","""Tombstone"" is one of the best westerns ever made. It was overshadowed in the early-1990s due to the success of ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Unforgiven"". While ""Tombstone"" is not on par with either of those films, it is an exciting shoot-em-up western that works because it never tries to be more than it is. The Earps (Kurt Russell, Sam Elliott, and Bill Paxton) are looking for their fortune out west. However, trouble ensues as ruthless cowboys are reigning terror all over the region. Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn are the leaders of the bad dudes and a massive showdown is the only answer for all concerned. Also along for the ride is Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer, in arguably his greatest role). ""Tombstone"" also has one of the greatest casts of recent memory. Some of the faces that will be seen include Charlton Heston, Dana Delaney, Stephen Lang, Billy Zane, Jason Priestley, and Billy Bob Thornton. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Exciting revisionist Western with plenty of tension , thrills , gunplay and high body-count .","""Tombstone: The Legend of Wyatt Earp"" (George P. Cosmatos, 1993) with Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer is a vigorous recounting of a familiar tale , dealing with legendary lawman moves to Tombstone , Arizona, aiming to begin a new life along with his brothers , Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) . This trigger-taut Western drama deals with a lawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) and a badman gunslinger and philosopher Southern gent who usually coughs , called Doc Holliday , (Val Kilmer who excels , giving comsumptive conviction to character) , the strangest friendship this side of heaven and hell . They fought shoulder to shoulder in the wildest stand-up gunfight in the history of the West . As the fabled showdown is seen about two-thirds of the way through this film . They are the strangest alliance between the West's most famous sheriff Wyatt Earp , trying to overcome outlaws and its deadliest gambling killer , Doc Holliday. It's incomparably performed by the greatest team who ever went into action , Kurt Russell portrays the large-than-life lawman , living by the old rules , driven by revenge , dueling to the death and Kilmer is most impressive as a gunslinger , the hellfire gambler , his only friends were his guns and his only refuge was a woman's heart , Kate : Joanna Pacula . Two towering Box office actors in a huge exciting production . The film correctly builds up its suspense until a tense battle in streets of Tombstone , it is the highlight to the story and the start of a small war between the revenger Earp and the baddies : ¨The Cowboys¨ , led by Curly Bill (Powers Boothe ) , Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) , Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) , Billy Clanton (Thomas Haden Church) , Frank McLaury (Robert Burke) . Meanwhile , Wyatt falls in love for an actress , Josephine (Dana Delaney) , though lacks the indispensable romantic spark .This is an overwhelming Western , though too self-conscious , suffering from 90s Western revisionism . It was partially panned , but nowadays being well considered , may be seen by some as unoriginal and cliched but is really a very fashionable outing in Earp saga and a throughly agreeable Western. Russell sounds and looks the part more than any other Earp , including Kevin Costner/Kasdan Wyatt, being helped in no small measure by his courage in growing a large Earp-like tache . Val Kilmer delivers an awesome acting , stealing clearly the show , a character designed for scenary chewing , giving a breathtaking portrayal of the doomed dentist . Although overlong , but blessed with a high-energy level , thanks to noisy action , spectacular horse riding and rousing shooting . Russell spends a lot of time looking troubled by the violence while kills mercilessly. There's also essential moustache-wearing from the very effective Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton : Virgil and Morgan . Here Doc helps Earp against other historic characters , such as Stephen Lang /Ike Clanton , Thomas Haden Church /Billy Clanton and Johnny Ringo/Michael Biehn . As the picture benefits itself from despictable villians . The film focuses Tombstone , 1881 , with stimulating scenes about OK Corral gunfight between Morgan , Virgil , Wyatt Earp , Doc against the nefarious Ike Billy Clanton , Johnny Ringo, and Tom McLowery . This main character is a historical figure , in this case the sheriff Wyatt Earp who participated the most famous duel occurred in the western town of Tombstone in 1881 that has been brought to the big screen many times as in the classic ""My Darling Clementine"" in 1946 directed by John Ford with Henry Fonda and Victor Mature , in this ""Gunfight at O.K. Corral"" (1957) with Burt Lancaster , Kirk Douglas directed by specialist John Sturges who would resume the same story in ""The Hour of the Gun"" (1967) ; the demystifying ""Doc"" (Frank Perry, 1971) with Harris Yulin and Stacy Keach or the more modern ¨Wyatt Earp¨ (Lawrence Kasdan, 1994) with Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid .This is a story enormous in scope ,unusual in concept with a mile-a-minute action on a climatic and thrill-a-minute gunfight. Packs a magnificent and marvelous cinematography-Vistavision with a nice sense of period , and Technicolor with overblown chromatic by William A Fraker . As well as adequate costuming and lavish production design . This thrilling film contains a spectacular and lyric musical score by the great Bruce Broughton who composes a rousing soundtrack . All of them help make this one an enjoyable action western film . This saga of Earp family and the band of law-abiding large moustaches beat the Wyatt Earp by Lawrence Kasdan/Kevin Costner to big screen by several years .

Ya, this movie will have you feeling good at the end - I'm not a Kurt Russell fan, but I am in this movie ""are you going to skin that smoke wagon or just stand there and bleed?"" . . . watch the movie, don't just stand there and bleed, you'll be glad you did - my recommendation, buy the DVD, you'll want to watch it many times over!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Val Kilmer is amazing!,"I loved Val Kilmer's performance. It was poetry, however, the rest of the movie was rather dry. I don't know why but it was. I guess I really didn't get into the story. Also I didn't care for the other characters. But it is quite fair to say that Val Kilmer's performance was breathtaking and utterly believable. I loved his arrogance, vulnerability. Doc Holliday was very noble even though he did a lot of bad things like killing a lot of people. And the way Val Kilmer portrayed it...it was poetry, like I said before. When I go to watch this movie I only watch the parts with Val Kilmer. I cried at the end because Doc Holliday dies. Sigh. It's so sad.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Indeed, sir. The last charge of Wyatt Earp and his immortals.","Tombstone is written by Kevin Jarre and directed by its star Kurt Russell, with credited director George P. Cosmatos ghost-directing. It also features a large ensemble cast that includes Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn & Powers Boothe. The movie is loosely based on historic incidents occurring in 1881-1882. The plot follows newly retired peace officer Wyatt Earp (Russell) as he and his two brothers, Virgil (Elliott) & Morgan (Paxton), arrive in the Tuscon town of Tombstone. Here they plan to make their fortune and gain themselves a share in a farrow game at the local saloon. Wyatt's long time friend, Doc Holliday (Kilmer), also joins the Earp's in town and it's not long before they encounter trouble in the form of The Cowboys - a ruthless bunch of outlaws led by Curly Bill Brocious (Boothe).The back story to Tombstone is rather interesting, so without waffling on and boring the spurs off of any readers I'll try & keep this paragraph short! Willem Dafoe was slated to star as Doc Holliday but Buena Vista (Disney company) said no way on account of his appearance in the frowned upon The Last Temptation Of Christ. Since Buena Vista were the only company willing to distribute Tombstone, on account of Kevin Costner pulling rank and influence due to his own Wyatt Earp movie being on the go, they had the big say in things. Then when the screenplay was turned in by Jarre it was shot down by both Russell and the now on board Kilmer because it was deemed excessively too long. Jarre was then fired as director for refusing to cut down the characterisations. Enter Cosmatos to ghost-direct for Russell. Then Robert Mitchum (who narrates in the film) had to drop out of playing Old Man Clanton (subsequently dropped from the story) due to a riding accident. While genre legend Glenn Ford bailed out of playing Marshall White to pave the way for Harry Carey Junior to fill those boots.In spite of all the problems getting harmony and cohesion to the screen, Tombstone ends up being a thoroughly entertaining genre piece. A love letter to the genre and boasting one of the best ever portrayals of an (in)famous Western character (Kilmer's take on Holliday is sexy, dangerous and utterly beguiling). Comparing it to Costner's movie is folly, for that movie (and I'm a big fan of it) is a telling of Earp's life and doesn't Hollywoodise things, this is about a short period in Earp's life, with bells on. There's some inaccuracies, but in the main the makers do a good job of covering the events leading up to the famous gunfight that occurred at the O.K. Corall - and the aftermath of said confrontation. Pic manages to have its cake and to eat it for a modern age made Western. It does all in all what old fans of the genre expect whilst having enough savvy dialogue and rah rah sequences to engage the more youthful viewers. There's not much art to speak of (for instance you wont go searching out for the cinematographer's name) and the sheer volume of characters at times threatens to bulge the piece over the belt buckle. Yet it always manages to keep us entertained with a high energy action sequence or a sharp quip delivered by the irrepressible Kilmer. Even the standardised romantic angle involving the beautiful, but superfluous Dana Delaney as Josephine manages to have its engaging moments. Sure we ache for the next scene of Kilmer being cool or Biehn being a cocky bastard, but the love blossoming between Wyatt & Josephine, and the inner conflict that it causes Earp, really fleshes out where Earp was emotionally at a time when he was trying to settle down for peace in his world.Ultimately it's probably with the story of Kilmer & Russell insisting on a trimming of the story that Tombstone makes the most telling point. Critically it was recognised as being too bloated and that wasn't what was needed. For crying out loud the Western fan had had Eastwood's sublime Unforgiven the previous year, so who in their right mind would try and follow that? Tombstone thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously, but still it has enough nous to keep the beans cooking on high and the splendid moustache's a twirling. All that Whilst simultaneously providing some of the most quotable lines delivered in the most splendid of film genres. Kilmer's Doc is our Huckleberry, and so is Tombstone the film. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ok movie,"Tombstone is a solid Western with some great performances and memorable moments, but it doesn't quite hit the mark as a truly great film. The standout element is undoubtedly Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday-his performance alone elevates the movie and provides some of its most iconic lines. Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp also does a fine job, bringing a strong presence to the role.The action sequences are well done, and the shootout at the O. K. Corral is a highlight. However, the pacing feels uneven, with some parts dragging, especially in the second half. The film also juggles too many subplots, making it feel a bit overstuffed. Some supporting characters, including the villains, could have been developed more to create a stronger emotional impact.While Tombstone is entertaining and delivers some classic Western thrills, it doesn't quite reach the level of the best films in the genre. It's worth a watch, especially for Kilmer's performance, but it's not a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Easily the best film I've seen in a month,"A public service announcement to anyone that hasn't seen this movie: Watch it now! I just saw it for the first time, and it's easily the best movie I've seen in months.I've said it before and I'll say it again, but, in my opinion, characters are likely the most important aspect of a film. That said, the characters here couldn't be better, each one has their own distinct personality, they all have moments to shine and, most importantly, they are all superbly acted. Top honours in that category go, of course, to Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday. Simply one of the best characters ever to grace the screen, no more needs to be said. Kurt Russell also did a very good job as celebrated lawman Wyatt Earp. The supporting cast are great as well, but these two certainly stand out...especially Kilmer.I wont get in to how great the plot is so that I don't spoil it. I'll just leave it at this: it's an enthralling story that will keep you glued from beginning to end, surprise you at times, and even saves time to make you laugh. Very well written, very well played out. Even the music is great, which is something that I often overlook.In conclusion, I'm a huge western fan. In fact, next to horror, I'd have to say they are my favourite genre of film. Despite being fairly recent, this film ranks among the best and has certainly earned it's spot as one of my favourite films.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A fun western with a loaded A-list cast,"When the discussion of Western's comes up among film fans there's the obvious choices like the Sergio Leone classics, The Searchers, Unforgiven and a myriad of other well-liked tales of the Wild Wild West but one film that has also managed to find itself in the conversation is 1993 hit Tombstone, a film not adored by critics upon release but one that's stature has continued to grow in the years following its initial release.Filled with one of the most eclectic and talented casts assembled in the 90's, with some of the most enjoyable turns in the career's of Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell in particular, George P. Cosmatos and Kevin Jarre's film (with Jarre doing a bulk of the early filming only to find himself fired and replaced by Cosmatos) that chronicles the events leading up to the famous shootout at the O.K Corral that featured famed Western stalwarts Wyatt Earp, Doc Holiday and Wyatt's brothers Virgil and Morgan.Overcoming a somewhat loose and scatter-gun early approach that makes it hard to care to much for anyone or anything, Tombstone finds its pulpy western groove around the half way mark with it impossible not to get caught up in the retired lawman going on one last mission quest that sees Wyatt and his gang taking it to a group of marauding cowboys who are making the lives of those living in the town of Tombstone far harder than it need be.With some of the best facial hair and swagger going around, the core cast of Kurt Russell, Sam Elliot, Val Kilmer and Bill Paxton make for some extremely enjoyable viewing with the gang of A-lister's all clearly having a blast getting to play dress-up and enact out every young boys fantasy of western life, with Russell and Kilmer in particular shining in a loaded ensemble that find themselves competing for screen-time in a loaded two hour event.There's little nuance to anything going on and little deep reflection that is prevalent in the more thoughtful westerns like The Searchers or Unforgiven, to be expected when the director tasked with finalizing proceedings is responsible for the likes of Cobra and Rambo: First Blood Part 2, but there is a prevailing sense of playfulness and energy that keeps the film ticking along, particularly when the bodies start piling up in the films latter half.Without providing anything that will make you ponder it once the credits begin to roll, Tombstone showcases how exciting and enjoyable the western genre can be, reminding us that its great to have the serious minded products but also that ones that feature Val Kilmer's Southern accent and Powers Booth wandering around with custom made cowboy boots.Final Say -A fun western that eschews anything of lasting substance to instead give us an abundance of action and sassy attitudes, Tombstone is a fun ride to the wild west with one of the best casts ever assembled for such a product.3 gun-toting audience members out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Say when!,"One of the most brilliant and impressive movies ever made.

Solid Film But Kilmer Steals The Show,"It's not to say Tombstone hasn't got much going for it, in fact it's to the contrary. The film wraps a tight package of an action filled yet emotional western that isn't sentenced to death by cliche as so many are. With a cast featuring Kurt Russell as probably the best of many Wyatt Earps, Michael Biehn in a rare and effective outing as a villain along with many, many other strong supporting performances. But Val Kilmer is something else. The humor, mannerisms and nuances of his Doc Holliday put new clothes on a well-worn role and leave unforgettable. As mentioned before, Tombstone is a solid western (it could have been the decade's best if not for the pesky greatness of Unforgiven) and movie overall, but Kilmer still manages to take it over stealing one scene at a time.Replace Pete Poselwhite with him and you would have the strongest line up of Oscar Supporting Actor nominees ever-in which he might stand tallest.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The movie is bad, really bad.  Go watch Wyatt Earp instead.","Tombstone is a horrible movie. The movie at best is Hollywood trash. Val Kilmer gives a solid performance as Doc. But if you watch the uneven Kasdan/Costner epic you will see a fantastic and far better performance by Quaid as Doc. Both are strong, but Quaid's is nearly by far more convincing and well rounded. Quaid went through major weight loss for the role and does an excellent job giving an ""accurate"" depiction of Doc. Outside of these performances both films fail, but Tombstone is much, much worse. Just watch the film with intent you can pick up some silly Hollywood crap. For god's sake, ""Peacemaker"" is engraved in Earp's six-shooter. The film is filled with factual and continuity problems as well.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It may not have a deep heart, but its a hell of a lot of fun...","The 1990s looked set to be a promising decade for the Western genre after the Oscar darlings Unforgiven and Dances with Wolves cleared up the Academy respectively in 90 and 92. Hot on the heels of those modern-day classics came two individual accounts of Wyatt Earp's legendary life as a lawman. Wyatt Earp boasted an interesting cast in Gene Hackaman, Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid with strong assistance from an excellent ensemble that included Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen. Although it was a fairly decent effort, offering a consuming account of the gunslinger's whole life from his humble upbringing and the death of his first wife to his renowned battles with Outlaws like the infamous shoot-out at the Ok Corral. It couldn't help but feel plagued by a yawn inducing 183 minute running time and an uncharismatic turn from Costner in the lead. Tombstone on the other hand, begins when Earp and his brothers move to the town named in the title and is - for the most part, a far more direct and satisfying approach.It opens with Earp ending his stint as a Kansas law officer and heading for Tombstone with his brothers Virgil and Morgan and their families in toe. Upon arrival they meet up with their good friend and Ally Doc Holliday and before long they've acquired a share in a thriving little saloon and card game. A group of ruthless bandits ironically titled 'The Cowboys', also inhabit the town and they take an immediate disliking to the retired lawman's reputation and moral attitudes. So far, Wyatt had done well to keep himself clear of any kind of feuding or trouble, but one fateful night a barbarous act forces him to arrest Curly Bill Brocious the leader of the desperadoes. This eventually results with the historic showdown at the OK Corral and a quest to rid the land from the curse of these malevolent outlaws.On his audio commentary for the Tom Cruise drama Vanilla Sky, Cameron Crowe describes Kurt Russell as 'Hollywood's best kept secret'. Showing flashes of Clint Eastwood, but without ever looking like he's trying to imitate him, he provides a competent lead and proves that there's certainly a lot of truth to that statement. From his humorous will they won't they yearnings for Jose, to his anguished rage as he screams, `.Hell's coming with me' into the stormy night sky, Russell's on top form. His excellence can't help but play second fiddle to a scene stealing Val Kilmer, who has some of the best dialogue since Mr Blonde shared breakfast with a group of crimms in black suits. Hitting a career high, it's seems surprising that the Academy didn't acknowledge such a worthy portrayal.  The camaraderie between he and Earp is one of Cinema's most pleasurable buddy pairings and no one can deny the pathos he creates in his tragic exit. His rivalry with an underused but adequate Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo is compelling and their dual makes for an irresistible climax. Dana Delaney also shines as the Marshall's 'other' love interest, but frankly with a cast studded with cameos from so many familiar faces - even Charlton Heston - you could give a gibbon the megaphone and the results would probably still feel fairly acceptable!The set locations are the standard cowboy fare, but director Cosmatos manages to make good use of them. The stormy night scenes when Morgan is attacked are crafted to create an electric atmosphere that is superbly lighted and the same can be said for the suspense made in the neatly staged shoot-outs. Clearly accomplished as an action director, Cosmatos certainly was the right Man for this rootin' tootin' ride through the Wild West. He shows a flare for building tension that runs smoothly throughout the beautifully shot set pieces.The only complaint that can be made about Tombstone is the lack of any real depth found within the story. Where as genre classics like Unforgiven offer an emotionally charged drama that snuggles so neatly with the always-ungratuitous gunplay, Kevin Jarre's story falls into the 'popcorn western' category. Along with its contemporaries Young guns or The Quick and the Dead, the movie aims more for blockbuster appeal than a deep and endearing dramatic approach. Still, fans of a six-shooter will find plenty to be impressed by - in this admirable character-led mix of gunplay, companionship, romance and even just the right amount of pathos. Fans still ask which is the better of the two accounts of Wyatt Earp's life that were strangely released around the same time. Well I guess the answer really depends on your personnel taste in movies. If you like the more dramatic western and have no problem with an epic runtime, then Costner and co's biopic maybe the one for you. However if you're looking for a 'popcorn' take on the lawman's life then you need look no further. Tombstone's your movie! It may not have a deep heart, but it's a hell of a lot of fun! 8/10",,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent epic. Wyatt Earp is an icon of the old west.,"This is a tremendous movie crammed with gunsmoke, romance and the full flavor of the old west. The life of the legendary lawman and his family is very interesting. Earp moves to rugged Arizona to start life over with his brothers. He proves to have a strong stature as a businessman, but can't get away from his legend or let it die. The elaborate gunfight at OK Corral lets the lead fly. Flawless camera work and lighting and talented ensemble cast will draw attention to this epic for a long, long time.Kurt Russell is a powerful and macho Earp. This role is almost as strong as his portrayal of Elvis Presley in a TV bio-pic. Val Kilmer is excellent in the role of Doc Holiday. Probably his best job of acting ever. Sam Elliott is a standout as Virgil Earp.Other fine performances come from Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Dana Delany, Billy Bob Thornton, Charlton Heston and Jason Priestly.This one you can watch again and again with no fear of tiring of it.The full cast and crew are responsible for making Kevin Jarre's words come alive.

Good,"I can see why people love this movie-it has a compelling story with strong performances and ends on a high note. ""I'll be your Huckleberry"" is an incredibly memorable line, and Val Kilmer and his character is one my favorite characters of all time. Kurt Russell was impressive, especially in his more intense scenes (his screaming), but it was Val Kilmer who truly stole the show. Beyond their performances, the acting didn't particularly stand out to me. The walkout scene and the major shootout were iconic moments, adding to the film's appeal. However, the romance felt overly corny, which was hard to overlook. Overall, it's a good movie, but not my favorite western.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""I guess you could say we did our good deed for the day, Mayor""","Whether or not Wyatt Earp ever made such a statement, it sounds like something we'd expect from a full-fledged western legend: short and sweet, with a trace of modesty. While Kurt Russell was not the biggest star to ever play Wyatt (Such honors go to the likes of Henry Fonda, Burt Lancaster, Kevin Costner and James Garner and the quintessential TV portrayal by Hugh O'Brian), he does a decent job with the part and Val Kilmer heads an outstanding supporting cast. Many actors have played Doc Holliday on big and small screen, the earliest I can find on the IMDb website is Harvey Clark in LAW FOR TOMBSTONE (1937), while others have included Cesar Romero,Kirk Douglas, Victor Mature, both Dennis and Randy Quaid, even Willie Nelson and Adam West.Doc Holliday has always been my favorite among all the historic gunslingers of the Old West. Earp and Hickok may have been more of the white hat sort of hero, but Doc made no pretense about having redeeming qualities, except for one: he stood by his friend Wyatt when the chips were down. No lawman or cowboy could ask any more or expect any less from a true friend. Of all the portrayals of Doc, Kilmer's version is one of the best ever done for this complex man. His pathos and comic relief that he brings to his part turned this picture into an outstanding example of its genre. In real life, the western hero was never a totally William S. Hart/Hopalong Cassidy type of good guy, but a human being with flaws just like anybody else. In fact, sometimes the flaws that a western hero has to overcome make his character all the more extraordinary and entertaining, like the Duke does with his Ethan character in THE SEARCHERS. TOMBSTONE's not in a class with the classic all-time westerns, of which THE SEARCHERS is one, but it's a good tale of how a vicious outlaw gang gets its comeuppance from two of the greatest gunfighters who ever strapped on their shootin' irons to clean up their town.

Tombstone,"There is something really quite authentic looking about this western. Set at a time when the law was beginning to seriously impose itself on the otherwise lawless ""wild"" west, it depicts the story of Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) who just wanted to retire to peace and quiet in the eponymous Arizona town. Once there, he quickly realises that his fellow townsfolk are not on the same page. The arrival of his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott), Morgan (Bill Paxton) and his lifelong friend ""Doc"" Holliday (Val Kilmer) make a confrontation with the red-sashed ""cowboys"" inevitable. This film takes it's time to develop the characters and the narrative. That's not say it is dull, it isn't - it just allows the story to breathe as the tension mounts before culminating in the legendary gunfight at the OK Corral. Russell was maybe not the best choice (though at times he reminded me of Gene Hackman); but Kilmer was oddly effective as was Stephen Lang's pretty duplicitous Ike Clanton. It's narrated by one Hollywood legend - Robert Mitchum, and features the briefest of cameos at the end from another - Charlton Heston, is well constructed and paced, and rather creatively, poignantly (and violently at times) depicts the end of an era.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A fun ride that's a little melodramatic at times,"Tombstone is a fictionalized look at the fascinating life of Wyatt Earp. And yet, to me, Kurt Russell's portrayal of the famous lawman is one of the weaker points of the movie. The real draw comes from Sam Elliot as Virgil Earp, Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocius, and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. Kilmer's sickly, yet confident swagger is impossible to ignore whenever he's on the screen. The movie starts off strong, then loses its way and wanders off the trail near the end. It's an entertaining film, but I think Tombstone bit off more than it could chew when it tried to take on Wyatt Earp's story.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ther is something about Doc Holliday n Val Kilmer nailed it.,"I first saw this in the mid 90s on a vhs. Saw bits n pieces of it umpteenth number of times on Zstudio channel. Just revisited few days back on a blu-ray.
There is something about Doc Holliday n Val Kilmer nailed it. Val Kilmer is the first reason to see this flick. He potrayed the fearlessness n daring of a man with finesse
n the second good reason is Kurt Russell who with his handle bar moustache was awesome, specially in the last river shootout sequence n the third reason is the splendid star cast, Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Charlton Heston, Michael Rooker, Powers Boothe, Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Zane, Stephen Lang n Michael Biehn as the notorious crazy Johnny Ringo. Biehns facial expression during the last confrontation was very convincing of that of nervousness n insanity. Russells facial expression after Doc tells him that he wont survive Ringos confrontation was top notch.
The dialogues r memorable, the theme of loyalty, family n friendship was good, the contrasting cinematography, from the dry set up leading to the river shoot-out n the final confrontation in the green woods. The only drawback is the romantic sub plot n the scene involving Michael Rooker, in one scene he is shown helping the lady climb the carriage along with Russell outside the safety of Charlton Hestons house n ........ u have to see to believe the scene.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very realistic Western among the best of its period,"I saw this movie for the first movie in 2014 as I was becoming a movie buff and I liked it so and so. Now, 7 years later I rewatched and I found it a bit better than the first time.This film is about the notorious gunfight at the OK Corral and all the events that led up to it. The subject had been brought in movies various times (with movies such as MY DARLING CLEMENTINE and THE GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL) but this time the West is seen in a more realistic way. In movies the West is full of shootouts, attacks by the indians and chaos in the saloons. In reality the West had lots of laws and shootouts were the exception rather than the norm. So when you go into this movie expect of reality unlike many Westerns do.This movie has a solid direction and a great cast: Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton and Kurt Russell as the Earp brothers and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday are the most relevant characters. There is a cast full of famous actors of those years in all the supporting roles: Stephen Lang, Michael Biehn, Jon Tenney, Joanna Pacula, Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Zane, Michael Rooker, Thomas Haden Church and even veterans Harry Carey jr and Charlton Heston. The soundtrack too is great especially in the end credits.

If you yahooed at the screen when you saw ""Young Guns"" you'll probably like this retarted MTV-style retelling of this classic tale. Kids, please go out and rent ""Unforgiven"", ""The Wild Bunch"", ""Once Upon A Time in the West"", ""Little Big Man"", or even ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"".

Tombstone vs Wyatt Earp,"I have watched both Tombstone and Wyatt Earp, which came out within a year of each other. Thus they offer rather vivid contrast. While they are both likable films, the former has a much more talented cast. Val Kilmer gave one of the best portrayal of Doc I have seen. He is complex, kind and cruel, careful and reckless, serious and humorous. His killing of Johnny Ringo in the woods is one of the best gun fight in movies. It is up-close and very personal so that the viewer can almost smell the blood and gun powder. I am certain that the director and writers take great liberty with history but the film is a classic western as well as a suspense thriller. The latter film tries to be more of a character study of Wyatt Earp. Here he is not the straight forward hero but a man of dubious moral conviction. Except for Costner, the cast, in my opinion, is average at best. I am particularly disappointed by Quaids' Doc performance. All the Clanton gangs seems interchangeable without individuality. The bottom line is these films are enjoyable but one is by far the better.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Dusty, Macho Gunfights and One Classic Character","Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and Earp's two brothers try early retirement, but can't seem to escape the notoriety of their gunslinging past. It's a bit on the shallow, simplistic side, but machismo levels are off the charts and the strong personalities are endlessly entertaining, bouncing around and ricocheting off one another like careless lead sprayed on a dusty street. Earp gets the marquee treatment, but there's no masking that Holliday is the story's real star. Played with an overdose of charisma by Val Kilmer, Doc is a vastly intriguing character; damaged both mentally and physically, he spends the entire film in some combination of deep intoxication and sweaty near-death, brought on by the later stages of tuberculosis. Doesn't matter. He still gets the best lines, the most memorable scenes and the densest, most complete individual storyline. A staggering, winking car-wreck of a man who's simply impossible to look away from, I'd throw him up against any of cinema's all-time greats. The surrounding film is secondary. We get a heavy dose of gunfights, shady characters and gentlemen who look cool in an absurd mustache and a duster, par for the course given the era and genre. But Doc, man, Doc elevates this film from a stylish also-ran to an absolute classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of the best westerns written and performed. Ever.,"I happened to be bored one night, flipping through channels when I finally gave up and settled with HBO, which had a movie called Tombstone coming on in just a few minutes. I never was into western movies -- until I saw this one. After having watched Tombstone all the way through and expecting to be unable to tolerate it, I found it was completely the opposite. I was drawn into the movie. The casting, the writing, it was all phenomenal.This is not a cheap knock-off of the classics or a poorly-filmed wanna-be. Nope, this is the real deal. As far as the cast goes, Val Kilmer did an excellent job in the role of Doc Holliday. He was very convincing, especially when Doc was very ill. Kurt Russell was never a favorite actor of mine, nor did I even really care much for him, until I saw him as Wyatt Earp. His performance was similar to Val Kilmer's in that it was powerful and well-delivered.Even if you hate westerns, even if you hate some of the actors... this movie is a must-see.

Dum dum dah-dum dum!!! *gunshots ring out*,"So I finally watched ""Tombstone"". It's one of those movies that's been on my list for perhaps decades and I just never got around to it. I finally did, because it really seems to have gathered a cult following long after it came out.Unfortunately I think that following is undue. I just didn't like it that much. The movie doesn't form a cohesive whole. I thought of that famous Shakespearean phrase, ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" There's a lot of gunshots, but no interesting gunfights. I kind of got tired of the sound of gunshots because they seemed thrown in at random. The movie has a romantic subplot that does nothing but provide the movie with a romantic subplot. It adds nothing and feels unnecessary.And the music. Are you familiar with the term Mickey-Mousing? It's when the soundtrack to a film is overbearing in how much it points out to you the way you're supposed to be feeling at any given moment. Plenty of '90s flicks did that, so it's not only ""Tombstone"". But I felt it more here. Maybe the musicians were trying to compete with all those bloody gunshots.What everybody talks about with this movie is Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, and it's true, it is impressive. It's probably the only thing about this movie I'll remember, truth be told. But the thing is that when a movie has a loaded cast like this one does, and you only ever hear people talk about one actor, that's not a mark in the movie's favour. The big bad here is played by Powers Boothe, a guy so awesome at playing bad guys that he single-handedly elevated a mid-tier Van Damme movie and turned it into something memorable. If he could play one of the best bad guys ever in a ""Die Hard""-rip off, what could he do here, surrounded by other professionals?Well, the answer is, not much, as it turns out. It feels like he's barely in it. The parts with him have so many other characters, so many cuts, so many gunshots, so much headache-inducing music, that it all works to distract you from it.There is another stand out in the flick aside from Kilmer, though, and that's Michael Biehn. I had never seen him play a bad guy in a movie before, and here, well, does he ever play a bad guy. The character he plays is slimy evil incarnate. The movie should have let him take centre stage.That's the problem. Not much is allowed to take centre stage here, so it's all chaotic and noisy and uninvolving. The movie has a cast like an epic, and a plot that doesn't justify it. A classic Western would have introduced the most important characters clearly and emphatically, letting you know that they're the ones to pay attention to, and then would have gotten busy with the machinations of the plot, involving you in the lives of the characters. Here, we just get some clichés like the unnecessary romance, and then a lot of music and gunshots, signifying nothing.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best in the West.,"Kurt, Val and Sam. They are the Good, the Bad and the Ugly of the 1990's. This remake immortalizes the story of the OK Corral and makes it palatable to the younger generation. All classic westerns should be remade. As of today, there are just a few, namely 310 to Yuma, True Grit, Young Guns, Jesse James and Appaloosa.Back to Tombstone. The dialogs are great, the cinematography is excellent and the casting is perfect. Val Kilmer is a killer, literally and figuratively. Kurt has a number of immortal lines. And Sam is the Sinatra of action films with his deep voice.I have watched this film, from the VHS to the DVD to the BluRay version at least a hundred times. This movie is the reckoning!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lightweight Western,"Lightweight western staring Kurt Russel as Wyat Earp and Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday. The film plays fast and loose with history (as most westerns do) but the famous OK Coral shootout is well choreographed and pretty accurate. The problem being the shootout occurs in middle of the film and nothing after matches the intensity of that one scene. But even so this film is worth a watch for western fans and the performances range from OK Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot to a surprisingly good Kilmer as Doc Holiday. The action scenes are handled well but it never stretches the genre like the better 'modern' westerns i.e. Unforgiven, Open Range etc. Overall its a slick, competent western and an enjoyable couple of hours 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Must See,"You have to see this one.  Kurt Russell is at his best, and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday gives one hell of a performance.  This is one of the best movies ever.  There is enough action throughout to keep anyone satisfied. The all star cast is second to none.  The chemistry between Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer is great, and the flow of the movie never slows down.  This is one you have to see, no doubt about it.  Best movie ever, hands down!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not bad, but remember this is The West, Hollywood . . .","The director Billy Wilder once quipped 'I've seen Paris, France, and I've seen Paris, Hollywood, and frankly I prefer Paris, Hollywood'. Many of us have seen the West in documentary photos and the West in Tinseltown Westerns, and frankly the Tinseltown West gets most people's vote despite the violence and, well, the violence.I say that because just before watching Tombstone (for the second time in 30 years) by chance I've been watching short 'What the West was really like' videos on YouTube, consisting of a great many contemporary photographs as well as information that usually doesn't come our way in courtesy of Tinseltown Western.The Westerns don't tell us of the choleras and tuberculosis epidemic, the horrific of sanitation, the often quite lethal medical 'care' at the hands of often unqualified hack 'doctors' and the very, very basic bars. In those photos the women folk are often haggard - it was a hard life - and are not done up to the nines like the lass who fell for Shane, the men dress just just like the folk back East but are a lot shabbier.They were most certainly not done up to the nines with spotless shirts and jackets and bowler hats and the 'baddies' most certainly did not glam themselves up with jingle-jangle and picturesque outfit. Gunfights were very rare indeed, as were bank robberies.The town's building were very often very basic jerry-built wooden death traps thrown up overnight. The barrooms were equally basic, their floors covered with straw to soak up spilled booze but also the phelgm drinkers spat out on the floor, ignoring the spittoons. Along the bar hung a number of towels which everyone used to wipe beer foam from their mouth and which were a major factor in spreading disease and infection.All that and more is why we prefer 'the West', Hollywood, to the rather dispiriting real thing. The closest I have seen the fictional West come to what I now know was the real thing was on HBO's Deadwood. And that is also why the second time around my enjoyment and appreciation of Tombstone was decidedly muted. The world Tombstone is 100% fantasy. Oh, well.Having said that, fantasy and a make-believe past is exactly what the punters want when the buy their movie tickets and stock up on popcorn to wait for the lights to go out. And in that regard Tombstone is as good as many such films. But don't mistake it for anything but The West, Hollywood.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Incohesive & Dissapointing,"For a movie of such regard, I was largely disappointed. Hardly feels like a cohesive movie opposed to a bunch of random scenes just thrown together. The movie barely stands together scene to scene. The dialogue is also pretty week and underwhelming and a lot of the scenes could be thrown out.There are redeeming qualities. It is entertaining in a sense and theres some good talent, but the overall direction and writing is rough.For something that is arguably supposed to be a significant leader of the overall category, I was saddened to be lost so quickly. It was painful to finish and barely held my interest.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Epic blockbuster that gets many things right,"Tombstone is arguably one of the more 'accessible' Westerns  a readily-molded popcorn flick that serves plenty of action, emotion and fun. Former hard-boiled lawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), his two brothers and his tuberculosis-infected friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) move westward and settle in the town Tombstone to retire and lead the profitable good life. This is grossly undermined by a band of outlawed cowboys who stir up a conflict with the authority.First let me say that the occasional shortcomings that 'Tombstone' has are what makes it a good film in the first place. To put it bluntly, it is a mish-mash of old 'harder' Westerns that has been filtered through Hollywood producers and softened up to a shameless blockbuster calibre. From the dramatic musical crescendo and the damsels in distress to the wide-ranging extended cameos by a big high-profile cast  it's accessible and fun and it makes no pretense about it. It is also so far into the Western genre with the dusty outback, the moustaches, the tense duel looks, the relentless alcohol-chugging and gunslinging characters that is almost tips over into camp territory.The good news is that Tombstone never quite slips that far and instead remains not only afloat but periodically extremely entertaining. At all other times, it manages solid fun. As said, hard-boiled graphic gore is kept to a relative minimum in the film which undoubtedly only makes its infrequency all the more effective. The acing is also top-notch  if a little theatric, but hey, it's Western  Russell and the others crisply retain an emotional transparency throughout and the prevalence of emotionally-charged looks among them is particularly impressive. In the ultimate showdown (that spans across the entire movie) between law-men and outlaws, the key word is tension, and Tombstone aptly plays upon the former at all times.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of the better Biographical Westerns,"Biographical Westerns are special for the simple reason that it is even more fascinating to know that all this stuff had happened for real. These were real bad-ass cowboys. That increases the importance of the movie. This particular movie is about the peacemaker and part policeman Wyatt Earp, his family and friends and his most famous shoot-out in the wild west which is now considered a historic event. All the main characters in the movie are real, the events shown have historic backing. But still, I think, the director's job is very important here. He has established all the characters in a very believable way. This movie also may be the director's tribute to all his favorite westerns. There is everything in this movie - juggling of guns, bashing at the bar, poker, alcohol, opera singer beauty and loads and loads of gun fights.Two actors - Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are very impressive from the extended star cast, especially Kilmer. He has stolen the show from everybody. This is one of the westerns where the supporting actors have done well. Overall, a full on action western with historic importance.Rating : 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kilmer's best performance by far!,"Val Kilmer plays Doc Holliday in this western about Wyatt Earp's (Kurtt Russel) fight for vengeance.

One of the All-Time Great Westerns!,"It took me about three viewings to appreciate this movie the way it deserves. Sometimes when you watch a film alone and uninterrupted you can really get ""into it"" and that was the case for me. This great western has it all: a terrific cast, great dialog, deft directing, stunning cinematography, a wonderful music score, plenty of action and even narration by the great Robert Mitchum. At 129 minutes, it moves along swiftly with no unnecessary scenes or dragging. The cast, led by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer, are perfection, many turning in their greatest performances ever, especially Kilmer and Sam Elliott. I'm not a historian, but it seemed to me to be fairly accurate in its facts. Of all its pluses, I can't say enough about the cast. Powers Booth, Stephen Lang, Michael Biehn, Billy Bob Thornton and Thomas Haden Church all portray terrific villains, while Kilmer, Russell, Elliott, Harry Carey Jr., Buck Taylor, Bill Paxton, Charlton Heston, Billy Zane and Jason Priestley are solid as the good guys. Dana Delaney, Paula Malcomson, Lisa Collins and Dana Wheeler-Nicholson are the love interests. Besides all the great western action, this film is about love, loyalty, friendship and life choices.

A VERY favorable review of a fine film.,"The mystery to me is why the Buena Vista brain trust failed to see what they had -- an incredible performance by Kurt Russell (he's so angry at one point that smoke seem to come out of his ears a la Yosemite Sam!) and an Oscar-worthy one by Val Kilmer. Were they scared of the ponderous, overlong Wyatt Earp with Kevin Costner? Did they just not watch their film? The sight of Russell, Kilmer, Sam Elliot, and Bill Paxton heading to the OK Corral is breath-taking. There's not a false note -- the wives and girlfriends, particularly the two Danas, Dana Delany and Dana Wheeler-Nicholson, are real people, not Western caricatures. The bad guys, Powers Boothe (more menacing than when he played Jim Jones), Michael Biehn, and Stephen Lang are truly scary. Billy Bob Thornton is very funny in his pre-""Sling Blade"" mode. And the wonderful narration by the late great Robert Mitchum tops it all off. I always seem to end up watching it whenever it's on. Thank Heaven for HBO, videos and DVDs -- without most of us would never have had the chance to see this fine, exciting film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tombstone is for everyone,"I NEVER watched Western movies. When they came on TV, I would have rather pulled weeds. ""Tombstone"" takes a classic plot, a little bit of history and a lot of action to pull you in. Kilmer's performance as Doc is beautiful. His palid complexion is by no means an indication of his performance. Doc puts heart into the old west, and gives tenderness to the harshness of what was. Kurt Russel made Earp come to life for me. Sam Elliot was perfectly cast, as he has the perfect rugged, western look. Though Tombstone was loose in the interpretation of fact (as Hollywood always is), it opened up the reality of what the wild west was to a whole new generation. It put Westerns back on the books and intrigued me to learn more about the interesting life and times of some of the earliest contributing members of our western United States.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautifully engaging with magnificent performances by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer,"Labeling this biopic-based western epic directed by George P. Cosmatos a classic may feel somewhat of an overstatement, but with engaging storytelling by Kevin Jarre and lively performances by such a likable cast (most notably Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer); it almost feels like one. With the Golden Age of Hollywood several decades in the rear-view mirror and the glory days of western actors like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood in the past, it seems the livelihood of the western genre has been slowly dying out with a progressing shortage of memorable or even engaging westerns outings looming year after year. However, this 90s biopic centering on the story of western lawman Wyatt Earp shows good proof that though the western genre is running low on fuel, its not out of the game yet. Set in the 1800s American West, this film tells the story of former lawmen Wyatt Earp (played by Kurt Russell) who has set to retire from law enforcement duty and settle down in the old town of Tombstone, Arizona where he reunites with his old friend Doc Holliday (played by Val Kilmer) and his brothers: Virgil (played by Sam Elliot), the town marshal, and Morgan (played by Bill Paxton), the town sheriff. Everything in town goes pretty peaceful, that is until a gang of corrupt outlaws lead by the ruthless Curly Bill Brocious (played by Powers Booth) arrive in town and cause tyranny. With the lives of their loved ones threaten, Wyatt and his gang must pick their guns back and serve justice against the unlawful gang.What do you come to expect when hopping aboard the western genre? Bearded men in ten gallon hats? Gunslingers engaging in violent shootouts? Thick Southern accents? As common tropes they are, they all of these happens to be here. But director George P. Cosmotos has much more engaging aspects to offer here than the usual western conventions. Based on an inspiring screenplay by Kevin Jarre partially based on true events, the film boasts a gripping biopic story with mostly solid pacing and charismatic characters, and ventures through the harsh odyssey of former lawmen Wyatt Earp and his call for heroism when the ones he loved become the target of corruption and the life he thought he left behind comes back to grab him by his throat. This all comes down to some bloodshed conflict between his town and the ruthless outlaws of the wild west who threaten to tear him apart. This is not to say the story doesn't offer moments of levity and humor in the midst of its overall solemn atmosphere, particularly from Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday who sprinkles in some comic relief. But the murderous outlaws are not only trouble Wyatt is gutted with, he is also caught in the unexpected love triangle with his narcotic common-law wife Josephine Marcus (played by Dana Delany) and Matty Blaylock (played by Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), which forms to a subplot this story sadly leaves underdeveloped and less dynamic than it should have been. Overall, the story is a spectacle. Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are both genuine and highly rigid in their roles, and the chemistry these leads show is equally moving, though nothing in the Oscar territory, nothing remotely disappointing. Sam Elliot and Bill Paxton are fine, but quite as memorable as the former duo in the performance department, nor is Powers Booth as the gun-slinging antagonist with a thirst of blood.Tombstone is a beautifully engaging western epic with lively performances by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer, and boasts a powerful, if flawed direction by George G. Cosmatos and a gripping script by Kevin Jarre. Though this film may be not be what I consider a masterpiece, there are plenty of reasons why this film is worth your time, even if the western genre doesn't quite spark your interest.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Rollicking, entertaining western","Rollicking, entertaining western. Focuses on Wyatt Earp and his brothers and Doc Holliday and their time in Tombstone, Arizona in the 1880s. For most people that story starts and ends with the gunfight at the OK Corral, but that event is only one scene in this movie. This shows how that was actually part of a much bigger picture, and wasn't anywhere near the end of it.Decent plot that keeps moving along at a brisk pace. Some attempts at character development, but it is mostly superficial. Dialogue can be a bit gung ho at times but is generally fine.Star-studded cast, even among the minor roles.

Val kilmer gives a masterful performance in imitating the irrepressible ""doc"" Holiday who seems to care not whether he lives or dies as long as he has a good time and looks out for his inner hero ""wyatt Earp"" doc has an almost hypocritical love for his only real friend and in turn Wyatt equally hypocritical uses his friend's obvious love of violence and cavalier attitude to life to drive home his own rules of obedience.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good but Not totally as expected,"Firstly the cast was amazing, Val Kilmer as Doc was the star of the show and extremely bad ass.The acting is top notch and all the characters are well developed and lovable. The only part I didnt like was Kurt Russels reaction at someone dying, that was kind of weird and bad. He just screams and puts his hands up to everyone and walks around dramatically. But besides that, overall very decent acting.The story and directing is where this fails for me. The movie is 30 mins too long. You go from a group of guys to fighting almost 50 or more out of nowhere. There is too many ""villains"". They also don't show who did the killing so you don't really get a feeling of hatred to one particular person. They also let one particular guy live in 3 separate occasions which was infuriating. The love interest/loss was not invested enough in Wyatts character, its just like oh yeah the other one just looks at me funny and doesn't help so I'm gonna leave her. Things and scenes just don't flow nicely. The directing just really sucked to be honest which is a shame.Overall it had great relationship building between friends. The characters are all well developed and unique which brings you joy and sadness to see how they ending pans out. The characters are the best part, it has a wholesome and nice story but the editing, film length and flow between scenes is terrible. If it didn't have such a good cast this would not be rated so high I guarantee you that.Overall If your a big fan of any of these actors or are into westerns than you will love this. This is not for everyone but I think most will like it. A great film with a great cast but sadly sub par directing and bizzare scenes that dont blend well at times.

Perhaps the most awesome western ever made.,"I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of the western genre, although the genre has definitely grown onto me the last couple of years. But even as a non-fan of the genre I've just always loved this movie.A '90's western is per definition a rare thing. Even rarer is that it's also a great one. ""Tombstone"" is a movie made in the tradition of the old spaghetti westerns but with a flavor of '90's action added to it. The end result is a great to watch and spectacular movie.Of course one of the reason why this movie is such a great one to watch is due to the story that is filled with some of the best known character of the wild west. The Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, Johnny Ringo etcetera. Everybody knows these persons, no introductions are required, which means that the story can do to them what they want without ever having to explain to much about their motivations or background. The movie is filled with well known characters, which are all portrayed by well known and excellent actors.The cast is also definitely one of the things that distinct this movie from other genre movies. The movie basically has an all-star cast but on top of that every actor is well cast as well. They suit their roles fine and make sure that the all-star cast doesn't distract from the movie its story. The cast has both well known established actors, like Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Charlton Heston, Michael Biehn, among others and yet fairly unknown actors that now are well known names such as Thomas Haden Church, Billy Bob Thornton and Billy Zane. So I say, good casting!It would be impossible to name and rate every actors performance in this movie but still I would like to mention a few. Kurt Russell works better than expected in the main part. Sam Elliott is solid as always and he delivers a powerful performance and puts down a strong character. Powers Boothe is truly great as Curly Bill Brocious, the leader of the cowboy-gang. Michael Biehn is also a great ruthless and hard tough cowboy, that also knows how to handle a pistol. Movie icons like Charlton Heston and Robert Mitchum as the narrator at the ending also show up in this movie. But obviously the one that steals the show, is Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday. It's a real shame that his performance was overlooked by the academy awards and any other award show for that matter. His performance is among the best of the '90's and definitely Kilmer's best till date.All of the characters also work well on an emotional level. It makes this movie so much more than just another western but a solid drama about true friendship, brotherhood and loyalty. The movie even manages to put a love-story into the movie, which works in a non-distractive way which is of course a real positive thing,The movie is basically filled with all of the western clichés and characters. You can say that this movie is a great homage to the good old westerns but that is also a great movie on its own. The movie is however not made in old western style but in '90's action style instead. This works surprisingly well for the movie and its story. It makes this movie perhaps the most awesome western ever made and an original one as well.The movie is filled with some great and memorable moments. Lots of those moments feature Doc Holiday. A coincidence? I think not. It proofs how utterly brilliant Val Kilmer is in his role and how well his character works out in the movie. Especially the stand-off between Johnny Ringo and Doc Holiday is one to remember.The movie might start off as a cliché filled western with nostalgic feelings but from the moment on when Wyatt's revenge starts, there is no holding back. The movie takes pace quickly and the movie turns into a non-stop action filled feast with some true awesome and well filmed moments, that are unforgettable.The way the cowboys are portrayed as a early group of organized crime is an interesting take, which works well for the story and the events in it. It also is another reason why this movie distinct itself from other genre movies.Visually the movie is great with some wonderful looking sets and costumes and a sweeping musical score from Bruce Broughton. I'll admit that the musical score is one of the biggest reasons why I love this movie so much. Broughton has composed some great musical scores over the years but yet he remains fairly unknown and underrated and mostly works on TV projects.I just totally love this movie, although I'll admit that it's not a flawless one.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
God vs Bad,This is the classic story about the god guys in the west vs the bad. I think everyone agree when I says that this is Val Kilmers best role ever.He plays the role of  Doc Holliday and he gets so into his role and gives us a rare performance that you not often see.I compare this movie to Young Guns because both of them has a great story and a lot of famous actors.Kurt Russel does also a great job as Wyatt Earp in this movie. And the movie really gives you the feeling that you are in the wild west.The Best western I have seen along with Young Guns.,,Anonymous,Biography
I'm your huckleberry,"There are two main film versions based on the life of infamous outlaw Wyatt Earp: a serious, sombre one with Kevin Costner (and a whole lot of others), and a rolkicking circus sideshow starring Kurt Russell, bedazzled with a jaw dropping supporting cast that doesn't quit. Both films are great, but if you held a six shooter to my head and demanded a preference, I'd have to give Tombstone the edge. It's just too much fun, one wild screamer from start to finish, filled with swashbuckling deeds, evil outlaws and bawdy gunfights galore. It should have been called It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World In The Wild West. Kurt Russell is in mustache mode again here, but looks younger and leaner than last year's western double feature his mutton chops starred in. Along with his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Norman (Bill Paxton) he arrives in Tombstone with a life of law enforcement in his dust and designs on retirement and relaxation. He gets pretty much the opposite though, when every lowlife bandit and villain in the area comes crawling out of the woodwork to give him trouble. Michael Biehn is the worst of them as crazy eyed Johnny Ringo, a deadly smart and ruthless killer, and Powers Boothe hams it up terrifically as drunken scoundrel Curly Bill Brocius. They are the two main causes of grief for the Earps, backed up by all sorts of goons including Michael Rooker, Billy Bob Thornton and a petulant Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton. Russell is joined by an off the wall Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday, the wheezy southern prince with a silver tongue that's constantly fuelled by booze. He gives the best work of the film, and it's fascinating to compare it to its counterpart, Dennis Quaid's turn in the other version. There's also great work from Billy Zane, Dana Delaney, Thomas Haden Church, Paula Malcomson, Tomas Arana, Johanna Pacula, Paul Ben Victor, Robert John Burke, John Corbett, Terry O Quinn, Robert Mitcham and even Charlton Heston good lawd what a cast. The standoffs, both verbal and physical, are a thing of beauty and the reason we go to the movies. Of all the westerns out there, this has just got to be the most fun. It's constantly alive, there's always something going on, a cheeky glint in its eye and a vitality in every corner of every frame, like a kid that won't sit still. Russell is a champ as Earp, a no nonsense killer, plain and simple, but a man of both style and charisma, two weapons that are equally as important as his side arms. Kilmer gets all the best lines and goes to town with his portrayal, creating electric tension whenever he faces off with Biehn, who is equally mesmerizing in a more intense way. The three of them kill it, and along with the howling mess hall of a supporting cast, make this simply the liveliest western I've ever seen in the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great Western,"This is a great western in the style of The Magnificent Seven. I am not sure if any of it is historically accurate, despite the use of real characters like, Doc Holiday and Wyatt Earp; however, it doesn't;t really matter. The strength of the movie is the stars and the performances. This is probably the best and most memorable performance in Val Kilmer's career. Kurt Russell, too, is very memorable as Wyatt Earp. Powers Boothe, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, and Michael Bien all give excellent supporting performances. The film hols up after thirty (30) years as a great Western and a great film. The Direction and Cinematography are top notch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hell's coming with me!,"While not exactly epic in scope - ""Tombstone"" does compress the passage of time a fair bit - it does do a fine job of entertaining its audience. This viewer isn't surprised to hear that it plays with the facts - such is the nature of motion pictures - but wasn't exactly expecting a history lesson in the first place. It's extremely well shot and does transport its audience to a different time and place. Everything feels very authentic, from the production design to the costume design. Granted, this gets pretty melodramatic - right after a key death has occurred, our main character is standing outside in an absolute torrent of rain. Subtlety is in short supply. But one thing this movie is not, is boring, and it fills a two hour and 15 minute run time quite thoroughly.A rock solid Kurt Russell leads an absolutely fantastic ensemble. There are LOTS of familiar faces here, although some unfortunately end up with very little to do. Russell plays the legendary lawman Wyatt Earp, who has left that line of work behind - or so he hopes. He retires to the Arizona town of Tombstone with brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) and their wives. Ultimately, fate dictates that Wyatt will NOT be able to ""live and let live"". A very scummy gang of outlaws that call themselves The Cowboys are going to become more than just a nuisance, and Wyatt will be forced to deal with them.It's the engaging and effectively eccentric Val Kilmer, as Wyatts' good friend Doc Holliday, that ends up stealing this show. Kilmer completely immerses himself in this character. Dana Delany as Josephine is an appealing love interest for Wyatt. Elliott, Paxton, and Russell make for a rather believable trio of brothers. Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, and Stephen Lang stand out among the many antagonists. As Doc says of Biehns' Johnny Ringo, he most likely wants revenge for having been born in the first place. Lang as Ike Clanton is such a worthless weasel that you keep hoping to see him get his comeuppance. It's nice to see Western veterans such as Harry Carey Jr. and Buck Taylor among the Tombstone citizens; the real Earps' namesake fifth cousin plays the role of Billy Claiborne. Robert Mitchum, whose son Chris has a tiny role, serves as the narrator.Good action scenes and visceral moments combine with some poignant elements to make for an enjoyable experience.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best westerns of the last 3 decades,"As with any movie involving the legend of the OK Corral, this is not history.  Script writers were limited only by their prolific imaginations.Kurt Russell plays a believable Wyatt Earp, Sam Elliot a phenomenal Virgil Earp, Powers Boothe a perfect Curly Bill, and Val Kilmer a bazaar Doc Holliday.  Kilmer's entertaining interpretation of the role is unlike any done before.This movie has a radical change in character at the mid-point.  The first half consists of introductions and character development.  There is plenty of action to carry the story forward, plenty of the tension of anticipating the next act of violence.  The focus is on the Earps and their friends and love interests, the Clantons and their allies, and the dynamics of Tombstone.  The second half is unbridled action, with no effort to tell a story.  There is little story left to tell, but the action sustains the adrenalin flow, keeping the viewer absorbed while waiting for the final details to unfold.Though the violence is more graphic then the westerns of the John Wayne era, gore doesn't become a co-star.  One of the best westerns of the last three decades.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Long winded,I enjoyed the movie for the most part. The characters portrayed were consistant with the wiki pages and the story wasn't hollywood changed that I could notice. The main cast was well appointed but my choices for the supporting cast would have been different. What I disliked the most about the film was the long over played scenes. The time of the film could have been cut by 20% without losing any of the storyline. This was my second viewing of this film and I totally missed the gay reference the first time around. Overall I give this film a positive rating. Worth the time to watch it.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Amazingly, worse than Costners' movie","Wyatt Earp, the hero of the famous shootout at the OK Corrall, is a fascinating character, who lived through the wildest days of the west and eventually became a friend to the actors who played him in the early westerns. The shootout itself (and Earp's subsequent trial for murder) can be seen as the story of a impudent but sorely provoked law man who was nearly stitched up by a corrupt establishment, but there's also a more interesting interpretation: that in Tombstone, many men (Earp and his brothers included) fought in defence of their own business interests; and that jobs such as sheriff or deputy (held by the Earps) or prosecuting authority (controlled by their enemies) had nothing to do with any true concept of law. I've recently seen two of the many films made about Earp's life (in fact, two films made within a year of each other in the early 1990s); but sadly, neither is particularly good. Kevin Costner even managed the unlikely feat of making Earp's life seem dull, through a leaden determination to play him as a man of frankly preposterous moral resolution. In George Cosmatos's 'Tombstone', Earp is a little less noble - but the film is clearly the worse of the two. The gist of the plot (which drops much of the interesting truth) is that Earp is a bland would-be businessman lacking even the gumption to fall in love, but when people start shooting at him for no good reason, he responds by riding around Arizona personally delivering justice to the state's leading criminals. If I hadn't known the story beforehand, I doubt it would have made any sense to me. One feature of both films is that they make play of the character of Doc Holliday, one of Earp's sidekicks; I found Dennis Quaid's take (in Costner's film) a more rounded performance than Val Kilmer's in this one (though the implausible script is more to blame than the actor).The film starts with a portrayal of a random murder just to let the audience know that the bad guys are really bad; and unfortunately, that's about as subtle as it gets. I'm sure there is an interesting, ambiguous version of the life of Earp of his comrades to be told; but I certainly didn't find it here.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Give it an 11 if I could,"This movie is chock full of amazing actors. It may not be historically accurate, but it is one of the best made modern westerns made hands down. This movie has passed the test of time and stands out as one of the best movies of the early nineties. We see Val Kilmer at the top of his game as Doc Holliday.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
10/10,"Behold, a pale horse. The man who sat on him was Death, and hell followed with him.""I can't even begin to talk about how great of a film ""Tombstone"" is and I'd have to do a Top 20 westerns list and put it up in my Top 5 as of right now. Not only has this been one that I forgot how great it is, but rewatching it today only solidified that it's truly one of the best films ever made as George C. Cosmatos directs a thrilling and dramatic story about the real life peace officer Wyatt Earp, despite Val Kilmer's claims that Kurt Russell technically directed the film on set. This cast is beyond stacked with Russell playing the main character of Earp, alongside actors such as Val Kilmer who steals the entire film as badass Doc Holliday with some amazing one-liners, Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton as brothers Virgil and Morgan Earp, Powers Boothe as the slimy Curly Bill Brosius and Michael Biehn as the equally evil and cold Johnny Ringo of the Cowboy gang and smaller roles from Billy Bob Thornton, Michael Rooker, Billy Zane, and Slang himself Stephen Lang as the massive coward Ike Clanton. The music for this film really hits hard and adds to the Old West feel of this film while the cinematography from William A. Fraker yet again paints the landscapes of the town of Tombstone with such beauty despite the very violent nature and chaos of the town and this film has some truly amazing shootouts that are visceral, intense, and have high stakes as no character feels safe at any time which makes certain deaths and near deaths hit with a hard emotional impact. The relationship between Wyatt and Doc is the heart of the film as their friendship sees both men willing to die for one another when the Cowboy gang runs a muck in Tombstone, as Doc proves to be a true ride or die pal despite his clear deadly illness and even the love triangle between Wyatt, his girlfriend Mattie, and his newfound love interest Josephine played by Dana Delany works because it represents Wyatt's internal struggle of his current life of trying to be a ""normal"" man away from his peace officer days vs. The true nature of who he is which is that of a gunman meant to run wild and free. This is yet another western that highlights the ugly nature of this life as despite how cool the cowboys and gunman look with their thick moustaches, cowboy hats, spurs, and wizardry with handguns, there's nothing but death and destruction and chaos overrides order and no matter how much you try to get away from it this life always follows you. No matter if Russell actually directed it, Cosmatos directed it, or even screenwriter Kevin Jarre directed it, this film is one of the best of the 90s and seems highly underrated if anything.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""I'm your huckleberry""","Tombstone tells the story of an aging Wyatt Earp who seeks to settle down and create some roots in Tombstone, Arizona. He is committed to changing his ways of womanizing and scuffling, in hopes of maintaining a business and a peaceful life. When you lie with dogs, however, you are unlikely to avoid getting fleas. With his gang of rascals helmed by Doc Holliday, trouble mounts. Holliday, much less committed to Earp's draw to a peaceful life seeks as much pleasure as possible, while enjoying life to the fullest. Earp's troubles go well beyond the confines of his own gang. Soon after arriving in Tombstone, Earp realizes that the cowboys that have run this town, and the law, are not willing to back down from their land without a fight. Another bright spot to Tombstone is a Miss Josephine Marcus, actress in the local theater who takes no time noticing Wyatt Earp, even though Earp tries to take his time noticing Miss Marcus. This love interest proves vital for Earp, as Josephine shows Wyatt how to seek and gain something from life, and how to enjoy it. Under attack, and unwilling to be scared away, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and the rest of the gang set out to prove that the west is left to be won for anyone. Technically, this movie is a stunning success! Set against the sometimes mountainous, sometimes open plains of the Old West, each shot is a miniature piece of art that comes together to create a magnificent mural. This film also reached outside of the box (pun intended) and minimized the screen to remind the viewer of the stretched screen format in which many classic westerns were watched on. This nod proved useful to establishing the authenticity of a western filmed in the modern day. Also essential to providing the western flair that the audience expects was the multiple extreme close-up shots of faces dispersed throughout the film. These shots help set the tone, and the mood of each character by blocking out all other visual stimuli, oftentimes leaving only the eyes visible to the viewer. Not only did this camera work set the gritty western tone, but it added benefit of seeing the character as they were going through their struggles.Tombstone proves to be an exceptionally acted ensemble piece. Anytime you have a film composed of about 30 main actors, the likelihood of one character upstaging another or one character disappearing into the background proves great. In this film, however, this problem never occurred. Each actor had at least one moment in which their character shines, and their acting is noticed. For me, the standout was Val Kilmer. It is unfortunate for Val Kilmer that what turned out to be, possibly the best performance of his career happened in a year stacked with masterpiece performances of supporting actors. When you watch Kilmer's Doc Holliday, and you watch both his health deteriorate and his drunken stupor, you see a depth to the actor that I, for one, did not know was there. When immersed in the film, it is easy to immediately state that he should have taken home a statuette that year from the dear Academy. Then, when you remember that was also the year of honoring work like The Schindler's List, you remember Ralph Fiennes' performance snub. Kilmer's acting in this film is the pinnacle of his career, and he should have certainly, at least, been nominated for it. An all-star cast came together for Tombstone and it will not disappoint. A stellar ensemble performance, wonderfully casted, and a beautiful backdrop proves Tombstone a western force to be reckoned with.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Its aim is true, even if the facts aren't","One of the many cases where there are two films covering the same subject or subject matter released by rival studios in close proximity to one another, 'Tombstone' was certainly viewed at the time as having the lesser pedigree than the supposed Oscar bait of Lawrence Kasdan's 'Wyatt Earp', but over 20 years later I think it's safe to say that the former is widely regarded as being the superior film.This is easily one of the best ensembles of the last 25 years, and standing tallest amongst the giants is Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. With so much stoic machismo on display his sly turn as Holiday gives things some much needed balance. I don't know if it's good history, but it's certainly an entertaining film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""I'm your huckleberry.""","FILM: 9.0
Rewatching Tombstone is a true delight, a film that perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the Western genre. The 1990s might not have been known for an abundance of westerns, but the quality certainly made up for the quantity. After Unforgiven swept the Oscars earlier in 1993, this gem hit the screens and left a lasting impression.Looking at the cast list feels like browsing a who's who of 90s Hollywood stardom. Leading the charge is my all-time favourite actor, Kurt Russell. His portrayal of Wyatt Earp is a masterclass in balancing the sophistication of a gentleman with the rugged grit of a lawman. Russell brings a commanding presence to the role that is simply captivating.Val Kilmer, despite his infamous ego, delivers what I consider his career-best performance as Doc Holliday. Kilmer's portrayal is nothing short of iconic; he nails every line and mannerism with perfection. Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton, both at their peak, round out the Earp brothers with solid performances that add depth and authenticity to the story.On the villainous side, Powers Boothe effortlessly exudes menace, while Michael Biehn is phenomenal as Johnny Ringo. Biehn's performance is intense and memorable, making Ringo a standout character. The supporting cast, filled with familiar faces, all play their parts to perfection, each bringing something unique to the film.Kevin Jarre's script breathes new life into a well-known story, blending epic Western elements with Hollywood action flair. The direction, whether by George P. Cosmatos or Kurt Russell stepping in, is seamless. Every actor gets a moment to shine, and the film balances action and drama with stylish finesse.While there are a few moments that flirt with schmaltz, they are so rare that they hardly detract from the overall excellence of the film. Tombstone has stood the test of time, over 30 years on, and remains a high point in the careers of many of its stars. For me, it's a must-watch that never fails to entertain.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 6.5

A last hurrah for the cheesy fun western.,"Tombstone is not sophisticated, or deep, or emotionally weighty. However it is quite special nevertheless. In a time after 'Unforgiven' supposedly killed the traditional romanticised western, for this ball of cheese and fun to have been made is a happily defiant stance for simple and fun movies. Tombstone does not deconstruct, or analyse anything within its genre. It simply enjoys itself and tells a good story.The acting in tombstone is very good, particularly Val Kilmer in my personal favourite performance of his. Kurt Russel also delivers a strong, if cheesy, performance as the standard action badass (I am aware that this is technically a biopic, however I'm fairly sure that this is not an accurate portrayal of the man). Their acting is enhanced by the cliché and simple, but well paced screenplay. The film's humour is also pretencion free and charming, hearkening back to the golden age of westerns.Despite the obviously throwback nature of this film, it doesn't feel tired. The acting and writing is still slick and modern despite keeping the spirit of the past. It really is a fun little example of how to do a silly throwback well, and still have occasional moments of weight and gravitas (once again mainly through Val Kilmer).On the downside, the film lacks a satisfying enough conclusion and in general seems to lack direction in its third act. I was also disappointing by the lack of satisfying material for Sam Elliot or Bill Paxton, two actors I genuinely like in supporting roles.Overall however, despite hardly blowing my mind or challenging me, I enjoyed my viewing of Tombstone. After Unforgiven killed the genre, for a film the brazenly cheesy to come out a year later was a big risk. In my opinion, it paid off.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kilmer steals the show,"Of the two films released within six months of each other about the life and times of American West legend Wyatt Earp, this star-studded, classically told version is an easy pick. It is a much less sprawling, much less indulgent, and much better proportioned film than Kevin Costner's critical and box-office failure Wyatt Earp. In this version directed by George P. Cosmatos, we jump into the action as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday (played by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer) reunite just before going to the boomtown of Tombstone in 1879, a year or two before that famous shootout at O. K. Corral. Tombstone succeeds quite well at the tough task of introducing its plethora of historical characters, many of whom play a secondary or inconsequential role in the story that unfolds, but for whom the filmmakers still manage to give some sort of elbowroom. And for most of its running time, Tombstone recreates that bustling, disorderly feel this world is thought to have had. Granted, the film never leaves its Hollywood roots, and you're always aware that you're watching a movie, but it's an entertaining and economical viewing experience which never tries to be something it isn't. The film is arguably better cast than acted, although that might just be the trick when you're including as many characters as this. Kurt Russell is a solid Wyatt Earp and does among his best work here, but it is Val Kilmer who steals the show with his performance as a sickly, condescending Doc Holliday.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gritty Western and a love story to boot,"Kurt Russell gives the performance of his career as Wyatt Earp in 1993's TOMBSTONE, a fairly accurate rendition of the Earp brothers adventures in a booming mining town. It's Virgil, Morgan and Wyatt versus a loose-knit gang of thugs known as The Cowboys for control of Tombstone. Things heat up after a showdown adjacent to the OK Corral, and Wyatt -- now a federal marshal -- creates a special posse including Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer in top form) and a trio of Cowboy deserters to hunt down the remaining Cowboys. Many familiar faces dot the landscape, including Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp, Powers Boothe as Curly Bill, leader of The Cowboys, and Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo, second-in-command of The Cowboys. Russell is given two women to romance in this film, Earp's drug-addicted wife Mattie (Dana Nicholson) and saloon singer Josephine Marcus (Danas Delaney) who has her sights set on Wyatt. A big production with a genuine feel for the mythical cowboy era, although the truth is more likely that the Earps and Holliday were as ruthless a gang as The Cowboys. The only concession to modern times is the Maybelline-style makeup on all the ladies and the contemporary use of the English language.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Confederacy of Mustaches,"Sometimes I wish Sergio Leone had never made any of those much-imitated Westerns. We'd be spared all those close up of faces of the sort were get here. Sometimes, instead of a choker, we find some kind of macrolens that gives us ever fleck in the subjects irises and every pore on his nose. Sometimes if a character should smile, there is a Great Wall as the screen is filled with giant Chiclets.There's that aplenty in this movie. And lots of gunplay too. Sometimes I was confused about who, exactly, was shooting whom, and why. Why, for instance, does the gang led by Michael Rooker, genuine bad guys so far, revolt against Powers Booth? Okay. Booth has been responsible for a couple of shotgun blasts thrown womensward. That's enough to turn off anyone who reeks of sensibilities the way these boys do. But why does Rooker and his gang then throw in with the Earp faction? Motivation is thrown to the winds, along with the red scarves the reformed bad guys have been wearing.I suppose the story of the Earps, Doc Holliday, and the Clantons is familiar in rough outline to everyone, so there's no need to recount it. The historical inaccuracies aren't particularly bothersome. The movie doesn't pretend to be a documentary and it's not trying to make some sociopolitical point that needs propping up by evidence.But, maybe because I missed a few minutes here and there, the movie struck me as a kind of sloppy lash-up. Were the cutters drinking an infusion of mushrooms or what? The story is all over the place. Okay -- Wyatt Earp is married to a hop head. What happens to their marriage? It just sort of fades away and Wyatt runs off with the red-headed singer.Speaking of red-haired singers, I really like Dana Delaney, but she's miscast here as a free spirit, a saloon girl, squired around by the County Sheriff. No. She's beautiful, but not in the properly sluttish way. She has great big dark soulful eyes and a tiny dimpled smile, in which her lower lip covers much of her upper lip. This woman is not an iconoclast. She is reassuringly feminine stability. And she's the only woman we get to know much about. Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) has a girl too, the exotically gorgeous Joanna Pacula, but she fades away too. The Earp's wives were almost indistinguishable to me.There are two interesting figures. One is Curly Bill, played by Powers Booth. He's neat in his red shirt. He laughs with genuine pleasure as he rips things apart and shoots out lights and he has never regretted anything in his life, a regular Edith Piaf in drag. He's the kind of guy who, after having accidentally shot a harmless well-intentioned old sheriff through the heart, doesn't seem remorseful, just puzzled. ""Aww, come on White,"" he says drunkenly, as if Sheriff White were playing a game that had gone too far. I hated to see Booth go.The other interesting figure is the tragic Doc Holliday, all pale and sweaty and coughing blood from consumption. I understand he was a kind of rotten guy in real life, a racist and all that, but he's a winning character here. He talks like a college graduate. ""Frederic f***ing Chopin."" And he will not use a short word where a long one will fit in. But we are thankfully spared any display of his medical skills. The script doesn't even get into his background enough to establish him as a dentists -- let alone a surgeon.Holliday was a surgeon in ""My Darling Clementine,"" come to think of it, which had far more in the way of historical inaccuracies. But you know what? It's a far far better movie than ""Tombstone."" There's nothing here that even remotely resembles Wyatt Earp escorting Clementine to the church service.This is okay if you're interested in lots of gunplay and not much in the way of character or humor. The photography is quite good. An item in ""trivia"" says the lightning was real lightning, and it looks it, but curiously the thunder sounds electronic, less real than the thunder of half a century ago. Nice silhouettes of funeral processions under a darkening sky. But the cinematography doesn't really save the movie from mediocrity.What led to all that violence in the Southwest was honor. Honor was a vital part of the regional Southern culture and the Western culture that sprang from it. Honor is like water. We need it, just as we need a drink once in a while. But there can be too much of it and what you wind up with is a flood that destroys communities even as it preserves dignity. Robert E. Lee had to be careful about posting his officers in the Civil War. There were so many outstanding challenges to duels that he had to be sure to keep those offended far apart.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
a good film though a bit uneven,"Wyatt Earp is a dedicated, no-nonsense lawman and expert gunslinger with a reputation that precedes him. Having recently retired after enjoying his distinguished career, he moves to the town of Tombstone, Arizona where he, along with his brothers and wild, gambling-addicted pal Doc Holliday, hope to live in peace and prosperity. Not a bad idea, but it's going to be a lot harder than they thought after they encounter a group of ruthless, volatile cowboys who draw them back into deadly conflict. Entertaining western is long and slowly paced with an ending that seems much too upbeat, but it's fun to watch thanks to lively gunplay and spirited performances. Kilmer is a scene stealer, and by far has the most fun as the wily quick draw Doc Holliday. **½",,Anonymous,Biography
Great Entertainment,"Probably one of the best Westerns to come out in the past 15 years. Right up there with Open Range, Pale Rider, Silverado, etc. It doesn't attempt to be politically correct, and doesn't try to rewrite history for the sake of a new audience. A far cry from the dark brooding and pathetically boring Wyatt Earp with Kevin Costner which came out the same year. And not as dreary as Unforgiven. The box office doesn't lie. Tombstone cleaned up just like the Earps cleared out the Clantons. And this may have been Val Kilmer's finest appearance on film as Doc Holliday.

But just like the recently discovered ""Rio Bravo"", whatever I long for in a western: male bonding, posses, powerful arcs, shootouts, romance, romanticism and 'end of an era' undertones, ""Tombstone"" WAS my huckleberry.The film isn't perfect but it's not about the flaws than the way it rises above them. Like ""Young Guns"", it sweeps its own incoherences off with such bravado that criticizing them would be like accusing someone to cheat when you have the upper hand. But for the sake of objectivity, let's get critical.There's a scene where Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton) leaves the place after his brother Virgil (Sam Elliott) was injured and two minutes later is seen playing pool before being shot. Editing-wise, it doesn't really work. I also wish the character of opium-addicted Mattie (Dana Wheleer-Nicholson) got further development. Now, one is a matter of debate: during a shootout, Wyatt (Kurt Russell) runs through the enemy fire without getting a single bullet. This scene is the height of improbability, but who said it was incompatible with awesomeness?Now, let's get back to the good stuff, pretty much everything else.In the late 18th century, ""Tombstone"" became the furthest limit of the conquest of the west, the arena where civilization and barbarity met for the ultimate duel, the symbolic spot where violence had its ugliest ambassadors buried. In an opening sequence using early black-and-white Western footage, a narration from Robert Mitchum mentions the Red Sach Band named 'Cowboys' as one of first crime organizations in America. Their leaders were ""Curly Bill"" Brocius (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn).When the Cowboys turn a wedding celebration in Mexico into a bloody massacre, symbolism couldn't have been more eloquent. Cowboys have no ethics whatsoever, being to the West what the Huns were to civilization, spreading their own law (or lack thereof) through mindless violence. On the other side, you had' townspeople, settlers, those with interests to protect, it's no coincidence that the first thing the Earps do at Tombstone is open a business, or that Wyatt (Kurt Russell sporting the only mustache to rival Elliott's) hits back a man who was hitting his horse. This is civilization speaking, settlers vs nomads, settlers who would respect their animals.But it's no tender foot Wyatt is setting at Tombstone, he knows it's a place where it takes a little more than a badge to sing the Gospels of Law (and the old marshal played by Harry Carey doesn't seem to possess the makings of a ruthless lawman). But Wyatt knows when to show his teeth and call a bully's bluff. In one of the film's best scenes, he shuts Bob Thornton down after three slaps and one-liners that I'm sure Eastwood would have loved to deliver. Just like that, he gets a business. You can't make it in the Old West by playing Mr.-Nice-Guy and with hell-raisers as rivals, you've got to remind them that hell might be coming with you as well.It's a truly Darwinian world, where at any point in his life, a man must show what he's got. On that level, the 'right stuff' is fully embodied by the eccentric and dandy-looking Doc Holliday, played by Val Kilmer... simply his greatest role. Oscar-worthy. Every line he says is an item of cinematic memorabilia. Now, this is a man dying of tuberculosis, with the utmost respect for Wyatt Earp, and so when his friend is the target of provocations, Doc is more than happy to 'oblige' the bad guys by retorting. Whatever it is: death wish or friendship, it gives him the edge.It's interesting that the Cowboys aren't all trigger-happy blood-thirsty savages, Johnny Ringo is clearly intimidated by Doc. Billy Clanton (Thomas Haden Church) is all talk, too and when his brother Ike (Stephen Lang) threatens the Earps who are clearly outnumbered, Wyatt points his gun on his forehead and promises that no matter what, he'll die first. He can tell he doesn't bluff.In that symphony of threats and bullets, the film leave some room for a romance between Wyatt and theatre actress Josephine (Dana Delany). Their courtship could have been made of banality but Josephine knows what she's looking even if it's not ""ladylike"". She also knows that a woman must rise above the manners of her gender to get what she wants. She dares ask a disoriented Wyatt ""what are your dreams?"" ""are you happy"" and the last time I was so hooked by a romantic dialogue was John Wayne and Angie Dickinson in ""Rio Bravo"".But besides the romance and the whole vendetta ride between the Cowboys and Earps' posse, the friendship with Doc is what made the film. This is one hell of a bromance that will get even the most hardened heart melt, and Kilmer's performance is integral to it. With bloodthirsty and perpetually angry enemies like Ringo, the survival of civilization depended on the fittest to embrace it and the quickest to draw. Doc and Wyatt had it, minus the health for Doc. And if it's a foregone conclusion that Wyatt would triumph, what he offered wasn't the legend but the narrative that allowed cinema to romanticize the genre.Hey, the good guys won, didn't they?",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Less Grand, but Tauter and Leaner","In the cinema, as in other areas of life, one occasionally comes across odd coincidences. There were, for example, two unrelated films about the life of Oscar Wilde in 1960 and two biopics of Coco Chanel in 2008/09. In the early seventies two Hollywood studios were working on disaster movies about skyscrapers on fire, but in this case the coincidence was discovered early on and the two studios joined forces to produce the film known as ""The Towering Inferno"".The near-simultaneous appearance of two films about the life of Wyatt Earp and the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1993/94 might seem like a similar coincidence, but in fact there is a more logical explanation. Kevin Costner, the star of ""Wyatt Earp"", and Kevin Jarre, the scriptwriter of ""Tombstone"", originally planned to make a movie together on this theme, doubtless inspired by the success of Costner's own ""Dances with Wolves"" and Eastwood's ""The Unforgiven"", which gave promise that a revival of the Western was possible in the nineties. After a disagreement, however, they went their separate ways to make their own separate films.""Wyatt Earp"", the film which Costner was to make with director Lawrence Kasdan, is a grand, sprawling three-hour epic, and Jarre, who was originally also the director of ""Tombstone"", had ambitions to produce something in the same vein. The studio, however, were worried by the potential cost of the project and wanted something shorter. Jarre was sacked as director when shooting fell behind schedule, George P. Cosmatos was brought in to replace him and extensive cuts were made to his script.As the title suggests, the film is (like ""Wyatt Earp"") based on real historical events in, Tombstone, Arizona during the 1880s, although it takes some liberties with strict historical fact. Wyatt Earp has recently retired as a peace officer and moves to Tombstone with his brothers Virgil and Morgan, seeing it as a place where he can settle down and pursue his business interests. Of course, he quickly realises that Tombstone is just as wild and lawless as the towns, such as Dodge City, in which he made his reputation and that his services will be required against a band of outlaws called the Cowboys who are terrorising the town.I think that Costner is better than Kurt Russell (here virtually unrecognisable behind that huge moustache) as Wyatt Earp; Russell never quite brings Costner's power and sense of the heroic to the role. ""Tombstone"" does, however, have one outstanding acting contribution which comes, rather surprisingly, from Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. I say ""surprisingly"" because, before seeing this film, I had always regarded Kilmer as a well-muscled action hero rather than as a serious actor. Holliday was (as the film points out) a complex character, a Southern gentleman-turned-dentist-turned gambler-cum-gunslinger and, unlike many of Kilmer's characters, was not physically strong- indeed, he was seriously ill with tuberculosis at the time of the events depicted here and did not have long to live. Kilmer's characterisation brings out many of the complexities of his character; his Doc is simultaneously gentlemanly, effete, soft-spoken, ruthless and shrewd. The driving force behind him is his close friendship with Wyatt Earp; he is not a man with many friends, but is unquestioningly loyal to the few that he does have. Among the supporting cast I liked Sam Elliott as Virgil and Dana Delany as Wyatt's mistress (later his second wife) Josephine Marcus.Kilmer, strangely, was not Jarre's first choice to play Doc. That would have been Willem Dafoe, but in a curious piece of censorship the studio, Buena Vista, refused to distribute the film if he was cast because of his role in the controversial ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" which had appeared several years earlier.Cosmatos only directed a handful of films during his career, and the only ones I had previously seen were ""Escape to Athena"" (which I disliked) and ""The Cassandra Crossing"" and ""Rambo"" (both of which I disliked intensely). I was therefore pleasantly surprised by ""Tombstone"", a far better movie than any of those. The pace does sometimes flag during the second half, a legacy of the decision not to make the Gunfight the climax of the film (as is done in some versions of the story) but to go on to tell the subsequent history of the Earp brothers and their enemies. Overall, however, Cosmatos succeeds well in the difficult task of taking over somebody else's project and then, at the behest of the studio, turning it into something quite different from what was originally envisaged. His version is less grand than Kasdan's, but tauter and leaner, and can stand comparison with it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
After seeing watching this again today...,"... i wonder why this movie did not receive one academy nomination.  This movie moved me when i first saw it in theater.  And while watching it today on cable I was reminded of the amazing transformation Val Kilmer underwent in this film.  If not for Kilmer then for SOMEONE in this film for setting the stage in some form.   The camera work alone captured the beauty and color of the dessert.  I don't want to ramble on, all i wanted to say was every time I see this film (this is one that can be seen over and over) i ask myself, how could this film not be nominated on some level!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Tom Mix Wept""","A huckleberry of a Western, ""Tombstone"" is quickly paced, full of gunfighting and memorable lines and mustaches and features an outstanding cast--especially Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday, but even the small parts feature actors who'd later become well-known, like Billy Bob Thornton getting slapped around by Kurt Russell's Wyatt Earp--all of which surely contributed to its continued success after theatrical release in its life on television and home video and for standing out in a crowded field of cinematic portrayals of the O. K. Corral gunfight, including John Ford's ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946) starring Henry Fonda and Kevin Costner's twin film ""Wyatt Earp"" (1993). It's also surely why I find it eminently rewatchable and have, indeed, seen it a few times now. Upon this latest occasion, what especially strikes me doesn't have anything to do with its touted relative historical authenticity, which I would hardly know much about anyways, but, rather to the contrary, how intentionally mythical it is.The first two scenes establish the two central conceits to this mythopoeia: biblical and cinematic. The first one is an introductory sort of film-within-the-film narrated by legendary screen actor Robert Mitchum and made up of grainy, flickering footage in the (imagined) style of nickelodeon-era films--indeed, is made up partly of them, such as that very first great Western film ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903). The second scene is at a church, where a massacre of retribution and an assault on law takes place (it's during a Mexican lawman's wedding) and Bible verses are recited in Spanish. So, right from the start, the history of the American West is conflated with its cinematic legacy and the Church with that of the law.Wyatt Earp is treated as a Christ figure, with talk of a reckoning and walking on water. He's the reluctant savior of law and order, pulled away from that capitalistic American Dream of financial and family gain and, more interestingly, from a more theatrical temptation. The business with the troupe of actors here, including the vaudevillian Shakespeare and, aptly enough, Faust, is great. It reminds me of the similar play-within-play structure of ""The Seventh Seal"" (1957), another highly reflexive and religious picture. Moreover, Earp is literally tempted to abandon his wife and gambling business by an actress playing the devil. The biblical and godly talk, too, runs throughout the proceedings, including the brother's discussion of the Spiritualism that was in vogue around the time. One character doesn't see the light upon death, while it's suggested that another, whom one might consider the seemingly more unredeemable sort, does--and after consecutive visits from the Church and from art, the latter via a pamphlet written by another character. And the simultaneously artistic and religious allusions continue until the last line, ""Tom Mix wept,"" referencing by way of a silent film cowboy star the famously shortest verse in the King James Bible, ""Jesus wept.""None of this seems especially evangelical, though, at least not in the sense of established religion. It's no William S. Hart Western silent film, which were usually explicitly set up as a struggle for Hart's good bad-man character's Christian soul. No, this is the Wild West as memorialized by the church of cinema. A deconstruction of the genre not in the fashion of revisionist Westerns since Ford's ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962) and continuing through Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" (1992), but rather for a reconstruction of a traditional, even worshipful, picture of the American Frontier. That's not to say it's an entirely uncomplicated picture. It's, after all, an entertaining shoot-'em-up that ironically initially arose from a defense of gun control. The other big cameo from a legendary Hollywood star here is amusing in this respect, or at least I think so, as it was some five years after Charlton Heston played a rancher aiding gun-control lawmen in ""Tombstone"" that he became president of the National Rifle Association. And, the film's Jesus dances with the devil. Historical authenticity as mythology. Cinema is a contradiction; yet, that only makes my devotion to it stronger.Plus, seriously, Kilmer is very good. Like his Doc here, the infamously ""difficult"" actor must have few friends in the industry to not receive an Academy Award nomination for this--I mean, he should've got the Oscar--but at least a nomination. I probably didn't think about most of what I discussed in this review in my prior viewings of the film because I was so taken aback by Kilmer's performance. In anticipation of his upcoming ""Val"" documentary, this was the role I wanted to see again. He's incredible.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Testosterone,"""Talent"" in tall tales where a powerful cast give their all to convey a fun and thrusting testosterone fuelled treatment of Wyatt Earp and his full throttle Earp and Clanton pals.This film has a fabulous production design and high production standards which reflect well on all the crew: there are plentiful props, sets, locations, extras, a large speaking cast of players, impressive costumes and make up.The cast have fun giving their roles life: they are tragic and comedic figures, eccentric, charismatic, colourful and loud and the cast all embody these roles with the conviction that the writing requires.The plot has a straightforwardness to it, with a character driven introduction to the Tombstone residents, followed by action orientated narrative force once the piece has been established.The film is style and little substance but it does give all its characters a prominence and a poise which is eye catching and memorable. There can be few films that would so obviously become cult classics after release as 'Tombstone'.I rate at 6/10 for the sheer panache and endeavour. I recommend to fans of films such as 'The Quick and the Dead' and 'Open Range'; 'Tombstone' can hold its own in such company because it has plentiful machismo testosterone in its form and mood, combined with emphatic production craft, and a stellar 90's cast perfectly hewn for this type of tale.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Superior retelling of the OK Corral gunfight,"The legendary gunfight at the OK Corral has been addressed several times on film; this is a well designed and faithful retelling of the story.For the 1990's, this was remarkably old-school western in its approach. The larger than life Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell, sporting a giant mustache) and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer, also mustachioed) are portrayed as the legend paints them: heroically brave, with only traces of dented halos. Both Russell and Kilmer occupy their respective roles as these historic gunfighters with exuberance and urgency. Sam Elliot and Bill Paxton are great as the remaining Earp bothers, Virgil and Morgan.The movie, like most of the other versions of the OK Corral story, elects to take poetic license to inflate the legendary characters and events of Tombstone. One of the Earps and one of the Clanton gang gunmen are missing, and the order of a couple of events have been changed in chronology. A couple of items are omitted, and a couple others fabricated. However, the deviations from history are negligible and easy to overlook, as the movie's focus on developing the main characters is thereby enabled. There is good insight to the souls of Wyatt and Doc, and what they stood for. The steadily mounting animosity between the two camps, and how it is exacerbated with each skirmish, is presented well.The gunfight itself is strategically handled, and realistic. Events before and after the fight are also developed and showcased well. A fine movie for history buffs or western fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mega-Turkey Western.,"I like westerns as much as anyone but this movie is a gigantic failure.  It doesn't even feel like a movie.  The actors are more like wax museums figures somehow brought to life.  But it's not really life, just a string of carefully constructed scenes that serve only the purpose of being a scene. Like the whole movie was made to serve up a lot of still shots for lobby cards.  What blows me away the most is all the praise for Val Kilmers performance as Doc Holiday.  His pathetic attempt at a southern accent is excruciating to watch.  I don't know how he did it with a straight face.  To all you yankees up north, let me assure you that no one really talks like that (except in Hollywood).I know a lot of people will disagree with me but I have to call it as I see it.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

Tombstone Review,"Tombstone is possibly one of the best movies written about Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) and his brothers, Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan(Bill Paxton). The film begins in 1879 with Wyatt and family arriving in Tombstone, Arizona. Wyatt comes to here to be retired, however he doesn't get the peace he wanted. The violent cowboys led by Curly Bill (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) run the town and have in a state a of lawlessness. Soon it became a showdown at the OK Corral between the Earps and The drunken gambler Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer) against a ban of the cowboys. After that the war continues until only one side is left standing. Kurt Russell brings a great deal of heroism to Wyatt. He does extremely well in scenes where he uses his reputation to make other men back down. The cowboys parts are played quite well also from Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) The coward to Johnny Ringo the fastest gun in the west. The real star of this film has to be Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday. His lines are all said with a sort of sly confidence. This is what make his character s great in the movie. His Smart and witty which brings in humor to his part. He brings out one of the best roles played in this film. Tombstone is definitely a grade A movie. From the intense action to the humorous remarks from Doc Holiday. One of the top films of its time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Just a lot of shoot em up nonsense...but I guess that was the idea. I suppose it was a good popcorn movie. But nothing that should be taken for historical accuracy. That's Kevin Costners job.Yes, the Doc Holliday part was great played by Val Kilmer. But I'll admit I found Kurt Russel a strange Wyatt Earp. He didn't seem to embody Earp.

I have seen just about every major actor in this movie in other roles and none of them have lived up to thier roles in tombstone.  This is undoubtedly the best performances of Kurt Russell's, Michael Beihn's, Sam Elliott's, Powers Boothe's and Bill Paxton's careers.  It is amazing that all you have to do is slap a killer mustache on Kurt Russell and its like your looking at an actual photograph of the real Wyatt Earp.The main characters aren't the only ones carrying the weight.  Surrounded by an amazing cast of supporting actors are Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Zane, Jason Preistly and the long-time Hollywood favorite Charlton Heston and even Robert Mitchum's voice is familiar for the narration.The accents are extraordinary. Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday is superb, with the best accent of any of the actors in the movie.With the exception of the Blues Brothers there isn't a movie with so many classic quotable lines.  Doc Holliday and Curly Bill have some particularly memorable dialogue.The scenery and cinematography are great. I am a huge fan of the old western's but I have to admit the special effects and cinematagraphy are extraordinary in Tombstone.The biggest complaints I've heard about this movie are because of its seemingly historical inaccuracy.

Sam Elliott can always be counted on for his contribution to a western. This is always the movie we break out on a winter afternoon and the whole family goes along for the ride!

Simply awesome.,"This is a great piece of cinema that is sadly often overlooked. In Tombstone, we have a great story (no matter how many times it has been told) with amazing actors put together by some terrific filmmakers. Kurt Russell is here at his best alongside a powerful supporting cast including Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton (the two Earp brothers) and a show-stopping Val Kilmer. Honestly, this is one of Kilmer's best roles - he has such a presence on screen that he steals every scene he's in. These actors alone would make it great, but we also have a raging Powers Boothe and the cold, calculating Michael Biehn and even a worthwhile appearance by Charlton Heston. Wow!This movie is worth it just to see these fine actors in their prime. Their performances are truly great. That aside, the story told is not as epic as it is extremely well-rounded. It doesn't over-achieve, but instead is told with heartfelt skill and emotion. It's just darn good!Get the extended DVD if you can.

This can't be a western!,"This can't be a western, because I hate westerns, and I LOVE this movie! It's a powerhouse film of sheer acting talent, with Val Kilmer in what is undoubtedly his finest performance (overshadowing his triumphs in The Doors and the more recent The Salton Sea), the always enjoyable Bill Paxton, the rock-steady Sam Elliott, and a surprisingly intense Kurt Russell.  Dana Delaney is also stunning, striking the perfect balance beween the free spirit and the vulnerable artist, and making even the most jaded man-of-the-world's heart melt for her.  Michael Biehn's villain is chilling, and it's such a treasure to see this journeyman character actor show off his dark side for once. My only complaint about this film (other than wanting it to last forever!) is the direction, which is sterling in most cases, but fails to maintain the various moods in the different ""acts"" of the film.  The audience feels the foreshadowing of evil a bit too early, and then the intensity of the hunt-and-slaughter episode leading to the climax is broken by a lack of sufficient atmosphere.  Bear in mind, however, that this inconsistency is not enough to ruin the film, only a minor blemish in what is otherwise a triumphant success. No, this is not a western.

`Why Johnny Ringo..looks like someone just walked over your grave.',"I can't say enough about this movie...pure and simple. There are so many aspects that I like about this movie that it's difficult to even cover them in a review, but I'll try.First off, the cast is second to none. Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, and Michael Biehn are the definite standouts here. All give absolutely unforgettable performances and are complimented and multiplied by the rest of the cast which contains some big names in it's own right. Paxton, Elliot, Boothe, Zane, and on and on. The list never seems to end. This movie is a pure joy to watch even if just for Kilmer and Biehn, the two badasses. Kilmer plays the drunk and formidable Doc Holiday, while Biehn plays the deranged, demented and very dangerous Johnny Ringo. Their eccentric characters taunt each other throughout the film, alluding to an inevitable showdown..Tombstone is probably more of a guy's movie than a gal's. I mean, one of the main reasons to watch this film is just to see how badass all of the characters are, and trying to decide who is more badass and who has the coolest lines. I feel like scratching my balls and lifting up one cheek to let one rip just thinking about it. But that's not to say the ladies won't like it, it's just that it's kind of testosterone laden.which rocks because it's not overdone. The dialog in the film just reeks of badassness. I can remember more quotes for this movie than almost all that I've seen, and understandably so. `I want your blood, and I want your soul..and I want 'em both right now! Don't any of you have the guts to play for blood?!' `I'll be your huckleberry.' YES. Or, `You smell that? Smells like someone died.'Tombstone is an adapted story from real life events that took place before the turn of the 19th century. Of course not all of it is true as it's adapted, but it's cool to think about the fact that something very significant happened back then, enough so to be remembered 100 years later and worthy of the basis for a film.The sets are really impressive here and definitely have the boom town feel to it that the creators were going for. That goes for the costumes as well. The whole atmosphere of the film is executed quite nicely and is believable. I watched the special edition disc on the dvd and was impressed by the fact that they built the entire town just for the movie, and that it wasn't just some set that's been used in other movies somewhere along the line.Tombstone never tries to be more than it is. It reaches epic status by keeping it simple. The movie is about the characters, and all are impressively created and depicted. And because of that, it is an epic for me. And epic of great acting and excellent characters. It's because of this that the movie has such a high replay value and is a wonderful edition to anyone's collection. It's a very pleasing movie experience that can be returned to time and time again.An absolute must for Michael Biehn and Val Kilmer fans.`Fight's not with you Holiday' `I beg to differ sir..play for blood remember?' `I was just foolin' about.' `I wasn't.' `Alright lunger.' `Say when..'",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Jon Monsarrat review:  a little slow, more a drama than action","OK, let me admit it up front. I'm an action movie guy, and I don't have a lot of patience for dramas. It isn't that I'm anti-intellectual. I just don't have the art school training to appreciate some of the subtleties if the main storyline is slow or melancholy.That's how I found Tombstone: a fascinating true story that was just a little too slow for me. There was amazing acting, especially by Val Kilmer, but I guess I wish they'd spent a little less time on the backstory of the heroes. For anyone who thinks a true to life story can't be made more gripping, check out ""October Sky"", which is a true story about some kid who builds rockets -- but it is Fascinating with a capital F. Same with Almost Famous and Apollo 13.Who should see this film:-- drama types, go for it-- western lovers, most definitely-- action movie buffs, but only on a rainy day unless you have a western or historical interestI'll give Tombstone a solid but not impressive 6 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A pretty good western from more recent times,"Ah the old west...we always romanticize about its wonders with all the sex alcohol and murder going on but we somehow make it though having it look like something out of a black and white Disney fairy tale. In more recent years the westerns have been darker in nature especially so after the Clint Eastwood era. Tombstone is somewhere in the middle of all of this.Well we are welling the story of Wyatt Eart and Doc holiday taking on the outlaws of the OK Corral. We have all the things that make our western's fun such as the violence and the drinking and the sex (well more implied). It also tends to have the oddly clean feeling that we got in the other old day westerns were most of the heroes cleaned their suits regularly and not like the Clint Eastwood type westerns where everything is covered by a level of dirt.The acting was very well done though I really wasn't' that impressed by Kurt Russels performance it like his character was more wooden than the others. Of course he was probably overshadowed by Val Kilmers spectacular performance of Doc Holiday, only Robert Downey Jr. Could have played the character better.The movie is easily watchable and though it clocks a little over 2 hours in length we can forgive it as you are entertained most of the time. The action is good but not overwhelming so you tend to not get bored easily.Is you are a fan of the old style westerns or like a little more gutsiness behind it this is a good movie to enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""I'm your huckleberry. Why Johnny Ringo, you look like somebody just walked over your grave.""","The film is loosely based on real-life events that took place in the 1880s. The film does take a lot of liberties over real-life events: compressing timelines, basing the characters on newspaper accounts, and fictional dialogues. However, the film is still impressive. The whole film is about how Wyatt and his brothers try to settle for a normal life but ultimately find themselves trying to have peace and order. The first act does seem slow, but after the Earps settle down in Tombstone, it gets good.The characters Wyatt and Doc are both really great in this. Wyatt goes through this ordeal and finds what he really wants as well as how to live.Doc Holliday: What did you ever want?Wyatt Earp: Just to live a normal life.Doc Holliday: There's no normal life, Wyatt, it's just life. Get on with it.His arc is supported by Doc Holiday and Kilmer's brilliant performance. Other than Kilmer, I thought that everybody had good performances, especially Russell. I would say that other characters may have gotten less screentime and may deserve some more time, especially Virg and Morgan.If you're looking for a historically accurate film, this isn't for you. However, Tombstone is a great and very entertaining Western film. Even if the first act starts slow, it's emotional and well-written, has great characters, and has great performances that make me want to watch again soon. Say when.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Even rather mystified by all the wows and adulation,"I had expectations after reading comment after comment about enjoyment of this film and about its ""historicity"". However, I was appalled at it from the very beginning. I tried to stick it out but finally had to bow out after I somehow managed to get to 103 minutes. Looks like less than one percent gave it the minimum rating of one star, so I suppose that then gives me something to think about regarding human differences. Maybe if I had read where even just one person wrote something about a Hollywood treatment with its typical dramatization, costuming, and storyline, I might have passed on it. I recognize that many people like extreme melodrama, fancy gun twirling, very over-done shoot'em up and down gunfights, guns that don't run out of bullets, and much larger than life good-guy heroes and their extreme opposite, and the romance that gets tossed in, but I do not. And for something historical I prefer something somehow somewhat believable. And maybe even something somewhat original but that is certainly not the case with Tombstone. I recognize that most people enjoy films like this one, and I write these comments for the benefit of those who know what I mean by a terrible Hollywoodization and perhaps spare them a possibly excruciating experience.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
R.I.P.,"George P. Cosmatos' film `Tombstone' is a true work of art for a western. The movie is filmed in the sophisticated town of Tombstone.  Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), a retired `peace officer' from Kansas, moved to Tombstone in search of making money and starting out as a new man.  He is joined there by his two brothers, Virgil and Morgan and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer).  While Wyatt and his brothers are enjoying making money and playing pool together an infamous gang called the Cowboys are causing violence in the so called `sophisticated town' of Tombstone.  During the movie the audience is given clues that will soon lead to the rebirth of the `Peacemaker.'The Earp brothers were offered by the town mayor to become the marshals of Tombstone after the town marshal was shot by a Cowboy.   After Wyatt finds out that his brothers accepted the offer, he becomes enraged.  However, he sticks up for his brothers and becomes sworn in as a deputy marshal of Tombstone.  After many quarrels with the Cowboys, Virgil was severely wounded and Morgan was killed.  The furious Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and three ex-Cowboys go on a killing spree of every man that bears the red sash of a Cowboy.  This shows the audience why the noted U.S. marshal Wyatt Earp got his nickname the `Peacemaker.' In this movie, Kurt Russell had an awesome performance as a gallant lawmaker of the Wild West. George P. Cosmatos deserves the '2 thumbs up' for this film. This movie keeps the audience wondering who will run the `sophisticated' town of Tombstone, the Cowboys or the `Peacemaker.'  This is a must see movie for all fans of western movies.",,Anonymous,Biography

I can't say how many times I've watched it from beginning to end like it's the the very first time. A movie doesn't get much better than that, but Tombstone does. The best time was when two of my best friends and I, were on a motorhome trip back in the early 2,000s. We spent a clear cold night in a RV park just outside Tombstone. I'm telling you what. The sun does set just like the sunset shot in the movie. A fantastic first rate cast at the top of their games. The camera captures the beautiful desert and mountains of Southern Arizona. There are so many great lines said by Russell and Kilmer. My favorite is "" Tell them I'm coming. You tell them I'm coming and hell's coming with me.. I hope to someday steal that tag for myself.

Powerful Characters in possibly the best western ever made,"There are very few films that blow me away and still keep me in awe hours after watching it. Tombstone is one of the few. The action scenes were wonderfully captivating and the scenery and costumes were splendid but I believe it was the acting and the characters portrayed that hit me so hard and the biggest reasons why I love this movie so much. First of all Doc was amazing and Val Kilmer should have gotten more praise for his portrayal of the quick-shooting, great-one liner Doc that I continue to adore to this day. The loyalty, friendship and brotherhood emanated between himself and Wyatt and their scenes together were just incredible. Kurt Rusell was perfect for the role of Wyatt Earp and I believe he played the part of this historical character the best out of any other actor playing the role. My favorite line in the whole flick is a quote of Doc's of course ""I got two guns one for the each of ya"". I also love it when Wyatt beats this guy, who was beating a horse and just gives him that hard look and says ""Hurts doesn't it?"" Dana Delaney was wonderful as the spirited Josephine and her scenes were all charming especially the love scenes with Wyatt. I especially love the part when he finds out she played the devil. And the crowning touch on this movie is how historically accurate it is. Excellent movie.The best western ever made (in my book). Four stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A gritty, realistic portrayal of the old west",This is a great western. Similar to the style of westerns I grew up with in the 1950's. Kurt Russell was convincingly deadly in his face down with a few who had it coming. Val Kilmer was both humorous and pathetic as the diseased and dieing Doc Holiday. I felt all of the actors were convincing and believable. This is certainly one of the better modern day westerns. Wyatt is portrayed as wanting to avoid being a lawman because he saw the risks as outweighing the benefits. It is others and circumstances that draw Wyatt into being a lawman and later he is incensed to the point of revenge bordering on lawless behavior himself. Dana Delaney provides an interesting distraction for our hero. The shootout is portrayed quite well and of course we know the outcome.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not Very Good,"I cannot believe people actually compare Tombstone to Wyatt Earp and I doubt many people know that Tombstone was offered to Kevin Costner first (Entertainment Weekly magazine article). He was obligated to go with the Kasdan version because he was already committed. So what happens? The Tombstone version was rushed at movie viewers faster than the buffalo ran in Dances With Wolves! How many people want to see two different versions, one much longer than the other? Me, for one. I think Tombstone is bad, and not in a good way. The performances are comical at times. Kurt Russell does OK in the role. Val Kilmer is terrible as Doc Holliday. Dennis Quaid nailed that role to perfection. Joanna Going is a beautiful Josie Earp and Dana Delaney is just OK. The entire cast of Wyatt Earp are so good and believable, you actually feel like you're in the room with them and seeing history play out before your eyes. Maybe some truths were stretched. Unless you were actually right by the real Wyatt Earp's side to know this, you can't say for sure. Bottom line is Tombstone is only a five for me while Wyatt Earp earns the full ten points.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Peak Western,"Tombstone is an all time great western that tells the familiar story of a town besieged by cowboys with few morals and those who are brave enough to stand up to them. What makes this rendition feel distinct is the nastier edge in which the story is told as the shootouts that break up the warmer moments of bonding are noticeably bloodied than usual. It's masculine melodrama with most of cinema's best moustaches on full display.From his very first scene Kurt Russell is so likeable and cool. He's given plenty of badass lines that he's able to deliver effortlessly and he imbues his version of Wyatt Earp with loads of humanity to balance it out. Sam Elliott being in this is just perfect casting because few actors feel as at home in this genre as he does and Bill Paxton playing the most innocent of three brothers works wonderfully since he brings so much empathy.Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday is a serious contender for the coolest character in all of cinema. His badassery is unmatched even in this film, enhanced by a genuine affection for Wyatt allowing him to be vulnerable. Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn excel as the main villains. They're so easy to hate because they always find a way to sink lower and the same applies to most of their henchmen, especially a very cowardly Stephen Lang.Whether it's Kurt Russell's or George P. Cosmatos' direction, it fully embraces the melodrama of it all by doing the biggest scenes with minimal subtlety and maximum emotion and there are some great montages. Tombstone itself really feels alive as well thanks to the extras and generally faultless production values. Composer Bruce Broughton brings a classically sweeping score that gets deservedly triumphant towards the end.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A True Western,"Unlike many of today's westerns, Tombstone reaches back for that something extra to turn out a western in a way that would make Howard Hawks stand up and cheer.

Thornton and Michaels Biehn's showdown with Kilmer is worth the Rent/Buy of the movie alone. Russell, Elliott & Paxton turn in great performances as the Earp Brothers.

You're a daisy if you do miss this film,"Val Kilmer's turn as Doc Holiday has a cult following among film fans. Watch ""Tombstone"" and see why. His Holiday -- an alcoholic, tubercular Southern aristocrat who spouts Latin in one scene and kills a man in the next --resonates even with those of us who don't like Westerns. Kilmer delivers some hilarious lines, and he plays Holiday as the dandified rapscallion we expect. But what makes this portrayal so unforgettable is that he gives us a peek into Holiday's self-destructive soul, too. Kurt Russell is wonderful and subtle as Wyatt Earp, but it's Kilmer who walks away with the movie. Surprise casting alert: Wyatt's wife, Allie, is played by Paula Malcomson, who a decade later plays Trixie on the HBO series ""Deadwood.""",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

too much is never good,"Tombstone		 Title: Too much is never goodThis 130-minutes during film doesn't give you a very good feeling. Sure, the actors are all playing their parts well (not good, just well) and Val Kilmer is really terrific as the tuberculosis patient Doc Holliday (it is one of the best roles Kilmer has ever done) and the scenery is very well done, but there is something not all right with the movie. The problem is that there are simply to many characters in this work. Besides the three Earp brothers Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan there are the three wives of the brothers, Doc Holliday and his Hungarian Kate, the tempting Josephine and her colleague Mr. Fabian, Billy Breckenridge, a good role from Jason Priestley, and a hole bunch of bad guys. It just isn't possible to put all of these persons lives and problems in 130 minutes of film. The headaches that Wyatt Earp's wife has, for instance, don't get enough attention to get involved in her situation. The same goes for the whole Morgan Earp-character, played unenthusiastic by Bill Paxton. He hasn't got enough screentime to get you interested in why he does what he does. He seems to be in this movie for the reason that it's impossible to make a movie about the legendary Wyatt Earp without mentioning his two brothers Virgil and Morgan.The second thing not making the movie a very good one is that you don't know who the main character is: Wyatt Earp or Doc Holliday. In the beginning it's obvious that Kurt Russell's Wyatt Earp is the most important person in the film, but slow but sure the Doc Holliday-part gets bigger and so much more interesting than Earp. This is because Val Kilmer is playing Doc Holliday with his whole heart and because you feel more for Holliday that for Earp. Wyatt Earp (in this motion picture) is a man who just wants to get a lot of money with doing as little as possible and Doc Holliday is the kind of person who wants to be there for Earp whenever he needs him, ill or not, Earp can always count on Doc Holliday. Writer Kevin Jarre and director George P. Cosmatos should have made a choice between Earp and Holliday and they didn't. That's a shame and it makes 130 minutes a heck of a long time.Luckily, like I mentioned before, Val Kilmer is a pleasure to watch and Jason Priestley and Billy Zane are acting very good as well. The scenery's are very impressing and Joseph Porro's customs are nearly perfect. All of this keeps the movie watchable, but not much more that that I'm afraid.",,Anonymous,Biography
One of the most entertaining movies ever made,"This is NOT a perfect movie, but I have found it to be one of the most entertaining films I've come across. It's the story of Wyatt Earp leading up to the gunfight at the O. K. Corral and the events afterwards. It's got some hokey moments and some awkward scenes, and not all of the dialog is top notch, but it manages to deliver much more than it misfires. Possibly the aspect that impresses me the most about the film is the historical accuracy. Many of the events are things that actually happened, right down to snappy one-liners that the historical figures are reported to have said. It's a violent movie, but it has a good amount of humor and an all-time iconic performance from Val Kilmer that elevates the entire film.

I like how the director leaves the audience to figure out certain scenes as opposed to carrying the scene further than is needed.  He also is well versed it the art of filming.  The variety of shot angles was terrific to watch. No doubt about it: This is Val Kilmer's best performance ever.  I'm not much a Val fan at all, but I am a huge fan of the Doc Holliday that he portrays. These folks did their homework and it shows when details are being looked at.

Wyatt walks into a bar known for trouble and finds Thornton at a gambling table, giving all kinds of grief to the others, being an obnoxious bully. Wyatt walks up and says ""You're sitting in my place."" Incredulous, Thornton's tough guy gets up, face-to-face with Wyatt, and gets slapped. Not knowing what to do, he gets slapped harder, not realizing yet who was doing the slapping. But he sensed that he might be in over his head. Finally, Wyatt says, ""Pull your gun. Go ahead, pull it, or do you plan to stand there and bleed all over the floor."" Thornton wipes blood from his mount, backs down, and leaves, still dazed over the quick sequence of events.

"Too few good turns, too few good moments, in this long, long film","The Earp brothers take on the Clanton gang, redux, in this muddled, overly long remake of ""Gunfight at the OK Corral."" The classical themes of old west lawlessness and threat of death are well displayed, but intruding upon these is an updated psychologizing theme that seems out of place as well as boring.Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp spends a lot of time staring blandly into space. He is dignified, give him that. But he looks too much like a preacher and not enough like a killer with a badge. Burt Lancaster was better cast. Ditto for the Clanton gang, all tricked out here with red sashes, like some step dance troupe. Give me John Ireland and Dennis Hopper  both were Clantons in ""Gunfight"" - any day over the acting ensemble playing at bad guys here.On the plus side, Val Kilmer is superb as the dying, mannerly Doc Holliday, way better than the perpetual ham, Kirk Douglas. And Sam Elliott is picture perfect here as Wyatt's brother Virgil. There were production problems on this film. Cosmatos was brought in to direct a month before the shoot, after Kevin Jarre, the screenwriter, who was supposed to make his directing debut here, was sacked.

"Half good, half rotten","The first half of this movie is well-researched and well-written, with the most realistic depiction of Doc Holliday ever filmed. And some of the performances, particularly those of Val Kilmer and Powers Boothe, are outstanding. But after the Gunfight at the OK Corral, the movie goes off a dramatic cliff. Earp's vengeance ride lasted only three weeks, and only a few people were killed; in this movie, it implies Wyatt's vengeance stretched on for months. The movie becomes ludicrously overstated with scenes as hammy as in any 1930s's B Western, such as Wyatt staggering through a lighting-laced thunderstorm, his brother's blood on his hands, moaning ""Morgan!"" Or his silly, uncharacteristic question to Doc late in the film about what makes a man like Johnny Ringo do the bad things he does.

In addition to being an overall entertaining film, it has a lot of style and substance. There is also the connection that can be made to the Book of Revelations This is made apparent in the opening scene when Johnny Ringo, a cowboy, acts a a translator for a Mexican priest who quotes the bible saying ""behold the pale horse. The man who sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."" This parallels Kurt Russel's character, Wyatt Earp, and provides some foreshadowing for the rest of the story.

Simplistic and Rushed,"Word has it, that several years ago, a big time Hollywood actor and a major studio expressed an interest in making an epic film over Wyatt Earp. Well, a rival studio got wind of this and decided they would beat them to the punch. So they rushed out a silly and moronic version of the events that led up to the events at OK Corral. Well, Tombstone is that inferior movie. I'm sorry, I like Kurt Russell, but he had little to work with here. Oh sure, the 7th graders will tell you that Tombstone is the better film, but only because it was written at their level. For my money, the Costner version is much better and more intelligent. And you know what? I like Kurt Russell more than Kevin Costner, so there!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Summarizing Tombstone,"Aside from reading a lot about Doc Holliday, I have also been in touch with the Doc Holliday Society in Griffin, Georgia, which hosts the Doc Holliday Days every August.  Tombstone was a highly accurate depiction of the characters and events.  Except for some blatant fiction (ie, Doc and Johnny Ringo finally shooting it out in the end), most of the other events -- large and small -- actually happened.  Val Kilmer did the best job ever done of portraying Doc, who was a charming, educated, well-bred southern aristocrat, was witty and fun to be around, was supremely deadly when aroused, and was an absolutely fearless gunfighter and killer.  However, his cousins in Griffin insist he killed only one man, and that was in the OK Corral.  I have to check that out.  Although he was not a good shot, which Wyatt Earp was, Doc was lightning fast on the draw, which Wyatt Earp was not.  At 5'10"", 160 pounds, he usually carried a nickle-plated revolver, a derringer, and a small knife slung down his back on a string.  He was a splendid figure of a man, went impeccably dressed and groomed at all times, wore well-tailored suits, and sometimes carried a cane. Dennis Quaid in Wyatt Earp LOOKED more like the Doc of the 1880's -- emaciated, tubercular, alcoholic; but Val Kilmer captured Doc's three-dimensional personality.",,Anonymous,Biography
Wronged by the critics,"Honestly most of the time i agree with the critics but most of them were completely wrong about this movie. It baffles me the good the bad and the ugly has a higher rating on metacritic then this movie. This movie is without a doubt the best western ever made, only one that even comes close is django unchained. This movie has action, drama, one liners and even comedy. All the actors to a fantastic job, val kilmer does the best though. His doc holliday is still one of the best characters in cinema in my mind.

Val Kilmer should have won an Oscar for this...,"This is a man's movie. It is a masterpiece in a genre that has a long history of masterpieces. Val got THE part of a lifetime and brought the most accurate portrayal of Doc Holiday ever to grace the silver screen. The rest of this ensemble cast work perfectly together. The movie is gripping, dramatic, while at the same time it's funny and touching. I've watched this movie more times than I know, sometimes with a woman or two trying to watch it as well. The men gasp and laugh, and most times the women just look puzzled. I do hope that when I die I can look down at my bare feet and laugh, then fade away.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Best Western that I have ever seen,"This film fulfills all expectations of a great Western. The star studded cast delivers a stunning performance. It is well written and superbly casted. The action of the movie does not cover up the love story and the love story does not cover up the masculine theme of the Old West. Tombstone makes me wish that I lived in the 1870's and 80's. The film makes you feel like you can reach out and touch history, it gives you the feeling that you are really there. I have seen various Westerns from Silverado to Open Range, and Monte Walsh and from John Wayne films to stuff like Blazing Saddles. Tombstone has a great cast, perfect setting, terrific writing, and the action scenes are top notch. I would definitely recommend this film to all viewers.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The greatest western of all time,"The acting, the action and the suspense of this film makes it very enjoyable to watch. Val Kilmer gives his best performance as the sickly, yet deadly Doc Holiday.

Duck Shoot (sorry Groucho),"As a fan of Gunfight At The OK Corral, I got off on the wrong foot with this film. The ridiculous moustaches worn by most of the cast put me in mind of Groucho Marx: maybe they should have titled it Duck Shoot. The screenplay had some truly unbelievable scenes, such as the terminally sick Val Kilmer arriving from his deathbed to the final shoot out. Credibility had taken a suicide dive out of the window long before this with some questionable casting and/or extreme playing of the part (Kilmer again was too Oscar Wilde-ish as Doc Holliday - he would have been blown away long ago by the hard men). There was one classic scene, though, with Kilmer upstaging Johnny Ringo's gun-twirling act - with a beer tankard. Only Powers Booth survived with his reputation in tact. This film is only for the fanatics.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
val kilmer's performance,"In this viewer's eyes, Tombstone was Val Kilmer's finest performance to date. He was almost chameleon-like in that the viewer saw very little of Val in Doc. The deadly gentleman could not be played by anyone better.  Kilmer's off-screen antics are no secret, but his on-screen performances are most always electrifying. Having Kilmer's Doc Holliday in a mind set makes seeing Dennis Quaid or Kirk Douglas portrayal of the gunslinger almost painful. Not that these actors are of second rate caliber, but they simply can not hold a candle to Val's representation.  With such memorable lines as ""i'm your huckleberry,"" ""I'm dying, how are you?"", and ""Oh, Johnny. I apologize, I forgot you were there. You may go now,"" left an imprint on my mind and I can recall most if not all of Val Kilmer's lines from Tombstone.  The fact that Kilmer was not even nominated for an Academy Award is a travesty in and of itself. I do not recall who won the award for best supporting actor in 1993, but whoever received the gold surely did not deserve to. I do not believe I have ever seen a performance quite as memorable as that of Val Kilmer's John ""Doc"" Holliday, and if anyone can, well ""you're a daisy if you do."" -CrewJG",,Anonymous,Biography
Don't confuse cinema,"First of all I grew up in Phoenix, AZ. I know as close as they configure the real story of Tombstone.

This film also has dozens of quotes that are fun to intermingle with every-day conversations (""I've not yet begun to defile myself"").

Lame spaghetti without the cool music,"Make no mistake, this is just another goofy spaghetti western, but without the great music that makes people think such westerns are good. One of the worst things about this one is the false bravado of try9ing to look like the real story. It is so Hollywood skewed that it lacks any entertainment value. First, the characters. This is where the film fell flat on its face. In the spaghetti western, there is just one character, each with different names and faces, but all the same character, the self righteous, unbelievably self confident superman (or buy who thinks he's Superman.) The trouble with this is, these characters would all be dead by believing they could fly off a cliff from day one. This movie gives a second character, the Virgil Earp. There are a few like him, but the script is so badly written, you realize these are just the same character, too. There is the ridiculous character, and the stereotype civilized character. That is it. And it is way too obvious and ridiculous to accept even in a fantasy land. We want to like Wyatt and Doc, the two main characters, but in Hollywood tradition, the director and writers do the worst job they can. This might be an example of how not to write or direct a movie. A few good actors and clever camera men try to salvage this, but to no avail. Doc and Wyatt are the same person. No difference. The same Hollywood hype Superman with an impossible to believe Superiority Complex. With such a complex, their trivial interests are impossible to believe. In Hollywood tradition, only the most unlikable of characters survive to the end, so no one ever watches the end, except for a few masochists. Even worse than what are usually inferior spaghetti westerns, because this lacks the great music. If this is not on a critic's worst 200 list, he's been bribed or is pulling your leg.

One of my Top Ten favorites,"I ""accidentally"" watched this movie when I pushed the wrong button in selecting a movie at a hotel in Reno, Nevada.  What a great bit of serendipity!  This movie is completely entertaining.  Men like it, women like it, people of all ages like it. Not a typical fan of Westerns, this one excelled, especially in the hilarious bits of humor given to the fabulous Val Kilmer.  (I was truly shocked when he was not nominated for Best Supporting Actor - at least at the Golden Globes - but, alas, his reputation precedes him.)  Nevertheless, the analogy he gives to Big Kate, ""then again, you may be the AntiChrist"" is classic! There are so many other fabulous lines.  Another highly appealing aspect to Kilmer's Holliday is his slightly effeminate appearance which masked a very confident machismo - and - the way Holliday is perceived as an independent loner, yet lets Wyatt in on the fact that he has been Holliday's best friend.  The desire to still maintain his manly dignity while dying with his friend at his side truly moved me to tears. I paraphrase, ""Wyatt, if you have ever cared for me... leave now."" Whoa!  So good, so good.  Kilmer was truly a standout in this movie.  He personified Doc Holliday.  Great movie - highly recommended!",,Anonymous,Biography
Best Wyatt & Doc ever,"One of the most stylish and coolest westerns with a plethora of incredible performances from a excellent cast.

Kurt Russell plays the truly badass Wyatt and Val Kilmer the suave and sickly Doc Holliday,in yet another stellar acting job from one of the greatest character actor leading men in the business. I personally believe the man deserved an Oscar for this. Practically every cast member here elevates the piece to some extent, with some very noteworthy performances by Stephen Lang and Michael Biehn. All in all you won't find a better telling of the story in all the annals of Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Tombstone, an iconic and memorable western, superbly acted with Val Kilmer stealing the show","This is a movie for all western lovers as it has everything you can ask for from famous characters to massive world building with sets, costumes and locations that are so amazing that you just immerse yourself after a second in a scene. The writing and story is incredible, the dialogue flows so well with the story and the actors that portrays the characters. The story is about Wyatt Earp, the director and writer does a magnificent job of creating and bringing his and the other's story to life whilst keeping it in a good pace, making each scene entertaining and almost every scene memorable.The ensemble cast is one of the many highlights of the movie as it is a huge one with both good guys and bad guys, lots of real people. We got the title characters Wyatt Earp and his brothers, Doc Holliday that are brilliantly played by Kurt Russell, Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton and Val Kilmer whilst we have Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn as the two villains, there is also lots of others but they are the ones that stand out the most with superb performances and I believe making realistic portrayals. Val Kilmer brings as always something unique to the role and he does it in a perfect way, making him stand out in every scene in a good way. With the movie's great writing we get some well written characters that are likeable and believable. Kurt Russell is the lead actor and he leads the movie with the help of Val Kilmer and Powers Boothe but he could have done it without them as he got chemistry with the others as well but the movie wouldn't be as good if they weren't cast as they brought their A game onto this movie.Edit: 5/12-2024.Tombstone begins with the introduction of the outlaw gang The Cowboys as they wreak havoc at a wedding in Mexico because the mexican police had killed two of their men. This happens right after a narration which quickly introduces Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday to the viewers, with footage with aesthetics and look from an old silent film where most are footage filmed with the actors. The introduction with The Cowboys introduces each member, even the leader ""Curly Bill"" Brocius who is brilliantly played by the late Powers Boothe in this film, we also get introduced to the other members: Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo, Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton, Thomas Haden Church as Billy Clanton, John Philbin as Tom McLaury among others. Then we meet Wyatt Earp played by Kurt Russell in one of his best roles, as he gets off the train at Tuscon, Arizona, reuniting with his brothers Virgil and Morgan played by Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton. The next scene has us getting introduced to Doc Holliday, a dentist and gambler turned gunfighter who's suffering with tuberculosis which was a deadly disease back in the 1880s, Holliday is played by Val Kilmer in a performance I can gladly call one of the best performances in the western genre. The narrative structure and pacing is incredible during these 15 minutes. We get introduced to the characters and also the upcoming feud through foreshadowing from the priest who tells the Cochise County Cowboys about the biblical Four Horseman of the Apocalypse, in a manner that something bad will happen to them soon. Then it doesn't take long for the characters to find themselves in Tombstone, where we quickly notice what kind of person Wyatt Earp is and of his reputation.The cinematography is absolutely incredible with so many mesmerizing shots. George P. Cosmatos does an incredible job directing each scene with superb mise-en-scene to back it up. Kevin Jarre wrote the screenplay and it's absolutely perfect, with the dialogue being excellent with Doc Holliday's standing out the most. Each scene of 'Tombstone' captures the western spirit perfectly, a big reason is for cinematographer William A. Fraker. Revisiting this film again placed a big smile on my face, it might be one of the best westerns.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Tombstone"" or ""Wyatt Earp""? How about BOTH","Released in 1993 and directed/written by George Cosmatos, ""Tombstone"" stars Kurt Russell & Val Kilmer as Wyatt Earp & Doc Holliday focusing on the infamous gunfight in Tombstone, Arizona, on October 26, 1881.This version of the story beat Kevin Costner's ""Wyatt Earp"" to the theater by six months and stole its thunder. The difference in these two films is in their names: ""Tombstone"" focuses on Earp's conflict with the 'Cowboys' gang in the Arizona town, whereas ""Wyatt Earp"" is an epic Western detailing Earp's life from youth to old age, although the Tombstone events are certainly the center piece. At 2 hours and 10 minutes, ""Tombstone"" runs an hour shorter than ""Wyatt Earp."" Both are top-of-the-line modern Westerns and whether you'll like one or the other depends on what you're in the mood for. If you're looking for a kinetic, mythmaking rendition of the tale then go with ""Tombstone."" However, if you want a more realistic, mundane account see ""Wyatt Earp."" Both are vastly superior to the talky 1957 version of the tale with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.""I just saw both films back-to-back and it is fun comparing the two. Val Kilmer from ""Tombstone"" wins out over Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday, but not by much and not because Quaid is bad but rather because Holiday's role is more prominent in ""Tombstone"" with better lines. Actually Kilmer is nothing less than fascinating, although Quaid is more believable. Kurt Russell and Costner are about even as Earp, but ""Tombstone"" wins out overall in cast with Sam Elliott, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Billy Zane and the shining Dana Delany as Josie, although Joanna Going shines just as much in the same role in ""Wyatt."" There are exceptions; for instance, Isabella Rossellini from ""Wyatt"" edges out Joanna Pacula as Big Nose Kate.As for the dramatic walk to the O.K. Corral and the gunfight itself I favor ""Wyatt Earp,"" but ""Tombstone"" has a much better build-up to the confrontation. Unfortunately, ""Tombstone"" spins its wheels in the last 35 minutes with redundant gunfights between Wyatt & his men and the remaining Cowboys. ""Wyatt Earp"" maintains better momentum after the gunfight.""Tombstone"" stands with the best Westerns of all time, but so does ""Wyatt Earp.""The film was shot in Arizona.GRADE: A- (8.5/10 Stars)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The leading ladies without an exception failed badly in their performance. Am not sure how many have felt this.

You Mangy Cur!,"One of the best Westerns ever to come around Tombstone raised the viewer bar for classic Westerns and remained reasonably accurate in its story-telling.

Guns, whiskey, cards, brawling, shoot-outs, dust, horses, good and bad guys, sheriffs and Marshalls, court scenes, women and even drugs too. No one knows for sure all the details but we do know that if you carried a gun or two, a knife and a rifle, chances are you not only needed to but used them often. Those that didn't died before their time. I am saying that to say this: killing remained a common problem forcing law and order to come into play or the killings would just go on. Bushwacking (getting the jump on someone) was common and shooting a person in the back was looked down on but there were many ways to kill and very few to testify. Nice long movie and who doesn't like all the stars and good supporting players they packed into it? Just well done all around.

Consistently excellent,"Tombstone is a thrill ride with feeling, a good enough script, inspiring music and one of the best casts ever assembled in motion pictures.  Kurt Russell plays the sensitive Wyatt Earp.  Val Kilmer is the movie's life force with a snitty peformance as the homicidal Doc Holliday.  The rest of the cast is New York Yankees deep, with even the bit roles manned by people like Billy Zane, Thomas Haden Church, Michael Rooker and Jason Priestley. Sam Elliott is great in everything that I've seen him in and his gruffness helps steady the movie until the end resolution.  Dana Delaney plays the free spirit.  The villains are loaded with Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn and Stephen Lang.  Even Moses, himself, Charleton Heston makes a cameo.  The script is relatively wide open, which is a no-brainer with the talent onhand.  What the script has is a nice sense of timing, set up and pacing. The music is dynamic and is really moving, especially in times of trouble. The movie is also pretty historically accurate in many places and doesn't mutilate the concept too badly overall.  This story is truly so much larger then normal life that other fascinating tidbits were left out (such as the true story of Earp's card game with Behan when he won the Oriental Saloon.)

Val makes it a masterpiece,"This is one of the best westerns ever made, and one of the best movies ever made. What makes it one of the best is VAL KILMER. Without him, it would've been a good one, but with him, it is a masterpiece. Doc Holliday himself was sure bigger than life. And Val is bigger than him, and much bigger than life. Not giving him the Academy Award he unquestionably deserved here is more than a mistake, it's a wrongdoing. I am certainly one of the many who would never forgive the Academy for that. This usually-underrated suprastandard master should be given his value and respect. And he should be in such exceptional themes more, no matter ""leading"" or ""supporting"". He leads even when he supports. He enhances, and he makes it prime. As a movie critic of decades, if I'm asked the best three performances (leading/supporting) in the history of cinema, I would admittedly take my time to choose the second and the third, but I would say the first without thinking a second: VAL KILMER's DOC HOLLIDAY.

When I think of all of Val Kilmer's performances that I have seen ( which believe me are a lot)this one always comes to mind first as well as The Saint and The Ghost and The Darkness. Kilmer has the most memorable lines combined with awesome action scenes that all really come off nicely. Kilmer definitely deserves an Oscar for this performance. I love the action and personality each character brings to the table. If I had not already seen this movie I probably would have critiqued it for my Film class. The side track it took sometimes with Wyatt's wife and her addiction to Laudanum was detracting to the overall picture but nonetheless it is still extremely entertaining. Also any movie that shows Billy Zane that pale and girly is worth watching",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Way, way, WAY too long.","Every time I see a certain movie on my cable guide I feel compelled to write a brief review, based on my recollections of whatever film that might be. 'Tombstone' is my choice for today, since I just saw it scheduled to play tonight on some cable channel.
My wife and I rented this endless western
from Blockbuster in the early '90's. I think we must have looked at the video cassette box more than once to double-check the running time of the film. Why, we wondered, couldn't they have cut this film by 30 minutes?
I totally don't understand all the glowing reviews for this overlong film!
Got nothing better to do for over two hours?
-then watch 'Tombstone'. Maybe you'd like to enjoy it as a double bill with 'The Natural'.

Extraordinary Performance By Val Kilmer,"Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday was among the most poignant and convincing performances in the history of motion pictures. In Tombstone, Kilmer would never have to bow to Bogart, Brando, DiNero, Hoffman or (and I hesitate to mention) Eastwood. Five star performance doesn't begin to describe the intensity of his grasp for the role.",,Anonymous,Biography
A Wild Ride Through the Wild West,"Tombstone isn't the perfect western, but it's damn good escapism fun. The shootouts and action are frantic, and they come aplenty. The performance are absolutely perfect, from the leads to the supporting, every one on the star studded cast gives it their very all. Val Kilmer goes above and beyond with his portrayal of Doc Holiday and has not been able to recapture than magic since. Although the action is great, there's just not enough story to justify the nearly two and a half hours of running time, even if the direction is confident, there's enough hiccups in the script to distract from the story a tad, but there's enough humor, action, and setting to make this western a great one.

From Rambo to Tombstone - miracles can happen!,"It really is hard to believe that George P. Cosmatos was responsible for Rambo III when you've seen Tombstone.Tombstone is a film so evocative of the old West that it almost feels as though you're on  a ride at Universal rather than watching a film.The best time to watch this one is at dusk on a warm summers evening with a breeze blowing through the room, at one with the film that places you on that wooden deck outside the sheriffs office, as the sounds of the play at the towm hall near the blacksmiths drift through the air.There is a brilliant recreation of the gunfight at the OK coral (apparently based on the testament of the real Wyatt Earp) and the chemistry present within the male lead roles oozes from the screen.THere are moments of pure machismo, granted, but overall the film is one that the female audience can still enjoy, as this film does recognise that half of the west was one by women.The scene in the saloon in which Kilmer and Biehn face off is legendary.

slick and phony,"Everything about this production shrieks ""glossy Hollywood dreck."" First of all, the Earps were hardly the saintly characters portrayed here, but Hollywood's need for black hats and white hats - metaphorically - has them as the righteous lawmen (even though they wear black hats). The script is laden with contemporary pop psych lines; I am sure no one at the time asked ""what do you want out of life?"" And ""I thought we could be a family again"" belongs on Dr. Phil, not here. The musical score is much too lavishly soupy (or perhaps ""soapy""). Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, praised so much here, I find phony in an arch and affected way. And as far as the brief promotion about ""equal pay for equal work for women,"" Hollywood evidently can't resist the urge to insert plugs for its favorite causes in the most unnatural places. John Ford's ""My Darling Clementine"" is 47 times better than this flick even though it's 47 years older.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A Good, Old-Fashioned Western","Ladies, we have a fine ensemble of some of the best looking men in the business:  Kurt Russell; Val Kilmer; Michael Biehn; Billy Zane; Sam Elliott; Bill Paxton, etc.  So don't let the fact that it's a ""western"" deter you from catching this one.I love movies that pay attention to fine details: Kilmer's filthy fingers during a poker hand, a child soothing her doll after a street shooting, the size of paper money, spittoons in the theatre, etc., etc.  Even the colloquialisms were accurate for the time period:  ""savvy?"" ""ain't that a daisy?"" ""I'm your huckleberry"" and so on.  The women in the film were not overly made up, only a small amount of lip color.  And the furnishings, drapes and other decor made me feel I had stepped back in time.The historical details were not right on the money, but for a movie which must wrap up in a few hours, who cares?  The movie is so enjoyable.  Russell WAS Wyatt Earp - the steely eyes, the head-strong determination.  Kilmer did steal every scene he appeared in, however, and mastered a Virginian accent magnificently.  Powers Booth and Michael Biehn played villains who really get under your skin.  And those in lesser roles (such as Curley Bill and Mattie Earp, who in reality was never officially married to Wyatt) were greatly effective.If you rent this movie or watch it for the first time, take note of the extra's.  These folks are not just walking around; they were painstakingly directed and busy doing tasks common for that time.A fest for the eyes.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Legends don't just fade away,"A very entertaining film, with plenty of action and some very strong characters.Famed lawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) goes to Tombstone, Arizona, to retire with his brothers Morgan and Virgil (Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot) as part owners of a saloon. Upon arriving in the lawless boomtown, they run into Earp's old companion, ""Doc"" Holliday (Val Kilmer).Trouble soon begins when the local bad guys, a group that calls themselves the ""Cowboys"", learn of the Earps' arrival, and try to show the Earps that Tombstone is their territory. Further complicating matters, at the same time, a new woman enters into Earp's life. Despite his wishes to retire to a quiet life at the poker table, Earp and his brothers are drawn into yet another fight, having to choose between living out the rest of their days as they'd planned, or doing what's right to save their town. After the Cowboys go too far, however, the decision is clear to Wyatt Earp: the Cowboys need to be taught a lesson, and he's just the man to teach 'em.A tale of revenge, vengeance, and legend, this movie is well made and exciting. Kilmer is fantastic as the brash, suave, gambling Holliday, and is a perfect compliment to Russel's Earp. Michael Biehn gives a solid performance as the dastardly Johnny Ringo, main nemesis of Holliday and the Earps. The movie features some classic lines and will keep fans riveted with a solid blend of action, drama, and good 'ol fashion Western gun play.

WESTERNThis is yet another version of Wyatt Earp with already lot more made before this one such as ""My Darling Clementine"" starring Henry Fonda, ""Hour of the Gun"" with James Garner as Earp and ""Gunfight At The OK Corral"" with Burt Lancaster playing the role! This time has Kurt Russel as Earp and Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday revisiting the Corral again! The film is OK except that I didn't care much for the ending very much since read somewhere that it wasn't exactly accurate in terms of the Doc Holiday character!

Sam Elliott and Michael Biehn added to the all round fine ensemble cast and for once, the casting made it believable that they were really brothers.

Great Stuff !!,"Out of all the Movies made about Wyatt Earp and The O.K. Corrall, to me, Tombstone is the finest. Kurt Russell playing the stoic Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer as the tormented gunslinging Doc Holliday, really did a job in this version of THAT gunfight as they swaggered through the film both looking invincible ( as indeed they were ) and I must say looking highly credible also. Tombstone reminds me of the fifties when most good Westerns were made, full of action, romance, a dash of humour here and there, and full too of heroes showing us how to get their man, ( or men.) And, like Westerns in the fifties, Tombstone ignores some of the truths about what happened before and after the gunfight just off Fremont Street and concentrates more on what we all pay our money to see.....men doing what men had to do. The facts? Who cares. Tombstone has the right balance of history and fiction to make it work and keep us interested in the Movie, as it gives us glimpses of the truth, then decorates it with heavy doses of Hollywood and it's determination to entertain. Val Kilmer almost steals the show as Earp's loyal side kick, but Russell held on to his character well and I think it's fair to say they came out about even. My favourite part is when the Dentist gives us a rousing rendition of musical mugs in the Saloon while responding to a testy cowboy from across the table. A table also where Earp, always in control sat with his trusty shotgun pinned underneath it and aimed at the cowboy's underbelly. That scene was about as far away from the facts as night is to day, but is was riveting stuff and the thought of it ever actually happening never really crosses our minds. Tombstone is a slick Movie, well directed by George P. Cosmatos who along with most involved in the film was hell bent on giving us a story, rather than a history lesson.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wyatt Earp Vs Tombstone - An unfair comparison,"I have just watched back to back these two movies and ranked both an 8. Kevin Costner, Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman Etal made me feel that their movie was closer to history and also brought pride in their perceived honor. The chronicle from childhood to the 20th Century felt complete. BUT Then came Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott and Powers Boothe (Deadwood 93) etal and left me entertained to the ninth degree. The sheer pace of this one leaves you breathless.these movies should be seen back to back and not compared as they tell two different stories occurring at the same time and place. Costner as Wyatt was more believable But Russell's Earp was more fun. Quaid was Doc Holiday but Kilmer had a holiday with the role. I will concede that Sam Elliott made Virgil his and nobody is going to take it away. Rent or buy both movies as it a worthwhile investment of your time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tombstone rocks as a great western,"Someone once said, ""when the truth dies, print the legend"", and that's exactly what happens with this film. Although accurate in many respects, it is highly inaccurate in others, but what the hey, who cares when it's pulled off this well. George Cosmatos handles the directing reins wonderfully, and the pace of the film only slows down for the sappy romance between Kurt Russell and Dana Delaney. The Earps come to Tombstone to make their fortune and end up in a bloodbath of historic proportions. Oddly, the one scene where you're most likely to say ""Oh, that's phony"" is the scene where Wyatt walks into the face of a ambush and holds his own -- but that's highly accurate! The real Wyatt had bullet holes in his hat, boots, saddle and coat, but dished the dirt to the baddies. Great dialog, and an absolutely movie stealing performance by Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. Joanna Pacula is gorgeous as always, and plays Big Nose Kate Elder, Doc's ""girlfriend"". Look fast for the bar scene where Wyatt tosses out a loud mouthed braggart -- Billy Bob Thornton in one of his first roles. This film tosses in every Western thrill you can think of, even the presence of Charlton Heston and Robert Mitchum. Don't just see it, buy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Almost certainly the worst of the Earp westerns.,"Yet another take, and a very different one, on the legend of Wyatt Earp, (and, of course, Doc Holliday), and that (in)famous gunfight at the OK Corral, but a very poor one, despite a huge and mostly talented cast, none of whom are at their best. It aims for the epic and it looks great, (William Fraker was the DoP), but the director, George P. Cosmatos wasn't able to tie it all together and it's poorly written by Kevin Jarre. You get the impression that someone, (the director, the writer, both?), thought they were making the greatest western of them all, the one that would put all other epic westerns in the shade, even down to casting Charlton Heston in a tiny role and getting Robert Mitchum to do the narration but this is a classic example of overwhelming ambition operating in a vacuum. Earp is Kurt Russell, who's barely adequate in the role and a pasty-faced Val Kilmer isn't even that as Doc Holliday. Luckily, this great galumphing disaster isn't much seen and pales in comparison with others in the genre.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

Excellent- Kilmer at top of his game,"This movie is excellent. Val Kilmer absolutely should at least have been nominated for an Oscar- more than any previous actor I have seen-Douglas, Mature, and more recent portrayals, he WAS Doc Holliday. The physical debilitation, the polished gentleman on the skids, the whole nine, was there. Whether the genius was actor, director, or both- his Doc Holliday is a tough act to follow. All the other actors were top notch -making the ensemble seamless. Newer efforts like Deadwood are interesting experiments in ""realism"", but real art is worth watching over again and enjoying.

A very entertaining movie and a total crock of horse apples.,"One thing you should see in western movies that you never see is piles of horse apples all up and down the dirt streets. You know they were there but you don't see them in the movies. ""Tombstone"" is a video of a crock of horse apples. Wyatt Earp was a brawler, a bully, a pimp, a horse thief. He made his money in Dodge City beating up drunks (at $3.00 a head knock) and keeping the peace in whore houses. That's how he earned the title ""the battling pimp."" He and his brothers were vagrant thugs and bullies. They were cited for the robbery of the Benson, Arizona stage but they had the badges so they blamed it on the Clantons and their friends. Then they closed the case by killing them at the O.K. Corral. One of Wyatt's brothers, Warren Earp, was a drunk and a brutal bully who lived in Wilcox, Arizona. One day he walked into a saloon and got too far out of control and someone shot him as many times as he had bullets. But back to the movie. You know you are looking at a crock of horse apples when Powers Booth's character, Johnny Ringo, stumbles out of an opium den and fires his two six shooters twenty-one times without reloading. According to records John Rheingold shot one man in his entire life. He shot a drunk in the face in a saloon because he didn't like the man's beard. The man did not die. Then in the re-enactment of the famous O.K. Corral gunfight, Val Kilmer's character, John Henry Holliday, fires a double-barreled shotgun three times in less that two seconds. Now you know someone has foisted a crock of horse apples off on you. The only saving graces of the movie are Robert Mitchum's voice over and Charlton Heston's underplayed and unannounced role. But, watch it because it is well scripted, well cast, well directed and a very entertaining crock of horse apples.",,Anonymous,Biography

Dana Delany plays the ultimate siren as Josie who captures Wyatt's heart.The backdrop for Tombstone was a typical small western town with saloons, corrals and lots of shooting.

Beyond the gunfights, however, there isn't much of note. The character development leaves a lot to be desired. The villains are a joke, the women are barely present with only one exception, the romance doesn't really go anywhere, etc.The one thing that makes the movie stand out is Doc Holiday, a suffering from tuberculosis aristocrat whose hobbies include drinking, gambling - both in incredibly unhealthy doses - and being the fastest gunslinger around.

Is to Earp films what T-bone steak is to Steakums...,"""Tombstone"" is a memorable film which is best viewed in the extended version. While most scenes restored in already released films are a gimmick to get you to part with more cash, the restored scenes in Tombstone should never have been cut in the first place, as they tie up loose ends which marred the original theatrical release, and kept it from true greatness.Then there is the other Wyatt Earp film of the season. (What was it with Costner? Wyatt Earp wasn't the first time he tried to beat a premised film to market. First there was the competing ""Robin Hoods"" of 1991. Costner was so arrogant that he did not even attempt an English accent. Totally unwatchable rubbish.)Comparing Tombstone to Costner's ""Wyatt Earp"" is like comparing fresh hens eggs to that powdered stuff the army serves up... you can roll Tombstone around in your mouth, exploring its every texture, or you can watch Costner play Costner while you gulp down the reconstituted mess, which, they tell you, ""is just as filling."" Yes, it will keep you alive, but something essential is missing.Length doth not an epic make.Tombstone has the epic feel. Tombstone has ""scope"". A finely choreographed testosterone slaughter-fest. Its dusty streets and wooden walks are brought to life in exquisite expectation, where Russell and Kilmer stride, larger than life, dueling and dwarfing worthy adversaries.There is a timeless feel to the film; a hyper-reality, which makes all other ""Earp"" films pale in comparison.",,Anonymous,Biography

"Extremely entertaining, if not a perfect western.","Tombstone (1993)3.5/4A production with a long history, 'Tombstone' has now triumphed to legendary status as a result. It's famous for its multiple directors, rewritten scripts, things that could have been, etc. At one point, Kevin Costner was signed on to the main Wyatt Earp part, but didn't like the way the producers were going with it, so set off to make his own individual character study, which would later become the infamous box office horror show 'Wyatt Earp'. So is 'Tombstone' a good movie? You bet.The movie follows a very successful lawman, Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), who plans to retire in the small town of Tombstone, Arizona. But he's disrupted by the kind he was used to eliminating, thus sending his retirement plans out the window. The movie also chronicles the different characters, like Morgan and Virgil Earp (Bill Paxton and Sam Elliot), Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer, or ""I'm Your Huckleberry"") and Henry Hooker (Charleton Heston). There's also a lot of great villains, such as Curly Bill Brocius (Powers Boothe), Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn), Ike Clayton (Stephen Lang) and Billy Clanton (Thomas Haden Church). The movie also features Paula Malcomson as Wyatt's wife, Dana Delany as Wyatt's mistress, Michael Rooker, Harry Carey Jr, Billy Bob Thornton, Terry O'Quinn, and Billy Zane. And to top that, Robert Mitchum narrates the picture. If that's not a cast to go see a movie for, then what is?This film is now infamous for its troubled production. Before the movie really got off the ground, as I said, Kevin Costner was interested in the project, but went off to make his own. So, after the cast was assembled, writer Kevin Jarre was brought on to direct the movie. It is said that Kurt Russell didn't like the way he was handing the script, and got him fired. So then hired was George P. Cosmatos, of the record breaking 'Rambo First Blood: Part II' and the smaller Stallone vehicle 'Cobra', which I'm a huge fan of. It is also said that Russell directed some scenes himself in between. It's a very complicated story, but in the end, Cosmatos is credited.Quite surprisingly, the action is beautifully directed by (the credited) George P. Cosmatos and the script by Kevin Jarre is also excellent for the genre. Since the movie had quite a troubled process, it's wonderful that the movie ended up as much fun as this. The only problem with 'Tombstone' is how predictable it really is. You know what will happen - and compared to masterpieces like 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' and 'Unforgiven', the highest norms for a brilliant genre, the film doesn't succeed. This is made clear in its opening scene, which echoes Sam Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch', which opens on a group of vigilantes raiding a village. It's essentially the same here, except it is much more of a black and white story, with distinct good and evil. What made Peckinpah's film so great was the heroes were anti heroes; meaning that they weren't good, but they had multiple complexities about their characters, which is why Peckinpah's film is so much more fascinating. So, compared to a picture like Peckinpah's masterpiece, the film fails. But that's all right, because the film is directed swiftly (by whoever directed it, Kevin Jarre, George Cosmatos, Kurt Russell, etc.) and moves at a breakneck pace, which is always accepted by myself. But if the movie does end up predictable, then the other elements shine on their own. The score is perfect for the mise en scene, and the scene setting (like thunderstorms, dark nights, etc) truly works in the film's favor. What also makes the movie great, is not surprisingly, the cast. The movie has so many cameos and minor roles full of huge stars that it becomes distracting. At one moment, you're watching a scene, like, ""hey, that's Michael Biehn"", and then you move on, and Charleton Heston appears.Whatever flaws the film may have, and I know it has quite a few, it's recommended highly for its own humble action terms. It may not be a dashing dose of originality, but boy, is it a lot of fun, and I highly recommend it for multiple reasons - a great cast, good direction, great writing, a great score, great mise en scene... the list shall go on, as this is a lot of fun.3 ½ STARS (OUT OF 4)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An easy 9.,"This film is entertaining from start to finish. A solid 8. But then you have this icing on the cake called 'Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday'. Whose lines from this film are immortalized.

Doc Holliday saves this otherwise bland production,"Excluding him, this movie is just a typical good guy action movie off the Hollywood assembly line, of the western flavour in this particular case. A bunch of macho men blah blah blah intent on leaving their fighting days behind blah blah blah, but it doesn't go so well blah blah blah and they need to fight again blah blah blah. Obviously some romance in there as well, blah blah blah.I mean don't get me wrong, it accomplishes that kind of movie very well and that's perfectly approvable 6/10 fun in itself, nothing bad about it. Just nothing special about it either.However, there *is* something special about this movie - and that's Doc Holliday. What can I say, Val Kilmer manages to create just an absolutely hypnotising character whose magnetism would captivate you all the same no matter what genre this movie belonged to or in what setting it happened to take place in. I feel like the rest of the movie is just an inconsequential container vessel for this one mesmerising individual. I feel like all the clichés and banalities are there so that you could for only a brief moment make eye contact with Doc Holliday, nod in agreement, and just laugh together silently about the stupidity of all of it, each knowing that the other understands *exactly* how he feels.I suppose if the ""typical good guy action movie"" REALLY isn't your thing, then just this one supporting character won't be enough to bother with the whole thing, but if this kind of movie is acceptable for you like it is for me, then you will find yourself impatiently waiting for the next moment with Doc Holliday, and you'll find the wait was worth it every single time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Simply phenomenal...,"The 1993 Western ""Tombstone"" from directors George P. Cosmatos and Kevin Jarre is without a doubt one of the most entertaining, enjoyable and outstanding Western movies in recent history. Well, at least since the era of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood made Westerns.The storyline in ""Tombstone"", as written by Kevin Jarre, is really well-written and entertaining. It is the type of storyline that takes the audience along on a very thrilling ride. The movie runs at 130 minutes, but there isn't a single dull moment throughout the course of that. And that definitely is a testimony to the writing skills of
Kevin Jarre.Not only is the storyline and script a part of why ""Tombstone"" is such a great Western, but the cast ensemble in the movie as well. And wow, talk about a head-over-heels amazing cast ensemble they got for this movie. It never cease to amaze me with the sheer amount of established actors and actresses that were in this movie, in both leading and support roles. And the performances put on by the cast ensemble really brought the characters to life on the screen in the most rewarding and fulfilling of manners.If you enjoy Westerns, then the 1993 movie ""Tombstone"" should not be an unfamiliar title with you. And if it is, shame on you. ""Tombstone"" is definitely one of the most outstanding and memorable Westerns to ever grace the screen. And the contents of the storyline, from writer Kevin Jarre, is so wide-spanning that the movie has a lot of replay value to it. I've seen ""Tombstone"" several times since it was released back in the day.My rating of ""Tombstone"" lands on a most well-deserved eight out of ten stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A winning combination of violence, romance, thrill and heroism","The opening to the film sets the scene beautifully. What appears to be an old film, cleverly well captured to create the illusion of a historic background. However note the spoof of the obvious silhouette of Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday.The first scene is an interesting sketch, gaining the audience's favour against the cowboys. This is an important point, as it is the basis for the film. What is most impressive about this scene other then the introduction of the well read Jonny Ringo, is the end of scene cut. This should be highlighted to any director of when, and how to cut. The scene ends with the quote from Revelations ' Beyhold the pale horse, and the man one him was called death, and all hell followed'. This is very well directed as the next items to appear are Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp riding a train. Reading more into this, it is a premonition of things to come, mainly Wyatt Earp being the destroyer of the cowboy gang, in other words the one bringing death to the cowboys.The next, and perhaps most delicious, extrovert and intriguing item i wish to draw to your attention, is the relationship between the cool, calm and sophisticated John 'Doc' Holiday; and the legendary peace officer Wyatt Earp. These pair somewhat resemble the odd couple, and make the movie what it is, in particular Doc Holiday. IT is this type of skillful writing and acting that make you wish you could travel back in time and become that character. The perfectly timed whit rivals modern day comic actors, and the slick comments make you want to base your existence around being Holiday's persona.Furthermore the scene toward the end of the film, in which we see the final showdown between Holiday and Ringo, is one of several climactic events. This in my opinion is the greatest of them, because of the lighting, and because we get to see for real how quick Holiday is at drawing, combined with his skill, and deadly aim. When Holiday does draw his gun, it is like a perfectly rehearsed dance move, the elegance of the movement, and the calm, effortless look on his face add to the hype of this single moment. This scene is why i class this film as my favourite movie of all time.Finally, a very good reason why this film is so entertaining, is because it offers more then a well plotted western. Aside from this, it offers a captivating tale of love, lust and flirtation. This intricately worked love story is between Josphene MArcus, and 'the tall glass of water' Wyatt Earp. This is different to most chick flick love stories, because it seems real, and is believable.In conclusion, i may not be an expert on films, but i can give many, many reasons why you should watch this film. It appeals to varied audiences, and because it is based on a true story, it makes every aspect more thrilling.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Tombstone,"""Tombstone"" wow what can I say it's just an amazing movie. I think this one of my all time best cowboy movie. I think it is up there with John Wayne's movies. The villains are great, the backgrounds or scenery is mind blowing, and don't forget the gunslinging. It makes you feel like it was real. It is just an all time classic movie. Also what makes the movie even better is that it is based on true people and events. ""I'll be your huckleberry"" says Doc Holliday and in this case I'll be your guide to seeing this movie.The acting is very good, the main actors are Kurt Russel (Wyatt Earp), Val Kilmer (Doc Holliday, Sam Elliot (Virgil Earp), Bill Paxton (Morgan Earp) and Powers Boothe ( Curly Bill Brocious). They all did a splendid job as villains/heroes. They made it feel like it was back in the 18th century and we were all deputies and cowboys.The scenery was all so very good. It was filmed in Arizona, because of the plateaus and the red sand which mimics the area where tombstone actually was. They probably would pick Arizona because there are many spots that are inhabitant to people, and because there aren't as many roads every where like California.The gunslinging is always the best part of cowboy movies to me. Doc Holliday in my opinion has the best gun slinging part. It seems like the hero's always win but there are twists in this movie that you won't see coming. People may not like this movie because there isn't much gore or blood but there are good amounts.The movie ""Tombstone"" is a great movie, for those cowboy fans! It's about a ounce was deputy Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russel), who was from dodge city and cleaned it up, who just stopped working as a deputy and moves to tombstone to become rich. He meets his brother up there and a gunslinger, drinker, and gambler Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer). When Wyatt just gets there he notices that there are people every wear who have red sashes. He asks the mayor why they are wearing sashes and the mayor says that they are a gang of outlaws who call themselves the ""Cowboys"", and they have been starting trouble in that region.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

I can't lie some of the parts in the movie I had to look away because it was starting to look a little too real when they started to kill each other. If you don't like western movies, you just have to watch this movie and it will change your whole perspective of western movies. I was never a huge fan of western movies.

"Real Men, in all their aspects.","Having just re-watched this, 25 years after its' release I can only say that it truly is a classic, dealing with classic themes, classic villans and classic( and not quite so classic) heroes.Kurt Russel, truly at his physical peak, with movement, squint, glance and demeanor demonstarting the pinacle of the typical american here.Val Kilmer, in a smaller but sublimely brillant turn, is every bit the hero.
As Kurt Russell was in EVERY aspect of his role, Val took a wholelly diferent approach and also made his role every bit as rivetting, but in it's antichical format.
Val Kilmer was mesmerrising in a way vastly diferent to the way that Kurt Russell was eqally messmerising.It was a true tour de force from both.Bill Paxtton is, well, Bill Paxton and the movie is the better for it.Even more the case for Sam Elliot whose western essense seems to trickle naturally from his pores.Watch out also for Thomas Hayden Church in a minor role as well.Overall, a rip roaring tale.

Someone get shot, then someone else gets shot, then someone else gets shot and so on and on without adding anything to the storyline at all.Also it makes no sense that Ringo invites Wyatt on a one-on-one duel when he was clearly in an advantageous position. Since when bad guys do that when they are already winning?In the second half of the movie even the quality of acting drops significantly.

Magnificent Western,"I slowly progressed on this movie, watching bits here and there, then increasing the dose as I went along. I have never been much on Westerns, but this is my all time favorite. Wyatt Earp may not have been a saint, but he certainly exceeds the moral values of his enemies, the Cowboys. And has the gumption to stand up to them. Russell is almost always spectacular, no where more than playing Earp along with a ton of other stars, including a very effective Kilmer as the quirky Doc Holliday.

Too long,"Tombstone, a George Cosmatos directed picture from 1993: I am sorry, but I must give this kind effort a weak score. There is far too much laconic self importance among the principles, and very little typical human behavior. The fact that nobody ever uttered a humorous line in the entire picture says something about what Hollywood believes comprises entertainment these days. And this is a very long movie, full of melo-dramatic seriousness. (I suppose ""I'm your Huckleberry"" expresses humor on some level, but. . .) Set in the late 1800s, Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp gives a very serious performance finding revenge laden motivations around every corner of the picture. Val Kilmer, as Doc Holiday, helps him some. . .at least offering a glimmer of lightness, but certainly not enough. He is somewhat lighter, but I would understand I suppose, given that his gun contains a vastly superior chamber for bullets than anyone had ever seen before. In one of the numerous gunfights, I have slowed the video down to count 35 consecutive bullets coming from his 2 guns a blazing. Credulity has little business in current Hollywood fare for ingestion, I suppose. Sam Elliot is just slow, serious, and weak here. His natural sounding accent for slow and stupid never gets more play than here.

"Tombstone, a true gem in the Western genre.","Set in the lawless town of Tombstone, Arizona, during the late 1800s, the film follows the Earp brothers as they confront the violence and chaos of the Wild West.Directed by George P. Cosmatos, but reportedly mostly by Kurt Russell, behind the scenes shenanigans aside, Tombstone skillfully captures the serious tone of the genre, retelling classics like 'OK Corral' and 'Hour of the Gun' with more weight. Kevin Jarre's writing takes historical liberties combined with dramatic storytelling, and William A. Fraker's cinematography immerses viewers in the tumultuous world of the Old West.The standout feature of Tombstone is its stellar ensemble cast, including standout performances by Michael Biehn and Powers Boothe. With some superb staging and setups Kurt Russell's Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday are unforgettable, with Kilmer's performance deserving of an Oscar. Their on-screen chemistry adds depth and emotion to the film, while the supporting cast, including the likes of Sam Elliott as Virgil and Bill Paxton as Morgan, further enriches the story, making Tombstone a character-driven masterpiece. There are also a number of familiar faces like Stephen Lang, Jason Priestley, Michael Rooker, Billy Zane, and Charlton Heston, to name a few.Overall, Tombstone remains a must-see for fans of Westerns, anchored by remarkable performances from its cast. This film secures its place as a timeless classic in the Western genre.",,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best westerns... ever,"I saw this movie on television for the first time, and it still blew me away. This film takes some classic historic figures from the wild west and brings them together into a well-oiled ensemble. The acting is the most impressive thing about this movie. Val Kilmer's portrayal at Doc Holiday impressed me to no end. It was one of his best performances in film. This movie certainly isn't for the grandmas or grandpas, but for the rest of the family, this movie is a sure-fire winner. This movie fits quite well in the genre of action, but it still keeps the qualities of a drama and a comedy. I approve vehemently of Tombstone. See this movie expecting a good time.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The best western ive ever seen,"Out of the few westerns ive seen this one was by far the best. I enjoyed this movie and i totally didnt think i would. First off im not a big western fan so this made it difficult for me to watch it but after i saw this movie i changed my mind about westerns. I starter watching a bunch of westerns at that time like Silverado, Wyatt Earp, The Magnificent Seven(new version), Bad Girls amongst others and this one beat them all by far. Val Kilmer and Kurt Russel who is one of my favorites did an absolute excellent job. Even though Kilmer's role as Doc Holliday wasnt accurate he created a whole new character for all of us to like. Dennis Quaid was more accurate but not at all as appealing. Kevnin Costner did all right but i didnt care for him as wyatt earp even though i like him i just think that Kurt Russel did a better job. Above all this was a great film and i recommend this to all western go-ers, but be sure to catch wyatt earp as well to get the real scoop on wyatt's life.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Val's best!,"I'm a big fan of Val's and i believe that ""Tombstone"" is the movie that reflects perfectly his abilities as an actor.

Typical,"Coming from the director of Rambo and Cobra, it's obvious that Tombstone isn't trying to make new boundaries of the genre.  However, when a movie fails to be basic entertainment, then you know something is wrong.Excess is the name of the game in Tombstone.  Too many players, too many scenes, too many fool's pardons on the writer (who also wrote The Mummy and Rambo, go fig).  Kurt Russell is not his usual Escape from New York self, he is totally anti-Carpentar in his depiction of Wyatt Earp.  That's not very good either.  Watch Bill Paxton carefully, you can always guess what he's going to say next.Overall, only Val Kilmer and his self-assured swagger make the only worthwhile element here.  Everything else is underdone or overcooked.  1.5 out of 5.",,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best westerns of the modern era.,"This is the best Kurt Russell performance I've seen. And the story was so thoroughly buddy film that I think one of the best lines in buddy film if not western history was uttered in it. As Wyatt Earp (Russell) prepares to face certain death Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) moves to go with him. Texas Jack tries to stop Doc and and asks Doc why he would go to certain death with Wyatt. Doc says ""Wyatt Earp is my friend"". What follows is one of the greatest exchanges in cowboy history in my mind. I bought the whole shootin' match. I watch it a couple times a year. Good to horses, passionate with women, good drinkers and gamblers, no cussin' and truthful to their friends. Those Earp boys and the posse they traveled with in this film were Americana at its finest. You cannot go wrong with this one if you're looking for good 'ol cowboy fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Fun, but bad acting at times. Val Kilmer rocks.","Overall well worth watching. The acting between Kurt Russel and Dana Delany's love story is sometimes cheesy and boring. But when it comes to action scenes this show shines. Val Kilmer is great as Doc. Honestly the entire cast is well cast, even the bad guys. The show loses points simply because a couple of scenes where Kurt Russel is just stiff and doesn't feel authentic and because I think Wyatt Earp is slightly better.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Tombstone, the best western out there","Tombstone is one of the best westerns to watch if you are in the mood for one, the movie his historically accurate with a few exceptions, the movie leaves you wanting more from Val Kilmer's Doc Holiday, it is well done and is a staple in the western movie genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
In top 10 of all time movies!!!,"To many people have not seen this film! This is truly a CLASSIC! If your a fan of Westerns, a fan of action, a fan of true storys or just a fan of great movies.....this is for you!! In an era when the change in laws on gambling and gun handling was sweeping across America, Tombstone was one of the last towns to be affected. Hench the reason all cowboys and harden gamblers moved in causing an extremely volatile town and ultimately the infamous GUN FIGHT AT THE OK CORREL!! Wyatt Earp is a legend that moved to Tombstone with his family and close friend Doc Holiday! Val Kilmer plays Holiday with unbelievable brilliance and wit in with out doubt his finest performance ever and Kurt Russel is excellent playing the tough Earp. This is a must see and see again!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I wanted to like it but couldn't,"The story itself is good but it is so unnecessarily crass and ""violent"" it's stupid. If you are looking for a movie with killings with no consequence on a large scale and profanity for the use of sounding bad, this is the movie is for you. I wanted so much to like this movie with the great actors involved but the script is simply crap. Everything fails in this movie. I want to make it to the climax of the movie but can't. Unfortunately, the script has done such a good job in not making me care about the characters in an unrealistic plot leads to a movie that sucks. I could give no crap about. I like the main actors and I wish one of them had called ""bs"" on it.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A mannered but memorable depiction of the post-bellum American West, as outlaw rule was challenged by marshals and civilization crept into once-violent towns like Tombstone","No recent Western contains a stronger cast, a finer script, a superior score, or more stunning cinematography than 1993's Tombstone. Based on a true story, and set in Arizona after the Civil War, when the country was rapidly expanding westward and open range was giving way to fenced-in fields, the story's central incident involves a showdown between outlaws (the Cowboys) and Wyatt Earp's gang of deputy marshals, including his brothers and tubercular dentist Doc Holliday.This film contains perhaps the most memorable storyline of the post-Civil War West: the forces of lawlessness duking it out with those of civilized society. Both groups, the Cowboys with their red sashes who have had a free hand in Tombstone for years, and the Earps who are the closest thing to lawmen in the region and are reluctantly drafted by the citizens to protect them from the Cowboys, are reluctant to do battle but circumstances bring about the memorable showdown.Director George Cosmatos knew this would be a character-driven story and he hunted down Hollywood's finest to fill the central roles. The historical Tombstone characters best remembered today are strongly drawn in the film by first-class actors doing their best work. The lead role, Wyatt Earp, is strongly played by Kurt Russell. He is the head of the Earp family, backed up by brothers Morgan and Virgil (Bill Paxton and Sam Elliott), and accompanied by a dentist/gunfighter dying of tuberculosis, an effete Val Kilmer, whose brilliant portrayal of an elite southerner going down with Dixie steals the movie. He deserved an Oscar for creating this utterly original character.Everybody knows the bad guys make or break a Western, and here they are represented by legendary character actors Powers Boothe, William Brocius, Billy Bob Thornton, Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Jason Priestly, and too many others to name. At times a few more people are on the screen than necessary, and some performances cone across as mannered, but we don't mind because we're having so much fun watching. Unlike ""Shane,"" where earnestness and virtue prevail, ""Tombstone"" refuses to take itself so seriously, and is all the better for it. Kilmer's faux-shootout using a drinking cup for a revolver is hilarious. (Don't believe me? You've got to see it!) The historical Tombstone characters were larger than life in their time, and their depiction with no punches pulled is what this movie's audiences wanted to see. Neither they nor the critics were disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Longtime Arizonan, author, and cowboy action shootist.","""Tombstone"" is the most stylish Western ever, and the most entertaining.  Val Kilmer's marvelous performance as Doc Holiday contrasts with Dennis Quaid's in ""Wyatt Earp"" but both are entirely watchable. Despite its factual errors (which are few beside the over-rated ""Darling Clementine"") I never tire of watching ""Tombstone.""  Let's see a ""prequel""",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great American Western,"I don't watch movies to learn great things about history, I watch movies to be entertained. For me, the desire to watch a movie more than once is telling, and Tombstone is one of those movies that remains highly entertaining with repetitive viewings. The cast is perfect, Kurt Russell is a perfect Wyatt Earp, and Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holiday is nothing sort of amazing. How Kilmer was denied the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award is beyond my understanding. In my opinion, the very best American westerns include: (number 1) The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Unforgiven (along with most of Eastwood's other westerns) and now Tombstone should be added to that short list. If you watch movies to be entertained, as I do, even if you are not a Western fan, Tombstone is an entertaining classic. Watch it and you'll agree.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
My favorite,"In my opinion the acting is outstanding for any genre. Val Kilmer deserved an Oscar for his performance alone. I always say that the best actors bring out emotions in people and Kilmer has that effect on me and many people I know. The other supporting actors also deserve credit for that authenticity, they were beyond great. I have seen the movie fifty plus times and I find I get emotional each and every time I watch. Kurt Russell plays a great role and adds to the mystique of the frontier towns of the past . Sam Elliott is the closest representation of a real cowboy, this too gave the movie a realism that mad3 even more believable.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Dramatic, epic and downright cool!","Tombstone is one of all-time favourite films. It's definitely my favourite western. It features one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen, many of who take meagre supporting roles in a film that never stops entertaining.While perhaps not accurate, Tombstone is the story of retired lawman Wyatt Earp who moves to the title town and plans to go into business with his two brothers Morgan and Virgil. Before long, his reputation attracts the attention of the Cowboys, a gang of vicious outlaws who essentially rule the region. When the Cowboys target Wyatt's family, he and longtime friend Doc Holiday declare all out war on the gang.Tombstone contains some quality acting, sharp dialogue and tense set-pieces which combine to form a truly rousing package. Production values and the score are also top notch. The story takes the odd detour now and then, giving the impression that a much longer version is around somewhere (with lots of characters and sub-plots touched upon). Nevertheless, the appeal of the film comes from it's strong characters.Kurt Russell makes a career-best performance in a role he was born to play. Both quiet and intimidating, he commands authority whilst able to show his more personal feelings and concerns. Val Kilmer is also fantastic as Doc Holiday and for many, he is the stand-out performance.Compared to it's counterpart 'Wyatt Earp', the film goes straight for the jugular and pulls on the heartstrings. As a result, the film is unapologetic in it's violence but also at times very moving.Tombstone is definitely a gem of a western and never have moustaches looked cooler.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Horrible,"Bad acting, pastiche directing, over dramatic music. This movie is an insult to the industry. The story is worn out and forces all the clichés of the film school in a very unnatural sequence in the film. Val Kilmer is dying half of the movie. My god, at the end you want him to get it over with. And oh yes, we have t have romance as well. Do we have a female. Oh yes, let´s get an actress. And then the corny life lesson. Spare me!

I watched this last night after several years and realized just how good the writing filming and casting was. The cast has more honors in this one film than many films today. The camera work of the gun fight scenes down to the focus of the steely glare of the eyes of the gunfighters is a class in what and how to capture on film. Billy Bob Thortons character wasn't what we're normally used to seeing him in but he was no less believable.

"a great western, two of my favorite actors at thier finest","if ur not a western fan (i am one) then im sure you wil still like this movie. it isn't the kind of movie where there has to be a gun shot off every five minutes, it is the kind of film that offers enough action, comedy, romance (although this was not a favorite element of mine), and great acting to please anyone. Kurt russel is one of my favorites, and he didn't disappoint me, and Val Kilmer steals every scene he is in. His potrayal of Doc Holliday wasn't as accurate as Dennis Quaid's in Wyatt Earp (another good movie) but it was just as awesome. i also really liked  michael biehn as (the good gut from terminator 1) as johnny Ringo. Along with sam elliot and Bill paxton, this movie provides all the entertainment that makes a great film great However, the character of Allie Earp dragged the film down, so if u rent this movie, her scenes would b the perfect times to go get a snack or take a leak. but don't worry, most of her scenes are with kurt russel, who saves the scenes he nearly ruins.

Truly awful,"I remember this being critically mauled when it was released but decided to watch it recently due to its high user reviews, thinking that it might be an overlooked classic. Don't make the mistake I did The positive reviews are clearly from people who have never witnessed moving pictures before.

Highly recommended; One of my favorite Movies. ...,"Where do I start ? Well written, directed and acted. Career topping performances by Russell and Kilmer. Great story with historical characters (While not always historically accurate). Still a well done and entertaining Western.A cult classic and one of my favorites. This film has an all star cast and is full of 'Movie moments' that you won't soon forget. Shot entirely in Arizona (only a few miles from Tombstone) the story centers on the Earp's retiring from the law business and settling down in the quiet town of Tombstone to raise their families and start a new life. They soon find out a local gang (The Cowboys) extort and terrorize the citizens and basically run the small town.All this is about to change when the Earp's get involved and return to duty as lawmakers! Great fun from start to finish. You'll be quoting this film for weeks. One of my favorite quotes: ""You tell 'em the laws comin', ..You tell 'em I'm comin', and Hell's comin' with me!, you got that? Hell's comin' with me!""If you've never seen Tombstone, and are reading this to help you decide it worthwhile, Watch It!

"Nice one, Sam. NOT!!!","After Sam Elliott's recent remarks regarding the movie ""Power of the dog"" I thought I'd see what a ""real man's"" western looks like. Well, it looks slow and boring with clunky dialogue, wooden acting and tedious action. Nice one, Sam. You managed to take a compelling story and turn it into a snore factory. The only redeeming feature is Val Kilmer's performance as Doc. Holliday.There's something very old fashioned about ""Toomstone"" compared to the sublime ""Unforgiven"" which came out the previous year. It's almost like a 1950s movie in that it isn't realistic, the characters are drawn as moral actors ( the goodies are very good but the baddies are very bad ) and there is an obligatory love interest for the ladies ( ha ha ) which is completely superfluous and goes nowhere but adds 20 minutes onto the runtime. I'm afraid I couldn't finish it, as soon as Val Kilmer left the stage half an hour from the end there didn't seem much point.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Truly an outstanding, well made film!!","I used to love Western movies, but the genre had all but disappeared in the few years leading up to ""Unforgiven"" and eventually to ""Tombstone"".  This rendition of the OK corral legend, although not all that accurate from a historical perspective, was without a doubt the finest ever filmed.  Kevin Costner's ""Wyatt Earp"" was a slow moving, plodding disappointment compared to this masterpiece.  The dialog in ""Tombstone"" is simply amazing, some of the most memorable lines in American movie history. Val Kilmer came of age as Doc Holliday in this movie, he should have won an Oscar for his portrayal.

A great modern Western,"Having lived so close to the actual town of Tombstone for many years and having visited the town many times, I always felt a connection to the movie. Its a bit humbling to see the land that is now covered with asphalt and wood portrayed in a manner that seems rustic and untainted. I've always loved the classic Westerns, and this one seems head and shoulders above the rest.While some people still dispute the validity of the film's self-proclaimed ""authentic"" tag, it still remains one of the best westerns ever. It will never age poorly, simply due to the mix of modern day aesthetics and rustic ambiance. All of he characters were presented with an arc all their own, firmly infused within the film's texture.

Meh,"""Tombstone"" is a Western film that attempts to capture the legendary gunfight at the O. K. Corral but ultimately falls short of the mark. While it boasts an ensemble cast, including Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer, the film's execution leaves much to be desired.First and foremost, the film suffers from a lackluster and predictable plot. The narrative seems more interested in showcasing gunfights and shootouts than in developing its characters or exploring the historical context. This results in a shallow and one-dimensional storytelling experience that fails to engage viewers on a deeper level.Character development is virtually nonexistent. Even with a talented cast, the characters in ""Tombstone"" feel like cardboard cutouts with little depth or complexity. Kurt Russell's portrayal of Wyatt Earp lacks the gravitas and emotional depth needed to make us truly care about his character's journey.Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday is perhaps the film's lone bright spot, but even his performance can't salvage the film as a whole. His witty one-liners and charismatic presence stand out in an otherwise lackluster ensemble.Furthermore, the film's pacing is uneven, with long stretches of dull exposition punctuated by sporadic and often gratuitous violence. It feels like a missed opportunity to delve into the complexities of the Old West and the characters who inhabited it.In terms of historical accuracy, ""Tombstone"" takes significant liberties with the real events and characters it portrays, which can be frustrating for those looking for a more faithful retelling of the O. K. Corral story.Overall, ""Tombstone"" is a forgettable Western that squanders its potential. While it may have its moments of excitement and a standout performance from Val Kilmer, it ultimately fails to deliver a compelling narrative or memorable characters, making it a disappointment in the genre.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best ever!,"I saw this on the big screen when it came out in 1993. After enjoying most every minute of this rich, colorful, and gripping movie, I just couldn't believe it wasn't getting more attention. It's one of the most quotable, fun, moving, memorable films ever. THIS is what movie-making is really about --creating and celebrating unforgettable characters in a compelling story.And they managed to make it tense and moving with minimal cursing, sex, nudity, gore, etc. It is simply wonderful. Certainly not a family film; but tame on some levels, and I love it. I especially adored Dana Delaney in her role --she was breathtaking and fascinating. Oh, and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday? Are there words? He SHOULD have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor by the Academy Awards for that performance. It's a crying shame he was not. To this day, it is a crying shame he was not nominated.There were many good performances in Tombstone. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson was achingly sad and believable as the morphine-addicted Mattie. Sam Elliott was in top form. He was so calm and reserved --when he lost his temper in one scene, it was really frightening. Billy Zane, Thomas Haden Church, Billy Bob Thornton, Powers Boothe, Kurt Russell, Stephen Lang --many of the actors were simply fabulous. And WHAT a cast of actors! My gosh! If you watch it today (2011), it's amazing how many actors you recognize who were fairly unknown then.Wonderful character development. It was so easy to get involved in the characters' stories and to pull for them. Yes, they took a few liberties with historical facts; but they brought the gunfight at the OK Corral and its back story to life in a grand, wildly enjoyable film with rich, interesting characters.Tombstone is a ""10"" in my book.

Very good western with Russell and Kilmer,"I watch both this one and ""Wyatt Earp"" because I wanted to compare them. Latter was more epic and adventure-styled, also a bit more inconsistent because it deals with such long time period. ""Tombstone"" on the other hand is more tight because it tells only the story of Earp's later days and his last fights.It's been a few weeks since I watched it so I've already forgotten what was I going to say but what has stayed is that it was a thoroughly good western film with great cast. Kurt Russell is an excellent Wyatt, and Val Kilmer equally great Doc Holliday - maybe the best performance I've seen from him. The script is well constructed with no boring moments.Probably my second favorite 90s western after ""Unforgiven"". It's a must see for fans of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just About the Perfect Western,"I have seen this film probably 12 times. It's one of those movies that draws you in if you catch it on cable. Walk by the TV with this playing, and kiss your next two productive hours goodbye.The script is solid, but it's performances, direction and editing where this film makes its mark. You can also throw a nice nod to the score, which supports the mood of the scenes, rather than attempt to create it.Simply put, Val Kilmer should have been nominates for Best Supporting Actor. He and Kurt Russell give the move its soul. They are the emotional core and they nail it. Russell's Wyatt Earp is my favorite of all time.George Cosmatos is an enigma. He's capable of doing this kind of work, yet he's also made some real crap during his career. The man obviously has talent and it shines brightly here. He came into the production after shooting had started, replacing the film's writer, Kevin Jarre.Despite all the scenes that were cut, this film qualifies as a western epic, and I consider it a classic. I also think this movie is what Kurt Russell will be most remembered for.""Tombstone"" is closer to the true story of the town, but is not meant to be factual.

"An emotional roller-coaster, accurate enough to history!","To sum up Tombstone in 1,000 words is near impossible. Fantastic portrayals by the tough Kurt Russell and an amazing supporting performance by Val Kilmer create the perfect relationship between the two legendary westerners. Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, Jon Tenney and Powers Boothe provide amazing roles in the background of the legend that was Tombstone. As Wyatt Earp heads to Tombstone to retire his badge for a life in business, he is joined by longtime friend John Henry ""Doc"" Holliday, as well as his young, eager brother Morgan (Paxton), the experienced, older brother Virgil (Elliott), and James and Warren Earp, (not portrayed in this movie). Trouble brews and Wyatt is caught up where he didn't want to be. The illegal cowboy faction made up of the Clantons (Stephen Lang, Thomas Haden Church), Curly Bill Brocius (Powers Boothe), John Ringo (Michael Biehn), and several other outlaws runs Tombstone, until the Earps move in.The lighting and scenery is believable, the roles are all incredibly well-portrayed, and the plot is fantastic.

If you like western's with a touch of 90's bravado, this is a great selection.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best movies I've ever seen.,"Tombstone was everything a western should be.  Considering it was filmed in the 1990's, you have to give it serious credit for authenticity in western lingo, as well as costumes, scenery and the like.  I was absolutely floored by the story and the acting.  Kurt Russell was the greatest I've ever seen him.  And as far as Doc Holliday goes, a better part for that character was never written than in this movie and no one ever played a better Doc Holliday than Val Kilmer.  I think Val is great, no role is beyond his ability to play it.  The characters he has played is in such variety, that his fans must never know what character he will play next. Tombstone made me love westerns, a genre I had not embraced (though I am a movie buff).Sam Elliot was wonderful, no one has a more serious mustache than this man, and boy does it work in a western.  Charlton Heston was a nice choice for a cameo role.  Kudos to the writer (who also wrote Glory and The Mummy). This movie is in my top 25 of all time greatest.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tombstone,"I was not super crazy about westerns but overall I really enjoyed this film a lot. I thought it was great overall. The story is centered around a lawman that just wants to simply retire and live a peaceful life. But he does not get that luxury in Tombstone. He comes across some wild cowboys that quite honestly don't know who they are dealing with and bring out the bad in him and make him resort to being a man of the law and to address any unruly citizens. The cast and directing is what makes this film so good. When you look at the cast, you can't help but love this film for the American classic that it is.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"They got the names correct at least, sorta","All the top reviews on this movie chirp about how ""historically accurate"" this film and the character portrayals are. Nothing could be further from the truth; almost nothing about this film is historically accurate. At least they got the names correct, sorta.Let's start with the story. The ""Cowboys"" were not some unified gang with a leader and a uniform like the Crips and the Bloods; the whole ""red sash"" wearing thing was idiotic. The ""Cowboys"" were a very loose collection of ranchers, petty thieves, and professional criminals, some of whom worked together and others who killed one another during their work. The Earps were not a gang of lawmen; they were men who worked hard to support their families and protect their interests in mining and gambling concessions while working employment as public and private law detectives, employed by their local municipalities, private banks, ranchers, and even the Federal government. The political situation in Tombstone was very complex and the Earps came along at a time when public servant criminality was rampant. In short, the Earps paid employment became a thorn in the side of those who expected their criminality to be uncontested. The movie ""Tombstone"" glosses over all of that and turns it into a cartoon Western worthy of Warner Brothers.The characters are also an interesting bunch. Kurt Russell does a great job of perfecting the steely-eyed glare Wyatt Earp was known for, but the rest of his persona is as one-dimensional as the wooden cutouts that stand at the OK Corral tourist attraction today. Completely absent is the actual human being who had motivations, desires, and emotions that any man has when thrust into an untenable situation.Everyone loves Sam Elliot as the tough guy, but having a 50 year-old grey haired Elliot stand in for a 38-year old Virgil Earp was comical. He appears to be more of a dad than a brother.Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday was cartoonish. Everyone raves how it was such a historical depiction of Doc and nothing could be farther from the truth. Dennis Quaid's Doc was the closest you'll ever get to seeing the real Doc - a gruff, violent man not prone to flowery prose. Kilmer's sweaty, puffy, pale Doc was clownish, while Quaid's thin, hacking violent Doc was accurate. Dennis Quaid's Doc also more closely followed the real relationship between him and Wyatt - a grudging, tolerant respect based more out of convenience than true friendship. They were useful to each other and Wyatt tolerated Doc, but on several occasions left him behind only for Doc to follow along.Biehn's Johnny Ringo was also cartoonish. Ringo was such a minor character in the real Tombstone that he's barely mentioned in the historical annals. Here in the movie he's a major character and protagonist. In reality Ringo was a drunk and a bum who mostly hung out in the nearby town of Galeyville and only appeared in Tombstone on occasion to get supplies.Powers Boothe's Curly Bill was entertaining but also way over-stated his importance to the real Tombstone saga. There was no unified boss or gang, and each group had their own alphas who managed business because all the different groups lived as much as 50 miles apart in the vast open county.Dana Delaney's Josie was a major miscast, as were many of the other characters, either due to age, appearance, or manner. The real Josie Marcus was very young while in Tombstone, and fairly fresh to the frontier. She was slight of build and while known to have a temper in later years, wasn't the tall, bold, imposing gal Delaney brings forth. Joanna Going's portrayal in ""Wyatt Earp"" was far more accurate.The rest of the story totally missed all the politics and motivations as to what actually happened in Tombstone. Totally minor and invisible characters are blown up into major importance. Appearances and mannerisms are completely wrong. Scenarios are completely made up. The whole ""I'll be your huckleberry"" was completely made up, it never happened in real life. Much of the dialog and activities were taken from Stuart Lake's 1930 book on Wyatt Earp, which was mostly made up because Earp was a horrible interview subject and provided one-word answers and little detail. In short, the movie was as much a fantasy as Lake's book. I give the movie 3 stars because as a straight up fictional Western, it certainly is entertaining. But for actually being historical and providing a portrayal of real people and real events, I would have rated it zero stars if possible. If you want a good portrayal of the actual people and events in Tombstone, ""Wyatt Earp"" is a thousand times better. Some of the scenes like the death of Ed Masterson in Dodge City was incredibly accurate except for the very last moment of the scene. The OK Corral gunfight was also very well done. It's not without its faults but does pretty well in following the real history. ""Tombstone"" is mostly fictional.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing performances ...,"by Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton (as Wyatt Earp, his two brothers and his friend, Doc Holliday).I must start out by saying; I have a strong dislike for ""westerns"".  Even having been raised from the age of 6 in Colorado, my tastes run more contemporary, modern and sometimes even futuristic.  My partner in life and I have recently been talking about our all time favorite movies.  We have discussed many and have about 60% of our choices in common.  The other day, we began discussing ""Tombstone"" and I interrupted him saying that he could ""just stop because I was not going to watch a Western.""  He convinced me to watch the movie based solely upon Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday.Well, I thought Val Kilmer was magnificent in ""The Doors"" and ""Heat"" and have been a fan of his since ""Real Genius"" so I grudgingly agreed to watch the movie.  Even as I put the VHS tape in the VCR, I was dreading my promise to him.  I waited to watch the movie until late last evening, ensuring a smooth transition into dreamland because I would be bored to tears and let's face it:  a boring movie is better than a sleeping pill.  Okay, here: ""You were right, honey.""This film captivated me in the first 5 minutes.  I went into the movie having little to no knowledge of the story of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday. Basically I knew their names from history; however before last evening I couldn't have told you whether they were ""good guys"" or ""bad guys.""The performances by Mr. Russell and Mr. Kilmer were phenomenal as I was transported back to the day of the Wild West.  Val Kilmer *was* Doc Holliday.  He oozed sex appeal, emotion, and honesty; every woman who has ever watched this movie wishes she were Doc's Kate.  Holliday was extremely attached to Wyatt Earp ~ the depth of the friendship beautifully portrayed by both actors.   Either would have given his life for the other.   The additional performances by Elliott as Wyatt's brother Virgil, and by Paxton as their brother Morgan, gave us a further glimpse into the dynamic lives of the Earp Family.This movie has everything:  good vs. evil, comedy (Holliday's response to Johnny Ringo's pistol twirling show), action, suspense, romance and some incredibly moving and emotional scenes.  I cried twice, once almost to the point of sobbing.  It has been a very long time since I had been so moved to that point by a film.  I have watched it three times in the last 24 hours and am planning on purchasing it for my own VHS collection.  Hmmmmm ... now may be a good time to upgrade to DVD .........Revisit Tombstone ... remember when you wanted to be a cowboy?  And ladies, you know you want him.  *wink*",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Russell is great and Kilmer is show-stopping!,"Okay, so this film is no western classic, and doesn't have the same feeling you get from most westerns, but Tombstone is a great movie with great performances. Russell is flawless as Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer, puts in the greatest performance of his life as Doc Holliday.. he is funny, moving and tragic, and steals the film away from Kurt Russell. Although I have since heard of the real events in Tombstone, and realised that these characters wre portrayed in, a very favourable light, I cannot help but feel the impact that Tombstone produces. This is thoroughly entertaining and is a good example of great story telling.

Val Kilmer's best movie,"I was very impressed with the movie overall, even after watching it innumerable times. My understanding is that it is quite historically accurate, but the best lines in the movie are reserved for Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday. A different kind of role for him (a sickly sophisticated sidekick).",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The best of the bunch,"Although the second-most accurate telling of Wyatt Earp and his legend (Kevin Costner's version is more accurate,though not 100%), this film is the most enjoyable film on the subject. It is also one of the best westerns of all time.The mood if this film isn't as grim as Costner's version, or 1967's ""Hour of the Gun"", but it's enjoyable to watch (think of Silverado, only slightly better.) It has great action, it's quick-paced, adds in a little romance for the heck of it, and a lot of great lines to be quoted.I rank it up there with the best westerns ever made, right along with the likes of ""the Searchers"", ""Unforgiven"",""The Maginficent 7"", ""High Noon"", ""Red River"", ""Stagecoach"",""Shane"", ""Silverado"", ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"", and ""Silverado"", get it?",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A truly great Western.,"Of all the movies made about the OK Coral shootout, this one is the most historically accurate.  (Note, I did not say it was 100% historically accurate).  I am a Tombstone scholar and this by far was as close to real history as any movie has gotten.  Not to mention there were great performances by Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliot and Powers Booth.

"What's up, Doc?","Even if you're not at all familiar with the Wyatt Earp legend, or with Westerns particularly, this remarkable film can easily draw you in to an obsession with both.  The depiction of the time and place seems thoroughly authentic, and the acting is top-class - while Kurt Russell makes a fine central character, Val Kilmer displays effortless cool as Doc Holliday, and Michael Biehn is suitably menacing as gunslinger Johnny Ringo.  The fabulous script allows every actor to shine, and many of Doc's lines especially will stick in your mind, such as ""I'm your huckleberry"" and ""Isn't that a daisy?""My only criticism would have to be the love story in this film - it just doesn't work.  And while I would praise it for trying, the fact is, there just isn't room for much romance in the genre.Should Val have won an Oscar?  Of course he should.  But the one thing we all know is that the best man rarely wins.  But never mind - justice is coming, and hell will follow with it!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Few westerns are as good, and Val Kilmer is superb!","The entire movie is a true ride. Kurt Russell is one of the most underrated actors of all time, but he pulls off Wyatt Earp as none have before. But just when you see Russell making Earp come to life, Val Kilmer takes Doc Holliday to a new level of brilliance! It is mesmerizing to watch Kilmer BECOME Holliday as none have done it before. His manners, his words, his drunkeness, are so incredibly wonderful to watch, that as good as Russell or anyone else in the cast are, you could throw them all away and just watch Kilmer doing Doc. Many people have wondered why Kilmer didn't win any award for this, and I can only say that it is a travesty of the system. There is no finer performance in any role by any one. The Val Kilmer interpretation of Jim Morrison is almost as dead on, but Val just lives Holliday in this, they are one and the same, and it is so real that you actually forget it's a movie. The drunken sweating cup twirl is fantastic, but even before that, when he talks Latin to Johnny Ringo and then just watches as Ringo twirls his own gun in Docs face, is sheer wonderfulness. Great movie, terrific acting, out of this world Val Kilmer.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Truly Epic Western,"The story of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and the Earp brothers taking on the Clantons at the OK Corral gunfight has been done on film numerous times. ""Tombstone"" came out before ""Wyatt Earp"" which was Kevin Costner's version of the Earp saga. I've never been able to sit through the entire thing, although I'm a fan of the earlier westerns. Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of Costner in dramatic roles. In fact the only thing I really care for him is playing the smart ass jock as he did in ""Bull Durham"" and ""Tin Cup."" Russell on the other hand may be the most versatile actor of his time. He can do comedy, action, drama or play the romantic lead. In ""Tombstone"" there isn't much comedy, but he gets to use all his other skills as Wyatt Earp, the legendary Kansas lawman.Russell's Earp is at a crossroads of his life, call it a mid-life crisis although no one used that term back in the 1880's. He and his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) have come with their wives to the booming silver mining town of Tombstone to make a new life and hopefully their fortunes. Wyatt is tired of law enforcement, they want to try their hand at being the house in one of the numerous gambling establishments in town. However they find themselves getting caught in the middle of the lawlessness that is rampant in Tombstone. The town is controlled by Cowboys, their leaders being Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) and Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) and his clan. A great western is only as good as the bad guys and this trio is superb. Curly Bill is a calculating, clever and opportunistic leader, who has a trace of likability and humor. Ringo is their gun. He's a sadistic cutthroat who truly enjoys killing. Ike Clanton is a vicious bully who turns coward when cornered. Gradually, against the advice of Wyatt, both Virgil and Morgan become Marshals and Wyatt is again brought back into it, along with his loyal friend, Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) Kilmer is excellent and really steals every scene he is in, whether it is at the poker table or with his woman Kate, or with a gun, something he can do better than anyone, except perhaps Ringo, as they move toward an inevitable duel. Doc is a man who knows his time is limited, he's dying of tuberculosis. It also makes him a dangerous foe.Wyatt has also had an unanticipated love relationship come to him in Tombstone, when he meets Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany) a lovely actress in a traveling theater troupe. There are both smitten almost immediately,although Josephine is also being pursued by the corrupt and cowardly Sheriff Behane, while Wyatt is still trying to maintain his marriage,although his wife Mattie is suffering from a drug addiction and neither seems to have any affection left for each other. Their love story is really secondary to the war between the Earps and the Cowboys although the film ends on an uptempo note, with Wyatt and Josephine getting ready to begin their lives together.So many great actors and performances in this. Kilmer is at the top, but Russell is very good as Wyatt Earp, a conflicted, flawed but fearless hero. Sam Elliott always plays the same character, but nobody does it better, especially in a western. Boothe and Biehn jockey back and forth as a pair contemptible outlaws, truly unconscionable. Billy Bob Thornton has a great bit as a local bully who has managed to bully and intimidate one of the towns faro games, until Wyatt Earp calls him down. Some legendary actors also have small parts-Chuck Heston as a local rancher who offers refuge to Wyatt and Doc, Bob Mitchum who is the narrator, and Harry Carey, Jr, the veteran of many great westerns who plays Sheriff Fred White.""Tombstone"" has plenty of gunfights, some great action and riding scenes, excellent cinematography and a rousing musical score. If you enjoy westerns it's one you can sit and continually watch, picking up something new every time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"'...and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him...'","That far away look in Johnny Ringo's eyes, right at the start when he delivers the famous line from Revelations. It's worth watching Tombstone just for that, but there are so many more great scenes. I've seen this film countless times and it just gets better with age. As westerns go it is right up there with the best.Kurt Russell, what can you say? Perfectly cast and just brilliant. His on screen prescence is epic. This together with the acting masterclass delivered by Val Kilmer, in what I believe to be his finest role, make this film what it is, thoroughly enjoyable throughout. Kilmer's portrayal of the ailing Doc Holliday has become the definitive one in my mind, studied and subtle yet explosive at just the right moment.The supporting cast of Sam Elliott, himself a strong contender as a 'must have' in any good western gives his usual flawless performance as Virgil with Bill Paxton ably completing the line-up for the Earp brothers. As mentioned above, Michael Biehn is superb as Johnny Ringo, giving the role just the right level of menace it deserves with a similar level of subtlety as that delivered by Kilmer.The other notable things about the film are the cinematography and the costumes and makeup. The lighting and camerawork are superb and all the set pieces have a vibrancy about them which holds the interest perfectly, for instance the street scene where Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus (again perfectly played by Dana Delany) first see one another.'An enchanted moment', remarks Holliday. Indeed it is and a memorable one.The way that the makeup department were able to make Val Kilmer look like he really was suffering from the long term effects of tuberculosis supported his character, perfectly reinforcing his performance. Similarly, the way Kurt Russell looked throughout the film. He really looked the part of the Texas law dog, real handlebar moustache and all.Tombstone will always be compared with 'Wyatt Earp', starring Kevin Costner, which came out six months later. Whilst this is also a great '90's western, for my money Tombstone takes the prize.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Only explanation for the high score is nostalgia. This is a poor film,"Was really looking forward to watching this as I remember it being a gritty, action packed western. But overall was very dissappointed.I'll keep this vague to avoid spoilers ....The story centres around a retired Wyatt Earp, moving to Tombstone to settle down, and, weirdly make some money off the locals with his brothers.The main positive is Val Kilmer and Kurt Russel and the interaction between their characters. This film would have been a 2 without Val.There is jarring, non-sensical, badly told and unconvincing love story going on throughout the film.Although some of the gunplay scenes (which were few and far between) were passable, there were also some terrible ones that took you out of the movie for their ridiculousnous.Their is a switch in the middle of the film that weakened it.The ""badies"" didn't have the charisma of anything you'd find in a Sergio Leonie film.I think what has happened is that everyone has remembered the one great scene depicted on the cover, and nostalgically voted based on that.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Who cares about the accuracy? Enjoy the thing.,"Ok, so there may have been too few or too many shots fired at the Ok Corral, and the costumes may be different, but this is a perfect movie. If it was too accurate it would have been boring. Val Kilmer may not be as gaunt as Doc was in real life but I bet Doc didn't get the laughs Kilmer did. Dana Delaney was perfect as Josephine, although I have to admit the constant wagging of her head annoyed me a bit. The one major flaw in this movie is that at the very end, as Wyatt and Josephine are dancing in the snow, the music is drowned out after three seconds as the final narration begins. They should have let the music carry on for a bit. But Hey Ho. Rent it, buy it, watch it. Let yourself be immersed in this movie. It will make you feel great.

Solid American Western 9/10,"One of the best modern Westerns -- not too surprising, since the genre is almost nonexistent in this day and age.

Not bad for a modern Western,"I will first come out and say it, I'm not a huge Western fan. I don't watch John Wayne or anything like that. Not to say I don't like the Western lifestyle and all of that, but the movies always seem to fall short somewhere. But not Tombstone. Tombstone managed to keep my attention. Kurt Russell(Wyatt Earp), Sam Elliot (Virgil Earp) and Bill Paxton (Morgan Earp) are 3 actors I always like in movies, so that automatically had me interested. Powers Boothe was great in Red Dawn and Sin City, so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed when he played Curly Bill Brocious. Michael Biehn was always good, so I knew Johnny Ringo would be played well. Michael Rooker surprised me by playing Sherman McMasters so well (although he wasn't in the movie all that long). Even Billy Bob Thornton opened my eyes as Johnny Tyler, the sleazy poker dealer (again, only in the movie briefly). It wasn't a bunch of city-slicker big name actors standing around bored talking with terrible western fake accents, shooting and cussing at everyone. This was actually a movie I could follow and enjoy. The gunfights were authentic, the tension was realistic, and the whole movie felt...well...real. However, there were some parts I feel were overdone. Wyatt seemed a little cocky at times. I didn't like John Behan's character either, he was pretty improbable, how he was everywhere disaster struck but always manage to get out alive. Still, good movie. 8/10.

The best western since Silverado,"Everyone knows the story of Wyatt Earp and the gunfight at O.K. Corral. This film covers the events before AND after that event with a beauty and ferocity that is rarely seen in westerns. Kurt Russell does well as Wyatt, Boothe as Curly Bill, Biehn as Johnny Ringo, but the real showman is Val Kilmer as the chronic killer ""Doc"" Holliday and turns in the best depiction of the gunslinger since Kirk Douglas. He is astounding. I think it was the best role he ever had and he makes the most of it. Kilmer makes you care about his character like no else can and his chemistry with Russell works like a charm. The casting was very good and the realism is unmatched. The gunfights are entertaining and keep your attention. There is tension and suspense in Tombstone like no other western you can feel it permeating the whole picture. Forget the movie ""Wyatt Earp"" with Kevin Costner this one knocks it out of the box rather easily. It's destined for classic status and is re-watchable which is unusual for most films being made today.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

However, each performance is stunning in it's own right, including incredible cameos by Billy Zane, Jason Priestly and Billy Bob Thornton.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tombstone,"The shooting of O. K. Corral is a mythical subject of the good old western of yesteryear, immortalized by John Ford and John Sturges among others. This version is intended to be closer to historical reality, the characters are more detailed, less glorious, more tormented, bearded and hairy, not always very clear in their actions.Stripped of its clichés of the old-school Hollywood mould, this western displays bloody violence and shows the Wild West as it really was, with its muddy streets, its filthy gambling dens, its unhygienic characters and its cowboys excited by beer and powder, constituting a more realistic trend started by Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" which developed similar elements.This spectacular western also shines with its impressive cast, led by the star duo Russell/Kilmer, but also the impeccable supporting roles like Michael Biehn, Sam Elliott, Stephen Lang or Powers Boothe... 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Amazing movie, great acting, surprisingly historically accurate...","Tombstone was lent to me from a friend, and quickly became my favorite movie. Although it is a Western movie (a type which I am not too fond of) the movie is bright, witty, and entertaining as compared to the typical drab, dull Western. Val Kilmer makes the movie with his portrayal of Southern gentleman turned drunken gunslinger =  Doc Holliday. In one week I watched the movie a dozen times. Obsessive? Yes, I admit to it. It's the type of movie that can never be seen too many times! I recommend this movie to absolutely anyone. It's a fabulous blend of action, drama, adventure, and overall fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Better than expected.,"I knew little about the film other than what anyone would know about that era in history.  I knew Jason Preistly was in it and that really didn't help.  But as I watched Tombstone, I became increasingly aware of the fact that it hadn't start sucking as I thought it would!  Val Kilmer is great, and Kurt Russel is pretty straight up too.  I couldn't believe the number of faces I recognized.  There's a pretty green and chubby Billy-Bob Thornton that took me a minute to notice.  Towards the end the glamorization (word?) goes a little bit over the top.  But, all things considered, I liked it. I'd recommend it to a freind and even you!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great Acting, Great Film","Tombstone is by far the best revisioning of the gunfight at the OK Corral and the life of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday. Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are both great in this film, as Wyatt and Doc, respectively. The two actors play off of each other with ease and make the film more watchable. In fact, Kilmer gives a bit of comedy relief where it's needed, compared to Russell's straightforwardness.There are some great scenes throughout the film, in particular, the scene with Holliday and Johnny Ringo and the ending scene is very heartfelt too. You'll laugh, you might cry too. It's a great western for modern times that is considered a triumph that helped bring the genre back, and relaunched Kurt Russell's career.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

My favorite Western,"Not being a big fan of Western's, I wasn't overly excited to see this film. However, fifteen minutes in and I was hooked.  Kurt Russell gives a convincing performance as Wyatt Earp, the Kansas lawman who moves to Tombstone to start a new life with his three brothers.  There he meets up with old friend Doc Holliday (played superbly by Val Kilmer),and the story takes off.  Tombstone is tormented by an organized crime ring of men called ""The Cowboys"".  The tension builds between this group and Wyatt's group, and creates a memorable drama.  The acting is superb, and the fast paced story keeps you hanging on each scene.  I especially enjoyed Val Kilmer's adaptation of Doc Holliday.  I found myself cheering for his character, genuinely moved by his acting.  The movie has action, drama, romance, and leaves you wanting more at the end.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and recommend it highly to all movie fans, even those who do not typically enjoy Westerns.  I rate the movie 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best Western of all time,"Val Kimers portrayal of Doc Holiday was Bad Ass from beginning to end - One of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen - and Hands down the best Western ever made.

Val Kilmers finest hour....so far...,"""I'm your Huckleberry."" I watched this again yesterday after nearly ten years since the first time. It was like meeting up with good friend. Val Kilmer's Doc Holiday is one of the finest characters in motion picture history.Every line he utters is a gem. The director manages to get the very best from all the actors used. Powers Boothe is mesmerising as Curly Bill. He should play the Joker in the next Batman movie. Did anyone else notice the the similarities between him and original Joker, Caesar Romero. I never thought Burt and Kirk's Gunfight at the OK Corale could be bettered but this is a ""Daisy."" Bring back Michael Beihn. I haven't seen him in anything for ages. His Johnny Ringo is great. Just as psychotic as his role in the Abyss. Only one thing wrong with this and that's Bill Paxton. Not because he plays it badly, it's just that Morgan was not a good role to play.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Movie for boys? Apparently,"I saw this one back in 93, felt like a bad joke... saw Wyatt Earp after and what a difference. I am a fan of literature and movies around the Earps and the duel, my preferred one before Costner's production was My Darling Clementine: Henry Fonda did a great job.But this nonsensical Hollywood movie, which everybody (boys) loves, is pathetic!Nice to see Biehn and Booth on the screen but the assault to the Mexican town is ridiculous: it's a shame Pedro Armendáriz jr wasted his talent there, but I guess everybody did in the movie.A guy walking with cards on his boots, geez! Even dressed as if they were going to Mass after a long shower... when they were riding for hours if not days, it hurts!But perhaps a single thing like the duel this movie got right, which I doubt, and all the so called experts claim to be the best... I challenge their credentials ha ha.A movie for boys: no character development, no context, no reason ... just nonsensical action. No wonder boys love Clone Wars, and thus the feminists in charge destroy that sci-fi franchise... how sad.I really recommend the previous iterations on the screen of this story, its characters and especially the historical context.

Best Wester I've seen!!!,"This movie's casting is excellent, each actor executed his role perfectly.  Val Kilmer will never equal his performance as Doc Holliday, and Kurt Russel brought Earpp to life. I watched a show on Earpp's life before going to this movie, and it's script is historically close.  The unbelievable events in this movie is true, and life, sometimes, is more bazaar then fiction.

A classic western but..,Its a very good western genre.no doubt about it..Kurt was good.val Kile is exceptional.but storyline jumps a few lines now and then..actions sequences are set to western standards..i mean you hit a bulls eye every time with a custom-made revolvers.. In comparison to the Kevin Costner's movie with similar biography i would like to Go with this one.its pace is well set so that it doesn't get boring or feel sloppy. But still could have been a better movie maybe even a epic one. The anti hero characters are not elevated properly.i mean to stand against a Highly decorated lawman...not just him along with his brothers and a deadly Loyal friend..you should have a strong character as a anti hero. The screenplay was good.the western background and locations are excellent. Overall a Good western flick to watch on a Saturday evening,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Dull western.,"A decent western. I have this on DVD and it's not a bad looking film, I don't think it's as good though as My Darling Clementine with it's black and white cinematography, the great climax and Henry Fonda in the lead role. This is more of an ensemble piece. I wasn't really convinced by Kurt Russel in the main role, I think everyone agrees Val Kilmer stole the show. The Plot is a fairly familiar one with cowboys riding around killing people and spreading fear and chaos whether they go. The film has probably too many characters, to the point where you don't really know who the clear main villain is meant to be. The female characters are given a bit to do but I think the female characters are bit too modern. The film does some stuff well by build up the stakes, the dialogue though towards the end gets really bad and the film seems to have about 4 different endings. It's all action in the second half but it goes on too long and you loose track of who is who and what they want. The Kurt Russell portrayal of the character is just a madman by the end too who kills about 40 people, the Henry Fonda portrayal was much better, mature, authoritative but with a cold deadly streak running through him too. Some of the special effects are a bit overdone too, there's a storm in which lightening flashes about every 3 seconds for about 5 minutes which just doesn't happen. The music is decent but again not memorable. The costumes and editing are both fine, nothing distracting and all pretty nicely done.I definitely rate My Darling Clementine though over this.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sam Elliott made all the difference,"I've watched hundreds of Westerns. I own all of Louis L'Amour's books and have read them all at least twice. And these are so many reviews that talk about Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell. Yes, they both put in great performances, and yes it was probably Kilmer's greatest. But what set this far and above all others is Sam Elliott. He has a natural God given gift of a voice and look that screams Western. And man oh man does he know how to use it. He and Kurt Russell are two of the men in Hollywood who have been with the same woman for decades, a major miracle in Hollywood. And I think that it reveals a certain type of man. Beyond that, Elliott 's role in this movie pushes it into the stratosphere of Westerns. I don't think Sam Elliott gets the credit due him.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Natuarlly being fans of Tombstone we had to check it out.I was not expecting much from Kevin Costner you seen one of his movies you seen them all.It was crap and it didn't compare in the least to Tombstone. Tombstone was awesome I am a big fan of Western movies.Val did a great job portraying Doc Holiday he's always been a virtual acting chameleon. Favorite scene besides all Doc's banter is in the first 5 minutes when he clears out The Oriental and bitch slaps Billy Bob Thornton and says fav quote ""you gonna do something or are you just gonna stand their and bleed"".You gotta watch this movie if you like westerns or action movies it's sorta of a guy movie but it's one of my all time favorites and I'm a chic in case you hadn't guessed.

There's nothing I'd change about this film,"Tombstone (1993) is currently available on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows Wyatt Earp and his brothers after he retires from law enforcement and moves to Tombstone to start his new career as a bar owner/operator. When a group of outlaws who run the town cross him and his brothers, and terrorize the townspeople, the Earps return to law enforcement. This movie is directed by George P. Cosmatos (Leviathan and Rambo: First Blood) and stars Kurt Russell (Escape from New York), Val Kilmer (Willow), Bill Paxton (Aliens), Sam Elliott (Roadhouse), Powers Boothe (Sin City), Charlton Heston (Ben-Hur) and Jason Priestley (90210). The storyline for this is very entertaining and contains larger than life characters. The cast matches the quality of the storyline with masterful performances. Every character is delivered to perfection. This is my all time favorite Kilmer performance and Paxton, Elliot and Russell played the Earp boys so well. The settings, backdrops and cinematography are perfect - as are the sets, costumes, hairstyles and props. The villains were also great as are the shootouts.

Tombstone can be watched and enjoyed at any point in the movie, yet the storyline flows effortlessly.  It doesn't contain any wasted scenes or leave any loose ends when the movie finishes.

Not to mention, there are so many iconic lines. For example, really well known, ""I'm your huckleberry."" said by none other, than Doc Holiday himself! As if he isn't a well built person to begin with, his lines are just wonderful.

EXCELLENT! Highest recommendation!,"This is one of my all-time FAVORITE films! I'm not particularly partial to movie westerns, but I AM very much interested in history, and even though there were minor liberties taken with certain details, this version was surprisingly accurate in MOST aspects of the story of the Earps, the Clantons, the ""Cowboys,"" and Doc Holliday -- moreso, in fact, than in any other film that I've seen on the subject.  (The DVD version comes with a great ""bonus"" disk which includes interesting interviews with cast and crew members, and behind-the-scenes production information.  It's fascinating to see how much painstaking effort was put into the production details, by cast and crew alike, in order to make the sets, costumes, and characters appear as authentic as possible).The story is SO well-acted, and so engrossing and entertaining, that I found it impossible to sit and nit-pick about historical accuracy; instead, I just relaxed and went along on a VERY enjoyable ride! As an example, in one scenario in which fact is unknown but theories abound --i.e., the circumstances surrounding the demise of the real Johnny Ringo -- the screenwriters presented a theoretical, but AWESOME, showdown scene between Ringo and ....oops!...won't spoil it for those of you who haven't already seen the movie -- but it's a MUST SEE!The cast was SUPERB, with special kudos to Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp -- EXCELLENT!!! -- (made me realize that he's capable of SO much more than I'd ever seen from him before) -- and to Val Kilmer, for his BRILLIANT portrayal of Doc Holliday -- he came, he saw, and he conquered the HELL out of that part! Also, Sam Elliot delivers his usual high-calibre performance, as Virgil Earp, and...well, there really wasn't a weak link in the entire cast! -- It is truly one of the greatest groups of actors that has EVER been brought together for any one production! I've bought the DVD for myself, and two others as gifts for friends/family. I think that most people -- male OR female -- would find this film more than worthwhile.

Ill be your Huckleberry....,"Retired lawman Wyatt Earp, after a successful career in Dodge City looks to become rich in solitude with his two brothers and fellow friend Doc Holliday in the booming town of Tombstone, Arizona. But when trouble in the form of the ruthless gang known as The Cowboys threatens the lives of all they hold dear, Earp and his family must defend themselves and become legends in the process.What many consider to be one of the finest western films ever made, with superb action and a captivating story that brings the grit and raw determination of the old west on the silver screen. Kurt Russell puts up one his finest performances as the conflicted lawman, but it is truly Val Kilmer's rendition of Doc Holliday that truly steals the show. The action is top notch as there is substance behind it rather than just action for the sake of it. 1800's Western life is brought to life in a realistic fashion. The most legendary shootout in western history is portrayed brilliantly and is perfectly paced within the film. Western life is perfectly portrayed in all of its glory which only adds to the charm and realism of the film.

Exciting AND Historically Accurate ? See the Director's Cut,"In either the theatrical version or the director's cut (VISTA series), ""Tombstone"" is an exciting and historically accurate account of the Earp brothers vs. ""the Clanton's"".  Unlike ""My Darling Clementine,"" ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" and ""Hour of the Gun,"" we get a true pictures of the relationships and fates of the Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, Josephine Marcus, Katie Elder, Curly Bill Brocius, Johnny Ringo (probably) and Ike Clanton.  Moreover, unlike the atrocious ""Wyatt Earp,"" we get a suspenseful, actionpacked and COHERENT storyline. We discover ""the Clanton gang"" of earlier films was actually a huge gang (over 100) of outlaws known as ""the cowboys.""  We learn that Virgil, not Wyatt is the real instigator behind the ""gunfight at the OK Corral and Wyatt a reluctant participant.""  That gunfight is given its proper perspective rather than being the dominant event in ""Tombstone.""  The male cast is mostly extremely good, particularly Val Kilmer (Holliday), Sam Elliot (Virgil Earp), Powers Boothe (Brocius) and Michael Biehn (Johnny Ringo). Unfortunately, with the notable exception of Joanna Pacula (Kate Elder), the female cast is pretty colorless. Especially disappointing is Dana Delaney as Josephine Marcus. There's nothing flat about Delaney, except her acting here.  One wishes, Joanna Going (""Wyatt Earp"") had performed the role in this movie. Nevertheless, it's a mild disappointment in a mostly terrific movie.George P. Cosmatos' director's  cut is a BIG improvement over the original theatrical release.  Although only four minutes longer, his version provides much better context and continuity, particularly during the ""reckoning "" portion. of the movie.  I would give the theatrical version a ""high 7"", while the director's cut is clearly a ""9"".The VISTA series DVDs comes with a bonus disk with lots of great features and a reproduction map of the OK corral drawn by Wyatt Earp in 1919.  The VISTA series disk is only a couple of dollars more thanthe theatrical version.  It's a must for any collector of great and near great westerns.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Just about the best ever U.S Western.,"By far the most exciting and vibrant western to emerge in the 90's. George ('Rambo') P. Cosmatos, completely overshadowed Kevin Costner's own 'Wyatt Earp' made in the same year and (the latter) on a much higher budget. Excellent details, with the reconstruction of Tombstone and a little known fact that cowboys indeed wore bright colour silks (sometimes clashing). You would not normally think of Val Kilmer as being one of the greatest actors of all time but his portrayal of Doc Holliday is nothing less than superb. With 'Tombstone' you not only get a blinding, Western extravaganza but a damn fine history lesson at the same time. The pace never lets up and all of the skilfully assembled cast are up really up to the task; in the sense that all (including Kurt Russell) give their best ever performances. A quite brilliant movie and my pick for the greatest ever U.S Western. An exciting, cracking experience!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best combination of entertainment and historical accuracy,"I rate this as the best Wyatt Earp movie as far as combining entertainment with historical accuracy.  The gunfight ""on the same block as OK Corral"" had many witnesses and is as well documented as any 30 second event with a lot of shooting can be.  I saw nothing in the film that contradicted written reports or court records.  The aftermath of the gunfight has always been open to controversy and the events in the movie, with the exception of Ringo's fate, are not outlandish.  Costner's Earp may have been closer to the true Earp persona, but it's just not as entertaining.  Kilmer, as mentioned by many, is great.  His relationship to Wyatt is just as touching but not nearly so somber and melancholy as the Costner--Quaid one.  For my money, Sam Elliott nearly steals the movie.  There will never be a better Virgil. This film is right up there with Unforgiven and Silverado as one of the best of the modern westerns.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Kurt Russell even exhibits some talent as Wyatt Earp, and of course a Western wouldn't be a Western without Sam Elliot.  The actor who portrays Johnny Ringo also gave a great performance.The gunfight at the OK Corral is probably the highlight of the film, although there are many excellent scenes.  I'm not sure if Doc Holiday says ""I'm your huckleberry"" or ""I'll be your huckleberry"" but whatever he says you'll be quoting it for months anytime someone challenges you.In summary, it's a simple story of good guys being punished for being good, and then kicking the living crap out of the bad guys - something many of people would enjoy seeing considering recent world events.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

My favorite scene that made cry seriously real tears was when Wyatt was at the tree about have his last gun fight, and his Doc steps out and says Doc Holliday, says to Johnny Ringo, ""I'Pick me I'll be your Huckleberry, that's just my game."" bezt line EVER. Are maybe it was Doc Holliday, says to Johnny Ringo, ""I'm your Huckleberry, that's just my game.""",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Possibly the very best western ever.....................,"Awesome performances from Val Kilmer, Michael Biehn, Sam Elliott and (for a change) Kurt Russell, make this not just a remake of The Gunfight at OK Coral, but possibly the greatest western ever. With a combination of shoot-outs, drink, women, gambling, comedy, organised crime and death.....need I say more. Don't bother with Unforgiven, forget the awful Wyatt Earpp('starring' Kevin Costner)rent/buy Tombstone for real western action.This is a return to the all action hero, at times ultra violent but always slick, fast paced and dynamic film. No boring bits, strong plot and excellent acting.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I'M BRINGING HELL WITH ME,"Western classic. Was shown this movie as a kid when I was young, and definitely can watch this at any time of the year. Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer steal the show by giving you everything you want in the Wild West. True civilized savages if you may say so. Val is the bad guy you want to win, and Kurt is a lawman that doesn't play games when it comes to the law. Crazy how these two are so different but stand together no matter what's in front of them. Val definitely made me shed a tear in one of his scenes, made me appreciate the time I have on this earth. Not a lot of movies make me emotional in this way, that's what makes this movie so good to me.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A very well done western, which replaces glorification with raw realism.","I really enjoyed this film, which is very centered on the notable figures of Wyatt Earp, Virgil Earp, Morgan Earp and Doc Holiday during their time as law and order in the town of Tombstone. In popular culture, they became famous due to a short but intense exchange of fire with a group of gunmen from the city, called the Ok Corral Shooting. The incident, which took place in October 1881, was widely romanticized in the early 20th century and became a symbol of the Old West.In fact, the shooting, which appears in this film, was just one violent incident within a long feud between the sheriffs and the gunmen. The causes are still shrouded in mists that historians are trying, with difficulty, to penetrate, and the feud continued and resulted in the murder of one of the Earp brothers and the pursuit and death of some of the assassins, in a veritable manhunt. I'm a historian, but I'm not an expert on the period or the Wild West, but I felt that the film managed to put everything in its context and respect, minimally, what really happened.If there is something in this film that deserves to be highlighted, it is the work of the actors. We have a magnificent cast, full of very competent actors who committed themselves to their respective roles. The effort deserves our praise. Of course, Kurt Russel will have a special highlight when receiving the character of Wyatt Earp, but the actor made good use of that role and managed to be very charismatic and friendly to the public. Sam Elliott, one of those veterans with a lot of attitude and personality, couldn't be better and is incredibly good in this film. Maybe it's the actor's best film. Val Kilmer is not one of those actors that makes me want to see a movie, but the truth is that he was also very good at his job, and managed to harmonize his character's fragility and charisma well.Directed by Kevin Jarre and George Cosmatos, the film is one of those westerns that went against the classics by dismantling the glorified figure of the cowboy, the bravery and coldness of the gunslinger and the villain, and giving a more realistic and historically credible flavor to films of this genre. The script is very good, it is very well written, and the technical work of the visual effects, make-up, costumes and set design teams was truly exquisite. The cinematography does not let us down either and makes very clever use of all this, and the sets and exterior footage, with magnificent lighting and a warm color palette that is simply delightful. The soundtrack, despite not being memorable or worthy of particular attention, does a good job.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the better existing western movies,"Overall opinion:I didn't see this movie until about 5 years after it was released and after hearing how great it was I finally saw it and couldn't agree more. This was a truly well made western. It had the catchy lines, the famous characters and a decent balance of action and acting.Plus and Minus Material (What I liked, What I didn't):+Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday+Michael Behing as Johnny Ringo+Kurt Russel as Wyatt Earp+Well written (some of my most favorite lines in movies come out of Tombstone)+Powers Boothe makes a good bad guy-It's got the expected language in parts which in some scenes ruins the western feeling of it all+Fairly epic for a western-Kilmer should've won an Academy Award",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A fine western - dramatic and artfully filmed,"The film is an craft-fully filmed western, with well-developed characters, plenty of action and gorgeous landscapes. The film uses the natural light and scenic vistas to great effect. There is one short scene where Wyatt is walking down a porch towards Madeline with the sun behind him that is just amazing.The story line builds beautifully. The characters are well-developed, even though there are many characters within the story. There isn't a place in the movie where I was left to wonder who is that guy and why is he doing what he is doing. The film is long, and there are many places where you are thinking the story has been told. Yet, the story line continues building and you find yourself caught up in the story over and over.In short: a well-written screenplay, an amazingly deep cast, excellent directing artfully filmed.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb Telling of the Wyatt Earp Saga,"""Tombstone"" deals with the adventures of Wyatt Earp and his brothers covering a two and one half year period. It starts with Wyatt (Kurt Russell) and his two brothers (Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton) arriving in Tombstone to seek their fortune. Subsequent events put badges back on the Earps and lead to the infamous gunfight at the OK Corral. The last third of the film deals with Wyatt's revenge on the baddies, known as ""The Cowboys"".Director George P. Cosmatos gives us a visually stunning film. From the spectacular sunsets/sunrises to the real lightning flashes and authentic settings and costumes. Most of the male actors are hidden under real beards and handle bar moustaches they grew which were common at the time of the story.The performances are excellent all around. Russell makes an excellent Wyatt. The relationship between Wyatt his brothers and Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer) are developed in detail. Kilmer plays Holiday as a former southern aristocrat complete with accent and mannerisms. Joanna Pacula plays his girlfriend. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson is good as Wyatt's drug addicted first wife and Dana Delaney looks stunning as the ""other woman"".Heading up the villains are Powers Boothe as Curly Bill, Michael Biehn as Ringo and Stephen Lang and Thomas Haden Church as the Clantons. Wyatt Earp's grandson Wyatt Earp III plays Billy Claiborne. Veteran western performer Harry Carey Jr. does a nice turn as the town marshal and Buck Taylor (of ""Gunsmoke"" fame) plays one of Wyatt's marshals. Charlton Heston puts in a cameo as a rancher and look for Billy Bob Thornton as a saloon bully early in the film.""Tombstone"" ranks in my opinion, as the best and most accurate version of the Wyatt Earp saga ever filmed. Try and catch the director's cut (at 134 minutes) which restores many of the cut sequences from the original version and serves to provide further clarification to the development of the characters and their relationships with one another.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
