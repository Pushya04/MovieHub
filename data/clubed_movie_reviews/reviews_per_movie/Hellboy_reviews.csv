An amazing spectacle,"This movie is a fun watch, but mainly because of Ron Perlman. The action is well done and the story is great, but Perlman makes the character of Hellboy (a demon raised by ""the good guys"") just amazingly human, with a wry sense of humor. You would be hard pressed to find anyone anywhere who could do this character as well as Perlman, let alone better. The physicality seems to have been tailor made to fit Perlman's features and the delivery of the lines is just so understatedly comedic that there are few who could pull it off at all.Of course, there are a couple times when the special effects are a little weaker than you would hope, but it doesn't detract from the movie as a whole. For instance, in the final battle scene, there are a couple shots where the Hellboy character clearly appears to be GC. But the fight moves so fast that you don't have much time to focus on those shots before something else amazing happens.See it. Love it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Red Horns Do It Better...,"Great comic series, good times on screen. Del Toro doesn't capture the shadowiness and the Gothic art of the books, but does the get the heart of the material, and plays it well between lighthearted comedy, lighthearted action, and as much weirdness(talking corpses, psychic merman, pyroknesis, Rasputin, clockwork Nazi assassins, and Cthulu, to name a few of the flourishes), as the story can handle.It is a super-hero movie, but one that mixes in occult myths, weird tales, and conspiracy theories, into a fine entertainment brew. Can't wait to see the next installment in the ""The Golden Army"". One of the best comic to film adaptations, not for style, but for heart and for fun's sake.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Guillermo Del-Toro's exciting, fun tribute to the flamboyantly cool powers of comic books","Hellboy is self-conscious, perhaps, but in the best ways possible. Actually, it's more due to writer/director Toro being very aware of what makes up the conventional bits to every sense character-wise to the world of a comic-book, but also what can be entertaining as well, than it is just to having it being a Hellboy movie where the comic-book Hellboy already exists IN this world (guy sees the Hellboy comic, looks up, it's Hellboy!). We get the tough-as-nails, dryly witty, and possibly ticking-time-bomb hero in Hellboy, a deadly serious villain in Rasputin (yes, Rasputin, with a blonde Nazi as his evil side-kick no less), the young apprentice to the hero (Ruper Evans as John Meyers), the hero's love interest (Liz Sherman played by Selma Blair), the father figure (John Hurt's Professor), and the reluctant 'boss' (Jeffrey Tambor), not to mention the plucky side mutant in Abraham (Doug Jones) AND a magnificent creature in that hard-ass slug. They're all there, bright as day (or dark, depending on point of view), and it all works wonderfully due to Toro running with it all head on. It's not done in a way that's meant to pander to the audience, either, but just to have fun with the conventions, to see what makes them all crackle and pop under big-time special effects. It's not quite a guilty pleasure because Toro is also a smart craftsman.And craftsman just as much as director, he crafts this world where the creatures (which were and still are Toro's forte) are fierce and radically charged, whether they're crucial to the picture like Rasputin's rabid, rapidly hatching slug-monsters that can only be killed one or two ways, or if it's just a minor creature like the zombie Russian corpse that leads a little of the way when Hellboy and his crew are in the main hideout of the villains (""I was better off dead!""). Toro is sensitive to the characters alongside this, and makes them all pretty believable- and I say pretty cause it's all a little simple, yet effective, in the main thrust of Hellboy's emotional core being about Liz and if she may or may not go for John over him- and doesn't dumb it down too much or contrive the relationships for the audience. It's a good balance, because there is A LOT of action in Hellboy, in fact probably at least a 60% allotment to either Hellboy fighting the monsters after him (usually in the subway, or in the Russian castle), or with the possibly un-dead assassin in the mask and leather who marks as one of the fiercest forces in comic book movies.So, fan-boys rejoice, because Hellboy should, and hopefully will, have everything one looks for in a brawny, high-octane entertainment where humor isn't confused with cheesiness (Perlman is too well focused as a possible anti-hero to get into any of that, as he makes that hugely built red lug a very real being), and the action isn't over-done with a tongue-in-cheek. Not that Toro doesn't flirt with having goofy things in his picture, like a moment where Hellboy has to save a box of kittens from the grasp of the slug-monster. But they're earned moments among a very tightly constructed story where human evils in history and the bizarre in what is in the facts (Hitler into the occult, Rasputin's very long death) into a comfortably understood framework of comic-book clichés that never get too old when done right. Bottom line, can't wait for number 2!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Great entertainment delivered in a visually stylish package,"Guillermo Del Toro's ""Hellboy"" is really the sort of comic book adaptation that should be commonplace- a film that feels every bit like a comic book in its energy, style, and visual feel, but is entirely worthy on a cinematic level as well.Sadly, ""Hellboy"" doesn't really have much of a plot, at least for half of its running time. Its first hour is Hellboy fighting squids and the mandatory character introductions, and its second hour feels pretty rushed as a result, having to introduce and resolve the bulk of the film's story. Thankfully, however, ""Hellboy"" avoids the comic book-to-film cliché of basing the first film of any given franchise on the 'superhero origin story' (not that Hellboy is much of a superhero, he's really just a smartass with a gun, except he's from hell), instead keeping all that to a short and dazzling pre-credits sequence. Other than the somewhat rushed and oddly-placed plot aspects, Del Toro's screenplay is fairly impressive, providing plenty of nods towards the comics and a good amount of wit and humor, also echoing the nature of Mike Mignola's work.The most impressive aspects of ""Hellboy"" are Del Toro's direction and Guillermo Navarro's photography. Del Toro was always a superb director in terms of visuals, although I've had issues with several of his scripts. His most accomplished film to date in this regard would probably be the superb ""The Devil's Backbone"", but ""Hellboy"" shows that he has a surprising knack for directing action in a fluid manner without resorting to the cheap method of quick cutting. Also notable in terms of Del Toro's work here is how he subtly manages to pay homage to the memorable artwork of the comics, for example the overhead shots of Hellboy.The CGI effects are quite good considering the film's relatively modest budget, and thankfully they don't form the basis for much of this film. The cast are all solid if not fantastic, although Ron Perlman is probably the best actor I can think of to play Hellboy. The final shot is beautiful and perfectly in keeping with the pulp poetry of not only this film but also the comics it is based on.8/10",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Hellboy, not perfect, but entertaining.","Let's be blunt, the movie is, in essence, a little lumbering and flawed and has a rather odd climax. The beginning is overlong and vaguely too fantastical, but once you realize this is a very different world, a comic book really, and normal rules don't apply, it can be forgiven. In fact most of the flaws can be forgiven because of Ron Perlman and what he brought to the picture.This is one of few movies I've ever gone to see on the opening weekend, possibly the only one. And I did so because I was already a fan of Ron Perlman and it was great to see him in a leading role, even though he's covered in makeup. Perlman is the best thing in this movie; he is perfect as Hellboy. He swaggers through it as if he'd always been a leading man. Delivering one-liners with ease and to perfection, battling monsters through subterranean sets and city streets, and giving a great comedic performance as well as a very emotional one that makes you just love the big red oaf. A great feat considering the extensive makeup he had to act through.And the makeup and prosthetics are the best of its kind I've ever seen. There's movement and expression in the lips at times that you would think would be impossible. You might at first think that the lips are rather stationary and unexpressive, but if you just pay attention you'll see that there is a lot of movement and subtleties to it. Rick Baker should be praised for his work in this, it's amazing.Doug Jones is awesome as the body of Abe Sapien. His movements are truly beautiful. And David Hyde Pierce as the voice is perfect. Abe is a very interesting and neat character that I wouldn't mind seeing more of. And his makeup is as amazing or even more so than Hellboy's.John Hurt is great in this, as is Jeffrey Tambor. Everyone in this does a great job. But Perlman's performance as Hellboy really holds the movie together. His character stands out and speaks to the audience better than any other.If you liked X-Men or Spider-Man don't expect a movie as well polished and put together, but you should be able to enjoy it and the more overt comic book feel of the movie. And unlike the aforementioned movies there is quite a bit of light humor throughout Hellboy that should garner some laughs from most anyone.Hellboy isn't perfect, I would have changed some things, but I had fun watching it and in the end, especially for a movie of this type, I think that's what matters most. In fact I like it more now, after seeing it again, than I did when walking out of the theater.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hell of a Movie!,"Alright, so seeing as how I'm comment #430, I don't imagine that anyone is going to read my review, or that anyone will be encouraged to watch Hellboy because of anything that I'll say. There are others who have written short novels on IMDb about what a great movie this is, so there's no point in me doing more of the same.Suffice it to say that this movie is beautifully shot, well acted (with the exception of the kid who plays the FBI agent) and directed by masterful Guillermo Del Toro with style and grace. It's not for everyone, and those who are fans of the comic will probably enjoy it more than your average moviegoer. But if you like movies like The Crow or Darkman, this one is right down your dark little alley.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Entertaining comic book movie,"When you are watching a comic book movie you have to take certain things for granted. The superpowers, strange villains, things like that. They are there in a non-existing world; saying they are implausible is true but not relevant. What a comic book movie needs is a nice story that is set in its own world (although real existing places can be there too), an entertaining superhero played by an actor who is able to really create the character, spectacular visual effects that fit the action but most of all it needs to breath the right mood. 'Spider-Man 2' did a perfect job, 'X2', 'Blade II' and now 'Hellboy' come very close. The difference is that 'Hellboy' is the first from what will probably become a series.The superhero in 'Hellboy' is, of course, Hellboy (Ron Perlman). How he arrives on earth has something to do with Nazis, around 1944, which we see in the first ten minutes of the movie. Let us say he is just here, present day, on the good side, with a professor named Bruttenholm (John Hurt) as his father figure; he was there when Hellboy came from hell. The villains are the same Nazis, you learn why they are still alive, and a lot of monsters they have created. We also meet a love interest for Hellboy named Liz (Selma Blair) and his new partner, Agent Myers (Rupert Evans).So Hellboy will fight the Nazis and the monsters, but there is more. His father figure is close to death and the love interest, who sets on fire when she is excited, is not really interested. What makes this movie entertaining, besides the right mood we constantly feel, is the dry humor Ron Perlman brings to the character. Hellboy is supposed to be a secret for the outer world although rumors of his existence are there. When Agent Myers goes for a walk wit Liz Hellboy gets jealous and follows them over rooftops where he encounters a nine year old boy. The boy recognizes Hellboy and the scenes that follow the encounter are close to brilliant.There are other very fine moments. At one point a character asks why photographs of UFO's, aliens or Hellboy are always blurry, not very sharp. We see the truth in this question although ironically in a comic book world the question is very out of place; Hellboy does exist. May be this is not the best comic book movie, but entertaining it is. Compare it to another 2004 movie like 'Spider-Man 2' this one seems flawed although we can see the same amount of fun the characters have. Compare it to the dark and brutal 2004 comic book movie 'The Punisher' and this one is terrific, feels like a comic book the entire time, has an interesting hero with humor. That everything around it is pretty silly we just have to take for granted.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Great script with Ron doing a splendid job.

One of the best comic book films,"Towards the end of World War II, the Nazis engage in efforts to win the war through means of invoking the paranormal. They attempt to open a ""portal"" for seven beings who are meant to invoke the apocalypse on Earth, but a U.S. Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense is on hand to stop them before they get too far. They do not stop them as quickly as they'd like, however, and the U.S. troops soon discover that a bizarre infant, part devil, part man, red, with horns and the demonic works, with a large right hand made of indestructible stone, has gotten through. They acquire the infant, we go forward in time to the late 20th Century, and most of the film concerns an adult Hellboy still working in conjunction with the U.S. government to help battle monsters and the paranormal.Hellboy was a 10 out of 10 for me, but there are a number of criteria for any viewer to have such a high opinion of it. One, even though director Guillermo del Toro is a big fan of the Hellboy comic books and many comments have been made by him, comic creator Mike Mignola and others that the film is faithful to the books, they've also said they've changed it to suit the context of the film, so you have to not be a purist about source material to screen translations (or current screen instantiations). Two, you have to have a taste for fantasy where the creators are not very concerned with making the material coherent with or plausible in the actual world. Three, you have to enjoy your fantasy both very dark (on the horror side) and humorous/sarcastic at the same time. Four, you have to like an epic, sprawling feel to your fantasy. And Five, you have to not hate cgi creatures. I meet all of those criteria. How many you meet will likely determine how well you'll like Hellboy.What worked best for me was the material that showed Hellboy, portrayed exquisitely by Ron Perlman, as just a regular guy cum sassy detective. Even though he's half demon, a large part of the comics, at least--and this is hinted at in the film, particularly in the climax--is a continual nature versus nurture ""debate"". He was raised by humans who were as normal as they could be, being government agents in a bureau dedicated to the paranormal. So he has a large number of human-like quirks, including a love of old music, beer, cats, pancakes, chili, and so on. He's also a cigar-smoking, smart-assed detective. Hellboy is at its best when it focuses on these characteristics.But everything else works well, too. Hellboy has a monster-like counterpart, Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), and a ""freak"" love interest, Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), who are almost as fascinating as he is. The villain and neutral creatures (such as the ""half-creature"" with a speaking role towards the end) are just as captivating. There are also other characters providing enjoyable comic relief, most notably Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor). His adopted father, Professor Trevor ""Broom"" Bruttenholm (John Hurt) is intriguing. And newly recruited ""caretaker"" John Myers (Rupert Evans) shows promise, even if we do not get to spend much time with him here. Like many films of this type, I'd love to see all of these characters further explored in prequels, sequels and spinoffs. That's a good sign, because it shows that del Toro and fellow writers Mignola and Peter Briggs have successfully conveyed a world with ""deep"" characters who have extensive histories.Also worth noting is the cinematography/lighting/production and set design, which is consistently beautiful, and ranges from the popular recent trend of more monochromatic textures (blue is the color of choice here), to the strong chiaroscuro of the comic books, to striking contrasts, such as a mostly monochromatic scene which is suddenly penetrated by a supersaturated red stream of blood. The sets are all engaging, from exteriors (one hilariously claimed to be in Newark, New Jersey) to interiors, urban to expansive countryside and even outer space environments.As for effects, which are a large part of the film, I can't for the life of me imagine someone claiming that cgi looks ""fake"" compared to mechanicals, practicals, stop motion (ala Harryhausen), and so on after they see this film. For my money, these are some of the most impressive cgi creations yet, including some great cgi fight scenes.Hellboy is captivating, suspenseful and humorous. It is well worth watching for anyone with a taste for fantasy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Quite stylish but somewhat disappointing movie.,"Director Guillermo del Toro already showed with his previous movies that he has a great visual style. ""Hellboy"" is no exception and it has a great dark comic book atmosphere. Too bad that the story and most of the characters don't really work out the way they're supposed to.The character of Hellboy self works out just great! This is thanks to mainly Ron Perlman but also to the very convincing make-up effects. The rest of the characters feel like they are only put in the movie to fill up the screen. Selma Blair is very boring as Liz Sherman and it never became clear to me in the movie why professor Bloom, out of all people picked John Myers. Not really a good character either. The two characters Abe Sapien and Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor is wonderful!), who were about the two most entertaining characters, disappear way too soon out of the movie. But most disappointing are the villains which are often the most important in 'super-hero' movies like these. Having Rasputin as the main villain of course is already a ridiculous idea itself but on top of that he simply isn't a very good and convincing villain. Uber-Nazi Karl Ruprect Kroenen is a way more interesting villain. He is the kind of villain I love in movies, cool outfit, awesome weapons, he can't seem to die and he has no lines. Excellent, scary, cool and mysterious all in one. Not bad for a 107 year old. He also was way more better than the most of the time, special effects monsters.The special effects were at times good, mediocre and just at times unconvincing.The action also was somewhat disappointing. I think this is due to the wrong offbeat pace in the movie. Everything is happening way too fast. One moment Hellboy is giving away some great, fun and cool one-liners and the next he's fighting a monster in the subway. Because everything is happening so fast, the story also isn't always easy to follow. The movie wasn't as entertaining as I had hoped and expected. I'm sure that when I read the script I would like the story better than I did while watching the movie.It still is a somewhat entertaining movie to watch but not one that I would recommend to everyone. However I'm still looking forward to ""Hellboy 2"" also because 'superhero' sequels are only getting better and better these last couple of years (""Spider-Man 2"", ""X2""). Hopefully the title will be; ""Hellboy 2: The Return of Kroenen""? One could only wish for...6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good,"I've been slowly making my way through Guillermo del Toro's catalogue of movies and this is my first time watching Hell Boy. If you're a Del Toro fan, then this one won't disappoint. He's such a superior director - he adds artistry to this action film through his use of shot making, pacing and colour. At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Not as fiery as it could have been,"Ron Perlman (Beauty and the Beast) stars as Hellboy, a creature who arrives in earth after an experiment during the war went wrong, and now in modern day works for the government as a protector of the good from the bad.Based on Mike Mignola's comic books, this charming and action packed fantasy adventure delivers on a wonderful entertaining basis, though with a few flaws.With an entertaining and magical opening, Hellboy will invite you into a fantastical world filled with dark magic and extraordinary creatures.The war settings and the business surrounding the opening are highly intriguing and will grab your attention straightaway, and when the child of Hellboy arrives you will be hooked as time moves forward with a montage of the creature growing up under the government's influence.The plot revolves around Hellboy, and his relationship with society and evil, and somewhat ironic that a guy from hell is good, which gives the ideology of the film a sweet edge. There isn't much reference to heaven and hell as one or opposites, which would have created more depth and a greater understanding of Hellboy's home and instead, focuses upon the good nature of the hellish man, and it's interesting to see him portrayed as a man, with human emotions and beliefs rather than an animal, which is the view of the society in the plot, which creates emotional tension and entertainment, and a sort of controversy for current society.Filled with action packed sequences, Hellboy dives into a horror and fantasy genre with its use of different creatures and appearances, giving the film a unique and approachable appeal, which is largely helped by Del Toro's stunning and gripping direction.The Hellboy himself is interesting. Though funny, every phrase he utters feels like he knows he is a superhero, thinks himself cool, and adds way too much sophistication and daftness to his character. These phrases add up to unnecessary egotistical central protagonist, who despite being funny, can be very annoying and clichéd.The plot is consistent, delivering action and suspense on a consistent basis with a different approach to the superhero genre. The ending however feels put of place with a dramatic climax which had no proper build up. Nevertheless and entertaining surprising action film",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

They don't make 'em like they used to,"If ever there was a film that probably shouldn't work, it was one about a reformed demon, born during World War II and designed to help the Nazis take over the world, but now spends his time slaying monsters and saving the world instead. 'Hellboy' was a film made in 2004 and came just before the massive resurgence in comic book adaptations which, to this day, still dominates the Box Office with superhero movies. It's a strange kind of film that, although popular enough to generate (and equally good, in my opinion) sequel, it never got the third part to send off the character and give him the trilogy of films that us die-hard fans felt that he deserved. The reason I say it's 'strange' is because (like many, I guess) I never knew much about the film before watching it at the cinema. I didn't know it was based on a comic and merely saw the posters advertising the movie prior to its release. I knew that (the ever brilliant) Ron Perlman was in it and that was enough for me. The fact that much marketing material centred on a giant demon silhouette sporting a huge firearm was merely a bonus for an action/horror fan like myself.I watched it, really enjoyed it, and didn't think that much more of it. However, now I can see in these days of 'mega-franchises' why it didn't quite set the Box Office alight like it should. By its initial marketing, it looks like an outright horror film. However, it's actually a superhero film that borrows horror tropes, plus it was made before the superhero/MCU really took off. Nowadays, we're well used to rooting for our heroes after they've been granted some sort of special power enabling them to fight the forces of darkness, but most of them look like Chris Evans or Chris Hemsworth, rather than a giant, ugly, red, semi-horned monster. I guess what I'm saying is that 'Hellboy' was destined to have a real 'niche audience.'However, if what I've already said intrigues you, I do recommend giving it a watch. First of all, it stars Ron Perlman as the titular anti-hero. Now, he's normally good in whatever he's in, but it's fair to say that he carries this film completely on his broad (red) shoulders. The other cast members, including John Hurt and Selma Blair, are good too, but it's Ron's show (although I should probably give a nod to Jeffrey Tambor as the long-suffering head of Hellboy's secret Government unit).There's not an awful lot to say about the plot. If you've seen one superhero movie (regardless of when it was released) then you can probably predict what will happen - evil megalomaniac wants to take over the world, hero has to put the brakes on that one. However, Hellboy does it slightly differently simply because of its general 'horror' look and feel. But - don't worry - it's not all Gothic darkness - there's plenty of top-notch action scenes, cheeky one-liners from our cigar-chomping, cat-petting red hero and special effects that look more on the 'practical' side, rather than an excessive use of CGI. It's worth mentioning the effects because Hellboy's make-up is particularly simple, yet flawless in bringing the character to life. He's pretty scary at the best of times and the only things more ugly are the beasties he's sent to despatch before they destroy the world (that clockwork assassin-Nazi still gives me the creeps!).Even though I stand by my belief that 'Hellboy' stands up today as it did when it was released, I know there's a reboot in the pipeline. I'll watch that too, simply because I like the way the film is done. However, I have my doubts that anyone can fill Ron's big red boots and whatever we'll get next (instead of the much desired third part in this franchise) will be nothing more than a studio trying to cash in on the superhero craze and going for an easy cash-grab.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Stops short of being a great comic-book movie.,"As far as most comic-book movies go, they usually follow the same-old path of showing us the origins of whatever hero for about 45 minutes before getting into a real (but usually superficial) plot. This can lead to a never-ending list of deadbeats such Hulk, Spider-Man and Catwoman and rarely ends up with a good movie (Batman Begins is one rare example). Guillermo Del Toro seems to make a compromise of introducing Baby Hellboy during the end of WWII and then flashing forward 60 years to adult HB (though genetically he's barely out of his 20s) working for the Government.The Beurau of Paranormal Research uses Hellboy as a weapon against the forces of evil. Being a demon from Hell himself, but preferring to fight for the good side, HB works with Abe Sabien (a very likable sort of fish-man) and his pyro-kinetic would-be girlfriend Liz. Raised by Professor Broom (John Hurt) he regularly has fallings out with his human father and even hides his cigarette smoking from him. I find the stroppy teenager attitude a unique character quirk that works well. What's even cooler is HB fondness for cats. Which not a typical characteristic of a demon born in Hell.The world's last living super-evil Nazis resurrect the mad-monk Grigori Rasputin and aim to bring about Armageddon by awakening sleeping Lovecraftian Gods, frozen in time at the edge of the universe. A tough job, even for HB, but it's all in a days work for the Beurau of Paranormal Research.Del Toro works wonders in bringing to life atmospheric sets (check out the flooded subway station) and horrific creatures but stops short of making Hellboy a dark epic. The CGI is impressive and the visions of Hell are interesting but there's just some intangible element that seems to be missing and the film feels incomplete. Even the Director's Cut still feels a bit alienating.However the action and humor is quite entertaining and the villains (especially 107-year-old, crazed assassin Kroenen) are definitely the kind you want to see die horribly. Enjoy it for what it is, even if you feel it's not entirely wholesome by the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
An awesome thrill-ride,"I'm usually pretty skeptical about comic book to film translations thanks to such esteemed turkeys as ""Captain America"", ""Daredevil"", and ""Punisher"" (the early 90's version with Dolph Lundgren). But this movie, which could've been bad.....real bad, somehow found a way to be ammusing and entertaining, while at the same time staying faithful to the comics original characters, storylines, and influences.Now this film's not gonna win any awards and isn't going to turn non-comic fans into hardcore comic maniacs but it is a great pre-summer action/adventure film with some comedy and a bit of the eccentric tossed in for good measure.I won't go into the usual routine and start giving away plot points and story snippits. All I will say is ""Go see the movie"". But before you do you must take all logic, all sarcasm and cyncism and toss those all out of the car window on the way to your local cinemas. This movie has alot of things that may contradict alot of things that most people believe in, but remember, ITS JUST A MOVIE. Thats what movies are for, they are meant to take the impossible and make it possible and so on.

Not earth-shattering but a decent comic book film,"""Hellboy"", helmed by Guillermo del Toro and created by Mike Mignola, is a CGI-heavy comic book film based on the exploits of the title character, a hot-headed demon from another dimension enlisted by the government to keep supernatural forces at bay.Ron Perlman portrays the title character and manages to infuse him with a curmudgeonly but ultimately likable personality. There are some familiar faces among his allies including John Hurt, Selma Blair & Jeffrey Tambor. David Hyde Pierce also lends his voice to the character of Abe Sapien. All in all, the acting is pretty good for a comic book film but nothing to write home about.The story is pretty forgettable stuff built around black magic and the supernatural. Basically, its only purpose is to provide a link from one action set-piece to the next. There's an element of interpersonal drama but it isn't much more substantial than in any typical action flick. The film is solid from a technical standpoint, though, with decent effects and top-notch direction by del Toro.In my opinion, it's not among the cream of the crop in terms of comic book films but it is a well-crafted action film with modest aspirations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Don't waste your time,"If you are like me, and thought that this movie just might be worth seeing in theaters, I'm here to warn you that it's not.  I went in without hearing anything about it, knowing nothing of where hell boy came from, and hoped that I could lend an unprejudiced view.  Right from the start, the movie begins throwing characters, important concepts, and bizarre events at you. Thinking that most of these things will be explained, you wait....and wait. The truth is, no explanation ever comes.  You never really even figure out what Hell boy is or who he is.  This goes for most every character in the movie.  All of them are developed only enough to loosely connect the plot, which suffers from the same development issues.  I'm not an idiot who can't things out on my own, the others who went with me also had fifty questions, and we all had different answers when we walked out.  The acting is not good, but it is bearable, and only hurts the film in a few places, thankfully. Basically, you're going to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what's going on and who everyone is, and you'll have lots of time to ponder since this movie is mostly just a few long, drug-out action sequences anway.

"Entertaining, If Nothing Else","This is a pretty good cartoon-character movie. It's entertaining because of two main things: 1 - good dialog by the lead character, likeably portrayed by Ron Perlman and, 2 - the violence is not overdone, wearing you out and dominating the film.It looked like the latter was going to be the case early on but the film calms down and the climactic scene is not overdone as it is on always every modern-day action film.I was sorry to hear some blasphemes in here, no place for that in a comic-book hero film geared to attract a young audience. I'm not familiar with this comic book here, ""Hellboy,"" but I was surprised he looks like so many alien-type monsters of today on screen, nothing original. They could have made him look different, unless that's how he looks in print.All in all, despite what may sound like a critical review, the movie was entertaining and even had some nice touches of humor. It's another example of good, mindless entertainment for two hours. I would like to see the extended version and see if that's better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A Surprisingly Good Comic Book Flick,I was pleasantly surprised by Hellboy.  It was smart and well directed and produced.  The acting and characterizations were great.  I particularly appreciated Hellboy's rye humor.The back history of Hellboy's entrance to the Earth via a Nazi experiment gone bad was very engaging.  The use of mythic legends adds an extra dimension to this story.Of course Armageddon is is tantalizing plot point and seeing a vision of the future with Hellboy commanding the demise of the Earth was great.  The arc of the story turns on Hellboy's human upbringing and this of course plays well with the Armageddon prophecy.  This is fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.  It is worth an hour 52 minutes of your time.,6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
For comic fans only,"While HELLBOY will hold little appeal outside of the comic fan circle, nevertheless it is a reasonably entertaining movie, much like BLADE, also adapted from an existing comic character. Hellboy comes from another, infernal dimension opened by some Nazis, but is rescued and raised by Americans and grows up to be a crime fighter. Only the criminals he fights are demons and mystics. As he matures, Hellboy does his best to fit in, which is difficult considering he resembles our classic image of the Devil himself. He keeps his horns cut off -- until close to the end, when the legendary villain Rasputin tries to get Hellboy to use his arcane powers to open the gateway to that hellish dimension. You've seen the same premise and a similar device used in STARGATE, LARA CROFT and EVENT HORIZON. The CGI in HELLBOY is plentiful but after awhile it gets boring. Better are the real physical stunts and gags. Ron (""Beauty and the Beast"") Pearlman's flip attitude as the Big Red One and his apparent ease in the full-body makeup make the character come alive and the movie work.

The Hellboy Cottage Industry,"If Mike Mignola isn't careful he's going to have a whole cottage industry devoted to his comic strip creation Hellboy. Having just come from Hellboy II: The Golden Army and seeing his credits at this website makes me think about what a gold mine Mignola has found.I saw the original Hellboy and I was struck by the fact at the time I could enjoy this film as an action/adventure and the tongue in cheek humor that is prevalent throughout. A lot of that is due to the fact that Mignola was apparently given a free hand to bring his comic book creation to life on the big screen. A lot is also due to Ron Perlman and the marvelous character he creates beneath all that demon makeup.Hellboy is brought to life by the son of Rasputin the Mad Monk in the final days of World War II. Rasputin being the good royalist he is, finds work with the Nazis who are now down to using black magic to pull out a victory. Adolph Hitler was known in fact to delve into the occult.Anyway their experiments produce an infant demon plucked from the spirit world, but he's rescued by John Hurt who raises him like a son and he grows up to be butt-kicking demon Ron Perlman who's grown to like such earthly pleasures as beer and cigars.Hurt functions as the Obi Won Kenobe of this piece and when he's killed, there ain't no stopping Perlman.Hellboy is rollicking good fun, Hellboy II is even better and I'm sure we've got a Hellboy, III in our future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Entertaining and Visually Attractive,"Hellboy is an entertaining comic book movie with plenty of action and its visually stunning. Based on Mike Mignola's cult comic book character, Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is a demon brought to earth by evil scientists and then put to use fighting the supernatural in the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. Along with his fellow agents, the man-fish Abe Sapien and fire-starter Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), Hellboy takes on an evil power that threatens a mankind that will always treat them like outcasts. I have never read the comic book but after watching the film I kind of want to. Guillermo Del Toro does a great job of directing and keeps the film moving at a nice pace. Even the non action scenes of Hellboy are nice because there's a lot of humor in the story. The action scenes itself are cool and are done well. The cast is pretty good with Ron Perlman playing Hellboy and I think he was perfectly casted for the role. Also there's Selma Blair and she does a decent job but she's not that good of an actress. The problem with Hellboy is that its hard to root for the main character because he isn't very nice. Also Hellboys enemies aren't very interesting and the movies running time of two hour plus starts to wear you down. However, the film should satisfy fans of the comic book and comic book fans in general. Rating 7/10, entertaining at most parts and its worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"B+ Good script, well-paced, overall very entertaining.","Hellboy is a well-balanced and very well-paced movie that avoids tiresome action movie content (mostly).Script: Very efficient. The snappy-attitude lines are allowable because of Hellboy's partially juvenile personality.Acting: I credit Pearlman for presenting a complete character without being gabby and coy. Well-done. Almost all of the other significant characters are equally well-presented by their respective actors, save for one. del Toro certainly dropped the ball in writing/directing that character (though I won't mention who so as not to give anything away). He messed up only one character, and I forgive him. Nobody's perfect.Casting: Appropriate.Pace/balance: The movie reminded me of X2 in this respect. It moved well, didn't get stalled anywhere, and both the action and drama were moderated with smooth transitions between each.For comparison, Spiderman was good but overacted, X2 was good but with a few eye-rolling moments.Overall, I found this movie provided high entertainment value.

"Not even close to a masterpiece, but still...","As a fan of the Hellboy comic series it's hard not to compare movie with the original comic although that doesn't do any justice to the movie itself: they are separate things and thus they should be taken too. But nevertheless I find the movie version of Hellboy a little hollow: lot of fun action, a little philosophical banter about nature of humanity and not-so-well-done relationship drama.Ron Perlman IS Hellboy. When I first read Hellboy ages ago, it was Perlman and no other actor I only could imagine as the lead for Hellboy movie. Thank God he did too. Perlman shines in this one and brims of blunt and stoic charisma. His performance of Hellboy is great mixture of humor and seriousness, just like comic version. John Hurt (professor Broom) performed also well, as usually. Others were more or less OK.Effects were nice, general atmosphere and sense of adventure was great and Perlman alone was well worth to see this. But what of the downsides? In truth, I disliked the romantic parts of the movie. Too shabby, too hollow. Obviously Hellboy is a man with hormones too, but in the movie his craving for tail (pun definitely intended) was way too dominating element and took a lot more screen time than necessary. In a way more than I could tolerate. Believe it or not, you CAN actually do good relationship drama withOUT any romance. Could someone *please* tell Del Toro this? Friendship, for instance, is what I would have liked the Hellboy movie to express rather than any faked romance. In the comic version almost entire B.P.R.D. was one big family, which made Liz, Abe, Hellboy and the other ""freaks"" of the Bureau more of siblings and true friends, rather than random romantic encounters. This family behavior gave a lot deeper meaning for their interactions in the comics. None of this was seen on the movie. Hellboy treated Abe as a neutral colleague although Abe claimed they were friends (quess Hellboy just didn't show it on-screen then, hmm?). And Liz was portrayed only as the love interest of the main character, not really a plausible person of her own or a qualified member of the Bureau.But hey, some might have actually liked those romantic scenes. Good for them. For me the very romantic element itself was just a distraction and a lousy way to add forced romance in a movie that didn't even necessarily require that. It felt so fake. But enough of that. Now to the plot. If you have read the comics, you know the deal and can fill the holes the movie leaves. But without reading them? You might have a little harder time to understand everything than happens. It's OK though, as the plot is not that important, intelligent or even interesting anyway. Things just happen and you can focus on the way too cool Hellboy.As a rental entertainment this has great value though: Cool main character, great action, funny but a little illogical plot. I've seen a lot worse comic hero movies.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
AMAZING!,"I must say I would have never expected in my wildest dreams to enjoy a film like this so much, much less this one.  Hellboy has it's faults but it's truly comic book/horror/fantasy hybrid masterpiece. It is the probably the best comic book movie I've ever seen. Based on a little known comic book I'm sure people will be running to buy now. Hellboy is the story of a group of bad guys whom are trying to destroy the world and end up bringing forth a small child like hellboy. After years of being raised by his founder he becomes a superhero monster fighting bad guys like himself and bringing them to justice while defending humanity. He's helped along in his quest by pyro girl Liz Sherman played beautifully by Selma Blair. And a very cool intellectual fish Looking guy referred to as Blue. But those people are back to destroy the world again as they have ressurected their master and it's up to Hellboy and his gang of misfits to protect humanity and foil their plan. I'm sure it sounds surely predicatble but that something this film lacks in troves. It's completely original, completely new and just great. The performances by Ron Pearlman, John Hurt and Selma Blair are completely involving. The story is well developed, emotional, scary and funny. The direction is taut and well developed. Definatly Del Toro's reigning masterpiece. I must say I was overly impressed by this film probably because I wasn't expecting too much but I can guarantee you one thing I will be going to see it again.

Entertaining at times - but nothing to write home about,"(warning: potential spoilers - warning: potential spoilers)story: there isn't really a story, I mean it can be summarised in 4 words: ""the bad guys return"". Countless films are based on this, and on how quickly the bad guys revive / return, and on how quickly the good guys get up to speed to save the world.acting: acting does not really count here, leading parts are fantastic / crazy heroes, who by definition over-act 90 percent of the time. Sure the actors deliver - but this is not a place where great actors will make a difference (and this may not be a film whose target audience will care).filming: the non special effects scenes are OK. The special effects scenes are numerous and often very well done.pace: pretty good pace, though all in all it is quite predictable.some ideas directly lifted from elsewhere: - the final scene where the hero gets rid of the huge monster by burning it from insides, rings a bell? Yep, lifted directly from MIB! - when she gets angry, the girls can unleash very powerful flames, and even shock waves and explosions. That's right - lifted from X-Menwhat about having a hero who is really from Hell, what about expanding on the theme of his developing a ""good guy"" personality just because of a better environment? Not enough time for that - basically the guy is just good for some reason, and he never wonders why, or wonders about Hell, all we know is that he prevents his horns from growing, and he is pretty much indestructible (at least bombs powerful enough to destroy a monster with the mass of several whales, leave him unharmed).Bottom-line: average fantasy / sci-fi film, good special effects, funny at times. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Hellboy A Decent Comic Book Movie,"Hellboy is a decent comic book movie from director Guillermo del Toro who shows some real talent and skill with this film. It may not be a masterpiece or a classic but Hellboy is much better than some of the other comic books that have been made into movies lately. The cast are solid in their roles including Ron Perlman whose nearly unrecognizable as the title character, Selma Blair, Karel Roden, Rupert Evans, Jeffrey Tambor, and John Hurt. The rest of the supporting cast are good in their small parts they have in the movie. The action/fight sequences are well executed and the special effects are impressive but nothing very memorable. The various creatures in it look cool but most of them only get brief cameo appearances and none of them really stand out. However with it's flaws aside Hellboy is still worth watching because of the story, the action, humor, and the exceptional performances by the cast especially Perlman who shows his talent in this movie.

Blockbuster fun!,"This movie sounds stupid on the outside, but its actually pretty good. The reason i say this movie sounds stupid is because read the plot. The son of the devil is raised to fight dark and mythical monsters that are hell bent on taking over the world. First the pros. So the makeup and special effects they have on these characters are astounding. Hellboy's even looks cool. The plot is actually kinda simple, but its simple entertainment. Simple entertainment doesn't neccesairly make a good movie, but it makes a pretty entertaining one. By the way if you love action in movies, then you are gonna like this film because it is totally action packed.But now the cons. So some of the characters aren't really engaging.

Superhero film Done Right,"This is probably one of the most creative superhero franchises to hit the silver screen, and I will always lament the fact that we'll never get the third entry in Del Toro's trilogy. While I do really enjoy this film, there are a few minor issues with it. First, it is a little on the long side. Notably, I did watch the directors cut of the film, which is ten minutes longer. And, if I'm being honest, it's been so long since I've watched the theatrical cut I couldn't tell you if the pacing was a bit better in that version. For the most part, I feel like the film moved along at a very solid pace, but it's the first act that really suffers the most. After the first scene, where Hellboy is pulled into our world, we spend probably twenty minutes establishing Hellboy's world, and some of the scenes during that time are certainly slower than others. The third act also starts to go off the deep end. As I mentioned, for about 75% of this film, this movie feels like a police procedural- it's pretty grounded as far as stakes go. But then, as we ramp up to the climax, the stakes ramp up stupendously, to the point where everyone in the world is at risk. I know a lot of people like their superheroes to save the whole world in a big CGI explosion-fest, but honestly, I wish this film had kept its climax a little bit smaller, more grounded, at the end. The CGI near the end is easily the least polished looking part, and while the ending is pseudo-satisfying it doesn't, in my opinion, have nearly as much heart as the rest of the film. This is, however, a small bone to pick with an otherwise very good film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hits All the Sweet Spots,"This movie hits all the sweet spots for me. It has action, Lovecraft-esque horror/supernatural elements, emotional intensity, interesting heroes...and cats. Lots of cats.And that mainly has to do with Hellboy himself. He is such a compelling character. He's an otherworldly beast who was raised by humans to be a good person. He fights monsters because his monstrosity enables him to know them well. He feels the pressure to look and act like a human as best he can so he won't be lumped in with other monsters. He kicks ass and acts macho, smoking cigarettes in a cool demeanor...yet, his many adopted cats shows that he has a soft side. And this vulnerable side is seen even further when we see how deeply he feels for the woman he loves.

"A Truly Different Superhero Movie,","Hellboy is a good movie with a well developed plot and a talented cast. It certainly stands out as being a much different superhero movie that what we are used to, it does not follow the same predictable elements, and Ron Perlman's stunning performance showcases a truly unique character. I felt the movie focused far too much on Rupert Evans, who really was the main character, the one who the audience follows and see how he reacts to the situation. His typical, cliché role gets very tiresome when there are so many interesting, bizarre characters, such as Hellboy himself, who we would have preferred follow. I also found Hellboy and Liz's relationship to be poorly developed, they talk about the great memories they have, but we do not get to see a whole of them together first hand, as a result of this I did not particularly care about them ending up with each other or separated. While it has its imperfections, Hellboy mostly makes up for it with a unique story and a dedicated performance from Ron Perlman, worth the watch if you are looking for a good action or fantasy film.A demon is raised by a secret US agency to battle forces of darkness.Best Performance: Ron Perlman Worst Performance: Rupert Evans",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

I judged them as remakes as I did know the stories and was familiar with all those comics. Anyway, hellboy was an entertaining movie with good action sequences and a lot of comedy. All the Hellboy fans around me seemed to love the movie so it was probably better to them than to me. I give the movie a 7 out of 10 because it was too simple to me.

Highly entertaining,"Guillermo del Toro proved his feeling for comic-book styled action with Blade 2. So it's maybe no surprise that this movie is also full of just that: feeling.Hellboy is the story of a demon who came to earth as a child. He was part of Rasputins evil plan to destroy humanity, but the demon child was rescued and raised to good instead. Now he, and a bunch of other special heroes, fight the occult evils in modern day society. Rasputin is back though, and he has other plans for Hellboy...There are a couple of factors that make this one of the most successful comic-book adventures i've seen so far in terms of style. First of all the casting is perfect throughout. Ron Perlman is very entertaining as Hellboy, and the other parts of the cast are equally up to their tasks. The special effects are also excellent, among the better i've seen actually. The action sequences are also well done without being too excessive. But mostly it's the feeling for what does and does not work that strikes me with this movie. Guillermo Del Toro seems to really like the genre and know exactly what he wanted out of this film.Of course there are also flaws as always. For instance the movie becomes a little silly sometimes, and a bit more action wouldn't have hurt i think. Mostly though i feel the ending, without saying too much, is sort of an anticlimax. But all in all this is very entertaining in a way that comic-book action should be. I rate it 7/10.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Still an instant classic two decades later,"In anticipation of the new Hellboy movie, I decided to binge watch and review all of the Hellboy Movies, so let's begin with the first Hellboy movie from 2004. This movie was my introduction to Writer-Director Guillermo del Toro as well as a gateway door to the horror genre and two decades later, this movie is still phenomenal.Positives for Hellboy (2004):
The first thing that I appreciate about this movie is Guillermo del Toro's direction. This man gives this movie a very fantasy feeling to it while having some horror elements when it comes to the creatures. Speaking of the creatures, the practical effects for all of them are phenomenal and there's even some usage of digital that actually still hold up two decades later. I also enjoyed the cast of characters in this movie. First off, you have Ron Perlman as Hellboy and he is perfect as this character, in fact this movie was my introduction to Ron Perlman in live-action form, prior to this movie I only knew him as the voice of Slade from Teen Titans. I also liked Selma Blair as Liz Sherman, Rupert Evans as John Myers, Doug Jones as Abe Sapien and John Hurt as Trevor ""Broom"" Bruttenholm. The movie's visuals look beautiful throughout the runtime. The action sequences in this movie are spectacular. I loved the movie's score by Marco Beltrami. And finally, this movie did a very good job at being a gateway door to the horror genre.Overall, Hellboy (2004) is a spectacular superhero and comic book movie that still holds up after two decades and I forward to rewatching this movie many more times in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
I should have seen it on the big screen.,"I really regret not seeing Hellboy in the theater. The comic book it is based on is printed by Dark Horse Comics, a relatively small independent publisher that most people have never heard of. I flipped through the source material and was not impressed, I mean really, a demon that wants to be human, a fish guy and an out of control psychokinetic fight the things that go bump in the night, sounds really lame to me. I couldn't have been more wrong.Hellboy is both engrossing and visually spectacular. The plot is a little more complicated to explain properly than is convenient here so I'll merely say that powerful Nazi occultists have set a plan in motion to unleash forces that will destroy the Earth and it is up to the bizarre collection of unlikely heroes at the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense to stop them. Nazis are great villains, nobody ever doubts their sheer capacity for evil, add the fact that they are chaos worshiping occultists and you have some truly diabolical foes.Ron Pearlman is fantastic as Hellboy, who is, much like Vincent from Beauty and the Beast, a misunderstood monster that wishes, more than anything, to fit in and be normal. To facilitate this he grinds down his horns in order to look more human. Of course a seven foot tall, 500 pound, red skinned, stone fisted demon with a tail won't appear human under any circumstances but this small bit of silliness underscores a tender side to the often gruff and rebellious Hellboy. It's small details like these that make the movie so enjoyable to watch, like little Easter eggs, each revealing a little secret about the strange creatures before us. I was very pleasantly surprised by Hellboy, and you will be too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
cheesy jokes!,"The little jokes they have here and there are very uncomfortable,, not because of its content but because it just.. doesn't go with the movie.... do you agree? "" He shaves his horn to fit in""??? ""You don't light a cigar that way.. you use a match to reserve its flavor""? Well the last one wasn't really a joke, but it was still very very cheesy...Also, Hellboy and his ""father""'s relationship is very vague. So is his relationship with Selma Blair. Furthermore, what exactly is the role of John Myers in this movie? I mean, the professor in the beginning mentioned that there is a reason he picked John, but there is no hint whatsoever in the whole movie the significance of John Myers. Overall, the movie does not give you too many of the VERY VERY IMPORTANT DETAILS. It confused me a lot,, giving me no choice but to say it is below-average movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The best demonic superhero film ever made,"Hellboy is a lot of things: a superhero film, an H.P. Lovecraft story, a fish-out-of-water comedy, an action/adventure yarn, a monster movie, and proof that Ron Perlman is singularly the most underrated actor working today.Hellboy is based on the comic book series of the same name by Mike Mignola. In it, he created a unique world of supernatural influences on our own based in part by Lovecraftian creatures and international folk tales.  These supernatural events are investigated by the B.P.R.D...the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense.  Many odd characters along with straight-laced soldiers occupy this group, but the most interesting is Hellboy himself.  Fans of the comic know that even though there is a lush background of amazing stories and multidimensional characters, that the best thing about the comic is Hellboy fighting giant monsters.  And fight giant monsters is what Hellboy does well.The film Hellboy is an incredible labor of Love by Guillermo del Toro (Blade II, The Devil's Backbone).  Del Toro was a fan of the series and pushed to have the film made.  He's not a director-for-hire here.  He is the driving force in this film's coming to life.  He was a fan first and that, as all comic book/movie geeks know is of ultimate importance.The plot here revolves around Rasputin, the Russian monk who people with knowledge of history know was the crazy guy who the Russian government had a heck of a time killing.  Well, it turns out that they never did accomplish their task.  He's still alive in 1944 and working for the Nazis' occult division in a last ditch effort to keep the Nazi regime from falling at the hands of the Allies.  With the help of some American soldiers, their scheme to open a portal to another dimension fails but something slips though: Hellboy.  They raise him as their own and eventually Hellboy becomes part of the B.P.R.D.  And then we get to watch them address the supernatural in classic Hellboy nonchalance.Let me say that Ron Perlman as Hellboy is just amazing.  Perlman, who stole many a woman's heart under the thick make-up as the Beast in the ""Beauty and the Beast"" television show in the 80s shows us that he still has the ability to exude charm from behind layers of latex.  Perlman puts more into this role than a superhero film has any right to have.  Perlman himself has a wide history of very different characters on his resume; his primitive caveman in Quest for Fire to his evil yet charming Hitleresque character in Last Supper to his Russian strongman character in The City of Lost Children. Perlman is an actor's actor.  When you watch Hellboy, you see Hellboy.Hellboy will keep fans of the comic happy.  But it is very geared to the uninitiated.  This is a movie that everyone can enjoy.  And with it's PG-13 rating, it's reasonably family-friendly.  The violence in this film is more smart than offensive.  This isn't Blade II.  This is Hellboy, a story about a creature who is working against his origin to do good.  It's not where you come from, it's where you're going that counts.  Also, giant monsters were made to be beat up.I saw this movie March 14th at a special screening in Austin.  Mike Mignola and Ron Perlman were seeing it for the first time there.  Mignola, the creator of Hellboy, was very pleased with how the movie ended up.  What better compliment is there than that?  See this film!  I guarantee that you will leave the theatre wanting more.  If enough people see this on opening weekend April 2nd then of course a sequel will get made.  And I assure you, that's exactly what you want.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Don't expect too much, and you should enjoy it","Firstly, I just have to comment on Ron Pearlman's performance as Hellboy, he breaths life into the character and makes him great fun to watch.The basic story is kind of 'X-men meets Men in Black'.Hellboy and sadly only a couple other mutant type characters are used to defend Earth from dark forces, intent of taking over the world. With very strong visuals, some fine characters and an action packed storyline, this movie is entertaining, amusing and great fun.Kids will undoubtedly love it (I know my son does) although some scenes are not for young kids, and most people should think it is at least good entertainment, but don't expect too much as you may be disappointed.Good fun for most 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Entertaining comic book fare,"Following on from the recent trend of turning comic books into movies is this offering - Hellboy. I've never read, or even heard of, the 'Hellboy' comic before seeing this movie but it doesn't matter as the film pretty much explains itself anyway. Hellboy tells the story of a demon that was brought into this world by way of a very silly sequence involving a portal to hell, Rasputin (yes, Rasputin) and some Nazi's (naturally). Instead of exterminating this demon, the American army decides to not only keep it, but raise it as a crime fighting superhero, whom they go on to use in the paranormal side of the FBI, which battles various monsters and stuff. Obviously. As you can probably tell, this isn't a film that takes itself seriously and should, therefore, just be taken for what it is - an enjoyable comic book movie. And when taken like that, it has to be said that Hellboy succeeds.Guillermo Del Toro is an obviously talented director. Cronos and The Devil's Backbone prove that without any further need for proof, but it's also worth noting both Blade 2 and Mimic, which weren't as great as the two films just mentioned, but were obviously helmed by a talented auteur. Hellboy fits in with the latter two films, unfortunately, and although Del Toro has no doubt made a good job of this movie, you can't help but think that his talents would be better served making more movies like Cronos and The Devil's Backbone. The CGI effects in the film are mostly rather good, and go some way to proving that CGI can work if done correctly. The film falls down when it comes to making the character of Hellboy into a well-rounded 'human being'. The word 'cliché' springs to mind immediately, and does so again when it comes to the dialogue that Hellboy has been given. Still, Ron Perlman makes an excellent job of the role, and although I've never read any of the comics; his performance shows what I would expect the character of 'Hellboy' to be. The film is not great, but it's a fun ride; so the thumbs are more up than down.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"before u see the reboot, see the original!!!","Nearly 15 years ago, Ron Perlman made his comic book debut in a movie called Hellboy which became a surprise hit at the box office. Based on a classic graphic novel and directed by the guy who would go on to win an oscar for ""The Shape of Water"", ""Hellboy"" is an amazing work of art that has to be seen to believe. A better sequel soon followed to greater success although it was released during a peak year of superhero cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
It's exactly what you think...,"This film hopes that its high production quality and charming wit will compensate for the fact that it lacks continuity and quite often defies the very rules it invents for the Hellboy world. One example can be found after Hellboy has been pushed off of the front of a train, only to keep knocking his shaved-down horns on the bottom of the cars that are passing over him. This resulted in a great deal of friction, heating his horns, and leading the leading man to say ""Ouch!"" after touching these horns, indicating to his viewers that they were hot. However, not 60 seconds later, Hellboy reveals one of his powers, by grabbing a rail and allowing the electricity to surge through his body and fry his opponent. How could his horns be too hot to touch, but yet he could sustain who-knows-how-many volts of electricity? Then, there was the Liz Sherman character, played by Selma Blair, whose fiery temper could set an entire asylum ablaze all the while leaving her clothing completely unscorched. Oh, how we long for the days when a man's rage might turn him big and green, but would also magically grow an appropriately placed pair of purple pants! Also, Rasputin looked like a pimp, for some reason. Ron Perlman, however, offers an even and sardonic delivery of an extra-worldly character, whose human upbringing shares the quintessential values of hope, love, and freewill. Although the writing at times desired something more, at many times, especially in scenes with Jeffrey Tambor, the film would surprise you with its happy-go attitude. And it should not be overlooked, the special effects were fun and engaging. Hellboy's a watch-it-once, maybe watch-it-once-more kind of movie that has you happy that you didn't take it too seriously and thankful that we still have Sam Raimi to show us how a comic book movie is really done.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Just A Great Ride From Start To Finish,"The Joe Cool Review: Hellboy(2004)Starring: Ron Perlman as Hellboy, John Hurt as Professor Broom, Selma Blair as Liz Sherman, Rupert Evans as John Myers & Doug Jones as Ape Sapien(voiced by David Hyde Pierce)Plot: Towards the tail end of WW2, the Nazis decided to resort to the occult to try and open up a portal which will bring about the end of the world. The allies managed to stop them but a baby demon made it through the portal. It is raised by Professor Broom and becomes known as Hellboy. 60 years later they're back and it's up to Hellboy to kick ass and stop them.Openers: What a great ride this movie is from start to finish. Hellboy has just about everything you want a movie to have, and yet it's not a typical movie in any sense of the term. It has action, comedy, horror elements and even some romance.The Good: Hellboy is sort of a melting pot of many different genres and that's what makes this movie work so well. It doesn't conform to one type of movie and therefore blows the viewer away from start to finish. Another reason this movie works is Ron Perlman. Make no mistake about it, Guillermo del Toro was 100% right in choosing Perlman and only considering him for the role. I couldn't get enough of him playing Big Red and when the movie was over I still wanted more. And the movie clocked in close to 2 hrs and ten minutes! Some of the supporting cast I feel did their jobs well too. Selma Blair and John Hurt were just sort of there but they didn't detract from the film. Doug Jones can act like a fish freak and could emote without talking. And since he didn't provide Abe Sapien's voice, that's kind of what he had to do. David Hyde Pierce was a good choice to provide the voice of Abe and one of those things that just seem perfect after the fact as far as casting goes. Everything else works too. The action is great(Love the subway fight scene) and the comedy and romance work too, with a few jump scares and emotional scenes thrown in. Honorable mention goes to Jeffery Tambor who manages to be pretty funny in a role that I originally hated but grew to love.The Bad: My main problem with this movie is the character of John Myers. I feel like he was forced onto the audience and really doesn't do much. He was just about as expendable as the other agents looking after HB in my view. Nevermind the fact he acts like a pansy throughout the whole thing. I get the fact he was placed into the movie to be an outside person learning about this new strange world of Hellboy but I still didn't care for his character like I did everyone else.The Ugly: The final battle, although short, relies heavily on CGI and looks kind of fake looking. However it doesn't really take away from the movie and is not that noticeable unless you're trying to find flaws.Final Verdict: I was pretty sure I'd like Hellboy but I didn't think it'd be as good as it turned out being. Now it's one of my favorite movies and I eagerly await the sequel to see HB kick ass once more.Rating: ****1/2 or *****",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A Bit of Fluff,"I don't have much to say about this movie. It was rather straightforward and had excellent CGI effects and fight sequences, and I liked the many Lovecraftian bits, but as far as story, plot development, acting, etc., it was a completely unremarkable movie. There wasn't much substance at all to it. I wonder why it was released outside of the summer blockbuster season. All things considered, Hellboy is very much in the same vein as the next X-men sequel or Star Wars installment. It's just eye candy. I enjoyed it on that level, but there was nothing about it -- good or bad -- that makes this film stand out in my mind. I think the description of it as ""a bit of fluff"" would be the most apt.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"A True Genre-Bending, One to Remember Del Toro Flick","When I first saw the trailers for this flick I knew I had to see it!! Guillermo Del Toro did a fantastic job of bringing Mike Mignola's comic to life. For years I had always wondered how a Hellboy film would look, seeing as the comic was different than traditional superhero comic books. Thankfully, the director doesn't let us down. But who could play such a role? Ron Perlman answers the call and it's because of him that many people like me have come to love this film. He plays Hellboy jut right, delivering the right comic touches. But that's not to say the rest of the cast isn't up to par.Selma Blair, Rupert Evans, all are superb. I love the conflict between Hellboy and Jeffery Tambor's character and add tension but also comedy. Kronen is my favorite villain in the movie but the real highlights are definitely the fights with Sammeal, the one in the subway being the best action scene in the whole film. To add to this there are some great sets and one can easily tell this a Mike Mignola adaption. One has got to love the BPRD (Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense) sets, especially the library one. Marco Beltrami completes the movie with a bad-ass score and I certainly hope he returns to do the sequel's music. Overall this film will appeal more to specific audiences then to main stream ones, but I think everyone will find something to enjoy in it. A true genre-bending, one to remember, Del Toro flick.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"Good, demi-demonic fun","During a secret Nazi paranormal experiment in Scotland, a red and horned child from the nether-regions crosses into our reality. He grows up to be 'Hellboy', an agent of 'The Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense' and becomes our hope when a reborn Rasputin unleashes a fecund demon as part of a plan to bring about an 'end-of-days' apocalypse. Typical of a Guillermo del Toro film, the imagery is striking, especially the brief scenes of a post-apocalyptic Earth. The characters, drawn from the 'Hellboy' series of graphic novels (created by Mike Mignola, which I have not read) are imaginative and engaging and the production team do an excellent job in bringing them to the screen. I particularly liked Kroenen (Ladislav Beran), the self-mutilating, 'clockwork' Nazi assassin, the character design and make-up is outstanding. Ron Perlman, also under a lot of makeup, is quite good playing the wisecracking titular demi-demon, as are Doug Jones (equally made-up) as Abe Sapien, the PBRD's amphibious scholar-agent, and the ever-moribund John Hurt as Prof. Bruttenholm, Hellboy's adoptive father. All in all, a great 'superhero' film: clever, fast-moving, fun, and much more imaginative than most of the films in the better known DC or MCU franchises.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Anung un Rama,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is Hellboy (2004), based on the Dark Horse comic books created by Mike Mignola, the film is helmed by one of the Mexico's Three Amigos of Cinema, this film is a vibrant nonstop energy flick. You leave the world of norm and introduced to a world of bizarre and beauty. The flick has special effects, amazing makeup and costumes and awesome set pieces which really differentiates itself from other superhero or comic book movie adaptations. The story and really the filmmaker is trying to have the freedom of expression by ricocheting shades of darkness and light and sometimes is a homage to a well-known fantasy author - H. P. Lovecraft. The title character played by the excellent and witty Ron Perlman is magnetic, who plays the character with grit, humour and shades of a Western character who is trying to not take things seriously. Perlman shines his performance even with the smallest nuances such as chomping his cigar, twitches his tail, his facial expressions concerning his love interest and his constant battles with his demons - it's all joyful. Two thumbs up to an actor of making an impossible character really work especially with the makeup he must have gone through. Now the plot is where things get tricky.The movie's central story concentrates on Hellboy's relationships with those important to him and the film tries to balance out a supposedly love triangle where the spawn of Satan happens to be in the centre, to three interesting diabolic figures who really didn't get the screen time they each deserved, to a father and son dynamic and of course saving the planet. This is where the film fails. I didn't mind having a World War II background at the start of the flick but the story did loose itself by juggling a few subplots which unfortunately didn't provide opportunities to look into secondary characters. The action scenes are great especially Hellboy fighting Samael in the underground railway station even if there was a cliched superhero moment with saving a kitten.The relationship between Hellboy and his adopted father played by the legend John Hurt can be correlated with the Frankenstein and his master-creator, which I find very smartly played out. Still I would've liked to see more of the psychic practitioner Grigori Rasputin background along with his aides including Nazi soldier Ilsa I have no idea what he is other than his name Kroenen who did a lot of surgical repairments on his own body. It also would have been great to have more character progression with the aquatic sapien creature named Abe Sapien played by Doug Jones however voiced by David Hyde Pierce (Nile's fans). There is a terrific scene when Hellboy kisses his love interest, the paranormal Liz Sherman played by Selma Blair who performs a grounded pyrokineticist so pretty much a human torch who feels guilty when starts fires as she is having trouble controlling her abilities. Also, Jeffrey Tambor who plays as Tom Manning, the director of the crew has a good moment with Perlman where he reminds Hellboy in order to enjoy a cigar, Tambor explains that cigars must always be ignited with a wooden match.Again, going back to Perlman's performance, he is the best thing in this flick where he swaggers through the whole film, delivering retro one-liners with ease while battling demonic creatures through subterranean sets and city streets. Witty, funny, great set pieces, CGI and visuals that yells out Lovecraft - overall 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Batman? MIB? Raiders of the Lost Ark? Ghost Busters? How about a blend?,"After a friend kept mentioning this movie for quite some time, my spouse and I finally viewed Hellboy and found it surprisingly entertaining.Mind you, we were not expecting a great drama, but were worried that it might be too gory, too foul, too much a horror/shock-fest flick, etc.But picture a cross between Batman (comic-book-styled ""hero""/sidekick duo and sometimes-funny/sometimes-brooding/reflective dialog), Raiders of the Lost Ark (Nazi pursuit of powerful religious objects), Ghost Busters and Men in Black (Z-z-zap-'em back to where they came from!), and you'll have a fair idea of the tone of this movie.So yes, due to the level of monster-shoot-em-up within (little blood but lots of slime), I'd adhere to the PG-13 rating and not let younger kids watch, but Hellboy turned out to be much more fun and cleaner (with a few ""good lessons learned"" thrown in) than we expected, possibly a good choice for a teen party!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Obvious potential wasted,"Hellboy revolves around classic comic book/action/superhero genre story lines. Essentially Hellboy is a kind of demon who has found his way on earth. He is brought up from a child by a priest and within a government society and has chosen to protect the people of earth from the supernatural, rather then be a menace (the normal career route for a demon).The set up of the story involves creative uses of history, combining Nazi experiments with the occult. It's preposterous, but so is the whole idea of a demon roaming the streets. I find the explanations of the characters, who they are and how they came to be very well handled. The sequences are to the point and very entertaining. In fact the opening is the best part of the film, therein lays the problem.Essentially Del Toro who both writes and directs this piece bottles it. The film is absent of all tension or any major conflict. Hellboy is essentially established as invincible within the first act and so the rest of the film comprises of scenes in which any conflict is automatically rather crass because we know inevitably Hellboy will be OK and the bad guy will die. I hear you cry that this is the case for any action/hero film. Well yes it is, but once we are drawn into a well made action film we can't help but feel the hero may die. Die Hard works because John Mclane looks likely to die at all parts. He escapes death by the slimmest of margins. The stakes are raised as his wife is also in danger etc etc Terminator and Terminator two work because in both cases the villain is far superior than the hero. The threat and tension is constant.Some of the other major weaknesses are: Del Toro is also guilty of employing deus ex machina. Characters generally disappear and reappear as their skills are needed within the story. The villain is featured in maybe three scenes. He has no motives. Turns up unexpectedly and inexplicably. In the one scene Hellboy looks to be up against a real threat (groups of monsters) a character unleashes her abilities - the screen fades to white and inexplicably the monsters are dead but everybody else lives. A minor character established in an irritating and undeveloped love story becomes the key to the conclusion of the film. Her character is so thin, the relationship so undeveloped. It is clear she is nothing more than a prop of sorts to push the plot along and to make it all make sense. I don't want to ruin the ending of the film but essentially a character that is dead is miraculously and unbelievably brought back to life.The film suffers from poor dialogue and one liners that just aren't smart or funny. After a while it all starts to grate.What's more Del Toro blows the action scenes with some uninspired visuals. And whoever made the creative decision to make hellboy's primary weapon a gun instead of his clunking arm should be fired. Essentially the use of the gun weakens the concept of the film, degrading the fights to nothing more than a one sided shoot outThe few positives include: The cinematography is very good. At all times a sense of mood is established by the dark lighting and the darker colour palette. As well as the use of interesting locations. Yet perhaps it is all a bit samey as well.The use of cgi and Fx is well done. Never do we get an over load. When effects are used they are used well and the sense of realism is kept. Rather similar to how Nolan used FX in batman. I much prefer this method to the overtop effects we often see.All in all this is a pretty poor film. The real shame is that (despite not reading the comics) I found the film wasted a lot of potential. Hellboy as a character has a lot of instantly apparent fascinating dimensions which are completely unexplored. The film has watch-ability, in the sense that if it comes on TV and nothing else is on it might be worth a viewing. But in any other situation I wouldn't bother with it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Had potential to be a really dark adult film and, despite being a bit entertaining, fails to deliver in most ways","During WWII, Hitler turned to the dark arts to try and turn the tide, leading the Allies to create a paranormal unit to combat his attempts. An attempt by Rasputin to open a portal to another world is foiled by Bruttenholm and US solider  but not before a strange devil creature has come through into our world. Decades later, Hellboy (as he was named) has aged slowly into his early twenties and, under the guidance of Bruttenholm, has become a secret force for the government in their fight against demons. A new agent starts as Hellboy's handler and is immediately thrown into the deep end with the arrival of a beast in a museum. However this is only the start of a bigger plot by Rasputin and his immortal Nazi allies in their attempts to destroy the world.As most people seem to be at the moment, I quite like comic book films  I like the potential for action but also the complex characters that the better adaptations will bring out. For this reason I was keen to see Hellboy even though the trailer was filled with CGI and bad kiss-off lines  I should have trusted the trailer. The film starts well with the background for us uninitiated and then skips to the modern day. Using the standard 'new partner' idea as an 'in', the film then pretty much walks the usual tracks of romance, action, monsters and so on. The script never really allows the adult side to come through very well  there is nothing complex here and the dark side that I had hoped for seems to only exist in the sets and costumes.Without this I was left with just another summer comic book film and, sadly, not one of the better ones at that. The action looks OK but strangely failed to engage me  partly down to the overuse of CGI but also due to the director not injecting enough pace and urgency into them. The effects look OK but it is telling that the CGI beasts are not as impacting as Kroenen who is a much better bad guy  I think he should have been a bigger part and that that CGI been used more sparingly. Likewise, the characters are not as well developed or as interesting as I'd have liked. Hellboy himself is a fairly ordinary action hero  aside from the red skin etc, he has a cigar, is muscle bound and makes wisecracks; hardly breaking the mould is it? Liz and Myers are not used well at all, with their supposed romance not working; meanwhile other characters are just bodies rather than anything else.It is a shame because it was in the characters that I expected something more grown up to be delivered rather than just more effects and I did feel let down by the lack of this. It is still noisy and big enough to survive in the blockbuster world but I was surprised to see it already have a sequel planned. The cast will be happy with this, even if I was not entirely happy with them. Perlman is a good choice for HB and he does well in a rare leading role  it is not his fault that he has little to work with for the most part. Evans and Blair are fairly bland and uninteresting  partly the scripts fault but also a bit theirs too. Hurt's father figure is interesting, and Pierce delivers what is essentially an underwater Niles. Strangely he was not listed on the credits  unsure why he wasn't. The support cast is less interesting  the bad guys are no more than bad guys and only Beran is good value in his minor role. Tambor is not that well used but his presence is a good influence.Overall, maybe worth seeing once but, for all its potential it doesn't really stand up against the couple of much better comic book adaptations that are around (Spiderman 2 for example). The action is noisy but uninvolving and unexciting while the adult themes and characters just fail to materialise. Unless it sorts out these pretty major problems in part 2 I would seriously doubt it will have another chance after that.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Better than expected,"Well, having never heard of the Hellboy comics before seeing the previews for this movie, I thought -- ""Hey, it might be fun to go and see."" Luckily, a friend asked me to go with him to see it. I'm glad I did.The performance from Ron Perlman is really very fine. Rupert Evans gives a fine turn as the young [handsome!] friend and new special agent. The story has good feet and is well-presented for the non-initiated. I felt the ending was a little weak, but then again my immediate reaction was ""hmmmm...set up the sequel in case this makes money!!"" The economics of Hollywood and a built in audience rule.Visually the film is really on spot and we are given a properly gritty yet rich world to experience this adventure. There are good special effects, especially the fun with subways! The film kept me interested and made me care what was going to happen, which is no small feat! It is worth seeing and I recommend it. I might even see it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Sure it's not a Great movie, but I still liked it and have some good words about it.First of all I liked the character of Ron Perlman. Hellboy is a funny, very cynic and very close to human character ( even with his superhero ability) that makes this dark movie a little bit lighter and funnier.Second is the direction. Hellboy looked good. Maybe it's not as solid as X-Men but it's still very entertaining to watch. The fights of Hellboy with Samael are awesome ( Much better than Alien with Predator ).

"A New Look at ""Hellboy""","There's a new trailer out for the sequel to Guillermo del Toro's 2004 ""Hellboy,"" which made me remember the original. I saw it in the theaters back when it was released, and frankly, didn't like it very much. Seeing the new trailer, and given del Toro's new found fame and recognition from the success of ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" I felt compelled to give ""Hellboy"" another try.My main complaint with ""Hellboy"" is more theological and philosophical than stylistic. Spiritually speaking, I don't proscribe to the traditional Catholic belief that we are born into sin. I believe that people are fundamentally good, and become evil through their choices. So the idea of a hero who comes from hell, who is fundamentally bad, who then chooses to be good doesn't really jive with my sense of the human experience. Consequently, I didn't walk away from the film, having one of those profound spiritual experiences like I've had from movies like ""The Matrix"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""But on this latest viewing I tried to set aside this more philosophical complaint and examine the film on a more entertainment level. Technically speaking, I enjoyed the film a lot this time around. Stylistically, it's near perfect film-making.Del Toro, as shown in ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" has a real gift for creating unique creatures and monsters. Every villain, monster, and character in ""Hellboy"" is fascinating. There's an almost abstractness to their design that makes them feel like they're out of a very strange dream- like/fairy tale.The special effects are top notch. Special effects shouldn't draw too much attention to themselves. Sometimes filmmakers can overreach and the effects look cheesy. This movie blends both old and new methods, creating a film that draws you in rather than reminding you that you're watching something fake. I appreciate that Hellboy is acted by a real actor, wearing prosthetics, which always looks better than even the best CGI.I really enjoyed the Hellboy character this time around as well. He's sarcastic, insecure, funny, sensitive, and tough. I really got a kick out of his little scene where he's trying to write a love letter to Liz and he asks, ""What's a good word for need?"" His staggering love- sickness over Liz is one of the most human and endearing aspects to his character. I also like his common muttering of, ""Crap!"" in the face of very large and scary monsters.The ""Hellboy"" script has great pacing as well. It's not too short, not too long. It just clips along like a good action flick should, always understandable, always inventive, always fun. This is a good old-fashioned B-movie.If ""Hellboy"" resonated on a spiritual level, it would be a great film. Without viable spiritual depth, it remains good entertainment. Not a bad accomplishment nonetheless.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Great Acting, Lousy Story","How many times do you come away from an action movie (and one based on a comic book series no less) remembering the characterizations more than anything else? This was the case for me in watching ""Hellboy."" I was totally impressed with Ron Perlman's dry as vermouth performance, and that alone elevates this film above your standard comic book to screen adaptation. Unfortunately, the story is so uninvolving that it never puts the characters in situations that really engage the viewer, so the acting talent much of the time feels wasted.This film looks great, too, but come on, by now don't all Hollywood action films look pretty good, and shouldn't they, given the amount of money thrown at them. No, the makers of ""Hellboy"" have all the ingredients for a spicy, rich, delicious stew but only manage to muster up a mediocre broth that needs a lot of salt.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
They Got Everything Right But the Pacing,"Having been a Hellboy fan for years I've been looking forward to the movie since it was announced. Now that I've seen it I'm of mixed minds. First off its one of the most faithful adaptations of a comic ever put on the screen where everything looks and feels right. The trouble is that the term leadenly paced doesn't do it justice, despite action sequence after action sequence this movie fails to move at all. Yes, all of the inter-personal relationships are scenes are fine, but anything that has to do with action or the villains is motionless. After an hour I was fighting a desperate battle to remain awake and the person I saw this with had to keep being nudged because they were snoring. What a slow slow movie. Wait for video and then keep the remote handy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Red alert,"Hellboy joins the recent trend of popular comic book adaptations (X-Men, Spiderman) and unfortunately also the dire trend of movies that drown in computer engineered effects (like Underworld or Van Helsing). The good news is that it was directed and co-written by Guillermo Del Toro, who has a terrific sense of perspective. Hellboy doesn't take itself too serious and that's why it is a lot easier to digest than an overly pretentious film like Underworld, for example. I never read any of the Hellboy comics during my youth but that isn't a necessity in order to follow the film. Apparently, he's a demon awakened by the most stereotypical Nazi's you'll ever see and nursed by an American scientist (John Hurt). As a fully-grown demon, Hellboy serves the FBI as some sort of caretaker along with some other freaks of nature. There's an aqua-man that shows a lot of resemblance with the Creature from the Black Lagoon and Selma Blair who bursts into flames whenever she gets emotional. Blair's character seems to come right out of an X-Men comic. Hellboy features a few very cool gimmicks and  surprisingly enough  a couple of very atmospheric and eerie sequences like the one shot at the Russian cemetery when it's snowing. The plot is utterly thin but there's the outstanding performance by Ron Perlman as Hellboy to fill up the emptiness. Some of his one-liners are pathetically lame but his charisma and grimaces do the job. The big advantage about these comics-turned-into-films is that anything goes. Here you have Nazi's collaborating with Rasputin (?), Hellhounds in the subway and more of this cheerful crap. Hey, at least it was better than Daredevil.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
One of the worst comic book adaptations,"No word on the story. It's a adaptation of a (comic) book, so the film is not responsible.But the film is responsible for the bad special effects, for the poor sound, for the pathetic scenes, for the lifeless actors and for wasting my time.It's like a bad demo of a graphic cards abilities, only disturbed minimal by the ""story"" and pathetic and lame acting. Hellboy has much of Blade (Blade 2): a boring, supercool dude, nearly unstoppable and instead of ideas he solves most with his immortality. He gets crushed in several walls, falls down far distances and gets one wound on his arm and ONE scratch in his face in the hole film. Wow, it's thrilling like a tank attacked by soldiers with bare hands.Get some GOOD comics and read them...but don't waste your time on this lifeless film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
She took his picture  Hellboy,"You gotta love Guillermo del Toro. The man knows how to play the system, staggering his Spanish language tales of wonderment with the oft-Hollywood big-budget action flick. The beauty of it is, however, that del Toro never compromises his vision when tackling a comic book adaptation. Looking at a film like Blade II shows that he carries his style with him wherever he goes, improving on a pretty solid first installment and showing that he can handle the work. That film helped land him the duties of helming HellboyI'm surea film with flair, humor, action, and style. Anyone else could have phoned a film like this in for the paycheck, biding time until his next passion project came down the pipeline, but with del Toro, this adaptation was just as important in his oeuvre as any other, and it shows.With an almost perfect mix of exposition, character development, and plot, this tale of a demon coming to Earth from a portal to Hell, only to be raised by a scientist into the ultimate fighter against evil, fires on all cylinders. Concise in its originnot quite a flashback since it's the first thing we seewe learn where the titular character comes from, who brings him here, and for what purpose. This is the all-encompassing larger plot line that will inevitably be carried on throughout the series, a demon fighting for good against the powers that spawned him. The ultimate cautionary tale of nature vs. nurture, Hellboy may be sarcastic, cranky, and abrasive, but he knows his role and revels in the fact that he saves lives on a daily basis. I always seem to connect more with the heroes that don't necessarily have powers. True he does, but only those abilities common to his kind. He is a demon and thus does demon things, much like Superman who is Kryptonian, (he doesn't have superhuman abilities, he isn't human), and Batman, who uses inventions and skill to battle villainy. These heroes use what God gave them and nothing else; no mutations or radiations make them different, life does, and they are doing the best they can, attempting to assimilate and be seen as normal.What really works here is the way that character relationships are developed as the plot continues on. Rather than everyone have a set bond that we must become privy to, they all kind of start apart from one another. Hellboy and his father Prof. Broom are at odds, he and his friend Liz are separated by a sanitarium, Abe Sapien is detached by his glass water tank, and newcomer John Myers has only just met them all. Connections are repaired and newly created before our eyes while the fights rage on. It is the fieldwork by this secretive government group against evil that brings them all together. Unfortunately, as a result, this also means that the plot to save Earth is a tad undercooked. Sure the action scenes are great, especially involving our Nazi timeclock, knife-welding friend, but the overall story really just shows whether Hellboy will stay good or go to the dark side. The only true peril Earth faces is in the off-chance he decides to follow his destiny as ruler of our dimension, a simple no could pretty much quash all the trouble faced here. But this was always to be the first of at least a trilogy, setting up motivations and tone, and for that you can't fault the film one iota.To complement it all is some fine acting from the large cast. John Hurt has made a living in his later life playing the sage mentors and he does so again here; Selma Blair stays true to her filmography as well playing the troubled youth trying to find herself while also helping her friends discover themselves; and Jeffrey Tambor adds wonderful jabs of wit and humor every time he graces the screen. Even Karel Roden as the evil Rasputin continues in the type of villainy he is recognized for. A stalwart at playing the stone-faced maniac, he is truly terrifying as he just carries on, back from the dead after 50 years, as though it's the next day and another opportunity to make Herr Hitler proud. The true star, though, is unquestionably Ron Perlman as our red hero. He excels at the sardonic rhetoric, chomping on his cigar as he cuts down those around him with words. A truly troubled soul, Perlman has full range of his facial features under the massive amount of makeup and portrays every emotion needed to realize the role. Credit the filmmakers for utilizing costumes that never hindered any performances.And one couldn't end without talking of del Toro's vision. Straight off we are graced with a vortex opening out into space and the Seven Gods of Hell awaiting their rebirth. The Sammael creatures are well-fleshed out, and the multitudes of squid-like monsters also. The art direction is superb with only a couple blemishes of illusion showing through, (Hellboy's crunching of a Red Bull can and numerous instances of bodies being thrown about, among others). It is with the fire from Blair's character that I was most impressed with. The blue flames encompassing her entire body and all that surrounds her was very realistic and cool to boot. Just viewing the trailers for the sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army shows that del Toro has upped the ante on fantastical beings. I can't wait to see what happens now that we can delve into the story from start to finish and check out whether the world can be saved from outside forces rather than the fragile psyche of our hero, although I'm sure that will play into it as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hellboy? Hell yeah!,"First off, Ron Perlman is Hellboy. It's like he was born for this role. Heck, if Hellboy were real, he'd look like Ron! Notable performances by John Hurt, and the characters of Abe Sapien and Rasputin, also contribute to the pleasure of watching this flick. Biggest disappointment? Selma Blair. I thought this would be her chance to show that she can play a character with depth, but she blew it. Whenever she's in a scene, it gets boring. Especially her scenes with Myers.The action sequences are great, and the script is superb. I mean, there was never a feel of cheese in the lines, which usually happens in comic books movies. Another cool factor is Rasputin's assassin, the Nazi freak. I just wish they would have explored his character more, given him a little more background in form of flashbacks. But it wouldn't have been too significant anyway.""Hellboy"" makes you wanna see more. Luckily for us fans, the sequel will be out by next year. I give ""Hellboy"" a hell yeah!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"For a far-fetched Sci-Fi Flick, Surprisingly Deep!","I don't think it's just me buy this flick was really deep in surprising places. It deals w/ past issues, the problems of how we look are a little explored, the depression of and issues of being picked on for being different, and the surprising violence, that children do on each other, the list goes on and on. It also had such great scenes and dialog, with the child on the roof and when Hellboy says just how he feels about Liz in a sort of clumsy yet romantic way like us mortals would probably do. It's really a great film for everyone, If it weren't for some of the great basic NAZI scenes and the well done action sequences, this could be watched by all. Leave it to G. Del Toro to make a could've been crappy adaptation very memorable and sticking to his guns to get the perfectly cast Ron Perlman (The Studio wanted someone well know and more ""Bankable"") to create such a film. Can't wait for the sequel, and loved the fact that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" won Academy Awards, and got him even more well know/loved by others. My favorite scene, when he takes his hand and looks into Liz's eyes and says so convincingly ""I wish I could do something about this"" meaning his face/look. Watch Watch Watch! It's great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
One of the better comic migrations,"This is one of the better comic migrations. Funny, fast paced, and straightforward. Hell, even the obligatory romance is funny.

"Good, fun movie","OK, I'm a GIRL who does NOT like comics, X-Men, anime, or any of those other genres of people that would usually like this type of movie. But for some reason I love it! I usually prefer chick flicks, feel-gooders like Forrest Gump, etc (typical girl), but something about the dark romance of this movie and how the freak loves the pretty, normal looking ""freak""...awww. Just gotta love it. Also, plenty of punchy action with lots of eww-gross moments like the Hell Hound who has to salivate and bleed more gross gunk than the aliens in Independence Day, but also the historical factor of the conspiracy theory with the Nazi's... I love a good c. theory, especially with the Nazis...always adds a fun kick. But I think this film appealed more to women because of the initial introduction to Hellboy as a little red baby wooed by Baby Ruths and who loves kittens..that big ol' teddy bear. I can watch it with my son, and he won't get bored, and I won't want to blow my brains out, so it's a great mix. Not to pretentious as other ""comic"" movies...still lets viewers who aren't comic nerds have a good time watching and enjoying without rubbing their face in the fact that they haven't seen Parts I thru IV and that special remake they made in '98 with ben affleck.. I mean, come on. Those ""other"" comic/movies, OK, OK, X Men... they expect everyone to know their story line and history and so they ruin it for people who don't. So Hellboy is a fun, action packed, light hearted romance for the family to watch and is a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours even for those of us who don't live in the comic world. Two thumbs up!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A celebration of visuals with a layer of stupid,"This film is held up by pillars of style, thanks to stylish costumes, nice colour pallet, textures, fun props, neat camera shots and ideas for cool scenes (something its sequel would expand upon). The make-up is especially impressive, giving us an authentic representation of the creatures from the comic books and, arguably, improving on their look. In this aspect, Del Toro couldn't have been a better choice of a director. Even the outdated effects don't look too bad, as the digital effects are properly mixed in with practical ones. However, the connective tissue that would tie these cool shots together into a coherent unit is lacking.There are glaring screenplay issues. For example, a monster jumps through the front of a moving subway train and out of the other end, ending up in location A. Hellboy gets dragged under that same train in the opposite direction for a while and is then left on the ground in location B. Someone wasn't good at math problems because, in the very next shot, the monster is shown standing directly above Hellboy, looking around.There is a character who is basically a nazi ninja, and there is a sequence in which he keeps swinging his knives around for no reason for what feels like at least 5 minutes (complete with whooshing sound effects). Did a 10-year-old boy get involved in the production of this movie? This kind of nonsense permeates the movie from beginning to end, and it is very distracting.Hellboy is one of Ron Pearlman's better roles, despite the fact that his face is under a layer of make-up and his lines mostly consist of monotone gruffs. Even the shape of his face fits the character he plays. Jeffrey Tambor's and Doug Jones' characters provide a colourful counterbalance to Hellboy's gruffness. However, everybody's lacklustre dialogue compounds the problems of flawed storytelling and this keeps the movie from reaching its potential.The good source material probably helped Del Toro make this movie into something special, which was good enough to get a sequel, but I am glad that the sequel fixed many of the problems of the first film. This first film is still worth watching though, even if only for the charm and the creature design. I know this is a comic book movie, but please have adults write your screenplays.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
What a Comic book film! Just Brilliant,"Hellboy was a 10 out of 10 for me, but there are a number of criteria for any viewer to have such a high opinion of it. One, even though director Guillermo del Toro is a big fan of the Hellboy comic books and many comments have been made by him, comic creator Mike Mignola and others that the film is faithful to the books, they've also said they've changed it to suit the context of the film, so you have to not be a purist about source material to screen translations (or current screen instantiations). Two, you have to have a taste for fantasy where the creators are not very concerned with making the material coherent with or plausible in the actual world. Three, you have to enjoy your fantasy both very dark (on the horror side) and humorous/sarcastic at the same time. Four, you have to like an epic, sprawling feel to your fantasy. And Five, you have to not hate cgi creatures. I meet all of those criteria. How many you meet will likely determine how well you'll like Hellboy.What worked best for me was the material that showed Hellboy, portrayed exquisitely by Ron Perlman, as just a regular guy cum sassy detective. Even though he's half demon, a large part of the comics, at least-- and this is hinted at in the film, particularly in the climax--is a continual nature versus nurture ""debate"". He was raised by humans who were as normal as they could be, being government agents in a bureau dedicated to the paranormal. So he has a large number of human-like quirks, including a love of old music, beer, cats, pancakes, chili, and so on. He's also a cigar-smoking, smart-asset detective. Hellboy is at its best when it focuses on these characteristics.Also worth noting is the cinematography/Special Effects crew and set designs, which was consistently beautiful, and ranges from the popular recent trend of more monochromatic textures (blue is the color of choice here), to the strong chiaroscuro of the comic books, to striking contrasts, such as a mostly monochromatic scene which is suddenly penetrated by a supersaturated red stream of blood. The sets are all engaging, and amazingly large in scale from interior to exterior.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Ugh. What the heck?,"Why Guillermo, WHY?!!!! It's like one of those trash British movies, albeit a bit darker. But still a room with a view and a staircase and a pond type of movies. You know, the ones with absolutely no plot devices. And lots of MacGuffins (look it up.) I was looking forward to this movie FOREVER as a huge fan of the character, and knowing PERLMAN would play him made it that much better. No one in the world could screw this up. Wow. Was i wrong or what? Perlman ended up being about the only thing that made this movie tolerable. Horrid effects, Selma's dry acting (Oh wow. i can make fire. meh. seems to be her general attitude), and a poorly laid out story. There's just nothing here for any Hellboy fans. Except perlman. IT gets a 1/10. Only because 1 is the lowest it goes.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Approach with Caution,"Hellboy started off like no other comic book film I have seen in a long time. It reminded me more of an Indiana Jones film the way the Nazis and Rasputin were trying to open the gate you could say, so it does have a very strong beginning, but after that it feels like the director lost his way really as the movie doesn't really go anywhere, if it does I must have missed something. For me I need a little characterization and bit of story but this film just flew past every plot hole and didn't correct it.John Hurt was on very good form just as I expected, Ron Pearlman was very good also as Hellboy but I don't like the way they portray him. It has some really good characters who start good but end in a way you don't really care anymore. It keeps your attention and then it is taken away from. No new fresh ideas or action set pieces makes this film overall quite a dull one. I would say Ron Pearlman is the best thing about this movie as his portrayal of Hellboy is more comical than scary. If your wanting your summer blockbuster then Hellboy is your film but if your looking for some in-depth movie about a comic book character than I would say Hulk is the one you should be dividing your attention to. Hellboy isn't awful but it isn't great or even very good. Approach with caution.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

WTH?,"How is this anything like spawn? Fact is, its not. Putting comics into genres shows that a person like yourself shows you know nothing of comics, besides the Hollywood Adaptation.Underworld good FX? Please. I thought they were not that bad, but not the best out their either. As for the weapons, so what. How does it imitate dracula or wereworlf weapons? I think he used a cross, garlic holywater etc out of superstition more than anything. And who cares, it isnt cliche. That has been the myth for year and ages and years. You cant change it, its been handed down to us.Also, how does the comic book ridicule such things? Obviously you have read something else, if you have even read it at all. You should take them seriously, its cool.Dont compare it to Indiana Jones. Wow because their is nazis, and every movie that has anything to do with Nazis in WWII is Indiana Jones? Fact is, the Nazis in Indy were bull. How is this like Quake or Doom? Stupidest Comparison ever, next to Indiana Jones. Not to mention, this comic was out way before Quake or Doom. Also, im pretty sure the original copyright for the comic was 92', and DOOM came out in 93. A years difference.If people like this, because they like it, why are you telling them to track down tick? That is lame. Tick = Stupid funny, Hellboy = Sarcastic. Anything alike?

John Hurt too is fittingly OTT as Hellboy's mentor.There is also an amusing romantic subplot which will keep you entertained although it's hardly Casablanca.

A hero who plays like a villain,"Hellboy features visual effects on all different scales, all of which can be described as nothing short of spectacular. I wasn't so much attracted to the story as I was by Ron Perlman's wonderful performance and the uncanny amount of effects that were flooding the screen at record speeds.If that's what you crave, than Hellboy is the recommended picture. Origins stories are hit or miss for me, but I found this particular one more believable in terms of performances and depth than Daredevil, yet not as polished and as moving as the recent Spider-Man films. But is it fair to compare Hellboy to the likes of a hero that is incredibly mainstream? That was for the masses. This is for the cultists.""Hellboy"" came out after the Nazis erected a portal off the coast of Scotland in 1944, hopefully summoning beasts from different worlds to help them win the war. The Nazis are soon defeated, the portal destroyed, but not before a blood-red infant emerges. The allies who discover him coin the name ""Hellboy"" for the little guy.I'm sure you now know where this will lead; Hellboy's main gift to the world is assisting in attacking paranormal creatures that are attempting to wreak havoc on our planet Earth. Super simple stuff. Director Guillermo del Toro's livens up the seemingly disposable material with a bright light show, equipped with impressive pyrotechnics and a helluva lot of explosions to boot. For someone that, surprisingly, wasn't very moved or gripped by the storytelling, the effects served as the main course I was happy to feast on.The key to Hellboy's success is Ron Perlman's amazingly gifted performance as the horned, red-skinned, quick-witted, loose-lipped, cigar-chomping demon that is Hellboy. Perlman's not only built for the role but incredibly capable in the shoes of the character, who possibly will never be portrayed as accurately again.The direction by del Toro bleeds style and packs in enough substance as well. The character of Hellboy is closely followed throughout the course and it seems that even though many things are going on, we never lose sight of what is happening. Hellboy is a truly favorable superhero film, with a hero who looks and behaves sometimes more like a villain.Starring: Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Jeffrey Tambor, Karel Roden, Rupert Evans, and John Hurt.

Pleasant surprise,"The trailer for Hellboy didn't set my pulse raising. I rejected it as rubbish before I'd even given it a chance. But when I went out with some friends and ended up seeing the film, I got a rather pleasant surprise: Hellboy actually has something to it. Red is quite a character, and in a weird, simple way he's very charming - more so, at least, than some of the dire action heroes we see around. The plot has drive, if it does occasionally stagger, and there is a supporting cast strong enough to be at least vaguely memorable. I've heard a lot of people moan about the dialogue, and true, it is often uninspired, but it certainly beats the Matrix Reloaded: 'No.' 'Why?' 'The problem is the choice.' That is to say, I didn't expect much more from this, but from The Matrix Reloaded I expected far more.If for no other reason, you should see Hellboy because it's damned exciting! With this kind of film, that's what matters. Hellboy fits the bill and if you've ever liked this sort of thing, you'll like Hellboy too. 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"Fairly generic sci-fi adventure tale, but with some fantastic art-design and a really likable lead at the core of it","Hellboy seems like a cool hero, and he deserves a better film than the one he gets here, which is too full of leaps in logic and extraordinarily inconsistent in tone. Like Superman, he seems to care enough for our world in order to save it from some pretty nefarious people when the time comes - perhaps chiefly because, like Superman, he doesn't actually have a home world of his own to go back to. He's cocky; confident and a little rebellious, although remains faithful to those who have taken care of him up to this point in his life.The film's beginning sets an odd, fantastical tone which does not really dissipate for the rest of its runtime. It's 1944, and despite the fact the Channel Islands were the only part of the British Isles the Germans ever conquered during The Second World War, the Nazis are in Scotland. There, they are looking to end the war quickly; sensing, I suppose, defeat, what with their failing campaigns in North Africa and on the Eastern Front, and so turn to opening up portals to dimensions beyond our observable world in order to call upon higher powers to help them. But, how do they know if this unknown entity will be sympathetic to their aims? The imagery of the opening is also too reminiscent of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", which culminated in such a show - we are at a stage now in blockbuster cinema whereby a film like ""Hellboy"" decides to BEGIN with it.Alas, for the Nazis, something goes wrong in their experiment when the American (not British) soldiers, who have been tracking them all this way, launch an ambush to quash the mission. With them is a young professor named Trevor Bruttenholm, who is eventually played in his old age by John Hurt. In the ensuing chaos, something does indeed pop out of what was a gateway to Hell - the aforementioned and eponymous Hellboy: a small, red demon who is eventually played in his 'old' age by Ron Perlman, by which point he is a conspiracy theory amongst modern New Yorkers despite there being photographic evidence of him posing in a picture with the soldiers.Guillermo del Toro uses this set up to tell a tale which is mostly interested in set direction and costume, which makes a change to having to sit through a film of this stock which is mostly interested in action, although there is quite a bit of action... In the twenty-first century, Hellboy is kept in an FBI lockup with a variety of other quirky occultist stuff from non-history - he's at an age in his life now whereby he is bored, and craves action and adventure and quite likes the idea of having a girlfriend. Whatever it is they groom young demons to do in Hell, Hellboy isn't getting it here.Away from this, something is brewing - the Nazis who failed to win The War the first time around are gunning for another shot. In true ""The Mummy"" style, two of these Nazis, played by Karel Roden and Bridget Hodson, are able to live forever in a cursed state and set out with the intent to bring about the apocalypse anyway. On their side is an odd, machine-like tin-made ninja decked out in Nazi garb and a bizarre fish-like creature whose raw brawn they use to buttress their offensive.The thinking and the energy behind ""Hellboy"" is a lot more interesting than the finished product itself, which finds comfort in telling a tale of heroes fighting villains with the world at stake. More interesting are the characters, particularly the supporting ones who are all at once beautiful; terrifying; fascinating and ugly to look at - we sense they each have their own worlds, complete with complicated biological ecosystem to slot into, somewhere in the universe, just nowhere that we can imagine.The film seems to lose its focus too often, coming off as very wayward in tone as scenes of brutal violence involving villainous sword-play are intercut with sardonic putdowns from the protagonist. It also seemed as if there was a love story in an earlier draft, or cut altogether, involving a character who could not control the fire she could produce from the palms of her hands. The film ends up in deepest of snowy Russia and Hellboy being carted around in a box, but why bother hiding him if his identity is out by this point? And what do the Russian authorities think of an FBI entourage in their country anyway? Irrespective, ""Hellboy"" is a lot of good, harmless fun which fans of the genres of action, horror and science fiction should devour.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"One of the most criminally underrated and under-recognized features of the past 20 years, ""Hellboy"" excels with its abundance of thrills, laughs and most of all...  heart.","The ""Hellboy"" film franchise is a story that could almost be called a tragedy. Mainly in that it so perfectly encapsulates one of the most troubling aspects of modern film-making and distribution.That is, no matter how high a quality a production may be, it all comes down to the money. If a moderately-budgeted film isn't a runaway hit or doesn't attract a massive audience, chances are it won't be able to continue to completion no matter how much it clearly should. Which is most certainly the case for the beloved cult-favorite ""Hellboy.""Whether it be the the highly entertaining and appealing ""Hellboy Animated"" series that ended at two entries despite audiences being promised a third that never came. Or this film and its similarly- singular follow-up. Despite their wild popularity amongst a more niche, cult audiences and general high critical praise... they just never quite brought in those big numbers that studio-suits salivate over.It's this fact- this terrible, terrible fact- that lends both the live-action and the animated ""Hellboy"" features an almost poignant air when they are revisited as the years pass. Because you can see masterful artistry and top-notch production work on display that should have so much more recognition (and obviously so many more sequels and follow-ups), but just doesn't.Directed and co-written by the poetic cinematic genius Guillermo del Toro and loosely inspired by the famous comics of mastermind Mike Mignola, ""Hellboy"" tells the tale of, well... Hellboy. (Ron Perlman) A demon summoned to Earth as an infant during World War II by the occult division of the Nazi's in a last-ditch attempt to sway the war in their favor. However, the kindly Professor Bruttenholm and a group of allied soldiers stop the ritual that summoned him in the nick-of-time, and he is taken in by the Professor. Brought up by a good man who taught him values and morals, Hellboy now works for a secret government division known as the ""Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense"" where he hunts monsters and other supernatural threats while being kept hidden from the view of the public.Now, when the spirit of the infamous Rasputin (yes, THAT Rasputin, as portrayed by Karel Roden)- the man partially responsible for summoning Hellboy to Earth so many years ago- re-emerges with a plan to bring about the end of the world as we know it, Hellboy must confront this devious figure of his past. Along for the ride are a colorful cast of supporting characters, including:-Liz Sherman (Selma Blair)- a beautiful but troubled pyrokinetic who Hellboy pines for-Abe Sapien (Doug Jones)- an aquatic ""fish-man"" with psychic abilities-John Myers (Rupert Evans)- the new-guy at the bureau who has been assigned to watch over Hellboy-Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor)- the head of the bureau whose a bit of a jerk, though he just might have the smallest of soft-sidesThe cast is just wonderful. Especially Perlman, who was born to play Hellboy and makes him as fun, relatable and complex as you could possibly imagine. Which is no small feat considering he's playing the role under heavy prosthetic make-up that gives him red skin, massive muscles and devil-horns. But he makes the character so lovable and oafish, you'll constantly find yourself forgetting about his looks.Blair is also stunning in her role, adding a lot of pathos and heart to the film, especially as her love for Hellboy and his love for her plays a major role, despite them not being together. It gives the film such a great emotional core.Hurt is a blast of fun as Bruttenholm. Jones (with voice-over work by David Hyde Pierce) brings the aquatic Abe to life with an absolutely magical physical performance. And supporting roles by Roden, Evans and Tambor are very well played, even if their roles are written somewhat flatter than our leads. (Though Tambor is given a lot more room to shine in the second film.)But it could be argued that the real star here is the wonderful script and pitch-perfect direction courtesy the wickedly entertaining and talented del Toro. His work is always so poetic and complex but also never alienating. He much loves melodrama (something he admits), and it's used to perfection in much of his work- ""Hellboy"" being no exception.His visual direction is smooth, slick and stylish. Always moving and writhing around the scenes like a beautiful serpent. Expertly painting the visual image before us. Combining this with the wonderful cinematography of DP Guillermo Navarro, and his work here is just plain stunning.Then there's his wonderful handling of character and story, in both his actor-direction and writing. It's witty. Never dull. And oddly enough for a film about a big, red demon- frequently and consistently heartwarming. Yes, this film has perhaps the biggest heart of any superhero/comic film of the past 20 years. And that's what really drives home just how special it is.And while I do have to dock a point from my score due to a few clichés and contrivances here and there, I really hope that doesn't indicate that I don't completely love and adore this film. Because I do. For it's wonderful performances. For it's gorgeous visuals. For it's fascinating design and phenomenal score courtesy the fantastic Marco Beltrami. And for it's great sense of humor and heart.This is a near-perfect 9 out of 10. Please give it a shot if you're even somewhat interested. A hidden gem like this really deserves wider recognition.

"Heavy on Effects, But Not Very Special","As with many of my fellow viewers here at IMDb, I at first had no interest in seeing this obscure comic book figure's cinematic debut, but preliminary favorable reviews and commentary found me pushing my $6.50 across the counter for the Sunday matinee viewing of ""Hellboy"".  It was not $6.50 well spent.Arcane as the character and story of ""Hellboy"" are, the film itself is disturbingly reminiscent of at least a dozen other (and better) movies.  It isn't that the idea of an oversized, wisecracking demon, adopted and raised from infancy by the OSS in 1944, battling evil on the side of Righteousness is not without originality or merit, but we have pretty much seen everything before; a sinister Nazi plot to use supernatural powers to aid their nefarious cause (""Raiders of the Lost Ark""); top secret government offices and agencies to deal with phenomena kept hidden from the populace, yet operating under our very noses (""Men in Black""); special groups of creatures, i.e. misfits,  with outlandish powers in hidden academies, led by benevolent elderly gentlemen (""The X-Men"", ""League of Extraordinary Men""); battles with slimy monsters living in abandoned tunnels in New York City (""Ghost Busters"", among others); a girl with pyrokinetic powers (""Firestarter"") and so on, and on and on...It begins promisingly enough, but soon bogs down under its own weight with recondite references to biblical demonology, and increasingly bizarre (and apparently immortal) enemies.  The fight scenes are violent, but dark and difficult to follow, as is the climax, which is held in a huge and elaborate underground vault looming beneath a cemetery near Moscow and outfitted with giant hammers with no other apparent purpose than to smash a bridge (don't ask).  Perhaps the comic book saga explains these things in greater detail, but in an hour an a half, the uninitiated general viewer just gets lost (and bored).The new government agent selected to chaparone Hellboy brings remarkably little to the film.  This is a role which might have been played by Keanu Reeves or even Matthew Broderick with some greater success, but here just plods along as the script directs.There is a fellow made of sand who winds himself up like a watch, an esp accoutered aquatic being with the voice of Niles Crane named for Abraham Lincoln, a beautiful Nazi woman named Ilsa who does not age after 60 years, and of course the Czarist priest Rasptutin plays a major role in the proceedings. None of it makes much sense, but then again, that could be a good thing...",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Watching this is like a cross between an X-Men film and watching a true expert play a 'beat 'em up' computer game against a feeble, first timer opponent.","At a time when the majority of films are comic book, action adventure adaptation films; I doubt we needed another CGI laden superhero film that had villains after world domination and a seemingly indestructible protagonist who is clearly the only match for whatever villainy the film can cook up. Hellboy is a nice to look at action film that never takes itself too seriously yet embodies several tired and familiar routines to keep it running. These include the old anti-hero persona that Hellboy (Perlman) carries with him throughout, the way the characters in the film are practically non-existent except for Hellboy and the main enemy and the fact the film sometimes contradicts itself regarding its ideas.In essence; Hellboy feels like a poor man's 'Men in Black'. It carries all the action and humour of the first Men in Black film, it copies Men in Black's use of a 'fish out of water' technique but the character of John Myers (Evans) is the character here and he's partnered up with Hellboy just like Agent Jay was with Agent Kay. The difference here is that Myers is sort of assigned to 'baby-sit' Hellboy because Hellboy needs his meals and needs to be kept out of public view but by half way through the film, Hellboy has had so much public exposure that his secret is out and nobody seems to care; rendering Myers useless after about forty minutes of the film whereas Agent Jay was Kay's partner throughout and was dealing with aliens and clearing up the mess wherever needed. I thought that Hellboy should've taken the approach Men in Black did and have these two people get into their own adventures but Myers is built up at the beginning as someone important and as someone who will have an impact on the film and Hellboy's adventures  in the end, he was just unnecessary.I was not moved by Hellboy and was not impressed with any deeper, more technical things. The film is shallow and rather poorly structured with the supporting characters consisting of human beings wielding machine guns and wearing suits (another 'should-be' Men in Black reference?). They are supposed to defeat the other type of character: CGI created fish-like monsters who are clearly no match for the human beings yet it is decided they do battle anyway. Other than this, there is just no conflict in the film. Everyone is weak except for Hellboy and a Nazi demon-like character who for some reason knows a mixture of kung-fu and how to use knifes and daggers like a Samurai  not particularly accurate. The reason there's no conflict is because whenever an enemy goes up against a human being, we know who will win; like-wise whenever Hellboy goes up against anything, we know who will win. There are also too many one-on-one fights that are too one-sided - meaning they play out like a fox battling an injured chicken.I'd say that Hellboy is perhaps a 'fun' film but maybe I watched it with my brain turned on a little too much. There is enough material to structure something clever: A Nazi experiment goes wrong, a demon enters our world and there are numerous other monsters it can do battle with. I felt that if Hellboy and the allies had another character who was equally as strong as Hellboy was, it might have been interesting. The character of Liz Sherman (Blair) is introduced and fits this character but she comes in far too late. The fish-like character of Abe Sapien (Jones) was there from the beginning but he was perceived as quite weak. Also, there are too many one sided duels throughout the film that just make it another CGI, comic book film that goes through the motions, has the showdown at the temple/castle or whatever and then kills itself off with a twist of fate or an individual act of genius from the hero. Hellboy is not a particularly good film but will entertain on a basic level although there are better films that do this; namely Men in Black.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

An Entertaining Comic Book Adaptation Worth your Time,"In the early to mid 90s, comic artist Mike Mignola created the character Hellboy for Dark Horse comics, and the series became a favorite amongst the comic community, mainly for its dark atmosphere, gritty design and sardonic humor. Fast forward roughly 10 years later, when the director of Pan's Labyrinth and The Shape of Water, Guillermo del Toro, helmed a film adaptation. Despite it being more of his own interpretation of the series than Mignola's, it went on to become a cult favorite. But does this film truly stand as a worthy adaptation, or is the upcoming reboot more of a blessing in disguise?The plot itself is rather simple and straight forward, as it centers around a devilish creature named Hellboy, an agent in the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, where he, the psychic merman Abe Sapien, and the pyrokinetic Liz Sherman protect America against dark forces. However, these beings called the Sammael are resurrected by Nazis in an attempt to not only open a portal to a paranormal dimension, but to also summon Hellboy in his true form. Simple enough, and most of the first half of the movie does sort of drag on at points with Hellboy trying to stop the Sammael creatures. That being said, what does keep the film going is the entertainment value, the relation between Hellboy and Liz, as well as his father, and the mythos behind the nazis plan.In a way, the film is very much like a graphic novel turned into a movie, and the grim atmosphere aided by cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and the production design by Stephen Scott bring out a very spooky presence to an already unsettling and suspenseful feature. Not to mention, the action scenes are very well choreographed and it shows how much hard work the stunt team put into the film (although sometimes they can be hard to make out due to the dark shadows). In addition, the makeup for Hellboy provided by the phenomenal Rick Baker is so fantastic that it's hard to only see Ron Perlman playing the character. Admittedly, the computer animation of the Sammaels and other things does look dated, although that mainly comes from the moderate budget the film had to work with, but they still look cool nonetheless.The characters themselves are more of a mix; some are worth rooting for, while others feel somewhat shallow and underdeveloped. Hellboy is the tough and sarcastic albeit subtly emotional demon who knows how to pack a punch but also has more layers underneath him based on his origins, Liz is the emotionless fire starter who has to keep her powers from getting unleashed after a traumatic past, and Trevor Bruttenholm, Hellboy's adoptive father, is the most knowledgable head of the BPRD who carries a strong emotional bond with his adoptive son. Abe Sapien also has strong knowledge through being psychic, aided by a wonderful physical performance by Doug Jones. These are the characters that keep the viewer intrigued enough to follow their mission, especially to take down the notorious Rasputin who will not stop in any way to fulfill his plans of world domination.However, the characters that don't stick out as much are just sort of two dimensional. John Myers is the somewhat neurotic FBI agent who tries to help out when needed, but he isn't developed enough to really warrant much stakes when he's in danger, but at least he gets brave by the third act. Tom Manning is the stuff-shirted bureaucrat who tries so stubbornly hard to do things his way over anything paranormal that he gets too annoying and selfish for his own good. Also, many of the antagonists like Kroenen and Haupstein are the typical power hungry nazis who will stand in nobody's way to get what they want. To put in bluntly, the film has its share of underdeveloped and inflexible characters as much as it has its share of highly determined, charismatic, and emotive characters.Overall, while it may not pick up much until the second half and some characters are more interesting than others, Hellboy packs enough raw action and stakes, mythos of the titular character, well detailed set pieces and makeup, and even some occasional snarky humor. I think fans of the comics will get a big kick out of the film, even if it does kind of stray away from the source material, as it represents the iconic rough and sardonic agent they've come to know and love. Heck, even if you haven't read the comics, this film will be a welcome introduction to newcomers who want to get sucked into something exciting and macabre. While I'm not sure how the reboot will play out, we still have this entertaining thrill ride to get sucked into.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Monster Mash,"I came into watching Hellboy with mixed emotions over what to expect, and hey, guess what? I'm leaving with mixed emotions! In what appears to be a big stretch, Ron Perlman plays a big lug. Well, OK, let's be fair, instead of a big hairy lug like he played in Beauty and the Beast, or a very odd lug in City of Lost Children, in Hellboy he stretches and plays a big RED lug. With horns. His name is Hellboy, a demon child birthed by an experiment in the third Reich to start the fall of Mankind. Or Something. To be honest, the plot is really ridiculous, something about Rasputin, an unstoppable third Reich assassin, and doomsday. The parts where it somewhat gets interesting is Perlman's dry delivery on his inability to pick up chicks when they don't really go for a big red lug with horns driving a garbage truck. Finally, if a film has to resort to casting Jeffery Tambor as an action star, well, you've got problems from the start.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hellboy: One of the best comic-book films out there.,"What makes a comic-book film good? Its plot, its special-effects or its overall entertainment value? For Hellboy, its Ron Perlman's performance. During the Second World War, American soldiers discover Nazis opening a portal to another dimension, through which a baby demon comes through. This demon grows up to become Hellboy, a monster-hunter who discovers of a plot to take over the world.As comic-book films go, Hellboy is one of the best. Ron Perlman is perfectly cast as the hero of the movie and provides the brilliantly sarcastic personality to the character. Fine performances also come from David Hyde Pierce as the voice of Abe Sapien, Selma Blair as Liz and John Hurt as Professor Broom.Like all action films, Hellboy's special effects will be judged and it certainly doesn't disappoint. Their use in the action sequences and on the creature Sammael are spectacular, although I did notice that at some points Hellboy does look slightly cartoonish. The special effects are at their most impressive during the first fight between Hellboy and Sammael.Hellboy's personality means that a lot of humour comes from him. Any film like this would definitely need some comic relief and this has plenty of bits to tickle your funny bone such as when a small tile falls on Hellboy's head whilst battling Sammael and he simply says ""Ow."" There was one thing about Hellboy that disappointed me: the villains. Sammael and Rasputin are both good and interesting in their first scenes, but their effectiveness wares off after a while. Also, Rasputin overall just isn't that great as a villain. The only enemy to stay interesting throughout is the blade-wielding Kronen who I think should have had more scenes.Nevertheless, Hellboy is one of the best comic-book films I've seen. I give it 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Exciting Villains, Boring Hero","HELLBOY is one of those frustrating movies where you can spot about 100 exciting ideas that they didn't follow up on -- but all you get is a muddled up mess instead.The movie's prologue is explosive -- desperate Nazis summoning up hell itself to ward off total defeat in 1945. Right away you are introduced to eye-catching villains and chilling possibilities. There's Rasputin, the sex-mad Russian mystic, and Ilsa, a stunning blonde SS She Wolf. He's about to gamble his soul to break into the vortex of evil. She's his willing slave and they kiss good-bye in a way that scorches the screen. Your mind buzzes with questions. How did Rasputin survive all these years? Why is he working for the Nazis? What is Ilsa like in bed? How did Rasputin tame her? Right away, you get it all -- sex, sadism, Satan, excitement, evil, and sensuality.Unfortunately . . . these are not the main characters of the film. The main character is Hellboy. Unlike Karel Roden (as Rasputin) and Biddy Hodson (as Ilsa) Ron Perlman as Hellboy just doesn't have the sexual charisma to draw you in. He's a big lug, that's all. A big lug painted red, smoking a cigar. The moment the prologue ends, and we switch focus to his personal problems, the movie begins to drag, slowly, to a halt.Certainly it's possible to make audiences care deeply about a big, dumb lug. Like Rocky Balboa. But Rocky was an underdog, someone we liked because, big as he was, he got no respect and was picked on by the whole neighborhood. But Hellboy is the opposite. He sulks and mopes, but he's given every possible luxury and his government bosses treat him with kid gloves. And in the fight scenes, which drag on and on, he's invincible, and his enemies are generic and ugly. There's a fight scene with a giant squid thing that drags on for ten minutes, literally. Why do you care who wins when a red painted lug stands around punching a bunch of rubber and foam for ten minutes? What this movie needed was to follow up on much more of the background ideas -- more mysticism, Nazi sex, occult mysteries, and historical scandals. The scenes they hinted at in the back story were far more exciting than anything the Hellboy actually does.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Humorous, Exciting, Adventurous","I Recently saw Hellboy not because of the previews, but because my boyfriend wanted to. Seeing the previews, I assumed that Hellboy would be a wanna-be X-Men. But it was definitley a lot better than I thought it would be.For one thing, the characters were so neat and definitley creative. I also thought the intellect and history in the story was a significant part. The settings were really exciting as well. Although, I think the movie would have been a ten if they had capitalized more on some of the characters and relationships. For example, Myers was 'chosen'. But his character still didn't bring much drama or substance as the audience would assume from the beginning of the movie. Gaps like that left out a lot of quality, leaving the audience with unanswered questions. At the end, the scene where Hellboy fought the leader wasn't all that dramatic, but it was supposed to be an important part in the story. It was the final fight and there was absolutely no substance in the scene.Overall I would say it was a good movie, but had potential to be much better.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Big Ron loses his head and sheds the red,"Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's third English language feature is an enjoyable comic book superhero romp starring the peerless Ron Perlman (as Hellboy himself). Big Red Ron wisecracks and chews cigars as he battles beautifully-realised CG hell-hounds in just the sort of impressive baroque sets we have come to expect from him; it seems del Toro can't get enough of letting the red stuff run through sewers and caverns - the danker the better.While the script is occasionally aimless, it's also very witty. Perlman plays Hellboy like an indignant teenager, full of tantrums and sarcastic retorts. He's ably supported by John Hurt, Rupert Evans, and Jeffrey Tambor, all hamming it up deliciously; Selma Blair seems somewhat vacant by comparison. The plot is ludicrous of course, but never boring. Del Toro is as bold as ever - not only in the casting of a decidedly non-stellar cult hero in the title role, but also in his wanton references to real historic villains to bolster the menace of his many menaces. But it is generally breezy stuff: silly, too violent for younger children, and yet sweet-natured and - Superman Returns and Spiderman 3 take note - FUN.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A lot better the second time around.,"HELLBOYI had seen this when it first came out, but to be honest I didn't remember much about it, but I do remember thinking it was average at best.Now, after watching it again I can honestly say I enjoyed it a lot more the second time.The movie is a fantasy film about a demon who gets sucked through a gate through time and space to Earth by the Nazis. He is brought up by a professor who believes that he can help fight crime. All goes well until the people who brought him through want to reopen the gate and bring through these creatures to destroy the planet.The story is quite interesting and a lot of fun. There are some comedy moments in there, even a couple that made me laugh out loud. The action sequences were over the top, but for a fantasy film it is what is expected. The fighting was big and there was a lot of destruction. The make up and costumes was good... I liked the dark, but colourful look of the characters. You could tell this was made by Guillermo del Toro. It felt like one of his movies. He has a certain feel and look to his films, much like Tim Burton, but slightly darker. There were some scenes where the effects were not that great... but you can get past that.The film stars Ron Pearlman as Hellboy, and you can tell it's him from the outset. I have been watching Ron ever since I was a little boy. He was in a TV show I loved as a kid called Beauty and the Beast. He played the beast. He has a really interesting face. He plays characters like the Beast and Hellboy brilliantly. Also in this film was John Hurt, Selma Blair & Rupert Evans. Selma is a bit hit and miss. She can be good in some roles and bad in others. There are some episodes of Anger Management where she is so bad that it is embarrassing... but other where she is really good. This is one of those roles... she is good in a lot of scenes, but not so good in others. John and Rupert did brilliantly.A great fantasy action film with a lot going on.

As it was, he was in a decent amount of time.The storyline was OK. The acting from the other actors was not astounding. I liked the fish character, and as I said John Hurt and Ron Pearlman, but the others gave nothing but lines, I'm afraid to say.Villain was not bad but not convincing. Same goes for the love interest.

From the way it looked in the previews, I thought it would be just another crappy superhero flick but it was more than that.  This movie had heart.  Whether it was the interaction between Abe and Broom or the romance with Hellboy and Liz you could definitely feel the emotion.  But that's only in the scenes between the fights, which were not bad but they weren't the best as special effects these days go (they're still 100 times better than anything you would've seen a decade ago with the comic book movies made back then).  As far as Ron Perlman's make-up goes, yeah it looks fake and a little cheesy but it keeps with the look of the comic.  Besides, 30 minutes into it I forgot all about the make-up and focused on the character which Perlman played perfectly as both rough and macho as well as sweet and vulnerable.  All in all, I give Perlman's performance a 10 out of 10 with the rest of the movie being a six.

Ron Pearlman Kills it in this Fun Supernatural Action Comedy,"A very charming and pulpy action horror movie with some creative visuals and a strong charismatic performance by Ron Pearlman as the titular Hellboy. The makeup is fantastic and easily makes up for the somewhat dated CGI. I always love it when the government finds out early on that the paranormal threats are real and they have to team up with other paranormal entities to combat them. The professor surrogate father was charming and the love triangle was a bit cliché, but refreshingly avoidant of melodrama for a more subdued approach. I also love Hellboy's little quirks like his love for cats and babe ruth bars. It's not a comic masterpiece, but it's not trying to be and it serves its purpose well as a fun simple paranormal action thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good adaptation of the Dark Horse comic book,"When I heard that there was going to be a Hellboy movie I was excited. I hadn't read any of the comic books but it made me curious about the series. I watched the movie and was intrigued from start to finish. Dark fantasy with horror elements and lots of weird creatures. What more could you ask? I later found out that the first book of the series was Seed of Destruction. It's been a while since I've read the comic book and seen the movie, but I want to go back and experience both. And Ron Perlman made a good Hellboy. I'd say this is his best work. And the sequel wasn't bad either. Do yourself a favor and see it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good,"Good movie. Perhaps a bit too long, I had the impression of watching a series, but good. It's not Guillermo del Toro that I'm used to, but it's certainly worth a look, especially who likes super(anti)hero movies.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Don't waste your money,"I went into this movie not expecting very much. Well, I didn't get very much. There were maybe thirty people in the theatre when I saw it and half of them walked out within an hour. The dialogue was laughably bad, every time someone made a joke it fell completely flat. Every time someone attempted to be serious it was hilarious.Besides the cringe-worthy script, the acting was pretty mediocre. Selma Blair was fine, but Rupert Evans (as John Myers) and Karel Roden (as Grigori Rasputin) were pretty bad. I'm not going to go into pointless plot summary because you can find that everywhere, so I'll just say don't waste $9.00 on this movie!",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hell Yeah Hellboy,"Great movie to go see for action and one liner laughs. This, like most movies adapted from books or comics, is not 100% accurate, but is still a lot of fun. This adaptation is far better than the big screen version of Spawn. The FX are not new but are well done. The movie has plenty of action and some good laughs. The movie was made for all audiences, so it is not as dark as is comic book origins.The movie does not make direct biblical references but it does borrow some of the stereotyped devices (such as silver and holy water). Lets face it, Hellboy is a demon. There is has to be some reference to good and evil and it is done well so that it does not directly rely on a specific theology.This movie is a fun romp and worth watching, and like all movies, should not be taken seriously.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Had potential,"Although on the whole I didn't mind this film at all, I wasn't sure that the comedic vein throughout was necessary? I think it demeaned the character and the story a bit, although I confess that I have never read the comics that the film is based on. It definitely needed some light relief in places, but it was all just too lighthearted all the time.In particular, I felt that Jeffrey ""I can only play one thing"" Tambor's character was too much. I think the FBI needed to be the serious bit for the rest to bounce off of, having gone down the less serious route with everyone else.While the story was enjoyable enough and the performances were all fine, there were just a few cringey moments, including a ""Neville On The Broom"" CGI issue or two. Some of the special effects in fact seemed to be deliberately bad, as if they were going for a retro vibe. When you compare this to 'Star Wars' (1977) it puts these SFX to shame and that was made 27 years earlier.We did have to wonder if John Hurt had ever looked young and having looked at his early photos on IMDB we concluded that he hadn't, but he's always superb to watch and possibly this films saving grace.It's an easy watch and apart from the swearing and violence it's not much more than a kids comic book hero film, bearing similarities to 'The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen' (2003) and in some ways 'The Harry Potter' series (2001-2011). Although unlike HP, you don't have to think too hard about the plot, so you can have a few drinks as you watch it and head to the toilet without missing too much. Let's just say that the characters aren't very deep, but it's fun enough if you don't take it too seriously.606.15/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Flawed Ruby,"Good movie with great visuals and dialogue, that very much nailis the vibe of the comic books, but unfortunately suffers from a screenplay that's just all over the place. The ending in particular kinda demonstrates this mess very well imo, with multiple high stakes moments stacked on top of each other and rushed thru that just ends up feeling extremely fizzled out and lame. Would undoubtedly have benefited from a rewrite where some of the stuff were cut.Still worth watching for Ron Pearlman alone and the fact that it manages to feel ""nerdy"", genuine and like it was targeting the kinda people who've actually read a Hellboy comic book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Perlman is Good,"Guillermo del Toro wrote and directed Hellboy, which is adapted from a superhero comic. Two years later, he made Pan's Labyrinth, which remains on my ten best list. His eye for superior visuals is evident throughout, and the story is good. In 1944 a portal was built by the Nazis with the guidance of Rasputin, in order to release entities to conquer the world.Sixty years later, the FBI is sent to check out Hellboy, a humanoid creature who was released during Wotld War II. Ron Perlman is the lead, and he is very good, as he battles many different evil doers along the way. A sense of humor is also evident with excellent special effects. The plot is fairly detailed for the genre, and although far-fetched, is based on a comic book, after all. It's worth the ride for del Toro's vision and Perlman's work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The Red Right Hand (A very short review of Hellboy & Hellboy 2),"Hellboy is a cool film. It has action, it has humour, it has heart, it has a truckload of kitties - now what's not to like!? It is a frankly a bad-ass movie, with a bad-ass song; Nick Cave's Red Right Hand, here performed by Pete Yorn. That scene alone is worth a couple of stars in the rating, that's how good it is. Hellboy is also a rather dark superhero film, featuring Nazi scientists where specially the gas mask clad Dr. Kroenen sticks out from the crowd as he suffers from severe body dysmorphic disorder. Another noteworthy beast is Sammael; the ""Hound of Resurrection"", kill one of these monsters and two shall rise. It is a funky bunch. And I have always found it peculiar that Hellboy 2 gets a higher rating here on IMDb. It is a much lighter story and honestly, If I want to watch disgruntled trolls, then I put on the 80s classic fairy-tale Labyrinth. In Hellboy 2 the grittiness that made the first movie is replaced by slapstick and creatures which seem aimed at a much younger audience. I rather watch Hellboy 1 twice in a row than bother with the sequel. H1 gets 8/10. H2 a mere 5/10 (and that's being quite generous.. it does feature a song by Eels).",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Surprisingly Entertaining,"Since I'm not a huge comic book fan (gasp! yes, I know comic books are ultra-cool for trendy kids) I wasn't sure I would like it.  The trailers looked kind of interesting, but with a name like Hell Boy, I thought it might be the equivalent of an 80s heavy-metal hair band in movie form.A friend finally convinced me to go see it and I enjoyed it.  It delivers what it promises--a fun action movie with enough plot and character development so that it's not completely brainless (just mostly).  I thought this movie was similar in quality with X-Men and a little better than X2 (which I didn't like as well).  It has similar themes of misfit, outcast mutants, er, supernatural creatures trying to save mankind from disaster and destruction. You get some love, redemption and Hell Boy has some good lines.While you're there, do a guessing game to see if you can figure out which character John Hurt plays (don't look at the credits here until you've watched it).  I was a little surprised to see his name on the credits. Maybe I'm just dopey but I really didn't know he was in it until I looked.A lot is predictable, but the makers put in some elements that weren't complete formula. For example, I kept expecting the obnoxious boss (played by Jeffrey Tambor) to ""get his"" since these types of characters usually turn into monster food pretty fast (just like the unnamed minor characters that always get killed on Star Trek away missions). Stay through most of the credits and you'll get a little clip of him as a comic reward.  He was funny and contemptible, but in the end he wasn't so bad.  This is just a minor example, but the movie felt fresher than a lot of things that have been trying to recycle formulas lately.I can't help comparing this movie to Van Helsing since they're both in the theaters at the same time and vaguely in the same genre.  Skip Van Helsing and see Hell Boy instead.  It is by far a more effective movie than Van Helsing was and on a much smaller budget.  I hope someone in Hollywood is paying attention and notices that bigger, faster, and more expensive is not always better.  You notice that this movie bothered to create at least a minimal plot and some character definition?Just wait 10 years when everyone can do high-quality special effects for even cheaper and special effects will stop being able to sell a movie on their own.In all an entertaining movie.  Not profound, but one of the best sci-fi/action movies this year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Good, But Not Great","Like so many out there who frequent cyberspace, I could not wait to see this movie. I was a big fan of Hellboy when it first came out and loved the Wolves of St. August series, shopping around to all my friends in hopes of introducing them to the character. And everything I had heard on the Internet about this film praised it as the Second Coming of comic book films.Sadly, I find it anything BUT.Overall, the movie is by no means a disaster. I have seen worse, and Ron Perlman did an admirable job with the character, even if his make-up was a bit ridiculous looking. Regardless of the overall latex appearance of his bodysuit (which is a bit annoying, since Abe Sapien looked so startling realistic by comparison), he breathed life into the character and made me believe Hellboy was real when he was on screen. I, for one, am glad they used a real actor like him instead of going the CGI route that so many films (like the Hulk) take nowadays.And by my own admission, it has been many years since I read the comic enough to know if the story was taken from the comic book or if it was weaved outside the printed page exclusively for the silver screen.Regardless, it was seriously lacking.The obligatory origin story starts in 1944 as a group of U.S. soldiers and Professor Bruttenholm (later in the film played as an elderly man by John Hurt) drop in on a secret Nazi ceremony performed by Grigori Rasputin in ancient ruins that reminded me of a would-be mod for the videogame Return to Castle Wolfenstein. Rasputin draws upon dark sorcery to open a gate to deep space to bring forth Elder Gods to bring about the Apocalypse, lending an immediate air of Lovecraft to the story.So far, pretty good, and the effects were very well done.But, as luck would have it, our American soldiers manage to thwart the Nazi efforts, and Rasputin is sucked into the void of space and his evil henchpersons Ilsa (how original for a Nazi villainess) and Kronen manage to get away. Professor Bruttenholm is not satisfied that all is well, and an inspection of the site reveals that a young demon from the depths of Hell has found his way to this dark Scottish Isle.This raised a flag in my head, as I thought to myself that if Hellboy was indeed from Hell, as the name would apply, then why did he not come from Hell, but rather the cold, dark void of deep space? From a Lovecraftian Elder God no less. And Hellboy himself looking like no Lovecraftian entity I am aware of. It would have made more sense if they had opened a portal to Hell and the obviously demonic child came from there...but I am looking too deep into the semantics of the film and not suspending my disbelief.Flash forward to the present. Special Agent John Meyers (Rupert Evans) of the FBI is transferred to the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Development (B.P.R.D.) and meets the Elderly Bruttenholm (at this point John Hurt) and the wonderous Abe Sapien (played by Doug Jones and voiced by David Hyde Pierce). While Sapien is not given as much screen time as the hero, Hellboy, he is delightful when he is on screen, and his make-up job was much, much better than Ron Perlman's. Bruttenholm informs Meyers that he was hand picked from a list of candidates to work at the B.P.R.D., and gives him the task of taking care of the star attraction, Hellboy (Ron Perlman).To be fair, Perlman is a tremendous screen presence as Hellboy. He was throughly enjoyable and his delivery of his dialog was flawless. As soon as he came on screen, in my mind's eye he fit the role perfectly. He fleshed out Hellboy better than Hugh Jackman did with Wolverine and ran circles around Tobey Maquire as Spiderman. Just like Patrick Stewart was perfect as Professor X, Perlman nailed Hellboy. No one else could have played that part. It was tailor made for him it seemed.Too bad the rest of the movie fell apart the minute the action started.I won't go too much further into the details of the plot, save that it involved a demonic hell hound named Sammael that was more Lovecraftian than Hellboy could ever hope to be, the ressurected Rasputin and his two henchpersons trying to finish what they started 60 years earlier by bringing about the end of the world, and Hellboy and associates trying to stop them. If CGI is your thing, this movie delivers it in spades. If over the top action is what you crave, you get it. If you like the standard ""Bad Guy wants to destroy the world for some reason, never stopping to thing that some demonic wasteland devoid of ALL life isn't what I would want to rule over, but hey, that's just me"" plotline, this one has it.If you are looking for something deeper in character development or a plot that makes sense, here's hoping Spider Man 2 lives up to the hype of its previews, but I wouldn't hold my breath.To me, it is a blessing and a curse that we live in the times we live in. I am glad I lived long enough to see the realization of a watchable version of Lord of the Rings that didn't make me cringe. I am happy that the X-Men made it to the screen and avoided the straight to video curse of so many other Marvel heroes. I am glad that a small Marvel character like Blade could have a movie that was a pleasant surprise and still entertains me when I watch it. But I am disappointed when we get movies like Hellboy, which could have been so much more with an adaptation of a smaller story like Wolves of St. August than this special effects driven two hour plus drivel that we are saddled with instead.Hopefully, when the inevitable sequel is made, they make the film less a centerpiece for trying to push the bar of special effects and more a character driven story where side characters like Liz Sherman are not wasted for the 15 minutes screen time they have.Overall, I would give this film a sad 6 out of 10. Promising start that becomes an orgy of special effects that sacrfice characters for digital mayhem.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Del Toro and Perlman make magic,"Guillermo Del Toro's two Hellboy films are a wildly different pair, both incredible thrill rides and well worth anyone's time, but I think I will always prefer the first. With the second he took the Pan's Labyrinth approach, presenting a fairy tale world and showcasing makeup effects that were very similar to that film, an esoteric and elemental vibe. There's just something about the Lovecraftian, steam punk WWII aesthetic of the first that works better for me, and seems to fit our red pigmented protagonist a little more. These films would be nothing without the essential and hard won casting of Ron Perlman, though. He brings a lively vitality, hulking physicality (he fits the part even before the prosthetics go on) and lovable sarcasm, and when you see him in action there is really no other actor you could envision bringing this character to life. It's laughable to think that Del Toro fought the studio for years to get Ron in the role, turning down the likes of Vin Diesel and Nic Cage (what oh what were they thinking), not compromising for a second, knowing the film he wanted to make. Well, Ron got cast in the end, as we now know, and he's not so much playing Hellboy, he just is Hellboy, he's that perfect for the role. When he's backed up by Del Toro's near godlike creativity and imagination (the two partner on projects frequently and it's genius every time), you get a piece of comic book escapism as exciting and adventurous as this. Hellboy was the result of a nazi experiment gone wrong, in which certifiable nut job Grigori Rasputin (freaky deaky Karel Roden) and his minions open a portal to a dark universe, in attempt to summon forth anything that could turn the tides of war (not the brightest idea, if you ask me), and instead out crawls infant Hellboy, a cranky crimson imp with a big stone appendage and an attitude to match. Kindly professor Trevor Broom (John Hurt) raises the creature to be a force of good and protection for our world, and soon enough he grows into eight foot tall, wise ass, cigar chomping, asss kicking Ron Perlman, now a valuable and formidable asset to the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, an order that strives to keep the darkness at bay. Joined by his on and off flame Liz Sherman (pun intended, as she's literally a firestarter), Professor Broom, rookie agent Meyers (Rupert Evans) and humanoid swamp thing Abraham Sapien (Doug Jones, dubbed out with David Hyde Pierce), he sets out to shield New York, the planet and the universe from Rasputin, who has returned with notions of finishing the cataclysmic work he started decades ago. The action is propulsive and rousing, initially in NYC streets and subway tunnels, and then in a far off arctic locale where a gateway to some dark dimension opens once more and a suspiciously Cthlhu esque deity of destruction peers out. Del Toro has stated before that he prefers to think of his work as 'eye protein' rather than eye candy. Well, call it what you will, his films are nothing short of dazzling on all levels, and Hellboy is no exception. There's visual splendour in every frame, from the painstaking costumes, makeup and props (Perlman has a great big gun for that great big hand), to the production design and seamless computer wizardry, the world we see on screen is immersive and entertaining for the entire journey. Roden makes a frothing madman out of Rasputin, always nailing the villain when he shows up, and stopping said show here with his theatrical and baroque insanity. My favourite has to be Kroenen though, a sharply dressed, mute nazi assassin with a face only a mother could love and a set of knives you'd be foolish to get in the way of. He's an inspired and truly creepy villain that sets the apocalyptic dial on the highest setting when he shows up. Jeffrey Tambor provides additional comic relief as the long suffering suit who serves as the face of PR for the bureau, and props to Brian Steele as Sammael, a seriously pisssed off demon set loose by Rasputin in the city streets, leading to one blockbuster of an action sequence. As far as comic book films go, this is a gold standard of filmmaking, world building and good old fashioned storytelling, all of which Del Toro is a master at. It wouldn't have been the same without him, without Perlman and especially without the magic that happens when they work together.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

And while it's weird, having finally seen the movie, I think it's far less wrong than things like ""Lucifer"". It works in it's comic book world and it works well. Del Toro does know how to make a fun movie and Ron Perlman is great in his role. Sadly, the movie does suffer from pacing issues and feeling that the characters are constantly doing something not very relevant to the main plot. To use a gaming dictionary, it feels they are constantly doing side quests. That is a shame, because when it comes to action, characters, or anything else for that matter, Hellboy delivers. It even has a good message. And while there are a few last decade cringe scenes, even that is cool in retrospective. It's just sad that it couldn't be much more than just a good movie.

Another great comic book turns into another mediocre movie,"Hollywood has obviously ran out of fresh ideas and so have turned to the comic world for the next big hit. Hopefully they'll soon realize that this is going to get old and move on but, for the time being, I'll keep going to these movies and hoping for a good one among all the crap.Unfortunately, this wasn't it. Though the movie wasn't too bad, it wasn't the best I've seen. The story deviated, the love story was pushed but not believable, the characters shallow, disallowing for emotional attachment. The only salvageable thing here is the OK special effects (even these are at times pushed). This ended with a setup for a sequel.

**1/2 (out of ****),"Guillermo del Toro always has a role in store for Ron Perlman in movies like Blade II and Cronos. The Mexican born director is really trying to put him on the screen more than anyone else would. Perlman never seems to find the right role that will put him in the spotlight and hopefully help him become a bigger star. Finally we see him in a leading role in a movie called ?Hellboy?.  Perlman is Hellboy, a demon who was sheltered by Professor Bruttenholm (John Hurt). He raised him to do good instead of evil. Perlman seems to have fun with his role. His enthusiasm as Hellboy makes the character likeable and fun to watch instead of unpleasant and ugly as it could have been in the hands of another actor, and director.Instantly there is an explanation of how this demon came about. It is WWII at the start of the movie, and the Nazi?s try to open up a portal to the dark side. They have failed their cause. What came out of the portal was ared baby demon who Professor Bruttenholm named Hellboy. Cut to the present time where Hellboy is now all grown up, and he is fighting everyday to protect human kind. His appearance is very human like. He has two arms, two legs, and a body. He has horns, which he had filed down to a very low length to fit in with the human crowd. Lastly he speaks fluent English.Hellboy is not just some tough demon that wants to do nothing but kill every monster that crosses him; he has quite a bit of tenderness in him. He is in love with a paranormal named Liz Sherman (Selma Blair). He also has a since of humor. His one-liners are cheesy and laughable, but it?s fun and appealing. Also, there are some other interesting characters in the movie such as Abe Sapien played by Doug Jones, and voice by David Hyde Pierce. This human like creature is able to swim and breathe in the water. He?s able to breath out of the water with a device that helps him. There is also one character that can do some cool moves with sharp objects. There is a lot to like about this movie. The special effects are top notch. The images jump right off the screen. The monsters look amazing. The Hellboy character looks great. The action scenes are well made. The laughs are right on point. The story line just isn?t easy to follow. I was scratching my head at some points. Why would the Nazi?s want the apocalypse? It just didn?t make since to me. Maybe I?m just slow, and closed-minded. I can?t find it in my heart to recommend this movie. Even though I had mostly good things to say about it. The implausible story line just took away from everything that was good about it. I definitely would like to see a sequel. Hellboy is an interesting character, and I want to see more of him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Look Beyond the DVD Box and Give This Movie a Chance!,"I have not seen this movie until months after it was released on video. It was one of those snowy nights where you just wanted to stay in and see a movie. After a coin toss, the favor fell with Hellboy. Turns out fate was pointing me in the right direction. This movie was a real thriller and served as great entertainment for its entire running time. The cast consists of relatively unknown actors to the average viewer. However this does not hinder the outcome of the film. When it comes right down to it, the budget would probably not allow for such a big name cast anyways because of the CGI and expensive sets. The movie moves at a great pace, and contains large doses of humor, mystery and violence. The last thing the viewer should do is criticize the film for being unrealistic. First off its a movie based on a comic book, second its not meant to tug at any heart strings and win any awards. This reasons compile to suggest that critics bite there tongues before talking crap about the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Horrible,"I can't describe how much this movie ticks me off. One thingthat ticks me off the most are the HORRIBLE one-liners.

They could have done a better job and not have used Sin from Final Fantasy X. Are we really supposed to believe that a giant squid looking creature is going to reign the apocalypse down on us and bring death and destruction to Earth? I am baffled at how this movie is a success. Movies now have to focus on special effects to get the point across instead of good writing. If you want to see a good movie, go rent The Shawshank Redemption, no special effects, great acting, great ending.

I certainly did enjoy Hellboy, and don't regret the price of admission... however, I don't expect I'll buy it on DVD.In its favor is Ron Perlman, as expected, who puts up a flawless performance in his role.  Also, a plot that only tells you the absolute basics keeps things moving at a pace too fast to leave you yawning.  Working against it is the performance of other actors.. most notably Selma Blair, who simply offended me in her presentation of some of her lines.  Did she shoot up tranquilizers before the filming?  Also, Del Toro takes absolutely no shot at achieving depth for the story.. making it all like a sort of long cartoon.

A nice dose of fun.,"Ron Perlman of course makes this movie great and the special effects are excellent but the ending is quite muddled. Perlman has always been good in every movie he has been in so i knew if this sucked it wouldn't be his fault. I found the main monsters in this looking like something out of Men In Black so i wasn't too impressed by their design but how the government can possibly cover-up Hellboy after the fight in the subway is beyond me. An out of focus picture is one thing but sheesh! That Nazi guy with the blades was cool and i liked that helpful zombie near the end, very funny.

Weird for the sake of Wit,"Going into Hellboy, I was thinking probably like anyone in the audience who wasn't familiar with he comic book: it's going to weird for the sake of weird with plenty of multicolored goo. And you know what, Hellboy didn't disappoint. I got all the goo I could ask for as well enough weird to make me forget exactly where I was.It's definitely a new approach to the comic book superhero, HB smokes, drinks and curses and I wouldn't have it any other way. I mean seriously, it would be just plain wrong to have a demon who always plays nice with others. He's straight out of Hell, from a Nazi vortex straight to the big screen for your viewing pleasure. Plus he's not without wit some great sarcastic and cynical wit. I laughed aloud when he wasn't quite able to ""Superman"" from one building to the next only to end up getting love advice from a nine year old.Story: demon is sucked out of Hell (or outer space, whatever) to be used by Nazis for world destruction, allies recover him and Professor Broom brings him up as a semi-good-guy with a craving for Baby Ruths. John Myers, our cute and innocent FBI agent, has the honor of becoming Hellboy's new escort. They get to work quickly, some museum has been broken into and the security has been devoured. Blah blah blah blah blah, fight in subway, funny line here, witty line there, it's all good.However, there is no real doubt that Hellboy can pull off the save the world thing, and he makes the BIG choice in about a 30 second argument and a yawning conclusion that is visually disgusting (or beautiful, whatever).7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

A blend that didn't work out,"There is a saying in the comic book community that you can't go wrong with a good Hellboy book. I've also often times heard that you can't go wrong with a Del Torro movie. On a objective and personal level, I find both statements to be true.But here is the deal: This Del Torro movie is a bad Hellboy story, which tries to turn the character into a superhero. And, stated plainly, it doesn't work.Del Torro works best when he can provide creepy atmospheres and rich plot; when he can tell a story, which provokes many questions, even at the price of pacing.His visual flare has been brought into Hellboy, but instead of picking up on the series' amazing cultural and mythological roots, they picked to focus on the action.Despite what most people think, Hellboy isn't really as much about action. It's about other stuff, that you naturally ""get"" while reading the books. And it's really good.None of the slow burn drama, brimming with lore and opportunities to showcase awesome monsters and creative banter, is present in this movie. Instead, Hellboy is just downscaled to a teenage smartass who is tough to kill.TL;DR - Hellboy is about more than that and Del Torro would be perfectly capable of showing it. But he wasn't able to, for some reason, which makes the movie disappointing.As a movie, on it's own, it gets the job done and can very well entertain an audience from kids to adults for its runtime. But it's neither faithful to the source material, nor does it showcase the best that Del Torro is capable of doing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"Ron Perlman is perfect, the movie is not!","Ron Perlman delivers a great performance as Hellboy, so it's a shame this movie is average at best.It's got loads of CGI effects but very little else. Parts of the movie just annoyed me, take for example when the young FBI agent gets to see his first mutant, why is he not shocked??Overall I enjoyed it more than Daredevil & Hulk  but thats not saying much as this was just another case of Style over Substance in the latest of superhero cash-ins.I'd probably give it about... 5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Funny, entertain and that's it","There is always a problem when I try to talk about this film, and that is the fact that I haven't read any of the Hellboy comic books so I don't know the changes made in adaptation or the real dimension of the characters that this movie surely didn't get in just one film.Anyway, this movie was funny, entertain and that's it, the previous movie that I saw in my country was I Robot, and that one really sucks, so I think that helped giving me some disposition and the mood to watch Hellboy and actually enjoy it. In comparison Hellboy at least get some jokes right which poor Will Smith didn't.I think Guillermo del Toro was pretty low in budget because the monsters were always the same, no more money for that modeling and computer animation, so it was require that the storyline get stuck in a constant repetition of a fight scene with the same Hellboy and the same resurrected fella in different locations.The characters were enjoyable, I think Ron Perlman is a wasted actor that actually has made something with The city of Lost Children and Cronos, the last one with Guillermo. Selma Blair and everyone else was plain good.All the problems in this movie really reside in the plot holes, especially near the end, Hellboy thriumps in a way too absurd and too easy for us to care and applaud him, despite that I think anyone has a standart possibility to be entertain and not end angry and mislead like I felt with that I Robot turkey.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Actually kind of fun and adventurous,"So, Hellboy, another comic book I never heard of, figured I would never get into it if I didn't know the story, so I stayed clear of the film, but I was renting movies and came across it and figured to just see what it was about. I watched Hellboy yesterday and this was definitely a fun film, it's so rare that we get the dark comic book story like Batman, except we have Hellboy, supernatural and dark, nice combo. Hellboy packs plenty of action and cool effects with an awesome story and a new anti hero to root for. It's so cool and ironic that we are rooting for a half man and half devil to save the world, right? Hellboy is an awesome hero with the super strength, great fighting skills, and best of all, gotta love the last cool pun lines when he saves the day.In 1944, Professor Trevor Bruttenholm goes to Germany to stop a Nazi troop who are ready to open the gates of Hell. The Americans are able to stop the troop, but Trevor finds a creature, half man, half devil, he calls him Hellboy. Years later Hellboy is being used by the government to help the city out with super natural forces. But when Grigori Rasputin wishes to open the gate once more, he needs Hellboy to do so. In the mean time, Hellboy is fighting for the city and the woman he loves, Liz, and will not fall for Grigori Rasputin's tricks.Hellboy is definitely a fun film to watch and it's a great comic book film. The only complaint I have about the film is just that the effects, as great as they were, there was still some very CGI moments and they were not believable. But I loved Abe Sapien, the special effects on him were beautiful and looked very real. I would recommend Hellboy for the comic book fans or even if you're looking for a dark super hero film other than Batman or The Crow. This is a fun movie and I'm looking forward to the sequel.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Fairly solid,"A demon is found back in WW2-era England by some serviceman after some Nazi's conjure it up. Stricken with the rather unfortunate name of Hellboy, the demon grows up under the strict supervision of the American government, with other people with abnormalities. Now evil Rasputin is back to finish the job he had started back in the day and it's up to Hellboy, his new handler John Myers,(Rupert Evans) and his love and fellow freak Liz (Selma Blair) to put a stop to that. This was a pretty enjoyable film. Kind of like ""Indiana Jones"" meets ""X-Files"". Ron Perlman does a good job with the loner, wisecracking persona of Hellboy. Selma Blair, while not the ""traditional"" connotation of the word beauty, still has something about her that oozes sexiness.

endearing comic book adaptation,"Based on the works of Mike Mignola, ""Hellboy,"" written and directed by Guillermo Del Toro, is a better-than-average comic book adaptation that boasts a refreshing sense of humor amid all the customary action sequences and first-rate special effects. The story begins in 1944, near the end of World War II, with the Nazis attempting to open a portal between earth and a hell-like dimension where seven evil deities have been lying in wait for just such an opportunity to come in and take over the world. One creature from the other side makes it through before the Nazis' scheme is thwarted, a young ""boy"" who is adopted by an American expert in the paranormal and groomed to become a superhero who can do battle with all the supernatural creatures who apparently exist in an abundance undreamed of by the vast majority of the human race.The makers of the film have wisely chosen to keep Hellboy life-sized and believable in both his physical and psychological dimensions. Despite his red skin, stone right hand and ability to leap from rooftop to rooftop with gravity-defying ease, Hellboy is really just an Average Joe-type, with a bit of an ego, a sardonic sense of humor, a strong sense of loyalty, and a really good heart. Heck, he even has problems in the romance department not much different from what all the rest of us go through at one time or another in our lives.The movie is overlong and the screenplay probably includes one or two monsters more than it needs to in order to get the job done, but Ron Perlman, even under all the heavy makeup, makes Hellboy a three-dimensional, sympathetic character, while John Hurt brings warmth and authority to the role of Professor Bruttenholm, the ""father figure"" who raises him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good start to a New Franchise?,"Enjoyable romp with, in this case, the forces of not completely good fighting the forces of very definitely evil. Good performances from all. Nice to see Ron Perlman who is not classically good looking taking the lead - yeah for the different looking guy! There tends to be a bit more characterisation in this film because it is the beginning of a potential franchise although there is still plenty of action. Lots of wriggly thingys getting their comeuppance! Just when you thought it was safe to back in the subway! Good throwaway comments and one liners lighten the movie.

An Honest Review,"It is a lot of fun, it has a sense of humor...it is flawed.Hellboy is one of those movies that seems to suffer from a lack of elaboration. There are elements in the films that are beyond interesting, things that we as an audience would like to see more of, things that we would like to know more about.Unfortunately the film never goes into it and that is possibly because there was never an intent to turn Hellboy into an out and out franchise. Because of that the mythology that the movie hints at is only given a lip service and it is done to move the plot along.It is a shame. It touches enough on it's own little mythology that it could have been an X-Files style franchise with a superhero.Instead of that you get an entertaining movie and really little more. The elements are there but they had to move along.What remains is a fun film with a good sense of humor, an action movie that took a bit of time to develop a few characters and make sure to give the others a real personality.It is not bad, but it is frustrating watching it, no matter how fun it is, because you know what could have been.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"It's Fun and Unique, But Just Doesn't Cut It","Let's face it, the 21st century is the year of movies based on famous comics, like Spiderman, The Hulk, X-Men, The Punisher and then there's Hellboy, which takes a different approach from what you may expect out of it. Hellboy's mood is darker than movies like Spiderman and The Hulk and attempts to be a bit more than just a typical action movie with a plot that's supposed to be interesting. While I appreciate and admire how the movie tried to be an interesting and different kind of movie there's one problem, the attempt backfires. The plot in the movie is good, but the movie presents it in a sloppy way, sometimes as if it were a sequel and most of the time the moments that try to let the audience develop a connection are screwed up by an awkward mood in those moments that make the movie seem as if it can't decide between certain ways to present itself. This is Hellboy's major downfall and makes it a less recommendable movie. But with that aside Hellboy is a pretty enjoyable movie and at times fun to watch. Ron Perlman makes a great Hellboy, he makes the big red demon-like creature that Hellboy is the most lovable character in the movie. The other performers in the movie don't do that great, with the exception of Hellboy's ""father"" and the main villain who looks similar to Rob Halford with a facelift. The action in this movie isn't used too much until the end but all of it is satisfying for the most part. As for the plot, while it is at least interesting, it just isn't as good as I'd have liked to be.

The Moose Hole - Review of Hellboy,"Here's come another one  another feature film adaptation of a classic comic book series. Ever since the comic book genre was revitalized by X-Men in 2000 and elevated to escalating popularity thanks to Spider-Man in 2003, it has been the top priority of every major movie studio in Hollywood to jump on the latest band wagon and grab a comic book franchise in which to roll several features, if at all possible. Granted that most of the major comic book series have been picked up and the only ones left are the less well-known franchises, but aren't the filmmakers that choose these projects all the more braver then those with the so-called `sure-fire' hits? Guillermo del Toro hasn't clearly shown that after taking the directing reins in the already hot Blade film franchise for Blade II, which managed successful to out-gross the original, but now he really gets to show how brave of a filmmaker he is with a project he's been working on for nearly six years. After shopping the experimental project around for quite some time, del Toro will now have the shot to bring the cult-classic to life but whether or not his hard work will pay off is still in the air.The story follows a young devil brought to Earth through a pagan ritual and saved by the United States Army on his journey to grow up and become a man. Nearly sixty years ago, the Nazis, in a last ditch effort to win the war against the Allied Powers, stage a cult experiment to unleash the seven gods of Chaos and destroy the world, all being led by the mysterious Grigori Rasputin. But when the United States Army intervenes, the lurid experiment goes awry and, as a result, tares the child of Satan, later named Hellboy, from his home. After he is adopted by Professor Bruttenholm, Hellboy is brought up as a force of good, rather then evil, working for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, protecting the world from all supernatural forces that may threaten it. His latest mission brings him in touch with the Nazi cult followers that brought him into the world sixty years ago, only this time they are adamantly determined to finish the job they started, which includes using Hellboy to fulfill his true purpose  unleashing the seven gods of Chaos and bringing about the end of the world. The story for Hellboy, as confusing and outlandish as it may seem, was surprisingly quite interesting but is definitely one that requires not necessarily a true understanding of the comic book series it is based on but an awareness of historical figures that the feature presents, as well as the legends surrounding those characters. If you go into this film without at least a reasonable sense of what is going on, you're not going to understand one solitary thing within this film. In that case, don't bother going at all  you're just going to waste your money.Unlike other comic book adaptations, Hellboy does not feature a whole lot of A-list talent but none-the-less features one of the most impressive casts this year, despite several flaws that become evident as the feature progresses. Ron Perlman is Hellboy, no ifs, ands, or buts about it! Perlman was apparently the major requirement by Guillermo del Toro when he shopped around the project and was one of the major setbacks for the project as well with the studios wanting someone more famous to play the red hero. Fortunately for movie-goers, del Toro stuck to his guns and showcases a real eye for talent with Perlman's marvelous performance. John Hurt, who portrays Professor Bruttenholm, gives a delightful performance of a character that cares dearly for his adopted son but knows clearly that his time on Earth is running out. You can't help but have a tear in your eye during his final scene in the film. There were few problems with the cast but the ones that were contrary to the rest were quite evident, this included Jeffrey Tambor and Karel Roden. It wasn't necessarily their performances but the characters themselves. Tambor plays some-what of an adversary to Hellboy in the course but you never exactly get an idea why this is. Perhaps he's the typical `uptight governmental agent who fears people different from him and therefore looks unkindly toward freaks' like Hellboy'  in that case, this just makes the character rather a lame addition to the overall story. And Roden as Rasputin? You just don't see enough of him to care or clearly grasp what he's doing in the film or trying to achieve.Overall, Hellboy lands up in purgatory, it is neither a hit nor a miss, not necessarily leaving you clamoring to see it again nor is it a feature that you would detest repeating, if it were presented to you. What it does leave you with is the feeling of wanting to know what the Hell (no pun intended) was going on and how it all makes sense, one way or another  a thing del Toro never clearly demonstrates in this film. First off, the feature, though only lasting a little over two hours, feels a lot longer then it actually is especially with several seemingly endless chase scenes. Secondly, it felt as though too much was being crammed into one film and might have been better split up but with enough problems getting this first one made it is understandable why del Toro might have getting a sequel. Third, there were several prominent instances where it felt as though the over-the-topness of the film was too much, including the scenes with Kroenen waving his swords around like that guy from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Many were expecting someone to pull a gun out, shoot the Nazi SOB, and move on from there but that never came about. And finally, concerning Kroenan, how does that work out? The man (figuring he is even human) is mostly dust but continues to do the things he does over a nearly sixty year time span  how is that possible? What keeps him, supposedly, alive? And what makes the last scene with him seem like the end of his character? Guess that's asking too much. Hellboy, in the end, becomes a comic-book fanatic's dream but the for the rest it leaves them confused.My Rating: *** ½ out of 5 (Grade: C+)",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Anti-climactic Ending Ruins It.,"I looked forward to seeing this flick, ever since the trailer ended with the giant squid like creature grabbing Hellboy after proclaiming ""How Big Can It Be"". That really had 'bad-ass' written all over it. I never went to the theatre though and had to wait for DVD. After seeing the flick I can tell you it's not my favourite comic book adaptation, but it is a decent one.Never reading the Hellboy comics I did not know what I was getting myself into, but the film looked like it was going to do one thing and that was entertain me. The problem I had with it was that it wasn't entertaining enough. It had all the right ingredients, it just didn't mix well. What I got was a pretty average flick with a sub-plot that I did not really care for.Perlman is in his zone with this character and even though he is under heavy make-up, I can't really see anyone else pulling this off the way he does. The right amount of comedic touch adds an odd layer to this demonic looking creature.The rest of the supporting cast didn't do much for me. I didn't care if the young agent died or not and Selma Blair was just too depressed for me to want to like her.The special effects were good and interacted well with the characters. Even though most were over the top, this is a comic book film after all. So I let it slide.Finally, it wasn't climatic enough. Remember when I told you how 'bad-ass' that end part of the trailer was with the giant squid. Well, I was prepped for an epic showdown and was let down by a 10 second fight. That really put me in a bad funk and when you're ending a film, you want your audience to feel good. Shame on you Hellboy, shame.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
One of my favorite fantasy superhero movies.,"Many people out there might not like the idea of a demon being the film's protagonist. Now name him Hellboy and you'll have conservative Christians in a frenzy!As for me, I thought this was a unique idea to have a character that looked like an antagonist, be the film's hero. Add a fantastic production design, stunning visuals, incredible action sequences, characters I cared about, and an unlikely yet emotional father/son back story, and you have a hell of an entertaining movie!'Hellboy' is exactly that. This is a film that perfectly blends several genres (even comedy and horror) into a high octane fantasy action film that delivers on every level. Ron Perlman is perfectly cast as Hellboy. (I somehow believe the film would not have worked so well without him in the lead). The rest of the cast are also very good, and believable in their respective roles.Here's the story: In 1944, during a failed attempt to awaken the Seven Gods of Chaos and bring them to Earth to wreak havoc, Hellboy enters our world through the open porthole. Years later, he helps the FBI fight crime. Agent John Myers (Rupert Evans) is handpicked by Professor Broom (John Hurt) to be Hellboy's new liason. An odd team at first, it was endearing to see how they became almost inseparable. Then there's the love of Hellboy's life: Elizabeth (Selma Blair), a firestarter. The antagonist is Rasputin - the man responsible for opening the porthole, and is very well portrayed by Czechoslovakian actor Karel Roden.'Hellboy' is non-stop action and entertainment.

It's not just his looks, but the way he can say the corniest dialog with utter sincerity and conviction. Selma Blair is also well-cast, with her perpetually depressed eyes and understated delivery.The monster fights are great at first, but once you've seen one, you don't need to see it three more times, especially with the same monster. The plot is pretty standard heroes n' villains stuff, with the twist being that the main hero is an apocolyptic demon from hell who loved kittens and eats stacks of pancakes that would gag Louie Anderson.Yes, it all sounds so corny, but I was drawn in because the actors and the script didn't take for granted that I was just another drooling fanboy.

The comic relief and sarcasm are especially well-done by Perlman in a good performance. Few films deal with such a heavy weight subject like Satan and do it to such a good effect. The effect of this is not offensive toward the religious.

"Second date, no tongue!","The movie begins in 1944 Scotland with American soldiers accompanied by a bookish, bespectacled Professor Broom, psychic adviser to President Roosevelt. There, they find a small contingent of Nazis, the most enduring of villains and a remarkably spry-looking Rasputin attempting to open a portal to another dimension. The occult interests of Adolph Hitler never got much attention at the time, but in recent years at least it's made for some new twists on the tired old villains.Anyway, the good guys ruin the party for the Nazis, knocking Rasputin through the dimensional hole, but not before a demon baby comes through the portal. It's coaxed down with a Baby Ruth candy bar and, like a wolf pup adopted by humans, becomes tame. Fast forward a few years. The demon is now an adult has a fondness for cats and cigars has filed his horns down to almost nothing in an attempt to be a regular guy and works for elderly Professor Broom in the Bureau for Paranormal Research.Broom is dying of cancer and knows it. He's brought in a replacement/successor, John Myers. Myers gets a tour of the place, where he meets Hellboy and Abe Sapien, a telepathic fish-man who likes to eat rotten eggs. While Broom is an old man, his old enemies haven't aged a day. Escaped Nazi Ilsa and a robotic character named Kroenen perform a ceremony to bring back Rasputin from the other side, looking none the worse for wear, and the fight is back on.My nits are minor things. In the end, the film is carried to its fun but entirely predictable conclusion by the strength of Del Toro's excellent direction and Perlman's total embodiment of the character. It also seems like I've seen this movie so many times before. But seeing as though it is a comic book flick, what can you expect. Really? The movie is nothing special, but it's better than some comic movies out there today. Not great, but certainly not bad either.***/*****",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
He's fireproof; you're not.,"The prevailing problem with 'Hellboy (2004)' is that it feels the need to over-explain everything that happens. Whenever something even remotely strange - or, indeed, story-related - occurs, someone will surely say something expository to 'take its edge off'. This, of course, becomes grating after just a short while, especially when most of what's explained is shown on-screen as plain as day and doesn't really need any further analysis. It's a mentality that leads to the piece's other main problem: John Myers. He's the audience's surrogate, supposedly used to ease us into this supernatural world, but he's not really the protagonist that the picture really wants him to be. That's because most of the movie is torn between him and Hellboy, leading to an odd 'back-and-forth' pacing that makes sure neither of them get the screen-time or development they deserve. On top of this, he doesn't really serve his purpose, anyway; his rookie status affords the film a 'free pass' when it comes to blatant exposition, but most of it isn't even delivered via this method. It's weird that he was felt to be necessary as the incredibly long prologue does a decent job of introducing you to the narrative's supernatural elements, as well as its overall tone and, even, Hellboy himself (who's then strangely hidden in his adult form for quite some time). Myers isn't a bad character but he doesn't do anything, really, other than take time away from the more interesting ones. Despite the picture's generally messy nature, it's still a solid effort. One of the main positives that pops out straight away is its special effects prowess. The make-up on both Perlman and (a criminally underused) Jones truly is terrific. Apparently the only parts of the former that are actually visible are his eyelids (even his eyes are covered by demonically yellow contact lenses) and the latter is pretty much completely lost under a layer of impressive prosthetics. In both cases, however, the performances shine through. The piece's practical effects are matched pretty much perfectly with their computer-created counterparts. Of course, some of the completely CGI stuff looks a little rusty on retrospection - especially when the remotely-controlled and quite cumbersome 'right hand of doom' gets a more dexterous digital double - but a lot of it - most of it, even - holds up surprisingly well. The completely digital doubles often look good, which is especially rare, but the flick finds a brilliant balance between the 'real' and the rendered, to the point where the two are difficult to differentiate during some select shots. Another of the movie's highlights, in usual Del Toro fashion, is the way in which the monsters are brought to life with such care and attention. They're treated like proper characters rather than side-shows. Hellboy is, for all intents and purposes, a human, a flawed individual trying to do right by those he loves and deal with his unfair, essentially race-based ostracism. If that isn't relatable, I don't know what is. At its heart, it's a story about a group of outcasts sticking together, relenting against their unfair judgement and - in some cases - initially destructive nature. That's the most interesting stuff but it isn't capitalised on all that well. The feature is messy, as I mentioned, and has about five climaxes but no real denouement. Every line of dialogue also sounds 'monumental', if you will, in that early 2000s way where everything has to sound 'cool'. I wish that someone would say something 'normal', as that would help normalise the strange situations (most of) our characters are supposed to find ordinary and add to a sense of 'realism' - or, at least, help ground the story in a more tangible world. In the end, I feel that the movie manages to overcome most of its issues, even if they definitely impact its overall effect. It's enjoyable but not always as engaging as you'd expect. Still, as I said, it's a solid effort. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Barely made it past first 30mins.,"I have never seen a more ridiculous movie in my entire life. The acting was horrible and the plot summary was even worse. Was this just an outlet for the writers to show as many monsters and plot twists as possible?(no matter how far fetched each twist is), if it was then i assure you they achieved this goal. Rather than focusing on the character development of ""hellboy"" and his story it seemed to either fail at that or purposely shy away from it. The attempt to make this movie as action packed as possible was an epic failure the action scenes seemed forced at times and sometimes lasted longer than necessary.In summary i am unaware as to why this movie firstly was released into cinemas and secondly was given the go ahead to make a second? This was by far the worst movie i have ever seen the amazing Selma Blair take part of and definitely sheds a very dim light on her acting career.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Dark and stylish Superhero movie, good Ron Perlman","'Hellboy' is an entertaining superhero movie directed with style by Guillermo del Toro. Unlike Superman and Spiderman, Hellboy is a dark superhero with a surprisingly demonic origin. The film is slick and well-paced and there are plenty of VFX. The production design is imaginative and the Special Effects achieve a lot on a limited budget. Ron Perlman has some terrific one-liners as our sarcastic superhero. Everyone else is adequate. However, I was disappointed in Rasputin (Karel Roden). He should have been a more menacing character. A solidly entertaining watch.Overall 7/10",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"come on, have fun with it! :D","this movie was fun, pure and simple.  It was certainly more family friendly than the blade films, and more entertaining to boot.  I'd never read the comics, but it did a good job introducing me to the world and caring about the characters.  A good summer flick or popcorn muncher, and for once I actually liked the performance and execution of the heroes better than the baddies!  The special effects were very decent, and the action was well mixed withe the serious moments and the humorous ones.  Maybe a little confusing for those of us who don't normally care for demon/occultist fare, but it has a more classic gunslinger/spy feel to it, especially in the music, and that I believe will help define it as a classic for years. Props on a good comic movie!  This is how they SHOULD be done!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Fun, original and glossy - but flawed","Hellboy has an absolutely brilliant premise and the opening sequence pays dividends towards it.  This part of the film - the set-up - is most definitely its strongest aspect.  Its very dark and brooding, and the direction I wish the film had taken more strongly.We are, after all, talking about a demon in a human world.Ron ""Naughty Nick Nolte"" Perlman manages to play the role of the lead character with enough self-mockery and charisma to not appear like a big red gimp, but the script does not allow the character to be truely Demonic unless you count appearance; he's like atrouble teenager, not pure evil being told what to do.  If a sequel is made it would be great to see original confusions and struggles with the character (not just grafting adolescence onto the body of a red bull can).Sorry - the make up is brilliant!The best charcter is the Nazi assassin - he should most deffo been left to live for the sequel.Lovely action scenes and some cracking SFX; its got so much more to give though and could be as rewarding as 'The Crow', if it tried just a bit harder to not shovell more and more popcorn fodder at us.5-6 out of 10.

That's Hellman to  You,"Hellboy: 10/10: Hellboy is one of the three best comic book adaptations of the last ten years. Now considering the recent spate of mediocre comic book adaptations this is a bit like winning a beauty contest at a fat farm. Hellboy is simply head and shoulders above those.It is on par with the recent Spiderman movies (Hellboy sports a better hero and better CGI effects while Spiderman takes the nod in the love interest and villains categories) better than the X-men films and simply puts other comic book adaptations to shame (League of Extraordinary Gentleman should be particularly embarrassed)Hellboy starts with a rip-off of one of the last scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark and introduces such horrible clichéd villains as Nazi babe and Rasputin. Yet the scene works. Director Guillermo del Toro nails a comic book style to the direction that keeps the action and humor going during the most implausible circumstances. Another kudos is in order for the special effects, both make-up (which is spot on) and CGI. Now I seem to hate most CGI effects.Many a big-budget Hollywood film has come out recently with horrible special effects that stick out despite 50 million plus budgets. Hellboy's effects are simply seamless where one forgets that entire characters and locations are digitally generated. The acting is also seamless with lead Ron Perlman giving a scene stealing cigar chomping performance that rivals Daniel Day Lewis's turn in Gangs of New York and Jeffrey Tambor turning a stock cliché (obstructionist bureaucrat who wants to shut everything down) into a humanistic sympathetic character. (This is also an example of very smart writing that makes even the clichéd characters into three-dimensional figures.)While all is not perfect (In addition to Nazi Chick and Rasputin we also have a Clock/Sand Nazi and a Space Cthulhu as an improbable villains) Hellboy is better than an action movie should be, much better than a comic book adaptation ought to be, and immeasurable better than a movie called Hellboy deserves to be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"An entertaining, funny dark film","I was not familiar with Hellboy before watching this film. I reckon I knew he came from comic books, but that was all about it. I found this film to be quite good, a nice mixture of action, humor and darkness with excellent special effects. I just re-watch it and it definitely reassured the fact that this is infinitely better than the sequel, which lost all sense of gloom and simply repeated bad jokes and added non Hellboy related stuff (elves, etc). It's hard to see why people would consider Hellboy worse than Hellboy 2 but, then again, you just have to look at the world today to realize how messed up common sense and opinions are. That's my rant for today. Alas, a very watchable film if you are into sci-fi/fantasy/action. Also recommended for the common folk who enjoys his/her popcorn.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

exciting comic book action,"Hellboy was another movie based off of a comic book, and like all protects seem to be doing, it tried to stray from the normal fare.  Well, I think in some ways it did and some it didn't, but if you look at the material it's hard to not do it like that and stay true to the original story and characters.  I enjoyed Hellboy, for it's characterization.  Hellboy and Abe and Liz were all unique and very interesting.  Just casting a smaller actor like Ron Perlman makes this movie intriguing because it's a new face and he brought a lot of warmth and dulled down humor that made this movie stand out.  The action was good and all the heroes were highlighted, but not as gods or unbeatable people which makes them more personable.  The father-son conflict was another good twist and the romance between Hellboy and Liz helps a movie that has a good story and good effects not become a cliched comic book movie.  There was also that theme we saw in X-Men, with outcasts of society and how there's that unity even between people who may be excluded or live in loneliness.  And the relationship with Hellboy and his father brought it back to every man, woman and child's level again, because it's a concept anyone can relate to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Finally...a Good Comic Book Movie,"With all the hype of turning comic book heroes into big screen heroes, one would assume that the majority of these movies would be, at the very least, decent. However, this is not the case. In fact, other than X-Men and LXG, I can't think of any other spectacular comic book movies. Spiderman and Hulk were total letdowns, as were the sequels to Blade and The Matrix. Daredevil was decent, but Ben Affleck really gave that one its suck factor. Well, movie goers, never fear because Hellboy is here. From Guillermo del Toro, the director of the terrible Blade II, comes the greatest comic book movie since X2. This movie has the one thing that the majority of the other comic book movies lack -- action! It also has another element missing from most comic book movies -- a storyline. The first fifteen minutes or so tell you the story of how Hellboy came to exist. That's it...fifteen minutes. Not thirty or forty like other comic book movies have done -- Spiderman, Hulk, Matrix. Fifteen minutes and you know all you need to know about how Hellboy came to be. After that, it's all action. Ron Perlman does a spectacular job portraying the lead role, and the supporting cast does a wonderful job of backing him up. This is a great movie.9*",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Pointless,"At best, ""Hellboy"" is somewhat, but not very, enjoyable; the creature designs, practical effects, make-up and visuals (minus the terrible CGI) are all impressive. The action sequences, however, are poorly orchestrated, and never implement a real sense of suspense or incite excitement, especially when they rely heavily on Perlman's delivery of one liners to a monster he fights over and over again, just in different settings.Looking for a plot? Well, how about a monster fight instead? Would you like that?! The story we're meant to follow is extremely vague, so much so that the film just feels like a mish-mash of scenes, especially with the flawed pacing. Despite the painfully obvious exposition at times in the dialogue, there is actually little to no explanation behind the events of the movie, little motives behind characters and antagonists. Everything seems so underdeveloped that it is difficult to see what this film is getting at. It's like a 9 yr old trying to give advice, you know? Numerous moments require a great deal of suspension of disbelief and these moments are just too hard to overlook.The tone of the film is quite varied too; just when the film quietens down and is serious, we think we may finally get to learn something about the characters and come to appreciate them but we are then thrown back into the extremely ambiguous plot or into another fight scene and too many of these moments come across as corny, largely due to the fact that we have no idea what is going on and what exactly to think of the characters as, as I have mentioned above, the lack of development makes it difficult to care for what is occurring on screen.Perhaps back in 2004, when this film was first released, it was appreciated and I could just about see why but 11 years later and it really does not seem to hold up. I find the current rating on IMDb to be very misleading. The ratings for its sequel, which I have yet to view, are significantly higher but I hope the scores are more representative. I really wish I could get my 2 hours back watching this film.""Hellboy"" is undeniably as pointless as Hellboy's horns. Don't waste your time with this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

He's a father figure that holds things together.The plot is suitably dark, with some genuinely grim villains, including a sort of zombified Nazi with a self-mutilation complex.

Comic Book Movies are still wonderful.,"I love comic book based movies.They are awesome and wonderful escapism.Mythology luring on the screen and beyond those stories is something left for us to think. One of my all time favourite comic book movies include Spider-Man 2,Batman Begins,X-men and many more.The only comic books I've ever read are Spider-Man,Phatom,Batman Begins, Justic League.I'm familiar with most of the comic book characters from watching the animated series.I loved to watch those Animated series featuring my favourite characters.X-men to Batman to Superman and Spider-Man and etc.They are highly creative and fascinating dramas,based on the Characters driven from a comic strip.ButI only started reading comic books after I watched this film.I never even heard this Character before,until I watched the film.I never thought this film deserved a review or to be commented when I first saw it but now watching it a few more times,I found it really something different.Right after this I started to get my self familiar with the roots of these Superheroes and the very place they originated.Comic books are more than just Hand Drawn entertainment,or storyboard if you can say that.They grow beyond our imagination and beyond those pages.Those characters have such a definite description of themselves that you can simply relate to their situations emotionally and otherwise.Spider-Man for example,in the sequel there are various issues that teenagers come across,and there no other way to deal with that than watching how Peter Parker,despite having all those heavy burdens and pressures and troubles decides in the end to continue his path as a superhero,because he never gave up.And I think that really relates to every teen out there,including me.X-Men movies/Comic books can definitely relate to those people who fear of being neglected because of their diversity and their different background and how the world hates them.Here in the movies and especially in the Comics they give you a definite thought that just because you're different doesn't mean you don't deserve equality and this really elevates these movies.And here comes Hellboy.A fascinating Fantasy Action Adventure that looks so unique and outstanding that it's hard to compare it with other films.This is one of the better Comic Book characters brought to screen,unlike the mediocre Punisher and Fantastic 4.The makeup,the Sets, the looks and Characters are perfect.There so much humour and style here that it makes everything so much fun to watch.Although the plot is disappointing.But the fantastic Script and Ron Perlman as Hellboy makes it up for it.There is enough sizzling action and wonderful Adventure there that keeps the viewers satisfied.ALthough I wouldn't say this is one of the best Comic Book Movies,it certainly is a welcome addition into that genre,and I definitely love the way the Title Character is presented.This has flaws and plot holes,but that never comes into its way from becoming the ultimate fun-house entertainment.It doesn't really stretches your imagination or anything but this is definitely worth a look and I really liked it.I would be honest to say that Superman is my least favourite characters. I like those superhero characters that really could exist in real life.For example Spider-Man,there could be possibility for it to be infected by a spider and become a superhero.Then there is Punisher and Batman,both have no superpowers whatsoever,but they fight crime in a way anyone who thinks he or she should serve justice.Hulk,X-men,Phantom,Fantastic 4 and such.I like Superhero characters that are real but not fantasy based. Superman is a rare possibility and so is Hellboy.And I believe many other characters like these.But nevertheless,they become part of our lives,we worship these characters.We love who they are and we wish to become just like them.This film is none of that,but it is something different and definitely wonderful to look at.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Perlman owns,"""Hellboy"" has its own sort of magic; the product of ideal actor and director bringing to life a character they evidently love. That magic is right there on screen, and even though we've seen some superhero movies over the past 15 years also do this (to an extent), it's uncommon for a movie like this to be made with such adoration.Del Toro's sensibilities fit right in with the paranormal atmosphere, while Ron Perlman brings Hellboy to life as the big red lummox hiding beneath a gruff exterior. This is a world full of freaks and monsters in which it's rather easy to spend two hours. And those freaks have dimension and heart.Not to mention a giant tentacled god.There's no pretense here; I love this movie.

The First Comic book Hero Turned Movie Star the I've Liked,"First let me say that I am not a comic book fan.  I don't even read the Sunday comics.  On the other hand, my husband is/does.  So consequently I have suffered through most of these films for his sake.  I can't say there's a single one that I really enjoyed.  The characters are so two dimensional, as I guess they are suppose to be. But that leaves me cold.  Anyway, it was my husband's birthday so I got him ""Hellboy"" and sat through it.  I was surprised.  I found myself smiling throughout.  I smiled because I enjoyed the one liners.  I smiled because I was touched by Ron Pearlman's wonderful portrayal of Hellboy and I smiled because I loved looking at that sword wielding villain, his fantastic costume design and beautifully choreographed moves.  I smiled because I loved the Amphibian creature with his sideways blinking eyes and his Niles Crane voice and I smiled because they tried to put a message worth thinking about at the end.

Ehhhh...It's okay...,"Not great, not awful. Hellboy is a strangely put together film. It's not really action-y enough to be action. Not dramatic enough for drama. It's a summer movie that's slow and plodding. Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't.The first thing to notice is the art direction. Every room is a masterpiece. Every costume is superb. This is a great, great film to watch for background. Color, lighting, set design are all top notch.Too bad, then, that the script just doesn't live up to their lofty achievements. The post skips nimbly over some rather thin flooring that threatens to become holes any second. The dialogue, too, is rather sketchy. Especially in the beginning. This movie feels like one that had a lot of footage left on the floor.The acting was pretty good, but we don't ever really know anything about the characters. No one has any real development. They just are, and they continue to be throughout the film.This is a film that I would recommend for a day that you are feeling lazy. Don't think too much about it.

"Exciting, Fun and Charasmatic","Ron Perlman shows a great performance in Hellboy. He plays A badass demon captured by Dr. Tom Manning who truly loves him and shows him the ways of good. This movie gives a lesson on acceptance. This is exibited when Hellboy shaves his horns to fit in and the love affair between him and Selma Blair, which shows us that even a creature of his kind could have feelings of that sort. Hellboy is exciting when he kills many villans such as the fish creatures throughout the movie.  He does this using his oversized gun and bullets and his enormous powerful hand that he is born with.  This movie is pretty well rounded and very well casted. I think the movie would be better if they would have concentrated more on the upbringing of Hellboy.

the friendly demon.The down sides are the big plot holes , and the antagonist who isn't really a good match for Hellboy making it hard to know when is the climax of the movie, but I think Hellboy's personality is well reflected in this movie and very simillar to how he is in the comicbooks.

Somewhat of a mixed bag,"What do you get if you mix a 7-foot red demon with a temper, a fish-person, a girl who can set herself on fire, a reincarnated Rasputin, a knife-wielding gas-mask-wearing Nazi and a lot of other nonsense together? The answer is ""Hellboy"", a super-hero movie that tries to set itself apart from the crowd by taking a far more over-the-top approach than most contemporary super hero movies. In spite of the rather silly premise, it actually works. Well, almost.""Hellboy"" starts out very strong, with some great action sequences, an interesting background story, and a good atmosphere. Unfortunately, it doesn't manage to keep up this level of quality towards the end.After the novelty wears off, I quickly found myself becoming a bit bored, due to a number of reasons. First of all, the story really isn't up to much: it's the usually tale of the bad guys trying to bring about the end of the world, and it isn't worked out very well.The characters, with the exception of Hellboy himself, aren't that interesting either. The bad guys are fairly generic and not really frightening, and, despite some efforts to flesh them out, I didn't really care about the good guys either (contrary to, e.g. ""X-Men"", or ""Spiderman""). The fact that Hellboy is just about completely invulnerable no matter what happens also doesn't help, as it kills much of the suspense.The action sequences in the start of the movie are very over-the-top, which makes them very enjoyable. Gradually, though, the movie takes on a somewhat more serious tone, which IMHO didn't work out very well. And although there are some genuinely funny parts in the movie, I found most of the one-liners and jokes not nearly as funny as they were probably intended.The special effects were a mixed bag as well: the CGI looks fairly good, but the movie also seems to use a lot of conventional effects (make-up and costumes) and they often look fairly fake.In the end, I have to say that ""Hellboy"" is somewhat of a mixed bag. It starts out great, but the thin story and the poorly worked out characters, it failed to keep me really interested.*** out of *****",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hellboy provides fun and excitement in excess,"I've never read any Hellboy, so I know nothing about the character as he was portrayed in the Dark Horse Comics that the movie is based on. The extent of my Hellboy knowledge going into this movie is that the character was created, written, and drawn by Mike Mignola. So I can't judge whether or not it was a good or loyal adaptation of the character, and thus will be judging it solely whether or not it works as a sci-fi action-adventure flick. The good news is that I'll be less likely to forgive a bad movie just because it pushes my fanboy buttons.More good news is that I didn't need any fanboy button-pushing to enjoy this movie. It's a high energy, special effects heavy, big action, comic book movie. I'm not usually won over by special effects heavy movies, because I feel they use them as a crutch to cover up the fact that they don't have much to say as a movie. But, when done right, special effects can enhance a movie, providing the audience with a visceral, visual experience that is unlike most of what they'll see in movies. Hellboy is one such a movie, a vibrant and unique experience that's as exciting as it is fun. It's probably for the best that Selma Blair is the biggest name star in the movie, because I'm sure most of the budget went to effects, as there are few scenes in the film without some.Thankfully, one area they avoided using special effects is with the Hellboy character itself, instead choosing to outfit Ron Perlman with makeup and costume to inhabit the big red guy. This works fantastically, as Hellboy manages to feel real in the film, despite his other-worldly appearance. He interacts with his environments, be they gloomy subways, the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, or a snowy Russian cemetery. Perlman does an excellent job filling Hellboy out, creating a character with enough gruff charisma to carry the film throughout. It's tough not to like the big guy, who fills the film with both humour and pathos, which is feat I don't believe CGI is ready to accomplish (if it ever will).The film feels like a blend of Indiana Jones, Men In Black, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Ghostbusters, while managing to stake out some original material for itself. It's a truly fun adventure film that's easy to like due to the nature of the character. But, the film isn't without its flaws. The villains of the piece are fairly second rate, the dramatic portions of the film, particularly the love angle with Blair's pyrokinetic character Liz Sherman, is merely adequate, and some of the sub-plots go unaddressed. But, what you should be looking for in such a movie is excitement and fun, and Hellboy provides both in excess.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Disappointing,"Okay, I'll start with something nice: Hellboy has great special effects, and fine performances from Perlman, Hurt, Tambor, and Pierce/Jones.Okay, I ran out of nice things to say.I'm a fan of comics and comic book movies, though the Hellboy comic has pretty much been off my radar. So I was looking forward to this movie. But I wound up disappointed for a lot of reasons. Let me list them...Villains: action movies need strong villains. This one gives us three (four if you count the monster)--and we don't really get to know any of them, though one does some nifty knife tricks. But what's their motivation? Hurt's character says they want to destroy the world. Why? Don't they get destroyed along with it? Sorry, but I could NOT understand WHY the bad guys are trying to do what they're trying to do.Heroes: all the good guys seemed to be plucked straight out of the stock character catalog. We have the world-weary lone wolf cop (Hellboy) to kick @$$ and crack wise, the intellectual (Abe) to explain the plot devices, the sage old man (Hurt) to explain the backstory, and the cranky boss (Tabmor) to be a pain in the butt. They're dressed up differently, but we've seen these characters a hundred times before, and in much better versions.Lovers: if the casting director was trying to find two extremely bland actors to match the bloodless characters of John Myers and Liz Sherman in the screenplay, he/she succeeded wildly. Hurt says he picked Myers specifically; why? Hellboy asks him what he's good at. We're never told or shown satisfactory answers. And what HB or Myers see in the morose, wan, and seemingly eternally-sedated Liz is beyond me. Not only is Blair not a good actress, she isn't even attractive.Dialogue: Hellboy has a few good lines, yes, but when you're able to fit them all in the trailer, you know you're in trouble. And the lack of interesting dialogue only highlights the lacklustre...Plot: Like many current action movies, Hellboy's creators make the mistake of assuming that action and effects are plot. They're not. The story shuffles along aimlessly; even the characters seem clueless about how to proceed. If Rasputin and his sidekicks are such a threat, why are they wasting time with the big hellhound-thingy? This isn't a plot, it's an excuse for a series of action set-pieces.When a movie can't come up with decent basic elements like the ones I just listed, all the special effects and whiz-bang action won't keep it afloat. It's too bad, because del Toro et al managed to show you can put together an effects-laden action flick at a much lower price than anyone would have thought.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
One heck of a flick,"Based upon the Dark Horse comic by Mike Mignola, directed by Guillermo del Toro (Blade II, Cronos), and starring Ron Perlman (Beauty and the Beast), Hellboy is one heck of a movie.The oddest of heroes - a reluctant demon who, despite a stone hand, is all heart - Hellboy fights monsters and resurrected Nazis as part of a covert operation for the US government. Sound silly? It is, and that's its charm. Under del Toro's capable direction, the action is swift, the monsters are scary, and the atmosphere is otherworldly. But it is character that drives Hellboy's plot. Much of the credit goes to the actors behind the masks. Ron Perlman delivers humor and humanity to a part that easily could have been little more than camp. And even supporting players, like the amphibian psychic Abe Sapien (voiced with aplomb by Frasier's David Hyde Pierce) are fully fleshed.Highly original and immensely entertaining, Hellboy sets a new standard for comic-book adaptations.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
All The Way With...GDT?,"Any movie that has anything to do with Guillermo Del Toro (GDT) is worth having a look at. The man is a genius. If you haven't really come across him before now then I suggest checking him out for titles like:Pan's Labrynth, The Shape of Water, Pacific Rim, The Strain, The Hobbit and more, he is awesome.I had not read the comic so Hellboy was completely new to me and I loved it. Such a rich creative universe and the titular character unlike anything I have ever seen.Pearlman is great as Hellboy delivering a great mix of humour, sarcasm, tantrums, anger and more.Its a great big load of fun :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"better than the Hulk, Daredevil or the LXG","This was a very enjoyable film and should spawn a sequel or two.  The only question is, since this is one of those ""save the world"" films, what do you do for an encore?Ron Perlman was excellent as the blue collar hero.  But rather than be a simple caricature, we saw Hellboy's deep feelings emerge for one of his fellow teammates, whose powers resemble those of an X-Men 2 mutant.  The scene with him spying on her from a rooftop while she was on a date was really funny and somewhat tender at the same time.The mysterious Nazi in the ""gas mask"" is revealed eventually and he slices and dices his way through the film like a martial arts expect with truncheon-like steel blades.  The CGI monster looks like a cross between a squid, a warthog and a wolf.  There's proof that this film doesn't try to take itself too seriously when Hellboy battles one of these creatures with one hand while holding onto a box of kittens in the other.  The comment he makes will crack you up.At times, the story is a bit convoluted and would require a second viewing to follow closely.Hellboy is a new cinema icon and so long as Perlman is able to play the role with humour and human feelings, much like Tobey McGuire's Spiderman, we have the makings of a franchise.  It's not as superb as the last X-Men film but Hellboy the character is much more charismatic that the Hulk, Daredevil or any of the cast from The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.Review by Triniman",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Wild, Fun, & Very Entertaining","I love Guillermo del Toro. The man makes great movies that are always fun and extremely entertaining. Cronos was good, Mimic was great, Blade II was the best movie of 2002, and now he gives us Hellboy, a great action movie that is funny and enjoyable, with all kinds of neat comic book touches, very original superheroes and lots of disgusting creatures.Ron Perlman, who is one of my favorite actors (and obviously one of del Toro's too) is perfect as Hellboy. He IS Hellboy. No one could have played him better. His attitude, his personality, his physique and his voice are all dead on, making him ideal for the role. Perlman makes Hellboy very cool, but also extremely likable. Hellboy's wisecracks are hilarious and Perlman nails them with just the right amount of sarcasm and wit. Perlman also does a wonderful job portraying Hellboy's soft side when he's with Liz Sherman, played decently by Selma Blair. John Hurt is great as Professor Broom, Hellboy's 'father', displaying wisdom and kindness in his old age. The bad guy, Rasputin, is evil enough, but doesn't seem like too much of a threat. The real threat comes from his henchman, Kronen, a sword-welding badass whose mechanized body keeps him alive and makes him almost invincible. Meyers and Abe Sapien do a fine job too.The special effects are amazing, especially Hellboy's make-up. Rick Baker did a fantastic job turning Ron Perlman into the red-skinned, yellow-eyed Hellboy with a variety of prosthetics and make-up effects. Hellboy's stone arm is wild and devastatingly useful when it comes to beating the crap out of people. I enjoyed his horns and red tail, which in one scene pays homage to Indiana Jones. Abe Sapien's aquatic effects are done very nicely, as is Sammael, the hell-hound Hellboy fights multiple times. Hellboy's gun, 'The Samaritan', is also a nice touch. My only complaint is that the CGI was overused, as in most movies these days.The action scenes, though short, are very cool. The scene in the museum that leads into an all-out chase between Sammael and Hellboy is pretty cool, with Hellboy punching the hood of an SUV, flipping it wildly into the air to save Meyers from being run over. Hellboy's fight with Kronen is fun and very original, as well as his demolishing brawl with Sammael in the subway. The giant tentacled creature at the end is very cool too.Guillermo del Toro's trademark visuals are in full effect here. His use of color, most notably amber, is excellent and gives the movie a very unique and interesting feel. His utilization of the elements is ever-present with lots of fog, smoke, and rain. The Gothic architecture and grimy locations are used very nicely with the Nazi island, the dark and dank subway system, and the Rasputin's temple. He also chooses some neat camera angles and movements, which give the movie a genuine comic book appearance. Good job, Guillermo!Bottom Line:Hellboy is a great popcorn movie. With a great director, excellent cast, fantastic special effects, and del Toro's unique visual style, Hellboy turns out to be a helluva lot of fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"""In the absence of light, darkness prevails""","Hellboy was such an interesting movie to see. It shreds clichés to pieces, has a fantastic story, hilarious one-liners, great CGI, but something in between made it feel empty. By no means is Hellboy a bad movie, but indescribably the movie falls short...The acting was pretty good. Ron Pearlman shines as always, and I think he was a great choice for Hellboy. He delivers his lines one by one with no struggles at all, and leaves you hungry for more. The only character that was questionable was the FBI detective John Myers, played by Rupert Evans. He seemed to be walking through the film, but with a crippled leg and embarrassment.. The thing that blew me away was how the story moves along. It didn't need complex twists and turns, only a hint. It moves along with precision and thought, and wasn't hard to follow at all. The movie is stylized by the great director, but the style isn't overdone like most other films these days. He knows how to put the right amount of humor and action, never falling for slow-motion shots or far-fetched explosions.. The movie is also really faithful to it's source material. I remember reading the comics as a kid, and finding them really good, and the director knew how to put the thing on the big screen. He does it with the right amount of attention, and the right amount of differences..Although I liked the film, there were some shortcomings. Hellboy was overdone with his jokes and humor albeit his few hilarious speedy one- liners. The movie has no tension whatsoever, but I'm not going to count that since the movie isn't serious. But whenever Hellboy is in a huge fight, you won't be cheering for anyone, because you'll know he'll come out the last one standing. Nevertheless, these things won't destroy the film for you. It delivers, maybe for a certain audience, but delivers albeit a little fall back. I recommend for people who can chose style over substance, but also get a little substance in between.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Hellboy Review,"Hellboy falls in line with practically every other comic to movie release. It does many things good and many things bad, but in Hellboys case, the good far outdoes the bad. Having said that, I really enjoyed Hellboy and I thought that the film was extremely well done. Even the opening credits have enough flair to keep you entertained. The cast is extremely versatile with there characters and I think that the casting director did a great job in finding great actors to play the parts. The film begins during World War II. With Hitler losing ground in Europe, the war is turning to favor the Allies. Hitler, in a desperate act, decides that the world must come to an end. He hires Grigori Rasputin and others to use black magic and create a portal to hell. This will cause a chain of events that leads to the end of the world. When the U.S government finds out about this plan, they send a special force team to Germany in order to foil Hitlers plot. After the portal is opened a demon crawls out and is rescued by Trevor Bruttenholm, a scientist who joined the special forces in Germany. He raises Hellboy (Perlman), a name he called him since he was a child, to be an efficient minister of justice for all the monsters that continually manifest in the United States. One day, while on a routine mission, he discovers that Rasputin survived the ordeal more than 50 years ago and is back to once again try to bring about the end of days. This leads Hellboy on a mission to save the world, get the girl, and avenge the death of his father. Classic stuff. He is joined by his love interest Liz Sherman (Blair) who is also a freak who can set her self on fire. Together they have many tasks ahead of them, and in the end great sacrifices have to be made. I really did enjoy this movie, the direction was nice and the acting was great. There was a lot of subtle humor littered throughout the movie and that made it all the more enjoyable. However, some parts of the film really held it back. For example, the plot is very unorthodox and sometimes you're not sure what is going on. This causes some huge problems when you're trying to follow the story. Also, there are a lot of loose ends that are never really tied up, or that are never fully explained. But the entire thing put together is a worthy movie that was well directed and nicely put together.OVERALL THOUGHTS ON HELLBOYEntertainment: Funny and exciting. 8/10Plot: Hard to follow at times, but still mildly interesting. 5/10Acting: Very nice. Perlman is wildly funny and witty. 9/10Music: Fast-paced and exciting, but a little generic 7/10Direction: Fits the genre, very nice. 7/10Alberts Analysis: A very good movie with strong characters that is held back by the lack of plot explanation. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
kind of lame and...,"the evil monster made no sense. It had something to do with Nazis and laying eggs and something about how the monster could reincarnate itself. I'm not sure how it all fit together; it wasn't explained well. Hellboy himself was kind of neat. The make up and costume were well done, but the one liners fell very flat. Hellboy's girl had a unique talent; too bad it wasn't show cased much. The fish guy was neat, but if they were going to throw other freak crime fighters in, then they should have had a handful of them. But, what I really didn't care for was the monster and the evil guy because they made no sense. How did the monster come to be? Was it brought to earth by the bad guy? Was the bad guy some type of demon or devil worshipper? And what was with him controlling the ugly faced dead Nazi guy, who was a master with the sword? I never understood how he did it. And who was the blond working with the evil guy? Also, the movie set up how much Hellboy depended on his father, but when the father kicks the bucket, Hellboy isn't too upset. He gets over it awful quick.And if they were going to have monsters in this, then there should have been several types of monsters to keep it more interesting.FINAL VERDICT: I know this is based on a comic book, but I didn't think it was anything like Spiderman or X-men. I really liked those movies, but didn't think much of Hellboy. So, I only recommend it if you think you have to see every special effects movie out there.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Jon Monsarrat review: Totally uninteresting,"Hellboy is a conversion of a comic book, so it's supposed to be campy. But even a campy film, like the first Austin Powers flick, should have engaging characters and a plot that makes sense.Unfortunately, Hellboy was a total waste in all categories. The bad guys weren't scary. Hellboy seemed pretty invincible so it there wasn't much tension (similar to the film The Crow). There was zero chemistry in the love interest. The dialogue was cheesy, and the computer graphics didn't work for me. I mean, the X-Men was cheesy but still fun. Hellboy didn't engage me at all, I'm sorry.Who should see this film:-- Fans of the comic book only.I'll give Hellboy a disappointing 4 out of 10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
How can you NOT love someone who saves kittens?,"This movie was great.  That;s coming from a girl who doesn't like comic books.  Action, laughs, romance and good acting were apparent in this flick. Ron pearlman was fantastic in this role, and the makeup sublime.  I think a lot of kids know what they'll be for halloween this year.  The only down side I thought was that Selma Blair was weak in her character, but the visual effects made up for her performance.  Loved the campy humour, and the fact that the hero wasn't afraid to show his sensitive side.  There were a couple of loose ends, but it's easy to overlook them.  They are prbably setting up for the sequel.  This movie is definately better than any spiderman or batman flick I've seen.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hell-Boy is one of the best comic book adaptations ever.,"I've watched loads of superhero films, from Batman to Mystery Men, and I can say that HellBoy was one of the best that I have seen. To me, comic adaptations can't just stick rigidly to the comics themselves, they have to branch out and have at least a few hints of realism. That's why I enjoyed Batman Begins so much, and have never particularly liked the 1989 Batman film. The reason I like HellBoy is because it feels real, but you know it's about a big red demon. It's also funny, 'quirky' and at some points mesmerizing. And although the Cthulu mysteries in it are not fully explained, I think that it still works magnificently (Anyway, most people would hate the Cthulu, even if Lovecraft is a genius!).The only reason it didn't get a 9 out of 10 is because it's impossible to have a 'perfect movie'. But this is damned close!Score - 9/10. OK, Nine and a Half...",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hellboy: 6/10,"Expectations have been set way too high now. Every time a movie based on a comic book comes out, everyone expects it to be the next , when a) most, if not all, of the popular comic book franchises have already been made into movies, and b) most comic book movies can't compare to Spider-Man. Yet these movies keep getting pumped out methodically, and people buy into them. I am one of those people, so on its opening weekend, I saw Hellboy, a lesser known comic-movie. There's obviously a reason why it's like that. Hellboy may be an interesting character, but his surroundings aren't.Ron Perlman plays the title character, a demon transported from hell during the Nazi regime. He's brought up by Prof. Broom (John Hurt, I'll get to him later), and soon helps out the American government in controlling paranormal creatures. However, it turns out he has human feelings and all, and must face his inner demons, so to speak.I must admit, going into Hellboy, I had high expectations. The trailers looked cool, and I thought it could surpass Spider-Man and get into Hulk territory. But I was wrong. Everything that went right in the two previously mentioned movies didn't happen in this one. The exciting originality and spontaniety of Spider-Man was thrown away in lieu of cheesy special effects. And the stunning story and depth in The Hulk was nowhere to be seen here. But I shouldn't be judging this movie based on others.In short, Hellboy is generic. Although the plot was far-out, it didn't go that far with it, and ended up just being a generic ""kick the bad guy's ass"" scenario. Any of the fight scenes seemed completely fake, until you realized that Hellboy was just a guy in makeup. Then I was in awe, but the sheer awkwardness of the computer animation just seemed off. Hellboy's makeup, though, was great; it seemed perfectly flawless (although I did see an image afterwards where some of his fingers were visible when there were supposed to be incased in a wooden arm), and was probably the highest point of the movie. The movie in itself was entertaining, but just not as gripping as it could be.Perlman is a great Hellboy. He stands out among this cast that could have gone for A-list stars but didn't. Hurt seemed to underplay his role. Ironically, Hurt played the title character in The Elephant Man, and I found these two movies similar, as they both deal with ostricizacation due basically to looks. Selma Blair, as the love interest, does what she can with her one note character, but she can't really do much with it.All in all, Hellboy is entertaining, generally. There's nothing new. Just some PG-13 blow 'em up, and that's it. Destined to not be a classic.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence and frightening images.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hellboy,"This movie is very Underrated it's unreal. Its funny, the visuals are amazing, its got a great story and there is so much more to it than a comic book story. People go around saying that spiderman is so amazing which it is but that is very overrated I mean its good but it's missing something, Hellboy has action, comedy, horror and it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through the film and you actually care about the characters and what happens to them. I don't think this film will live on for ages or even if people will remember it which is a shame because it deserves a lot more credit than it actually got. there is one tiny thing that i didn't like about the movie and that was that annoying bald guy who sticks up for Hellboy at the start but then just moans on and on about nothing, thats all that is wrong with it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Why doesn't this have a higher rating?,"I haven't read a single page of any of the comics. And I was not fond of del Toro from what I had seen by him before this, those being Mimic and Blade II. As of watching this, I am at least interested in his work. The trailer instantly sold me on this, and I was not disappointed. Plot is engaging and well-thought out. The characters are nicely developed, consistent and credible. Action is absolutely awesome and rather well-choreographed, and Kroenen rocks harder than I thought possible. This is also impeccably funny, garnering many laughs, and it never tries too hard. The pacing is spot-on, and you get to relax between the intense, exciting and scary sequences. Acting is excellent, Perlman is flawless, Hurt is beyond reproach as always, Blair lends her role the vulnerability that it needs without being overly frail, and Evans manages to make his part, which could easily have been anything but, quite tolerable, and even pleasant. Heck, the kid they use isn't terribly irritating, that in itself is noteworthy. The special effects are amazing, and there is a lot of imagination and creativity in this, and it's all up there on the screen. Writing is great throughout, and there is a nice amount of memorable and/or clever dialog. There is infrequent, mild language, watered-down gore and bloody violence, and potentially disturbing content in this. It's one of the more entertaining PG-13 movies, and one where it isn't as obvious and distracting that they censored it. I recommend this to any fan of the director, the main cast and/or the Hellboy. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good,"Hellboy is a good movie.  It is not a great movie.  It is a typical comic book movie.  The world is in danger of another great apocalypse.  The best reason to watch this movie is Ron Perlman as the title character.  He is funny and charismatic in the role.  He make the movie watchable.  The story is delightfully silly.  The Nazis with the help of Rasputin open the gate to hell, or another dimension, or whatever it is.  Hellboy comes out and is raised by the government.  He travels around the country in a garbage truck to combat evil.  Meanwhile, Rasputin returns with his henchmen to try to reopen the gate using Hellboy.  Everybody got that!

Hellboy,"Essentially just one in a long line of comic book film adaptations, Hellboy is enlivened by the superb casting of Ron Perlman from the 'I-know-the-face-but-can't-remember-the-name' school of acting as the eponymous hero.Hellboy is the infant product of some Nazis attempt to lure demons through a portal opened by Grigori Rasputin  yeah, that Rasputin. Taken under the wing of John Hurt's professor-of-something Bruttenholm, Hellboy grows into a hulking monster with red skin, forked tail and an impressive pair of horns which he grinds down in order to blend in.Introduced as a Loch Ness Monster type focus of media speculation, writer/director Guillermo del Toro quickly discards this aspect of the tale to concentrate on a relatively straightforward supernatural demons type plot that offers nothing new to those familiar with a range of comic book heroes stories (this film is, in fact an amalgamation of three different Hellboy stories). A love story is unwisely shoehorned into the plot, providing a respite from the plethora of special effects, which might have been more welcome had it been of any interest.Perlman is the best thing about this film. For a start, he looks the part, even though he was in his mid-fifties when this was shot. He breaths a little life into a lot of lame one-liners, but the foes with which he is provided are a little too bland at times: Biddy Hodson, the only villain whose character offered the suggestion of a little depth, is woefully underused and the film is all the weaker for it.This one will please the pre-18 multiplex set, but will leave more mature audiences wanting something more substantial.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Cheesy But Pretty Fun,"Guillermo del Toro is known for writing some pretty cheesy scripts when it comes to English speaking movies, and this movie is no exception. It is full of cheesy lines and clichés, but it's still a lot of fun. It's a comic book movie made before todays time of constant comic book movies.The story is one that is one third original, one third cliché, and one third stuff that del Toro loves. There's Nazi's that are involved with paranormal, weird creatures, creatures with tongue like things that shoot out, and all around odd things. Del Toro loves all this stuff (for more on that, watch The Strain) and it's kinda more funny than it is serious and dramatic, but it's still fun. It's self aware at times and a lot of humour is thrown in which works.Now there's a good mix of CGI and practical effects. The practical stuff works for me, but a lot of the CGI doesn't. Granted it is 2004 and we have come a LONG way since then, but there are a few specific shots, such as Hellboy crushing a redbull can, that are absolutely terrible looking. They look incomplete at times. But I will say that for the most part it looks passable. Not amazing, but okay.The movie shines in the department of design of sets and characters. The outfits and general appearances of the people in this movie are really top notch and feel fresh. It certainly makes them fun to look at. Even the general style of filming this movie goes for is kinda unique and fun. It feels like del Toro actually had a vision for this movie, like he does with most of his films.Overall this is a movie that is pretty fun. It leans more to the popcorn flick side of things, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It's part of the beginning of the comic book genre of movies we see today, which as a side note, i'm really damn sick of.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The Samaritan,"Directed by Guillermo Del Toro Hellboy is based off of the Darkhorse comics of the same name. Nearing the end of WWII a Nazis cult attempts to open a portal to another dimension. Overseen by the Russian Mystic Grigori Rasputin(Karel Roden) Their plan is foiled by a soldiers being led by professor Brom. They find among the rumble a demon child and Brom raises him as his own naming him Hellboy(Ron Pearlman). 60 years later we find Hellboy who works for The bureau of paranormal research and defense. A organization that protects the human world from supernatural threats. Now Rasputin returns now Hellboy has to figure out his plan and put a stop to it. Hellboys always been one of those characters that has maintained a huge following in fans. It mixes superheroe, mystery and occultism. The movie is overalls a fun bombastic with it's fighting,music and character it a eye catching piece. The characters for the most part a great. Ron Pearlman was An excellent choice for Hellboy he comes off as everything that you can love but not expect at the same time. A cigar smoking gun toting lone wolf bad ass demon, who at the same time is a reckless, funny and relatable guy. He prefer to work alone in the field, but it's not a stick in the mud. Blends the perfect mix of seriousness and camp with character similar to Wesley snipes blade. Everyone else does a good job but Ron is the reason why the movie succeed so well. The make up effect on both him and Abe Sapien(Doug Jones)and he other monster is amazing both uses a great mix of practical make up but still touch a little cg on. It blend well in and out off combat the only cg really uses like Hellboy's tail, Abes eyes and when someone being thrown around by tentacles. I also like Liz(Selma Blair) as a character though I really didn't feel like she got much time to flush out before the end. She has her big moment though, Myers(Rupert Evans )and the Director of the bureau(Jeffrey Tambor) felt the most out of place characters in the entire movie.even for this suit pencil pushers for the bureau these guys do not look like they belong in this setting. The action scenes are good especially the subway but it also takes time to have some fun. The scene where he's spying on his friends and this kid bring him a cookie on the roof that just great. The Music's great very orchestrated Gregorian chant and instrumental fitting with it religious tone. The setting are diverse nice shot of snow,Rain be the city and ruins. One downside is that the Villain is kind of basic and the sense Rasputin isn't really all that special at a least in this movie. He serves a important role in the history of Hellboy, but here he barely does anything until near the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Pretty darn good, and that's coming from someone who hates comic book  (***)","I'm not a fan of comic books (or most comic book movies), so I wasn't too interested in seeing ""Hellboy"" until I heard that Guillermo del Toro was directing it. When it comes to dark and intense films about creepy-crawly things, he's one of the best (""The Devil's Backbone"", ""Cronos"", ""Mimic"" and especially the awesome ""Blade II"").The hero of this story was a baby demon who slipped through a portal to hell that was opened by Satan-worshipping Nazis at the end of WWII. Under the tutelage of the kindly human professor (John Hurt) who raised him, he became a crusader against evil. It's a ridiculous story, but no more ridiculous than most movies based on comic books, and the well-developed characters make it seem almost believable.Hellboy himself (played to perfection by Ron Perlman) is quite a fascinating character. Raised by humans, he struggles to be normal despite his gigantic muscles, red skin, and huge horns (that he sands down every morning). He also has a wickedly sarcastic sense of humor (after putting down one monster he says ""I'm fireproof. You're not.""), and his pining for a fellow freak named Liz (a melancholy human firestarter played with the right dark-eyed loneliness by Selma Blair) is touching.Even though the characters are the best thing about this movie, I found the story pretty compelling as well, as it seems far more influenced by the gothic horror of H.P. Lovecraft and Clive Barker than those cheesy Marvel comic stories.Lovecraft's influence in particular is present here, his indescribably creepy, gigantic, tentacled monsters waiting in some dark dimension for their chance to take over the world. Barker's work is felt in the sprawling hellscapes, satanic machinery, and a grisly reanimated corpse used as a puppet.In a nutshell, if you like lots of action mixed with the dark and grotesque (basically if you liked ""Blade II""), ""Hellboy"" will probably do it for you.

Lots of action and a good story...,"While not being familiar with the ""Hellboy"" comic books, I had very little idea of what to expect from this movie the first time I watched it, back when it was initially released. I took the time to sit down and watch the 2004 ""Hellboy"" movie again, as part of getting geared up to the forthcoming new ""Hellboy"" movie in 2019.I will be the first to admit that director and writer Guillermo del Toro definitely was the guy to have at the helm of this project, because he has a very unique knack for making these supernatural type of movies. And he did it marvelously at the helm of the 2004 ""Hellboy"" movie.The storyline told throughout the course of the movie was a good and interesting one. It had lots of flavor to it and there were lots of smaller subplots to the overall main storyline along the way. It all panned out quite nicely and Guillermo del Toro managed to get the movie to come full circle at the end.Needless to say that the special effects in the movie were off the charts. The creature designs and costume designs were just magnificent. The CGI was so realistic and there was a very Lovecraftian touch to the creatures throughout the movie and the massive entities that were found in space and in the skies. Definitely an interesting thing going on there.There is also an abundance of action throughout the movie, and it was executed quite nicely, coming to life on the screen in a very beautiful and pleasing visual way for the audience to enjoy.Not to mention an impressive array of actors and actresses to portray the various characters and roles in the movie. Ron Perlman is actually quite good as Hellboy, and he is not normally an actor I am all that keen on watching. Karel Roden made for a good villain in the role of Grigori Rasputin, but he was so outstaged by Ladislav Beran playing Karl Ruprecht Kroenen - not only did he have a much cooler outfit, but his character was also way more interesting to me. Doug Jones did a marvelous job as Abe Sapien, though it was the voice acting of David Hyde-Pierce that really brought so much charm and wits to the character.While the reanimated corpse Ivan only had a minor part in the movie, he brought so much humor to the scenes that he will be sorely missed. Half a man, but all laughs.The 2004 ""Hellboy"" movie is definitely an entertaining movie from start to end, and if you haven't already seen it, then I can strongly recommend that you take the time and effort to do so.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good Popcorn Cinema,"A good comic book adaptation which is quite entertaining. But not perfect. In addition, Ron Perlam manages to revitalize Hellboy well.Well, the special effects were successful for 2004. Guillermo del Toro proves that he is a versatile director. Nevertheless, the film has lengths here and there.Entertaining, fun action fantasy film. You can look at it, but you don't have to. Nevertheless, I can personally understand if del Toro's Hellboy has a certain cult status. Mainly because he managed to combine the genres well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A Good Superhero Movie That Dares To Be Dark,"In the year 1944, the Allies stop a Nazi plot to use a dimensional portal to awaken the Ogdru Jahad to aid them by mystic Grigori Rasputin. However, a baby demon comes out, one with red skin and a right hand made of stone, which Professor Broom, who was with the Allied Army that day, adopts. Fast forward to the present, and the demon, Hellboy, is a member of the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, a top secret branch of the FBI dealing with monsters and demons. However, Rasputin has been revived, and now Hellboy must stop him from summoning the Ogdru Jahad once again.For a film rated PG-13, it has some dark themes in it. However, they made it work. Ron Perlman makes a good Hellboy, and David Hyde Price does good as the voice of Abe Sapien. The special effects help bring the monsters to life, and the story is a good one, despite the pacing being slow at times. This is one superhero film I suggest giving a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Visual elegance, lame plot and pacing","Hellboy's a real pity: a strong cast and beautifully designed visual environment are wasted with a doofy script and lazy characterization. Ron Perlman's Hellboy -- and, in casting terms, Perlman's the perfect choice -- is unleashed upon the movie without depth, idiosyncrasy or soul, and forced to spend twenty minutes at a time pummelling large voiceless CGI dogs. It's a waste of the lovely work done by the visual designers, who beautifully render a steampunkish detective lair; sinister Nazi-era villains; and the delicately amphibious Abe Sapien. The greater shame is that the source material, Mike Mignola's comic, is a work of dry elegance and understated wit. Try it if you're interested in seeing what would happen if this world and its characters were allowed to run a little deeper.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Perlman's great, but the movie's not","Superhero flicks are all the rage right now and Hellboy is yet another one to ponder. Unlike X-Men or Spiderman, I've never actually read a Hellboy comic so I went in knowing next to nothing about the character.The movie gets a major boost with the casting of Ron Perlman in the lead role. Perlman is great as Hellboy and he breathes considerable life into the character. The best scenes were the ones where Hellboy was just being Hellboy. I liked watching his various girl problems and really enjoyed his conversations with the other characters in the film.It's too bad the actual superhero aspect of the movie doesn't match up to Perlman's performance. I just never got interested in any of the action scenes. The villains didn't interest me and I actually got bored watching Hellboy fighting the same monsters over and over again. I can't give this movie more than a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Overall good action film,"My husband and I bought this DVD sight unseen.  We were verycurious about this one for ages, but never got a chance to see it onthe big screen.  We liked it.  This movie is not an amazing out ofthe park epic, but we would like to see this franchise in the future.Pearlman was really good in this film, and he really held his own.Overall, the writing was not what I had hoped for.  And it could haveended sooner.  At the end, it just kept going and going.  Which isfine.  But editing could have helped this film.  Del Torro, what tosay?  Frankly, I'm not a fan.  Blade 2 turned my stomach....toomuch needless gore and such blood, it just went overboard.  Atthat point I swore that I'd never see another Del Torro film.  Blade 2just made me ill...and I adored the first film totally.  So, for me tobuy Hellboy...well, it was a leap of faith.  And I'm glad I took it.  Ibought it in a two pack of DVD's...and the other?

Better than Expected,"I wasn't expecting to like this movie in the least, Ron Perlman typically comes off as an over-rated actor and the First trailer I saw was boring.I actually liked Perlman in this film, him and Abe really came to life and were quite entertaining.

Lovely all through the way,"There is something magical about 2004 movies; and Hellboy is the most magical of them all, in both literal and metaphorical ways!Guillermo del Toro has this method, he creates such awful-looking creatures but then adds a little something to the cocktail, he gives them his heart! Developing characters so lifelike you feel you them your whole life as if they're not monsters but friends.Indeed who was the first that said monsters should be always evil?Starting at an offsite military base, nazies are once again trying to summon dark powers but with US troops stepping in, things go kaput and out of the very depths of hell, one strange little boy comes up, and that's how the tale goes.Funny when laughter is needed, emotional when sentiments are needed, and lovely all through the way!

Could have been worse,"TL:DR Watchable if not memorableSomehow I skipped this when it came out. Now that I've watched it I'm a bit conflicted.The Good: The story was decent, especially for a pre MCU comic book adaptation. Ron Pearlman was perfect of course, and much of the casting was very good, at least for the main protagonists. The sets were good, as were some (but NOT all) of the effects. There is actually a suprisingly good balance of action and character reflection/growth, although the humor could have been emphasized a bit more.The Bad: Pacing suffered at times. I'm not sure the editor was awake. Most of the secondary characters were 2 dimensional at best. Some of them could have been cardboard cutouts and it wouldn't have made much difference. Some of the monster effects, both practical and cgi, don't hold up well today.The Ugly:
Some of the wire work was atrocious, as was some of the direction, especially the crowd scenes in the subway. Jeffrey Tambor is wasted here, despite the brief attempt at character development and redemption near the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"""Passion-less""","Why is it lately the best films about who we are as men and women come from stories full of aliens, freaks and mutants?`Hellboy', which has one of the weakest premises out of the Marvel Comic factory, is about a Devil child accidentally let loose to our world through a Nazi experiment gone awry. The United States raises him to take care of other evil going on in the world that we, of course, never hear about.Hollywood is big on that: `Ghostbusters', `The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', `Men in Black', `Harry Potter', `Stargate', `The X-Files', and `Stuart Little' come to mind. (I think talking mice can be verrrrry creepy.)Nonetheless, `Hellboy', played by Ron Perlman, is the quintessential tough guy with a sensitive streak. This is not a new role for Perlman. Ever since he played the Beast in `Beauty and the Beast' in the late 1980's, (remember way back to the 1900's?), Perlman has shown that ugliness is only skin deep.`Hellboy' is a wise cracking cigar smoking cross between George Peppard, Ted Danson and Jack Nicholson. He's Sgt. York with a John Wayne swagger. He's short on words and big on action and is more cocky than Han Solo and Ferris Bueller.From the get go, the film has a Spielberg `Raiders of the Lost Ark' feel to it in both story and well blocked direction by `Blade II' and `Mimic' director Guillermo del Toro. (I wonder if William the Bull knows Benny (Benecio) the Bull.) The action never lets up with rare moments to let you grab your inhaler and when it does let up it's for some sappy scene that isn't even important plot points - except to show `Hellboy's' all too human inner calling.The film is unrelenting, as was `Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom', and it shows that plot driven films has its choice of real stunt men for tools or computer graphics.Those wacky, fun loving Nazi's are still hanging around waiting to take over the world! You know, when Hollywood tries to have something or someone take over the world it's so serious but when `Pinky and the Brain' do it it's funny though their diabolical plans are no less ponderous. OK, then - Nazis! Evil overactin' Nazis yet! Now that's diabolical! They come back to release some watch-a-ma-call-it really large and slimy thingy and `Hellboy' is called in to kill it. I mean, it's always `Kill it! Kill it! It's gotta' be killed! Make faces at it if you must, but kill it!!!' No one ever wants to capture anything. No, wait, there's always Daryl Hannah in `Splash.' They did want to capture her, but then again, New Yorkers aren't afraid of much.The trouble with killing this 'moving-so-fast-creature-you-can't-get-a-good-look-at-it', is that for every one that dies, two of them are born! Sort of like mosquitoes and IRS forms! AIEEEE! Surely, there's more to this, I hear you ask yourself with soulful introspection. Unlike `The Hulk', undoubtedly one of the worst films ever to have been made and unfortunately distributed, the answer is yes - but it takes awhile to get there.The film is 2 hours and 5 minutes long and you start to get antsy even in those plush `loveseat' style seats. (Personally, I think the whole purpose of those seats is to let someone know how you feel about them by either raising or lowering the armrest between you.) The film is well paced with two fairly weak subplots filled in with appropriately enough, fairly weak performances. Rupert Evans, who has been in about six projects, plays the wimpiest CIA Agent you'll ever run across, though he has an abundance of courage. `Hellboy's' girlfriend, who's got a gift with engulfing buildings in flames, (and that's OK if you know how to control it), is played by Selma Blair. (How come she can't control igniting things but she can see to it that her clothes don't even get scorched?) And John Hurt, of all people, likens himself to `Hellboy's' pop since he's the one who raised the little Devil. Hurt's performance is the biggest waste as he's hardly recognizable and could have been played by an unknown because you actually think the guy is an unknown. But the most interesting bit of second player acting, is the half-man/half-fish played by Doug Jones, but voiced by David Hyde Pierce from `Frasier.' And yes, the fish creature is better looking than Lillith.Meanwhile, in a land chock full of Nazis, our villains await `Hellboy' and his combustible girlfriend to usher in Satan and his minions - which is pretty ironic since `The Passion' was playing down the hall.Movie composer Robert Beltrami, veteran of 43 films, did a sensational job as did the hundreds of others who worked on the project. It's as if most of them have worked together before. Wait! They have! Namely the aforementioned `Blade II' and `Mimic.' Come to think of it, the five producers have worked on a plethora of films together and most of them were quite successful. Probably because there were no talking mice. Honestly, what makes this film tick is Perlman's performance.By the way, the film was shot in Prague. I suppose the producers thought `Hellboy' and Prague was a Czech-mate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hellboy portrays its impossible titular character with blazing fire and childish charm.,"A superhero blockbuster shrouded in Del Toro's signature darkness, bringing a relatively unknown graphic novel into the spotlight. This accessibly entertaining flick has just enough mindless action to appeal to general audiences whilst offering a dynamic range of genre transitions allowing Hellboy himself to develop as a character. Sure the central plot is extinguished right from the start, but it's all about Hellboy. And, in my opinion, it works. Just. Hellboy, a demonic beast pulled from a dimensional portal, works with other supernatural individuals to keep the world safe from paranormal threats. This time, he must stop a Russian mystic from summoning inter-dimensional colossal creatures.Part superhero fantasy, part romance and part horror. A mish-mash of dark genres that suit Del Toro's signature style. Whether it be Hellboy traversing damp sewers or prowling the streets at night, Del Toro maintains the overburdening sense of darkness that looms over Hellboy as he struggles to mature. As a character study, Del Toro's screenplay manages to fully flesh out Hellboy's loneliness and, accompanied by Perlman's transformative performance, makes the character instantly memorable. Abe, an amphibious humanoid, and Liz, a pyrokinetic, are introduced in a way that suits Hellboy. They never become central to the story, but represent his adoration for his peers/friends. Bestowing human qualities upon him. The romance is nuanced but effective, the paranormal imagery exhumes imagination and the action is watchable.Just a shame that the main story has no development whatsoever as the antagonist (and his disciples) are instantly forgettable. The lore of the Ogdru Jahad and the Thule Society felt dense yet never truly explored, ultimately feeling rushed just to relate to the source material. The visual effects were satisfactory for the most part. However due to Del Toro's natural insistence on practical effects (phew...), it does make the CGI more noticeable during fight sequences, ultimately taking you out of the experience. The third act, especially the final fifteen minutes, crumbles into dust. The screen suddenly fills with tentacled behemoths, fiery horns and last minute revivals. It all happens instantly and pretty much has no effect, which is a shame.Fortunately we were graced with a sequel, as I find this introductory film reminiscent to a seed. A ""Seed of Destruction"" if you will. Del Toro plants the characters firmly into the ground and presents their origins and destiny defying arcs well. Now it's time to let these characters grow and focus on an involving central story, as this film was absent of that entirely. Still, Del Toro's fantastical style bursts through the screen in what is an often overlooked superhero flick.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Containing a super hero that isn't your typical good guy in white (or black spandex like Batman), I was intrigued to go rent it.  Unfortunately, HELLBOY turned out to be a very unpleasant viewing.  Hampered by terrible dialogue, mundane action sequences, and more banal moments than a Venetian history lesson, the movie is one to avoid.  There was also inordinate amounts of music painfully placed at every single juncture of the film, making me wonder if the filmmaker had been raised in a silent cardboard box.

"One hell of a fun film, boy.","Seeing the trailers for the film, I decided that - while I am a big fan of comic book movies - HELLBOY looked like a bore.  Boy, was I wrong.  When I popped in the DVD of HELLBOY, from the first few minutes of the film, I loved it.Hellboy is a demon who was brought out of a hell dimension by the Nazis in 1944.  He was taken in by a paranormal specialist, who nicknamed him ""Hellboy"" and taught him the basics of demon life.  I guess.  How the hell he potty-trained him, I don't know.  Cut to sixty years later - Hellboy is the FBI's top-secret tool to kick demon ass.First of all, let's get down to the acting.  Ron Perlman is a very gifted actor, and he has never been better than as the title character in this film.  His portrayal of the cocky, sometimes reckless good-guy demon is absolutely flawless.  The rest of the cast performs well, but Perlman completely and utterly steals the show.The story of the film is what attracted me to it at first.  The whole idea with the Nazis and such I find to be very interesting.  The screenplay is absorbing, action-packed, and frequently funny, but I must admit that it lags a little towards the end.Another fun part of the film is its atmosphere.  It feels like it comes straight out of a comic book, with its dark subway stations and nighttime scenes with an orange haze.The special effects are terrific.  Abe Sapien is Hellboy's sometime companion, a sort of fishy character with psychic abilities; and then we have Liz, Hellboy's dream girl who just happens to have a little fire in her.  That's a pun, by the way.Just watch the movie.What can I say to get you to watch it?  It's one of the funnest films I've seen recently, and it completely and totally surpassed my expectations.

When I see the characters, I get this strange feeling that these guys got the highest marks in school, never lied and you can't see them eating something that is unhealthy. Hellboy is different. For sure. A demon fighting for peace on Earth. Cutting his horns for them not to grow further. Playing ""lonely hero"", watching cartoons and trying to hide a cigar from his father (professor Broom - the guy who ""adopted"" him, actually, but... ahem... this is not the father who just gave birth, but the one who grew the baby up, right?). Demon, which has a thing for cats, shows an ironic outlook on everything including himself (""I can promise you that I will always look this good!"") and demonstrates a really STRONG love towards ONE girl.

Monsters are the real treat here.,"I would have never expected Hellboy to make the silver screen. There's something about the comic that never brought me toward it. But Guillermo del Toro has seen something I haven't, because the transition from comic to silver screen is exceptional. The film is very plot-driven, one scene moving to another at a faster-than-usual pace, but the real gift of Hellboy is the ingenuity and effort used in creating the monsters. Sammael and Kroenen are crafted with much care and I found it an absolute shame there wasn't more monsters to work with in a limited time.Much of Hellboy feels underused. Liz is not used as much as I hoped, and Abe Sapien is out of commission about halfway through. Dr. Manning's fate wasn't fully settled on either and abilities used by Hellboy, like reviving the dead, are kind of just left out there, like who knew?

"A fun, well adapted Dark Horse Comic","If there is one Dark Horse comic book property that many people enjoy and respect, its this adaptation. It's obvious that a lot of work and effort went into this to make it as good as it is. Apparently this was also director Guillermo del Toro's dream project way back when he first started directing. But that's not the only reason why everything comes together here. Every element of the film has something to contribute.Let's begin with what's the most easy to notice - the casting. It's spot on. Ron Perlman as Hellboy was the perfect choice and it's great that del Toro stuck with his gut instinct and ran with it. Perlman has the voice, he has the chops and has the wit to give Hellboy just the right amount of charm and machoness. The rest of the cast were accurate choices as well. John Hurt is an older actor so it's fits that he would play Dr. Broom. Selma Blair as Liz Sherman is beautiful in her own way because of her troubled past. And Abe Sapien physically played by Doug Jones and voiced by Daivd Hyde Pierce was a great mix.Hyde Pierce was the same man who voiced Slim in A Bug's Life (1998), Drix in Osmosis Jones (2001) and Dr. Doppler from Treasure Planet (2002). Then there's the strangest villain of all, Karl Kroenen played by Ladislav Beran. What a creepy character! Beran's movements actually reminded me of a mix between Ray Park's Snake Eyes from the G.I. Joe franchise and Anis Cheurfa's Rinzler from Tron Legacy (2010). Then there's the special effects. Much of which look practical - solid or liquid elements. Certainly the creatures are practical because that is Guillermo del Toro's specialty.Unfortunately, like most superhero / blockbuster films, the protagonist is set to battle for all of humanity. It's cliché but there's one part to the writing that tops that. Just like many other films, a key plot point involves a magic key to fulfill a prophecy. This kind of plot point is really overused. Thankfully this is covered up for most of the time until the third act. Plus there's one last element that helps this movie excel - Marco Beltrami's musical score. Beltrami's music hits the right note on all angles. His score has a main theme for our hero and also mixes horror tones with action cues and emotional motifs throughout the running time. A fun film piece.Its writing contains the usual superhero clichés but every other aspect of the film hits as hard as Hellboy's rock hand. The actors represent their characters accurately, the action is great with lasting special effects and a memorable score.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A great adaptation!,"Del Toro brings this somewhat obscure, but great comic book to life in a magnificent manner! It has a great sense of humor and an overall atmosphere to it. It's grim and dark, but not overbearingly so! Ron Perlman is great as Hellboy and the rest are good too. Awesome monster/creature designs and great action as well!

One of the best Non DC or Marvel superhero films ever,"DC and Marvel seem to dominate the superhero film industry nowadays. But they better watch out from another comic book company called Dark Horse Comics. Their movies include 300, Sin City, and Hellboy. In my opinion, Hellboy is their best project yet.What I love about this film is Guillermo Del Toro's direction with the story, the characters, the cast, and the visuals. Hellboy, played by Ron Perlman, is very likable hero. He's got a tough sense of charisma to him but you can always see his soft side as well. The main villain, Rapsutin, is very despicable and is very cunning as a mastermind bad guy. Out of all the supporting characters in this movie, my favorite one is Liz, Hellboy's girlfriend, probably because of her very interesting background.The story is very good in this movie. I'm not going to spoil it, but I will say that it is a good mix of action, horror, fantasy, and themes like identity, choice, and what it means to be human.Even if you know very little about the source material, I think you'll still enjoy it. Hellboy is a fantastic film thanks to its actors and its very talented director, Guillermo Del Toro.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"A very warm hell, unable to scald the audience.","This movie is the film adaptation of the comic with the same name, and tells the story of a creature from another dimension, with demonic appearance, which was found by US troops on a special mission in Scotland, designed to neutralize the efforts of German occultists to mobilize magical forces for World War II. With direction and script by Guillermo del Toro's, it has a cast headed by Ron Perlman, John Hurt, Selma Blair, Karel Roden and Doug Jones.I was never a fan of films made from comics as it's a kind of film full of graphics normally seen in this kind of literature. For me, film is film, and a comic is a comic. This movie positively surprised me as it moves away from the graphic look of the comic- books, bringing the story to a more realistic scenario. The theme of the story, hanging around the magical and occult, it's also interesting and appealing. An ancient philosopher, who I don't remember the name, said that hell was more appealing than the sky because it's more mysterious, and he had some reason. The script was well thought out, blending action, romance and adventure in perfect doses. The cast also fulfilled well it's role but it wasn't particularly surprising. The special, visual and sound effects are excellent and do a good job, as the scenarios. The soundtrack, despite the good performance, not surprised also. In fact, what is most lacking in this film is precisely the element of surprise. It's a constantly warm film, never robbing us that emotion or shock feeling. Maybe if the script had been thought differently... The highlight of the film, in the end, can be really touching, which is a positive, even though the best time of the entire film.This film is full of interesting and favorable points, and it's of the few comics-based films that can break free of the stylized look of these magazines. Unfortunately, it lacks a certain amount of surprise, excitement and intensity that just don't pour the film to lose because, even then, is a film that looks good and is entertaining enough for a family audience, although is never hot enough to scald the most demanding audience.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Entertaining,"I loved this movie. It was entertaining and well-paced. One thing that I liked about this movie was it didn't have unnecessary scenes or unnecessary stretching.Pearlman played the role of Hellboy very nicely. All of the other significant characters are equally well-presented by their respective actors.The movie moved well, didn't get stalled anywhere, and both the action and drama were moderated with smooth transitions between each.Overall, I would recommend this movie to everyone.

It's done in a way that permits humour to be used without breaking the tension when it's needed.One of my all time favorites. If you think about it, it's incredible that you actually feel for a giant red guy with horns, a blue fish-man and some giant walking trees by the end of this movie, without having watched anything like it before-hand.

"Great comic book movie, Ron Perlman is the man!!","The latest comic book to be transferred on to the big screen is Mike Mignola's cult series, Hellboy. Hellboy is the son of Satan who found his way to earth in 1944, when Nazi's by the order of Adolf, decided they would try and win the war by opening the gateway to hell. Hellboy slipped through and was taken into care by the Allied army's paranormal specialist played by John Hurt. With the Nazi's having been foiled in a brilliant opening scene set in wartime Scotland, we flash forward to present times and Hellboy is now a fully grown beast working for the FBI in a special unit that battles all manner of devilish demons. Hellboy is the main government assassin against these freaks of nature. Alongside him is his father (Hurt) and mer-man Abe Sapien, a strange creature who can read minds and see into the past and future. There is also Hellboys love interest played by Selma Blair, who has the distinct gift of bursting into flames whenever she gets angry or upset (thank god all women don't do that otherwise that time of the month would be hell).The films source material is much like that of the Crow, and the Blade series. It is real cult material and few will have an assumed knowledge of it and the few that do will probably know it inside and out. It is probably the sort of comic that doesn't have casual readers like many of Marvels favourite heroes. It is far darker material. Despite a dark theme and dark material this film isn't excessively dark like the Crow was and Blade. They have done it out so that visually it is fantastic and dark but this was only a pg-13 in America and a 12A in the UK and as such it isn't massively violent and they have lightened the tone a fair bit with plenty of humour. In some ways I would have enjoyed more grit and edge, an R rated version but it still works very well. What helps here is that director Guillermo Del Toro is probably the biggest Hellboy geek on the planet by his own admission and his passion ensures that fans will be satisfied. I don't know how faithful it is personally but I have seen artwork and visually the have got Hellboy spot on. By all accounts though, the geek-boys loved it. Del Toro is a great visual director as he proved in Cronos and also Blade 2 but this film looks amazing. From dark and grimy rain soaked locales, to snow covered, to a fiery hot, burning post apocalyptic vision of the future. All the sets are great as are the effects.Del Torro is no stranger to cult movies as I mentioned before with Cronos and the second Blade film and in each of those films and this too, there is a recurring element, Ron Perlman. He's a master of cult movies having worked with Del Torro several times and also appearing in cult French fantasy City Of The Lost Children. Perlman is one of those recognisable faces you see in a lot of movies and it's a shame is not more well known. He has a strange cult following who like the guy. Perlman is certainly capable as an action man, he has the build and is very tall but what has held him back is his looks. He doesn't look like hero material, he's not particularly photogenic and that is proved by the very fact that his full 4 hour Hellboy make up is actually a marked improvement. The part that is tragic is that he is a good character actor, he has charisma and is cool. I think that Hellboy gives him a potential long series of films to turn him into a star and make him more popular but the fact of the matter is, he will never sell a movie by his name. He has gone from big budget Hellboy and his next movie is a $2 million, more than likely DTV, action film. Hellboy wasn't a massive box office hit, due to it being very cult material and having no star name, but it was a critical success and has done well on the video shelves so hopefully a sequel will come, by all sources involved it seems possible, and the appeal can only increase for another film. Let's face who imagined it would be a really good movie, not many. I would have been satisfied if it had matched the Blade films but it beats them. Perlman is superb in this film, he rocks. He has come form nowhere really to the majority of the general movie going public and has been a revelation, it is his most high profile role and film. John Hurt is also good in a brief role and also Selma Blair is good too.The action kicks bum. Del Torro crafts some wonderful set pieces and the film has good effects, particularly for a film with a fairly modest budget for a summer action movie. The whole look of the film is striking and there is a great attention to detail. Marco Beltrami also provides a marvelous score. The only minor quibbles are that certain elements are not fully explained. How the Nazi characters don't age for example and also the backgrounds to some of the supporting characters. For a summer movie that has such a brisk pace the plot-holes don't affect it too much. Overall this is a very good and entertaining summer movie with some character. Perlman is superb and Del Torro's stubbornness in holding out for Perlman and agreeing with the studio to drop the budget to have him in, was inspired. It was certainly a risk but you cannot put a price on good casting. The studio wanted the then, flavour of the month Vin Diesel and although I like him he would not have nailed the role as perfectly as Ron Perlman. ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Great Movie All Around!,"It is a very difficult thing to bring a comic book character to life on the big screen and do it justice. People tend to have some preconceived idea's about how close the movie should be to the comic book itself. Although there are many differences between the comic book and the movie I really feel that Guillermo del Toro, along with a superb cast, captured the true essence of Hellboy. It is not an easy thing to do but Guillermo succeeded with familiarizing the audience with who Hellboy is, where he came from, and what he does.This movie is one of my all time favorites and I can't wait until ""Hellboy 2: The Golden Army"" comes out next year, 2007.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Poorly directed, insults viewer's intelligence","This is an extremely promising concept, badly executed. The first third of the movie forces too many unexplained facts on us - the only character that's given any background is Hellboy (coincidentally - he's the only major character that ""works""). We have no clue as to the motivation of any of the other people, which makes it difficult to accept or understand their behavior later. And why the heck was the head of the military squad in the opening sequence being briefed during their last few steps through the rain on the way to their objective? I mean, it's a comic book movie, and we expect to suspend a dump truck-full of disbelief, but this is just flat-out stupid. Unfortunately, this sort of stupidity permeates the rest of the picture.The middle third of the picture flows better - Hellboy is facing some monsters in various locations and continues to establish his character. The rest of the characters plod along through their actions with no obvious motivation, etc. The action sequences are garden-variety. Hellboy's one super-attribute, his ""fist of doom"", is underutilized (IMHO), but that's a minor quibble. A not-so-minor gripe is that during one sequence one of the monsters - which at that point had been resolutely quadrupedal (walking on four legs) - walks on his find legs for no reason whatsoever. This caused me a horrible flashback to cheezy 70's movies with people walking around in rubber suits. It looked completely ridiculous. There is also some glaring inconsistency in the amount of ""damage"" suffered by Hellboy in various circumstances - at one  point a moderate cut on his arm causes him to lose enough blood to cause him to eventually collapse, however his being impaled with dozens of pieces of glass later is shrugged off as inconsequential. He gets up slowly after being thrown against the wall, yet gets up easily later on after directly absorbing the blast of half a dozen grenades. At one point he is engulfed in a room full of fire (to which he is supposed to be impervious) and it's the only thing in the film that knocks him unconscious. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to suspend a lot of disbelief, but the director makes it extremely difficult.Despite the glimmer of promise shown in the second act, the final third of the movie drags you back into the intellectual gutter. We have the caricatured head of the FBI leading this mission - how the hell did this guy lead the FBI? This moron couldn't lead cub scouts on a day hike. The pronunciation of Russian words is so bad that my girlfriend (who speaks Russian as her first language) couldn't understand their words without the subtitles. I don't want to spoil the climactic (or anticlimactic, as it was for me) confrontation, but it frankly made no sense whatsoever. The evil Rasputin is given so many powers ?(for no obvious reason) it reminds me of playing superheros as a small child where you had that one friend that kept making up new ""powers"" whenever it was convenient (or when he/she was in ""trouble"") that you wanted to pummel them into the dirt. And despite that Hellboy deals with him so easily at the end that it's almost a joke.I can see that a lot of people liked this movie so maybe I was in a harsh mood or something when I saw it (I wanted to like it), but I just couldn't get over the inconsistencies, the lazy scriptwriting, and the ""beat you over the head with some information, then don't explain everything else"" direction. Aside from Ron Perlman, the acting was mediocre at best (of course, it's hard to act a role that's more or less undefined). My suggestion - don't waste your time or money on this one.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

A Real Treat,"Now, i had my concerns with this movie. Basically, it was because Guillermo Dell Torro was directing. It's not like i don't like his films or anything like that, but 'Mimic' was average at best, in my honest opinion. My friend, however, was raving about this film. I couldn't actually understand the reasons for his thrill, because i thought this movie would also be a 'so so' flick, like 'Mimic'. After seeing the trailer, my expectations for this movie grew just a little bit, but i still had my doubts. When it came out, me and my friend went to the premiere. To be honest, this movie lived beyond my expectations. Ron Pearlman does an amazing job carrying the heavy look of Hellboy, although in some scenes he looks pretty clumsy, if you ask me. But overall, he couldn't have done it better. I'm always happy to see John Hurt in a movie, no matter what movie it is. And this one was no exception. Love his strong British accent, his solid actor play and the way he manages to it in any role given to him. But what really amazes me is Del Torro's determination to have Pearlman for the role of Hellboy. I heard the studio wanted actors like The Rock or Vin Deasel(actor?). But Del Torro remained strong with his choice. This led to decrease in the films budget - from 80 000 000$ to 60 000 000$. And Del Torro didn't even care as long as he got Mr. Pearlman for the leading role. This kind of determination is what i would like to see in every Hollywood director. And i think the budget slip didn't even effect the films quality. I don't think those 20 000 000$ would have made a difference. All in all, this is an amazing film.

Surprisingly Good,"While I can't say this movie was entirely my cup of tea but it was much better than expected. You have the feeling that you are looking at an actual comic book. I never thought this movie would have so much cross over appeal but Perlman was very well cast in this part. His quips, wry humor, and just complete take on Hellboy was note perfect. He also successfully humanizes him which is an incredible feat considering the character's appearance.  The chemistry between Selma Blair and Perlman was surprisingly very convincing. This may get a little scary for a smaller child but it is rated PG-13. The movie can tend to make you feel like it is wondering a little bit b/c the premise is so bizarre but del Toro ties up all the loose ends with a rewarding ending and makes you wonder when Hellboy 2 will come out.

I expected a bad movie, but what I saw was beyond horrible. The plot made no sense. The cutesy red demon child was gay, that Nazi gas mask guy spins his knives like an idiot instead of killing Hellboy. Hellboy spews random horrible punch lines until the demon gets p***ed of and attacks him. All Hellboy has to do is PULL THE F*CK*NG trigger to his enormous gun and the demon would be dead.

"A good, solid start","I found Hellboy to be a worthy first entry in its' ever-growing series. The commercial success of this film led director Guillermo Del Toro to make Pan's Labyrinth so it also serves as kind of coming out party for such a stellar film-maker. The film runs kind of like a moody, dark, and disarming tale of MIB only were dealing with monsters as opposed to aliens. The real reason this film works is because of its' cast. Ron Perlman is utterly awesome as Hellboy as a someone is truly angered and dealing with a never-ending identity crisis. Selma Blair is kind of simple, but shows her character as one who knows she's vulnerable and scarred and confused as to how she can help the team and Hellboy the man...yes he ACTS like a man...she cares so much for. The action is solid and you can clearly see Del Toro's visuals in almost every scene. I found the scenes in Russia to be breathtaking. The storytelling is thin but the fact that the villains are Nazi's helps because no matter what you always hate them. The plot also seems a predictable bore at times but you don't really notice which is a testament to the cast and Del Toro. All in all this a good movie and a stellar comic-book movie with fantastic driven performances, stunning visuals, solid action and a disarming sense of humor.

Basically, the story is about a character on Earth from another dimension facing two battles: evil creatures from his dimension and love. I liked the character's personalities. Hellboy is laidback and tell jokes while fighting and Liz is just calm and collected except when in immediate danger. The acting is fairly good. I enjoyed the characters.

Better than its peers,"Hellboy is about a demon who works for the FBI. The plot is generic, bad guys want to unleash Armageddon, good guys must stop them. But what this movie lacks in originality it makes up for in every other department..Hellboy is genuinely fun and Guillermo Del Toro's eye for good composition makes a movie about a hideous brute, actually very beautiful. The action is well paced; the characters are shallow yet eccentric and interesting. One of my main problems with similar comic book movies is how the makers swamp the screen with enough CGI to sink the Titanic, and throw action sequences at the audience in the hope that some may stick in the mind of Joe Cinema-goer for longer than half a minute. Hellboy didn't have the uber-budget of a Spiderman (a franchise that bores me beyond belief) but Del Toro spent his pennies wisely and all the CGI effects are effective, seamless and limitedly spectacular.Ron Perlman is excellent as Hellboy; his presence enriches the hero with a sense and genuine power and subtle, childlike wit. There are not many layers to the characters for the viewer to slowly unravel, each character plays to type (the scientist, love interest, annoying boss and so on) but the supporting cast all perform admirably. John Hurt helps the story progress with a fair amount of exposition and Jeffery Tambor is funny-bordering-on-hilarious as Hellboy's insecure and incompetent boss. Also David Hyde Pierce of 'Frasier' fame is perfectly cast as a clairvoyant talking fish.The bad guys are a sight to behold; Rasputin is menacing but underutilised, Karl Ruprecht Kroenen (aka the gas mask wearing, knife wielding, gimp) is a grotesque creation and perfectly re-created from the rich source material of the comics.Overall, Hellboy is a smaller movie than its peers, and it's all the better for it",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Pretty good movie,"When I first heard that Hellboy was coming out, I had also heard it was being made by the same guy who made Blade 2. I was a little less than enthused about seeing Hellboy. I was pleasantly surprised.After seeing the previews and hearing about how this was a comic book based movie from one of my co-workers, I was a little more interested. Unfortunately, I had never heard of this particular comic, but I am always up for seeing a new comic book based movie. Then it probably helped that it had a few ""names"" in the cast list too.Then I saw the actual movie. The story was a little weird at first, but keeping in mind it was a comic book, it was easy to maintain that sense of the story. The story was entertaining, the action scenes were good, the occasional comic relief mainly in one scene in particular was cute too. Overall, it was really good. My only complaint would be that he special effects were decent, but not spectacular.Since I have never read the comic for this series, I don;t know how true to the story it was, but as a movie, I thought it was pretty good. I'd recommend this movie if you have already seen the bigger budget Spiderman, X-Men and Superman movies and you are looking for something fresh.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Fun, cool...but no where near classic status.","X-men...classic depiction of a comic book, beautiful characters, you actually care for them. In Hell boy, the characters are well developed, its just that it's lacking in plot. No subplots besides the love story between Hellboy and Liz. It was a decent subplot, besides Ron Pearlman, and some really cool looking characters, the movie does not remind me of anything other than Men in Black 2. Just plain and corny looking Monsters, and a boring Plot. Great visuals...I loved the Character Hellboy, there is a very human side to him, almost like an ordinary Joe. He was cool and down to earth, and even though the movie was corny at times (only Marvel comic book movies are realistic, in the sense that they make you believe ...(for example)that a science experiment can change you can't it? but as far as Nazi's opening up Portholes and bringing in Demonic creatures from hell? Thats a little too campy. So I guess the unique cool looking characters and their personalities allow the movie to get the well deserving high 6's rating. but anything over a 7 would not be right...its a little above average, and it entertained me for 2 hours, but it's no where on the same level as the x-men films, or even spiderman. **1/2 stars out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Take it or leave it.,"Even though films made of comic books aren't usually my thing, I thought I'd try this out just because my co-worker couldn't stop raving about it. Maybe my expectations were a tad bit too high, because I didn't come away from the film as excited about it as she apparently was. In a nutshell, I could take it or leave it. It's not one of those films that I wish I hadn't seen, but it's also not a film I'd want to see more than once.Ron Perlman did a very good job portraying his character - both his strengths and weaknesses, and he brought a certain level of credibility to him. At first, you weren't sure if you'd like the character, but by the end of the film, Perlman had made him pretty endearing, I thought. The villains were pure evil - as you'd expect from this kind of film, but they were also very interesting, with their own set of weapons and abilities.The special effects were done well, and much more seamlessly than we've seen in other FX films recently. I personally thought the CGI was better in this film than it was in the new Star Wars, Harry Potter, or even Lord of the Rings films.You don't watch a film like this for the writing or the dialogue, and this movie is pretty typical as far as superhero films go. The dialogue was good in some places, and bad in others. This film doesn't take itself too seriously, but I thought in some places, it was just plain silly. I could say the same about the plot - it was predictable, slow and tedious at times, but interesting and exciting in others.All things considered, I gave this film a rating of 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Awsome.,Beautiful and fun with a bit taken from the graphic novel.,,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Fun,"I thought `Hellboy' was a fun movie.  It isn't deep or understated but it is loud, special-effects laden escapist fare.  The cast was effective.  The bad guys were real bad and the good guys were there to battle the bad guys. The movie included Nazis, demons from Hell and an evil Blonde Nazi in love with a reincarnated Rasputin.  What more could you ask for.  Hellboy himself was played very well by Ron Perlman who gave him a vulnerability and cockiness that you wish to see in a lead monster.  The story was fast paced and slightly ridiculous but it held your attention and entertained.  It is well worth seeing  if you wish to entertained and not challenged.   The movie does not take itself too seriously but is more of a live action (or live through CGI) cartoon.  Too many action movies, like the Matrix stuff, take themselves far too seriously.  With this movie you want to relax  and laugh at the preposterousness of the plot .  I left the theater grinning and glad I saw the movie.  Isn't that what you want.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Oh, Hell","I never noticed it before, but Guillermo del Toro is one of THOSE directors.You know, the one who has a phenomenal visual sense, but has no idea what to do with those bothersome things called ""actors."" To see this problem at its worst, make note of the awful ""Bulletproof Monk,"" but del Toro is several shades better in that he hides it very, very well. In fact, so well I never noticed until now.The average movie-goer doesn't care. If you've seen this movie, you probably didn't even notice that the actors just kind of stand around, and when they do move (in any scene where they're not replaced by CGI-effects), it's without much thought to it (walking down a hall; walking down a street).The action sequences are very creative, I really did like this movie. Thumbs up. But I can't give it any better than a B. Great effects, great acting, but the storytelling was only so/so, and so was the dialogue. I felt like I was watching the 2nd season premiere of some HBO series, or worse, 3 or 4 episodes from the middle of season 2 just kinda crunched together. There was no arc to it-- this happened, then that happened, the end. Characters came back from the dead so easily, it's like, what's the importance of even killing them in the first place? The bad guys are just gonna get up again in 5 minutes. Where's the rest of the story?Despite ALL this, I didn't hate it. Ron Perlman and Selma Blair are way too charismatic, even when they're given lines that are MEANT to sound cool but were actually written by a 40-year-old filmmaker who thinks he has the same taste in one-liners as a 20-year-old. Granted, yes, I liked this better than Del Toro's ""Blade 2,"" but there's still major room for improvement here. Any word on when the world will get ""Hellboy Returns,"" or better yet ""Hellboy Forever?""If they're better than the first one, the way ""X-2"" was light years better than ""X-Men,"" then those are the films I want to see. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

All I can say is that it was REALLY BAD.I couldn't believe such a dismal attempt at film making. It has no redeeming features, EVERYTHING is a HUGE disaster. HELLBOY is absolute garbage from start to finish. Ron Perlman is Ok as Hellboy, but, can anybody recognize him under that pile of make up? Any big size actor in the planet can ""play"" Hellboy really. For years when the subject of awful movies (based on comic-books or not) would come up I would say HELLBOY is the worst of them all, Del Toro will never be Bryan Singer or Sam Raimi.

Both Guillermo del Toro and Mike Mignola give their all in creating a movie that's exciting, fun, -and- adventurous for everyone.

Masterpiece,"10/10! Hellboy is a cinematic masterpiece that perfectly captures the essence of Mike Mignola's beloved comic book series. Guillermo del Toro's direction is nothing short of brilliant, bringing a unique visual style and sense of humor to the film that's both faithful to the source material and freshly imaginative. Ron Perlman is absolute perfection as the titular character, bringing a lovable, lumbering charm to the role that's impossible not to adore. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Doug Jones, Selma Blair, and John Hurt delivering memorable performances that add depth and richness to the story. The film's action sequences are intense and thrilling, the makeup and visual effects are stunning, and the script is both clever and heartfelt. What truly sets Hellboy apart, however, is its thoughtful exploration of identity, community, and what it means to be a hero. This is a film that's not just about monsters and mayhem, but about finding your place in the world and embracing your true self. Overall, Hellboy is a must-see for fans of superhero movies, fantasy adventures, and just great storytelling in general - it's a wildly entertaining, visually stunning, and deeply resonant film that will leave you cheering for more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Almost perfect!,"You know, this film is superb on SO many levels, it makes it close to perfect.The cinematography is beautiful (props to Guillermo Navarro). Most of the shots in the movie are moving shots, which breathes much more life into the movie than just straight-ons. And, since its a comic book adaptation, it's important that it feels real.The acting is super! I wasn't really a big Ron Perlman (I didn't hate him, but I didn't really care for him) before this movie, but I thought Perlman was PERFECT as Hellboy. And Selma Blair as Liz. And John Hurt as Professor Broom. And Karl Roden as Grigori. And...EVERYBODY else. This movie has one of the best and most talented casts in the past decade!The special effects were some of the best I've seen in YEARS! Granted, they're not perfect, but they're certainly better than Blade II's (Guillermo Del Toro's movie before Hellboy). In fact, I can only think of one scene I was really disappointed with in this film (Hellboy crushing the can with his stone hand).The music in Hellboy is the best I've heard from Marco Beltrami so far. I don't think a bad score could destroy a good movie, but it could definitely subtract from its overall feel. Beltrami's score in this movie is fantastic! It's obvious he put a lot of work and thought into it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Good Special Effects, but Limited Character and Story Development","I'd been looking forward to seeing Hellboy, based on the publicity. I've enjoyed several graphic novels and/or books based upon them. The best of the movies, like Spiderman, the first Superman with Christopher Reeves, the first Batman, X-men, and even the Hulk, successfully capture the wonder and mood that made each comic popular. In the best comic films, newcomers to the story are drawn into the world of that hero and the particular themes that make him or her resonate. (Wonder Woman movie, please!) I didn't have that experience with the hellishly boring Hellboy, and perhaps that is due to its lesser fame. Many people have a basic knowledge of Superman, for example, and that familiarity can make identifying with the characters easier.Unevenly paced and unbalanced in tone, Hellboy evokes a team of writers struggling to condense a potentially complicated story world into something brief and manageable. It's possible; Peter Jackson did it in Lord of the Rings. Hellboy just didn't work. The characters were sketches, identifiable by one sentence tags, and it was a shame, because it seems like they might have interesting stories from the comics---too bad you don't get that nuance in the actual film. Ron Perlman invests Hellboy with a lot of presence and charisma, but that's a tribute to the actor rather than the dialogue. Rupert Evans was likable, but under utilized. It would have been nice to see Selma Blair as something more than the obligatory love object. Though the FX looked fine, the action scenes seemed strangely boring and random, with major characters being disposed of in anti-climactic manner. Even the villains were disposable and easily dispatched. A very quick ""kill the boss-monster"" ending only increased the movie's feel of being something rushed and underdeveloped.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Hellboy fun to look at, but not a lot else","Guillermo del Toro has made good films before.  He helmed Blade II, an exhilarating, gothic, action-packed sequel to the surprisingly stylish original, and showed that he had a flare for directing `comic book' movies. Some of this flare can be seen in certain frames of Hellboy, where we get the feeling that we could freeze any particular frame and insert it directly into one of the original comics and it would blend right in with the rest of the images.  Unfortunately, this visual aspect is really the only noteworthy aspect of Hellboy.Based on a comic, the movie follows the fairly cheesy activities of Hellboy, a demon brought into the world through a portal constructed by Rasputin and the Nazis to wreak havoc on the Earth, who was taken and raised for good by the Department for Paranormal Research and Defense after the Nazi's plan was foiled by US troops.  Right..Anyway, surprisingly this kind of ridiculous camp quality is not necessarily where the movie has its downfall.  There's a lot of fun to be had if del Toro could just find a happy medium between Men in Black type intentional cheesiness, and some of the style he harnessed with Blade II. True, the movie recognizes its own goofiness and tries to use that to its full effect, making us roll our eyes and laugh quite often, but there's no control behind it.  Del Toro seems to have just told everybody to go hog-wild on the cheesy fun and forgotten that he was making a movie in the process.The result is that after about a half-hour we get tired of the intentionally lame one-liners, the over-the-top monsters, and the annoying, scholarly fish-man (aptly named Abraham Sapien), and our concentration drifts to all the things to not like in the film.Allow me to illustrate.  Selma Blair plays Hellboy's troubled love interest, a girl who is able to start fires with her mind, but is unable to control exactly when this happens.  Luckily, Hellboy happens to be immune to fire.But then Hellboy really seems to be a movie full of immunities.  Like when a monster he fights repeatedly (to the point where we are begging to see something different) begins laying eggs in the sewers and spawning more of itself at random for no real apparent reason other than to provide us with another sewer scene reminiscent of Blade II, without any of the tension, visual ferocity, or stylization.  Apparently Hellboy is also immune to gaping plot holes.Then there's when the Nazis come back onto the scene with a resurrected Rasputin in tow and attempt to pass themselves off as characters in the final acts, desperately trying to rush out some sort of a plotting conflict involving Hellboy opening up a portal to the netherworld.by this point I was crying.  However, it's when a portal opens up, seemingly from the moon, and a giant squid-like creature comes down to Earth (maybe to save us from the rest of this movie?) that we finally see Hellboy's true fighting capabilities as he straps explosives onto his body, allows the uber-squid to eat him, and detonates the explosives from inside the squid's stomach, propelling him unscathed amid a scatter-storm of tentacles and special effects.  So among other things, Hellboy must also be immune to monsters' digestive systems, earth-shattering explosions, and the schemes of one-dimensional villains.Now I'm ripping on this movie pretty hard, maybe harder than it deserves.  After all, the preposterousness is the point, and there are plenty of entertaining moments throughout (like Hellboy's love for baby kittens, or his rooftop conversation with a 12 year old about love), but the absurdity is taken too far at times, resulting in a movie where the battles are so over-the-top that they all feel the same, where the hero can't be hurt in any way, shape, or form, and where we've had most of the fun we're going to have within the first 30 minutes.After this it's all just too much and there are more scenes and lines that elicit eye-roles than those that get laughs.  I had a stupid grin on my face for a lot of Hellboy, and it is very much a comic book on screen. Now del Toro just needs to refine things a little bit and ration the cheesy humor.  And I wouldn't be surprised, with the way Hollywood is today, if in the near future we find out that the one thing Hellboy isn't immune to is a sequel.**(out of ****)",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A fun ride the whole way through,"This is truly one of the best comic-to-movie adaptations I've ever seen, as in up there with X2 and the original Batman. After X2 amazed us it seemed hopeless, ""The Hulk"" and ""Daredevil"" were both awful, and it seemed like there would be nothing good to ever again come of comic movies. But this one reminded us that there is hope. To start with, we have Ron Perlman (Enemy at the Gates, anyone? This guy's awesome.) The only good acting performance in the entirety of ""Alien: Resurrection"", and when I think of it the only actor who could really pull this role off. Hellboy's a simple guy, he'd enjoy saving Earth from apocalyptic beasts just as much as a beer and some nachos, definitely not the average superhero, and Perlman did a good job with the character, his dislike of being a ""freak"", his love for Liz, all of it was well-done. Then we've got Liz played by Selma Blair. Amazing, truly amazing. Selma Blair's a really great actress, even in that ""Cruel Intentions"" movie, and here she really captures Liz's actual level of fear of her powers.In addition David Hyde Pierce did an amazing job as the voice of Abe Sapien, and the body actor (can't remember his name) also did a great job adapting the character to screen. And as with any action movie we have to talk about stunts and graphics: the CGI was incredible, the action sequences were mind-blowing and captivating (I couldn't turn away once!), and with all this it clearly has to be del Toro's greatest film, even better than ""The Devil's Backbone"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Entertaining thanks to Del Toro's direction and Perlman's performance,"Hellboy is a very unique and entertaining comic book action movie. it succeeds in supplying great action,imagination and compelling characters. Guillermo Del Tore was an excellent choice to direct this movie. He fuels it with dark fantasy and imaginative visuals,creatures and plot devices. His style of film making makes this film a joy to watch as we soak up his dazzling vision. I must also give credit to Ron Perlman for his brilliant performance as Hellboy. He makes Hellboy sympathetic,likable,funny,witty and dynamic. He holds your attention whenever he is on screen and radiates confidence,power and also a bit of a sensitive side. Hellboy is very self aware and we can tell that he wishes he could fit in and be accepted and despite the fact that some people may fear him,he doesn't hate outside people. The other great performance in this movie is by John Hurt as Hellboys father. He is the wise confident leader who is also a great father figure for Hellboy. One other thing that I loved about this movie was the mythology used here. It is imaginative,frightening and some how very threatening in this film. This film is not without some flaws,some plot elements and characters aren't fully developed(villains mostly) and the film lacks some focus. But these flaws don't hold the movie back to much. this film is fun fast and entertaining but it is also thought full and somewhat touching.

I felt sorry for none of them -- they were so obviously props for an action film that it was like watching a Star Trek episode populated almost exclusively by red shirts.And did you really feel that the ending was tension-filled or even difficult for Hellboy?

Hell Yeah!,"Another comic-based movie, some may say and yes, this is another comic-based-movie.

Del Toro makes a good drawing of his characters, he avoids any up and downs, and achieves a nice and praiseworthy ""in crescendo"" effect. He didn't go mad neither choosing the actor: he recruited a cast of non-stars such as Ron Perlman (City Of The Lost Children), who performs a perfect Hellboy that it can be defined as a mixture of Hulk and Tom Waits. John Hurt plays the priest (Hellboy's godfather), Selma Blair plays the hero's beloved one, and a crew of nice guest starrings (mainly unknown, at least in Europe) do the rest.Conclussion: nice escapist cinema, well conducted action, a very solid script and, above all, Ron Perlman in state of grace (he demonstrates he's one of the most versatile actor of the last 25 years).

Colourful yet grim fantasy tale,"Here's a fantasy film, a comic book adaptation actually, that isn't afraid to fully commit to its world. The world of Hellboy is a strange, multilayered and bizarre combination of influences from Christian mythology to Russian history to weird pulp science fiction. Yet under Guillermo del Toro's direction it all takes shapes and starts to make sense. The world is never explained in detail, like in some other superhero films. We never get to know where most of the weirdness comes from or what it really means in the grand scheme of things, but it all feels like it has a purpose. It feels real within the realm of the film.So what's the story. There lives a demon, the eponymous Hellboy (Ron Perlman), who was brought to Earth during World War Two by Rasputin (Karel Roden), who was working for Hitler at the time - but of course he was - but who was taken in and raised by an American professor Trevor Broom (John Hurt) when his group of Alliance soldiers helped to stop Rasputin. But now Hellboy must face his original enemy and learn who he really is. It is an outlandish tale and the film is brave enough to not beat around the bush with it. It doesn't try to modernize the character, it doesn't try to make it more sleek and current. It's good, old-fashioned geeky story and damn proud of it.The reason why I didn't rate the film any higher is that I think the central story would have been fine as it it. It would have been strong enough to work as a pure adventure film. Unfortunately the plot is diluted by needless side characters and their story arcs and the connections to Hellboy's own arc. Take for instance John Myers (Rupert Evans), who gets transferred to Hellboy's unit from FBI. He's the audience surrogate, there to allow other characters to explain things to him. Yet the thing is that the film doesn't really need an audience surrogate. It's a complex world, but as I said earlier, del Toro's directing is strong enough to explain the world through other means. Surprisingly little is explained through Myers, making him absolutely pointless. Then there's the director of the unit, the various agents, other ""freaks"" of the unit, various bad guys and so on. I get that most of them are from the original comic books. It makes sense that they wanted to include them in the film. It just pains me, because there's such a good adventure plot, which gets buried beneath all the establishing scenes when the film tries to cram in yet another character. Plus there's a romance subplot, because of course there is...If I'm being completely honest with myself, I have to admit that my dislike for this film is more than little irrational. Objectively looking it's a fine film. The main leads are very strong in their roles, the film looks great even today and the mythos is especially intriguing. I just can't reconcile with myself about what I want this film to be and what it actually is. If you're a fan of gritty adventures, comic book movies or full and detailed fantasy worlds, then I'd give this one a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Consequently we don't care the least bit when any of them are placed in mortal danger and by the time the movie is over the only thing left to say is, ""So what?""

Dark~Horse Commeth.,"I just finished watching ""Hell Boy"" for the first time and I was very happy with what I saw.  The viewing started with very little knowledge of the storyline.

I knew of ""Hell Boy"", but past that my knowledge was limited.  I remember seeing the trailer for the first time and I just had to see it.  I love the dark quality and when they mix fantasy with history it just adds to the experience.  I was happy they had an actor play ""Hell Boy"" rather than using CGI like they did with the ""Hulk"".  Perlman pulled off a great performance and proved to me an actor could have played the Hulk.  I don't care what anyone says.  I am a lifetime Hulk fan and even though I liked the movie, I disagreed with then not casting an actor to play the Green Monster.From movies like ""Hulk"" and ""Spiderman"" where my knowledge is far greater, I can tell where they took artistic freedoms with the storyline.  Of course, I have no idea how close they stayed to the comic book.  I liked what I saw and that's all I can base this on.  This movie was very interesting and pulled the viewer in.  There was always something cool happening, like crazy imagery.  It rocked. I would highly suggest it and there is another one in the making from what I hear.Check it out.  Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Awesome,"Let me tell you this: HELLBOY was awesome! Maybe I'm a bit biased, seeing how I've been reading the comic for about 10 years now, but then again that in itself would make me more critical. Not saying that the movie went 100% by the book, but it was close enough and the production value was off the charts, I just sat there like a little kid in the candy store. So if you want to see the big red son of Satan, who's right hand is the litterally the key to destroying our world, smoke cigars, eat pancakes, cookies and milk, play with kittens, smash Nazis, insane Russian monks, and the giant primordial gods of chaos, it is a 10 in my book!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Great movie! Possibly a classic!,"I thought Hellboy was an excellent film! The cast was chosen well. Ron Perlman was awesome in My opinion. He put so much excitement into the Hellboy character. He looked so neat as well. In fact his character has not only become of My favorites but Perlman himself has become one of My favorite actors. Selma Blair was also good and she looked neat. Doug Jones also played a great and colorful character. John Hurt, Jeffrey Tambor, Brian Steele, Corey Johnson, Rupert Evans, Ladislav Beran, and Biddy Hodson was also very good. All of the characters have great personalities in My opinion. The music by Marco Beltrami is very good. The action is awesome to watch, the special effects are realistic, and the direction by Guillermo del Toro is great. In My opinion The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen should have been like this. I strongly recommend this great action packed movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
well...it certainly was a movie,"It's going to be difficult to find 1000 words to use in reviewing a movie that put me to sleep, but I'll try my darnedest, because I think it's important that people be warned of its sombulatory effects. Given my druthers, I'd like this review to be a simple five word sentence: ""It put me to sleep."", but IMDB guidelines force me to go on. Still, my further review will just be fluff around the fact that I fell asleep, so if you're just reading for the primary point, you've already passed it, and can now stop reading the rest.First, I love action/adventure movies. If I'd never seen one before, Hellboy would probably be a favorite. But, as I've seen many, there wasn't a single thing in Hellboy to keep my interest. Not in the plot, not in the dialogue, and not in the details (except for one of the villains, who had a cool ability, that the film makers than ruinned by completely circumventing it). If you've seen both Men In Black movies, then you already know the full plot arch of this film, as well as many of the details. If you've seen more than two action films since the mid-80s, then you know all of the dialogue.I can't believe there's a sequel already in the works. Hollywood is out of ideas.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Uninspired for the most part,"Hellboy kind of sleepwalks through a thousand old comic-book cliches, and doesn't really introduce anything new or refreshing to the genre.  The story skips over 60 years of the title character's life, and makes no effort at all to explain what may have happened in that period to shape a demon into U.S. government agent.  Needless to say, the World War II origin scene was the most inspired, and a better movie may have been lurking in the years that shaped Hellboy, not the end product.  What we are left with is Ron Perlman as a semi-ticked off, cigar chomping brute who non-chalantly dispatches his opponents and shows little to no concern about any danger that awaits him or others.  If you read comics as a kid (or now), you know this covers roughly a quarter of the Marvel roster. Hellboy's cohorts are nothing special either, Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) is almost a direct knock-off of Charlie McGee in Firestarter (we get no background on their romance), and John Myers (Rupert Evans) just sort of reacts to his partner's destructive tendencies.  The only interesting characters to me were Professor Broom (John Hurt) as Hellboy's ""father"", and undead Nazi assassin Kroenen (Karel Roden).  The action scenes were pretty standard, typical CGI stuff.  I did like the fact that an actor portrayed Hellboy, and he wasn't computer-generated.  That makes the movie much more watchable.  Just don't be surprised if you've completely forgotten about this movie 2 hours after you've left the theatre.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"Hellboy, a lonely boy once again comes to save the world from the dark!","A nice movie, but i think they should've changed the ending a little bit.  It was kinda like Men In Black, except not really a comedy....Of course, it was better than Men In Black.  I would recommend it to people.  The story didn't really make sence at the end, they shouldn't have made it like a love story thing, i mean, it was action before, why make it a love now?  But i have to admit, the movie was good.  The people in it was pritty famous and all, too.  Plus, Hellboy was hot! (Kinda...)  Go see Hellboy now and see how he does!  Bring a pal along with you so you can talk about it after the movie.... Or that's what i did.  It's 2hours and 5 min. long, but it seemed longer than that.Good thing or bad thing?  I would say, a bad thing.

i just saw the movie could have been so much better,OK first off i just wanted to say a couple things that i hadn't seen posted that i was unimpressed with. 1. i saw myers get hit by a car and blown up yet nothing happened to him he was fine i was also told he was pure of heart yet never got a description of that. 2. i saw a hound of resurrection that all the sudden stopped regenerating for some reason. 3. i saw a man that wouldn't die even thought he had been killed several times throughout history just lose his will to live i suppose because a rock fell on him. i just to sum this up think there was some really good opportunity's in this movie for some cool good back story but they just seemed to skip that part and move you on through. i just thought it was weak throw it away with the hulk.,,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

How good is Hellboy 21 years later,"Twenty one years after the release of Hellboy, Guillermo del Toro action fantasy remains one of the greatest comic book adaptations. The plot and images convey the enchantment and legendary animals to the unimaginative evil, giving what should be a short film an enormous size of a vast cosmos outside of our own. I don't frequently see films where the actors, like John Hurt, Selma Blair, and Ron Perlman, effortlessly inhabit their parts, convey a sense of being that character for longer than they actually have, and understand their performances. Some of the best on-screen creature designs are produced by a combination of practical effects and visual effects, which have a lot of fantasy and horror components.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

(People don't fly through the air for 15 seconds parallel to the ground without gravity having any affect.)I thought this movie would be a cult classic or at least have some of the style of movies like Blade.

"Good FX, some funny lines, the rest sucked","I know this is a cartoon and not supposed to do more than mildly entertain an adult, but this one tries too hard for some sort of meaningful emotional plot between the red thing and some mousy wench -- the history of which relationship we are told absolutely nothing. It's all very mysterious and presumably supposed to be profound, I suppose, but I found it rather annoying.  It could be that the writing and editing was just phenomenally rotten, but it looks like all this silliness was on purpose.The CGI (or whatever they did the FX with) was exceptional, and almost worth the price of the rental. However, the production just couldn't seem to decide whether it was just kiddie-action cartoon stuff or an actual movie. I couldn't either, so I quit about three-quarters of the way through.It may just be an age thing. To me, and most other baby-boomers, comics were just kid things, not to be taken seriously by adults. Aside from the Simpsons and South Park, almost all the rest just seems to juvenile to bother with.I give it a 3, and then only with reluctance.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
yes!,"Anyone who expects a comic book movie to not be cheesy, full of computer animations and a sometimes non-detailed plot has to be a moron.

If you like chick flicks where everyone is full of angst and sorrow about complex dating rituals, etc. then this isn't your movie.

The special effects were neat too. Especially the makeup and creature effects. All in all, this is 2 hours of solid film. Good acting, a sharp script, and awesome effects. I do have one question. Why couldn't we have seen more of Abe-Sapien? He was a cool character. Well, I can't wait for the sequel. Here's hoping there even is a sequel to this wonderful movie.

Best comic book adaptation ever,"I love this movie. I saw it four times in the theater and four more times since I bought the 2 disc DVD. I am now waiting with bated breath for the Director's Cut DVD which is still on its way to me. You may wonder why I love this film so much since I am not into comic books nor do I usually love this kind of action film and I have a very simple answer for you: Ron Perlman, Ron Perlman, Ron Perlman, and also John Hurt.It's the subtext of their father/son relationship in this film that really makes it for me. That, and also the Catholic subtext to the film, that take this film far beyond films that have a much more serious surface. But the great thing about this film is that the surface is so much fun as well. The film works on so many different levels. That's one reason why I watched it more than once.If I really like something I will almost always watch it again at least a second time. If I like it just as well or even better the second time around it's a good film. If I like it the most on my seventh or eighth viewing than it's a real classic.The Catholic subtext of this film also ended up making viewing ""Hellboy"" one of the major recent spiritual experiences of my life. Frankly, in my opinion this film isn't just destined to be one of the best of 2004, it is destined to be one of the great classics of this decade.I'm not a reader of comic books, but I loved this film so much I sat down and read everything I could get my hands on by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola.I also read the prose novels written by Chris Golden based on Mignola's characters and all of the short stories written by horror writers also based on Hellboy. I've read all of the spin-off comics as well. The comics are just as great as the movie. Or I really should say that the movie is just as great as the original comics it is based on even though the adaptation in the film changes some of it.I haven't become this enamored of something since I first read ""Lord of the Rings"" when I was 16. I read that book 30 times and saw each of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films three times. I did enjoy those films, but it says something about the movie ""Hellboy"" that I've seen it eight times and counting. ""Hellboy"" is not necessarily a better movie than the ""Lord of the Rings"" film, but it is a better adaptation, in my opinion, of its original than Jackson managed with Tolkien.Kudos to Guillermo del Toro for bringing Mike Mignola's big red hero to the screen with such panache. And a big kiss to Ron Perlman for bringing him to life in a larger than life way. I've so fallen in love with Hellboy, both movie and comic, that I've written five fan fictions based on its characters and am working on the fifth chapter to my latest story. And I usually HATE writing.I hope ""Hellboy 2"", scheduled for release in 2006, will be as fresh, funny, and original as this ended up being for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Review on hell boy for brothers,"I loved this movie its not that terrifying as annabelle but still good. From the moment the credits roll and the thunderous soundtrack kicks in, the 2019 reboot of ""Hellboy"" grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Directed by Neil Marshall, this film is a bold and energetic reimagining of the beloved comic book character created by Mike Mignola. With a stellar cast led by David Harbour as the titular character, ""Hellboy"" delivers an exhilarating blend of action, dark humor, and supernatural elements, making it a thrilling ride for both fans of the comics and newcomers alike.David Harbour's portrayal of Hellboy is nothing short of fantastic. He embodies the character with a perfect mix of gruffness and vulnerability. Harbour brings depth to Hellboy, allowing audiences to connect with him despite his demonic origins. His performance is enhanced by the film's witty dialogue, which is peppered with one-liners and moments of introspection. This balance of humor and seriousness is one of the film's strong suits. It's refreshing to see a hero who wrestles with his identity and purpose, and Harbour's nuanced performance captures this internal struggle beautifully.The story itself is a captivating tale of good versus evil, with Hellboy caught in the middle. As he faces off against the Blood Queen, played by the terrifyingly enchanting Mila Jovovich, the stakes are raised. Jovovich's performance is a standout, and she embodies the malevolence of her character with an infectious energy that contrasts perfectly with Harbour's Hellboy. The dynamic between these two characters fuels much of the film's tension, and their confrontations are some of the most exciting moments on screen.Visually, ""Hellboy"" is a feast for the eyes. The film is filled with stunning special effects and imaginative creature designs that stay true to Mignola's distinctive art style. The cinematography captures the dark, gritty atmosphere of the narrative, immersing viewers in a world filled with supernatural threats and gothic landscapes. From the eerie forests to the grotesque creatures that populate Hellboy's world, the visuals are both striking and imaginative. The practical effects, combined with CGI, create a unique aesthetic that feels authentic and engaging.The action sequences are another highlight of the film. From intense battles with mythical beasts to Hellboy's signature weapon, the Right Hand of Doom, the choreography is exhilarating and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The film doesn't shy away from the violent nature of its source material, and fans of the comics will appreciate the gritty realism that comes with Hellboy's battles. Each fight scene is not only thrilling but also infused with a sense of purpose, driving the narrative forward.Moreover, ""Hellboy"" excels in its supporting characters. The film introduces a diverse cast, including the formidable Alice Monaghan, played by Sasha Lane, who brings her own unique abilities and backstory to the mix. The chemistry between Hellboy and his allies adds a layer of camaraderie that enhances the narrative. These relationships are explored in meaningful ways, showcasing the importance of teamwork and friendship in the face of overwhelming odds.One of the film's most commendable aspects is its commitment to staying true to the tone of the comics. It embraces the darker, more mature themes while also celebrating the absurdity and humor that fans expect. The blend of horror and comedy is executed flawlessly, and the film never takes itself too seriously, allowing for moments of levity even in the darkest scenarios.In conclusion, ""Hellboy"" (2019) stands out as a thrilling and visually stunning adaptation that pays homage to its comic book roots while introducing the character to a new generation. With a charismatic performance from David Harbour, a compelling narrative, and breathtaking visuals, it manages to capture the essence of what makes Hellboy such an iconic character. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the comics or just looking for an entertaining movie experience, ""Hellboy"" delivers on all fronts. It's a grand spectacle filled with heart, humor, and horror-an adventure that is well worth taking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Hell let loose,"In Hellboy you enter the world of Guillermo Del Toro as he brings the comic book adaptation to life with his brand of visuals. But to put it bluntly despite the praise Ron Perlman gets for his wisecracking performance he was too old to playing Hellboy because despite his earth years he is supposed to look young and Perlman looks old despite the heavy prosthetic make up.The plot regarding Nazis using the power of the dark arts and a portal to hell harks back to Raiders of the Lost Ark. The government agency with a menagerie of alien species working for them reminds you of the Men in Black franchise.The story is rather so-so, it drags at the beginning and really just takes you from A to B to C. It relies too much on the one liners from Hellboy and despite good support from Doug Jones as Abe Sapien, John Hurt, Jeffrey Tambor and some dastardly Nazi baddies it is fairly entertaining without much depth.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Really bad movie,"I don't seem to understand all the positive comments and high rating this film has achieved. I have watched it twice at home and the second time it sucked even more than the first time. The story is so stupid that only a 9-year old could take it seriously. The dialogue is plain ridiculous, packed with clichés, lame one-liners, and some characters always seemed to know everything with or without explanation. When John says he is not pure-hearted, and the fishy guy instantly replies with his C3PO voice, ""Yes you are"", I couldn't help from laughing. With such a complete mock of a plot, most of the actors are doing okay trying to save the film from being a complete disaster. But in addition to the lack of story, the actors are also clearly miscast, with the exception of Linda Blair, who should be playing in the next adaptation of Stephen King's ""Firestarter"". A good actor like John Hurt is wasted, Karel Roden was a great villain in ""15 minutes"" but here he just looks awkward and ridiculous. Rupert Evans - completely miscast, I did not believe he was an FBI agent for one second. No negative words on Ron Perlman though, he coped with his part in the best possible way. I cannot imagine any of the top Hollywood stars handling a role of a big, ugly, red guy with cut-out horns on his forehead... Really, if the story, dialogue and effects were good (like Spider-man 1,2 and even X-Men 2), or if the movie did not take itself so seriously, this could be fun to watch. I hope they give the sequel to another writer and director who could do something better with this material...My rating: 4/10",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
This movie is one thing that is fun.,"Hellboy reminds us that comic book movies are indeed good as did both the X-Men movies and the new Punisher film. It is a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and gives us what we want in a super-hero movie: good action sequences, cool goodguys and badguys, funny moments, and suspense. This is a movie that all other directors/producers planning on making a comic book movie should follow so that we don't end up with such boring films as Daredevil which had zero character development and Hulk which was so slow you had time to go to take a ten minute run to the toilet after some bad popcorn and still not miss anything.

Hellboy,"Hellboy is one of DC Comics' less widely spread, but just as popular, franchises (they also do AvP, amongst others). It has a strong cult following, but is not as universally recognised as other comic book series like Spider-Man or X-men. This is what is wrong with this film, which was widely released to a mostly Hellboy-naïve public.I have to admit that I have not seen many of the Hellboy comics, but from what I have seen, the film seems to stick to its source material admirably. The problem is that it sticks a little too well  fans of the comics will probably love it, but the rest of us might feel a little left behind, as if the film wasn't made for us. It is also fairly surreal in its visuals, so that non-fans might be thinking ""what the hell?"" for much of the film, what with its references to other dimensions and strange magic. Other comic books, whilst not really way up there in the plausibility stakes, still take place in our universe and make them seem that much more real. Hellboy does take place in our world, but the introduction of other dimension and more surreal goings-on makes it feel too different from what we're used to. Normally I'd praise a little originality and going against the norm - God knows that Hollywood needs a good dose of that, but with this it makes the whole experience lose something, maybe a bit of the audiences' respect. However, I fully understand that writer/director Guillermo Del Toro couldn't deviate too much from the comics without upsetting the fans, and it was for them that the film was made.Anyway, to the film itself. The plot revolves around the demon Hellboy, who was conjured by the Nazis but rescued and brought up by the Americans. Now he works/fights for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence, led by his rescuer Professor Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt). They discover a plot by Rasputin to allow a squid-like monster to enter our dimension and destroy the world. Hellboy and his gang of mutants (including an amphibian and a pyro-kenetic) must go on a mission to stop him. Ron Perlman is fantastic in the role of Hellboy, and the other cast are good enough, but the problem stems from a dodgy script and lacklustre action scenes. The heavy use of CGI does not help matters as it is clearly not up to the standards that other films have reached, and the film is too heavy on the editing side that is ends up being a mess. This is a real shame as the director was also responsible for the much better Blade II, which handled all its action scenes very well.The film does start out quite promisingly, with an entertaining sequence of the stopping of Rasputin and the discovery of Hellboy. From there the film keeps its momentum until about half-way through, at which point it all starts going downhill. The potential for the film was good, but it just could not keep its head above the water. This results in the audience not really caring about what happens in the end, and it is only because of the loud noises that we are prevented from falling asleep. There is, however, one excellent scene in which Hellboy is talking to a young boy about his feelings towards Liz (Selma Blair), which perfectly sums up Hellboy's character and wise-cracking humour. But it is not enough to save the film, and with Hellboy 2 already green-lit, hopes are not high for a redemption of this comic-book franchise.Rated: 5.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
much a-latex-do about nothing,"I know some Hellboy-Comic books, I like Ron Perlman, so what better than to watch this movie, I thought. Well, I was wrong - after I got some hope after the opening scene somehow the story developed boring beyond belief, the Characters were more than linear, I would like to call them punctual (only highlight of the movie was the scene where hellboy observes his girlfriend and the new agent with a kid on the roof of a house, which was the only scene in the whole film that caught the spirit of the comic-books). The cast was awful (have no better word for it)- all actors seemed to have taken sleeping pills, Ron Perlman's acting was buried under ten pounds of Latex on the face (only highlight was Jeffrey Tambor, who played I think for his tenth film the same spleenish but likable character), the bad guys were even more boring than the good guys. I think the whole film suffered tremendously from a too short character introduction and development (good examples for character developing scenes are spiderman 2 and the coffee break with Ocatavius and his wife, or the scene with Magneto as a kid in the concentration camps).To summarise: this film could have been better if someone would have taken the time to write a solid script, it isn't enough for comic-book-based films to hasten through the character introduction and background story, just to be able to show some special effects and come to a somehow wrong timed and wrong placed happy end.so: 3 out of 10 tubs of red latex for this film",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A must-see!  You'll be surprised!!,"A big surprise!  Hellboy has a little of everything...well made, with characters that you truly care about - and are fully developed, super special effects - it's really a great film!  Much, much better than most - that's for sure...and the fight scenes are simply phenomenal.  I was glad I didn't pass this one up in the theatre - get on it, and spread the word! This is one of the few there should be a sequel for!! Ron Perlman has been one of Del Toro's regulars since Cronos - and this is a fantastic vehicle for him to show his range.  Even under all that makeup - the character comes across on many levels.  All of the supporting players are well rounded and interesting - and the whole cast has a great script to work with.  None of the lines, even the gags - are too cheesy.  It's a smart genre picture for smart viewers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Born bad, makes good.","Ron Perlman has long been an undersung master of the craft, starting with his big-time debut Quest for Fire. Unfortunately, he's been saddled more than his fir share of lemons (ie Alient: Ressurrection, Blade II). As the sardonic protagonist Hell Boy -- a baby demon raised as a human -- Perlman puts his portrayal over the top with a world of skilled understatement. And John Hurt (Midnight Express, Alien) is in fine form as the supporting lead. Director Guillermo del Toro has razor sharp instincts for both action and pathos. The problem is that horror/sci-fi/supernatural/fantasy is seldom appreciated as a legitimate genre. Hence, this film wasn't nearly as big a hit as it should have been in theaters. It is, nonetheless, a reasonably well scripted tour de force showcase for Ron Perlman, who deserves such an opportunity if anyone does.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Impressive,"Having never read any of the Hellboy comic books, I went into the movie with no idea what the plot would be about.  I used to collect comics so I knew what to expect from the genre.  (That, and I play Champions, the Hero System RPG.)I have to say I was extremely impressed with the quality of acting in this movie.  I knew that Ron would be good- I've been a fan of his since 'Beauty and the Beast'- but, wow!  This movie didn't come across as campy like a lot of the other super-genre movies (Batman, et al).  To me the characters here were believable, and I actually forgot who the actors were behind them while I watched.  That is a mark of a great movie, in my opinion.The script was a great balance between comedy and drama, just like any good comic book movie should be.  I'd say it's on par with Spiderman, if not better.The special effects were very good, too.  Personally, I wasn't happy with the 'C'Thulu-esque' style of monsters they battled but, hey, no movie is 100% perfect.  And even so, the special effects were very smoothly integrated and I didn't notice any obvious CGI effects during the show.Well done, I am ready for the sequel!M",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hellboy..,"Hellboy, directed by Guillermo del Toro, is a lousy comic adaptation that retains none of the original spirit or atmosphere of the comic. Instead it is a show-off of digital effects and a parade of various clichés: digital hyper action a la ""Matrix"", ""Aliens"" monster-chase claustrophobia, ""Indiana Jones"" lost-civilizations feelgood adventure, ""Batman"" Gothic fantasy and so on. It even incorporates some boring romantic melodrama.Add some vague pseudo-philosophy and moral preaching about what is it that defines humanity, and you have one of the most overrated movies of 2004. As Hollywood fairy-tales come and go, this is one of the worst. But essentially, Hellboy is a video game and not a film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
we're better than that!,"i know i can write 1000 words on 'hellboy' but i really don't need that long, since the film itself probably contained fewer than half that! my point is pretty simple - haven't we reached a level in film now that we as viewers are no longer satisfied with just punch-punch-punch action? don't we crave the intellectual discourse thrown at us by writers such as tarrantino and the collaboration of damon and affleck? don't we adore the depth of character thrown at us by directors such as maddocks and zemeckis? 'hellboy' seems to treat us like movie-morons, as if we couldn't have our attention sustained by dialogue for more than 5 seconds and couldn't cope with a deep and intricate character if our lives depended upon it. sorry, torro. we're better than that!",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A fun comic book movie,"Hellboy works on a number of levels: as a pure action film, as a fun comic book adaptation, and even as a decent character study. That's because Ron Perlman, best known for the TV series Beauty and the Beast, completely inhabits his character, a red-skinned half-demon who grows up in the care of the U.S. government and helps hunt down bad guys and monsters of all stripes. Perlman is very human behind his alarming makeup, and gets to wisecrack in a way that works far better than it has in other comic book-oriented films. He also is surrounded by a first-rate cast, including John Hurt as a kindly professor/mentor and Selma Blair as Hellboy's psy-powered love interest. For those who don't care a whit about comic book movies, watch it just for the subway scene. And I must say the CGI is some of the best I have seen since STARSHIP TROOPERS.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Well done - an interesting story,"When I first heard of Hellboy, it sounded like a movie I really needed to miss. I expected a cheap horror film. However, I happened to see a few minutes of it on cable TV and was immediately entertained and caught up in the story. I had to have the DVD right away and watch it end to end.I never read Hellboy comic books. However, I thought that the movie was quite well done with a great story, very good acting, nice scenery, and good creativity. I tend to like creativity in a movie. Something that tickles the imagination is far better than running the same old plots.While the movie has some of the comic book fun of Batman or Spiderman, it also uniquely has its own direction. Hellboy is clearly his own person, or monster, or whatever.Of course like many adventures, such as League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or Spiderman, a realist is likely to be dismayed and ask ""is this based on a true story?"" or would normal people act that way. No. But that is exactly what makes this movie fun for many of us. Hellboy is a good bet I think for many of us who are seeking entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
One disappointment,"I have never read a hellboy comic, but i loved the movie.  Very well told story, humorous, fabulous imagery, and a  unique lead character that is likeable.  This movie deserves noteriety and some love!  yeah, they are okay numbers, but if there is one disappointment, it's the fact that not all the comic book movie fans are checking this one out.  We live in a glorious age of comic book adaptations.  Though i am not a hellboy fan from the start, i am now, and it was because i checked the movie out not knowing that it would be a great film, but because generally i check out all the comic book adaptations.

Not So Good but........,"Yet another big blockbuster action movie based on a comic is the base of Hellboy. It's the story about one of Satan's sons who's unleashed onto earth to reek havoc. Instead of this he's taken in by a friendly scientist who takes is powers and tries to put them toward good and not evil.Hellboy was again a Hollywood flop with bad acting and one of the dumbest stories thought up by Guillermo del Toro. It's filled with mindless action and conventional story twists. Also a bad job was done by John Hurt as he tried to play the handsome and inexperienced cop who gets caught up in the supernatural mess.From beginning to end Hellboy was filled with stupid humor and uninteresting directing. The only thing that I enjoyed was the actual character Hellboy played by Ron Perlman. It was somewhat refreshing to have a unconventional type of hero as Hellboy is a cigar smoking, back talking thug, lost in the world.All in all Hellboy was bad but not horrible as there were a few bright spots but not many.

10/10 movie,"*Hellboy (2004) - A Fiery Delight*Ron Perlman's iconic portrayal of the demonic superhero Hellboy sets the tone for this visually stunning and action-packed adaptation of Mike Mignola's beloved comic book series. Director Guillermo del Toro masterfully weaves together a rich narrative, blending horror, fantasy, and humor to create a cinematic experience that's equal parts thrilling and heartwarming.The story follows Hellboy, a demon-turned-superhero, as he battles against the evil sorcerer Rasputin (Karel Roden) and his minions, who seek to unleash the apocalypse. Alongside his pyrokinetic girlfriend Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) and aquatic empath Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), Hellboy must confront his own destiny and the prophecy that threatens to destroy humanity.Perlman's performance as Hellboy is nothing short of phenomenal. He brings a perfect balance of humor, vulnerability, and toughness to the character, making it impossible not to root for this unlikely hero. The supporting cast delivers equally impressive performances, with standout moments from Blair and Jones.Del Toro's visual mastery is on full display, as he brings the dark, gothic world of Hellboy to life with breathtaking production design, atmospheric lighting, and innovative creature effects. The action sequences are fast-paced and intense, with Hellboy's battles against monstrous creatures showcasing the film's impressive visual effects.What sets Hellboy apart from other superhero movies is its unique blend of horror and humor. Del Toro's script, co-written with Peter Briggs, strikes a perfect balance between dark, eerie moments and witty, laugh-out-loud humor. This tonal balance makes the film an absolute delight to watch.In conclusion, Hellboy is a wildly entertaining, visually stunning, and action-packed ride that will leave you grinning from ear to ear. With its talented cast, impressive visuals, and masterful direction, this film is a must-see for fans of superhero movies, horror, and fantasy.*Rating:* 4.5/5 stars*Recommendation:* If you enjoy superhero movies with a dark, gothic twist, Hellboy is an absolute must-watch. Fans of Guillermo del Toro's work, particularly Pan's Labyrinth and Crimson Peak, will also appreciate the film's visual style and atmospheric tension.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hellacious!,"""Hellboy"" isn't just another comic book movie.  The main character, the demonic Hellboy, played by Ron Perlman, isn't so much a superhero.  One might call him more of an anti-hero.  Hellboy, as an infant devil, was drawn out of Hell by an immortal Rasputin in 1944.  Today he works for a secret government agency that deals with the paranormal.  Think ""Men In Black"" with kind of a spiritual slant.  Anyway, the visuals are amazing, and the imagery is also eye-catching, but shocking at times.  The story is quite good. Maybe a bit far-fetched, but there have been worse along these lines.  This is a good movie to see to get the full spectrum of comic book movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
To Hell and back ...,"Saw the film in L.A. at a special screening March 19th.Well ... what can I say? I always knew this film was a labour of love for Del Toro, but I didn't really expect so much of it to show on film.HELLBOY is an absolute joy to watch. Not being a comic-book fan to begin with, I really had no pre-conceived ideas about the film, but boy ... it blew me away. A lot of the shots were pure Mignola, and Guillermo Navarro's luscious photography caresses the screen. Dark blues, bronzes, golds ... and the startling, living red of Hellboy himself.The cast is magnificent. Ron Perlman IS Hellboy ... a gruff, bad-ass, cigar-smoking demon with a big heart and the gauchness of a teenager when it comes to Liz Sherman, the pyrokinetic young lady he adores from afar. No one else could have played him, and thank God - THANK GOD - Guillermo del Toro held out and stubbornly determined to use Perlman as his lead. Inspired casting indeed.The rest of the cast is also bang-on ... John Hurt is uncanny as Professor Bruttenholm (pronounced 'Broom'), and Jeffrey Tambor and Rupert Evans are both a delight. Doug Jones is the 'fish-guy', Abe Sapien, and his fluid, balletic grace and quirky performance brings Abe to the big screen brilliantly. Let's have more of Abe in the sequel, if we get one? (and I bet we do ...).Go see Hellboy. It's a great popcorn movie, weird, funny, quirky and utterly charming. There are fantastic fight sequences, lots of dry, hilarious one-liners, some great bad guys and as strange a bunch of heroes as you're likely to meet - and you'll love 'em to bits.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Like Clockwork,"Stop me if this sounds familiar: a wise-cracking hero combats baddies who are occult Nazis, which leads the hero and his pals into a booby-trapped tomb. Or how about a baddie who seemingly twirls daggers merely for the generic swoosh-and-whoosh sound effects--even Indian Jones couldn't be bothered to put up with that nonsense. (By the way, does anyone else feel that the unlocking of Hellboy's chamber looks and sounds a bit too much like that motif in the X-Men movies for unlocking Cerebro?) Then, there's the typical superhero-action-movie squishy monsters that incinerate instead of bleed, and, to further ensure that PG-13 rating, clothes hardly burn up in fire, either. If all of this weren't predictable enough, there's also the repetitiveness of the fight scenes, whereupon Hellboy fights the same sort of squishy monster three times, each with their own mini-cliffhangers, lots of punching sounds and such, and a combination of wire-work practical effects and loads of villainous CGI. Plus, he also fights another--even bigger--squishy monster in yet another scene. Hellboy even eavesdrops on his paramour with another guy twice. Soap-opera love triangle screenwriting for a superhero movie, c'mon.Along with the nominal romance, most of the characters here are bland. The baddies sure are, and even the merman is more interesting as comparison to the similar Creature from the Black Lagoon that Guillermo del Toro developed more fully later on in his Best-Picture-Oscar-winning ""The Shape of Water"" (2017) than he is as an actual character in ""Hellboy."" Perhaps, the most apt character in this one is that dagger-twirling Nazi, because he runs on clockwork--much like the movie does. Mechanical, predictable and repetitive. ""Hellboy"" doesn't even manage to do anything interesting with its meta comic-book within the comic-book movie. Years later, ""Logan"" (2017) would. Neither does del Toro do anything compelling with all of his stylish characters and cinematic imitations. At least, in ""The Shape of Water,"" he played some with expectations by reversing the colonialist message of ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954). ""Hellboy,"" on the other hand, is probably what you'd expect it to be because you've likely seen many other movies that are just the same. It's like clockwork.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Worst movie ever ?,"Dear dear me. This film starts badly and gets worse. The plot is so disjointed and thin it is like watching someone flicking through a comic book. The director shows a total lack of skill in linking even the simplest of scenes together and the script reads like every other page has been removed. The characters are totally one dimensional and the casting could not have been any worse. Hellboy though was well acted but let down by a terrible script which turned his character into an uninteresting bore. The action scenes had all the fluidity of a brick. The movie had a wild swing at humour but missed by a mile. And as for the bad guys.... lets just say, Ming from Flash Gordon and a costume left over from Blade 2 doesn't make fantastic viewing. My advice is don't go to watch this film unless you need a warm place to sleep for two hours. 0 out of 100",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good job with comic book inspiration.,"Hellboy is a comedic, action, adventure that delivers.  My wife and I enjoyed it thoroughly except one thing.  The final battle ended way too soon.  The make-up was wonderfully done.  The special effects were just enough without over doing it.  The actors seemed made for their roles. Ron Pearlman may not be Brad Pitt, but this movie was made for him as he has always had an unusual look to him.  He fit the character perfectly.  Abe Sapien they could have elaborated more on for those of us that do not know the comic.  Though, he looked like a devil they really never made it clear if was the true son of Satan.  Again, I apologize because I just saw the movie and know nothing about the comics.  At any rate the movie is a great choice if you have not yet seen it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Enjoyed it more than I thought I would.,"I have never read the Hellboy comics so I came into this movie with no expectations.  I mainly went to see Ron Perlman.  He is one of my favorite actors. I enjoyed the chuckles, and the sometimes cheesiness of the effects. Compared to many of the other Comic book films that have come out recently, as character Hellboy was far more interesting. Although the story line of Nazis occult practices and HP Lovecraft type monsters has been over done many times.  In this film it worked. The final battle seemed a little short, but at least they did not drag it out so long you got bored watching it. And the best part:  Hellboy, not the cute FBI agent, gets the girl.

This movie compares to everything and nothing.,"Lucked into a screening of this film, a week ago.  I've gotta tell you that the trailers don't begin to do this movie justice.  This is the closest we've seen of a direct translation of the methodology of the comicbook on the screen.Color palette - right out of Mignola's inks.Framing - the director managed to get some of the trademarks of the source onto the screen.  Remember the great shots where Mignola goes from action to static shots of statues and back to action? It's in here.Comicbook action - Hellboy the comic is famous for great monster vs. monster action and this film translation spares no expense in making sure we get just that.  He fights like 20 monsters in this film.  There's lots of OUCH moments, which are my favourite moments.Unique - You've never seen monsters as cool as these.  Sammael has so many tricks up his sleeves it's sick! sick I tell you!  Oh, and you're so in for a surprise when you see the Ogdru.  The freaking Ogdru will rule your world! You've never seen monsters this awe inspiring. Ever!Heart - on top of all this non-stop monster battering, this film has pulled off something that never quite worked in previous comics2film.  Sure you might have cried when Jean Grey drowned herself at the end of X2, but you were still detached.  You'll never been in a position like that so, you don't really relate.  In this film.

You have the Pyro girl which can be taken from The Human Torch, Hellboy, which is like a mix of Nightcrawler, Thing, and The Punisher, and the little water guy a mix of Namor and Prof. X. The dialogue was nothing but cheesy one liners, you couldn't care for any of the characters because one, Hellboy doesn't look like someone you can care for and Pyro girl is just a cry baby.

This is a great action adventure with defined characters.,"The story has action and mystery elements that stand on their own, but one of the main focuses of the story is to show the development of the characters. Every scene either progresses the story's plot line or reveals a bit about how each character became the person they are, and where they're going. Hellboy is portrayed perfectly as a being of dark nature raised in a mildly good environment. His attitude and actions reflect this marvelously. I felt that the climax could have been given more focus, but it's nature fits well with Hellboy's combination of heroism and nonchalant attitude. The other characters, both light and dark, are developed well enough that we have a basic understanding of who they are, while retaining an element of mystery for each one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

It wasn't distracting to the enjoyment of the movie, but I would have loved to see what another $5-10 million budget could have done for the finished product.It is not important that there are no ""big names"" in the movie. The acting and the script kept the film going, kept it interesting and what a relief to have a main ""hero-villain"" that you find yourself caring about.

Heckboy,"There are guys with faces just made for Hollywood. I speak not of the Tom Cruises, Paul Newmans, and Cary Grants. I'm talking about the Marty Feldmans, Michael Berrymans, Edna May Olivers, and Rondo Hattons. People so goofy looking, they could only get a job in the movies. Actors like this are handy because they require almost no makeup. Their face is its own special effect. So you gotta wonder why the filmmakers of Hellboy would cast Ron Perlman - a pretty damn beastly looking guy on his own - for the title role, then bury him under a ton of makeup and red paint. They could have got just any large actor and it wouldn't have made for any extra trouble. Not putting anything against Ron Perlman, who's a fine enough actor, but he's not exactly the first guy that comes to mind when you think 'starring role'. Come to think of it, they did the same thing with Perlman in that TV show he had way back when.Anyway, Ron plays the adult Hellboy, a sort of orphaned demon who gets adopted as a toddler by a British paranormal officer during WWII. As already stated, he's all red, plus he has a huge left forearm that looks like one of those things attack-dog trainers wear, and has two humongous horns that protrude from his forehead. He keeps these filed down because he wants to fit in better with humans. Red humans with tails and elephantiasis of the left arm, apparently. Personally, I think he keeps them filed down because they look like cool aviator goggles pulled up above his eyes.Together, Hellboy and his aging British foster parent (John Hurt) fight crime along with a Fishman that apparently was also adopted along the way. Fishman looks a little like a cross between the aliens in Close Encounters and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. He lives in a giant fish tank, but can survive outside with a special collar. Fishman is more of an intellectual non-violent sort and provides all the case research and background info for Hellboy to gruffly dismiss as he breaks out the hardware. Into the fold comes a regular 20-something human who is recruited as a partner/servant for Hellboy, as well as the future head of the paranormal crimefighting division once John Hurt kicks the bucket, which looks to be any day now. Hellboy and Fishman have codenames in this underground organization: ""Red"" and ""Blue"". You can probably guess which one is which. These are needed because you're pushing the envelope of the PG-13 rating if you're saying 'Hell'Boy all the time.Hellboy is supposedly based on a comicbook, though to be perfectly candid, I've never heard of it. Then again, I haven't heard of half of the comicbooks they make movies from nowadays, including the X-Men. Yes, I live in a cave, and the last time I cracked a comicbook, Shazam was the hot new thing. Is that guy still around? I suppose not, since there isn't a movie about him out there. Hellboy the movie seems to draw from lots of other comicbook movies, though. There's the strained father-son relationship that Hulk apparently didn't cover sufficiently. There's the whole superheroes-are-persecuted-because-they're-different angle that X-Men always tries to sell. Speaking of X-Men, there's also a character here (that I call FireGirl) who causes things to catch fire. In the first half of the film, she can do this at will, but in the second half, she needs to be slapped in the face first. I'm not sure what that's all about. She always appears to be upset, supposedly because she doesn't like being called ""FireStarter"" by the kids in her school, especially when Drew Barrymore beat her to it.Hellboy's first assignment is to take care of the Keymaster of Gozer, who has grown some reptilian dreads and a second pair of eyeballs since his Ghostbuster days. This encounter leads to a big fight in a subway station. Director Guillermo Del Toro sure does like those subway stations. The most notable thing about this fight scene is that right smack in the middle of it, a woman asks Hellboy to save her kittens, which have been left in a wooden box on the floor of the subway station. My first thought at this point was, ""What would anyone be doing on a subway with a box of kittens?"" But, I've never been on a subway, so I can't really judge. However, I have seen people bring stranger things on an airplane - or at least I did before the FAA decided that things like toenail clippers, laser pointers, and bookmarks were deemed as the tools of hijackers. I bring this scene up, because I think this movie is kind of poking fun at comicbook movies in general, where, as this scene references, someone always has a baby they left in a burning building that needs rescuing. There are other examples in the movie of this tongue-in-cheek approach. The vehicle our crimefighting heroes arrive in is a garbage truck, Hellboy's favorite meal is a monster stack of pancakes, and in one scene he confesses his crush for FireGirl from afar on a rooftop to a 10 year old boy as they share milk and cookies. It's just that kind of film.Eventually, Hellboy will fight more keymasters, some Nazis, a zombie/robot that wields swords like they were nightsticks, and some giant space squids. To be honest, I got a little lost by that point.Hellboy is an OK movie if you're into this sort of thing, I guess. I'm not, however, and found the film to be about a half-hour too long. The attempts at humor could've been a nice foil for the typical comicbook-movie shenanigans, but they were never really all that funny, though I'll give it marks for trying.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Why can't they make more comic book films like this?,"To start, I don't want to explain the exposition, because the origin of Hellboy and the villians is part of the movie's fun.  Suffice it to say, Hellboy is a demon raised as a human, who works for a secret organization fighting monsters (think Men in Black).  Certain mythical beasts are let loose, and it starts hitting the fan in about 3 minutes.  Hellboy (Ron Perlman) works alongside aquatic creature Abe Sapien (voiced by David Hyde Pierce) and pyrokinetic Liz Sherman (Selma Blair).  Along with a team of slightly inept humans, our heroes set out to find and destroy the source of the monsters.  What follows is one of the best comic book adaptations in recent memory.  Great action sequences, superb special effects (the opening sequence is a killer!), and a wonderful sense of humor makes Hellboy a very enjoyable experience.  Despite his horns and tail, Ron Perlman plays Hellboy as though he were as normal as the rest of us.  In effect, the audience sympathizes with Hellboy as he clashes with his emotional troubles.  Though the plot degenerates in the last few minutes, the nearly 2 hours leading up to it are a lot of fun.  Even if you're unfamiliar with the source material (guilty), give this movie a chance.  It's worth it.  3 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
See it twice more.,"Having seen this movie in advance, I admit that it was fantastic! - and I'll need to see it a few more times before I'm satisfied. A number of us were invited to LA over spring break to preview 'Hellboy' and visit with Director Del Toro in the meantime. As many doubts as I had about this movie, I was stunned to finally see it in its entirety. Del Toro has done an incredible job in piecing together Mike Mignola's works in their unique imagery, and actor Ron Perlman's commanding performance is everything you would expect from a veteran actor, famed for his roles in the past sitcom 'Beauty and The Beast', 'Alien Ressurection', 'City of Lost Children', and countless others. I would say he carries the film, but for the invaluable contributions of actors Selma Blair, Doug Jones, Jefferey Tambor, and Karel Roden, to name a few. With an dauntingly small budget, Del Toro has worked a miracle - the effects in 'Hellboy' rival Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy, Spiderman, more believable in many respects.If nothing else, add this to your Must See list.  I expect nothing less than an awesome box office performance from this timeless film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good Times with Hell boy,"""Hellboy"" is a visually stunning and action-packed superhero film that brings the beloved comic book character to life in a big way. Director Guillermo del Toro's passion project is a masterpiece of dark fantasy, blending horror, humor, and heart in a way that will leave you breathless and begging for more.Ron Perlman shines as the titular character, bringing a perfect balance of gruff humor and vulnerable charm to the role of the demon-turned-superhero. His performance is matched by a talented supporting cast, including John Hurt, Selma Blair, and Doug Jones, who all add depth and complexity to the story.The film's visuals are a feast for the eyes, with del Toro's signature blend of gothic horror and steampunk flair on full display. The creature designs are incredible, with the demonic villains and supernatural creatures looking like they leapt straight from the pages of Mike Mignola's comic book series.But what truly sets ""Hellboy"" apart is its unique blend of action, humor, and heart. The film's tone is pitch-perfect, balancing intense action sequences with witty one-liners and poignant moments of character development. The result is a film that's both a thrilling ride and a deeply moving exploration of what it means to be human.Overall, ""Hellboy"" is a must-see for fans of superhero films, horror, and fantasy. With its stunning visuals, talented cast, and unique blend of action and humor, it's a hell of a good time that will leave you eager for more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Perlman with a Toilet Roll...,"I usually like the big good-natured bad asses Ron Perlman invariably plays, whatever movie he is in. Usually though, he is only a sideshow to the main characters and storyline, not so here. This big good-natured bad ass has the whole show to himself and it's just not enough to fill a movie. I've never read any hell boy comics, so maybe I'm just missing the allure of a big red painted man with a toilet roll for a right hand prancing around and hitting stuff...I did like the Nazi-Voodoo stuff. Reminded me of all-night games of Return to Castle Wolvenstein and that robot dude had (for me anyway) some cool references to BloodRayne.As for the plot, nothing there you didn't see coming from the line at the ticket booth.So, basically if you liked League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and/or are an avid player of RtCW you can probably suffer through this movie.

Movie with a style,"I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie. Expecting to see just another action hero flick, I fell in love with the classy style this film is produced with.This is one of the rare films which manages not to take itself too seriously (without falling for cheap humor). Fifth element and Pirates from the Caribbean are films I consider having similar style and making fun of themselves at the same time.Hellboy (as in the main character) is acted out just hilariously. The side characters are somewhat a disappointment and the movie could deliver more here, but Ron Perlman saves the film.Go see it when you feel like seeing a stylish movie and having a good laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself.

"Best ""monster"" movie in years!","This scruffy little flick is one of the best ""monster"" movies I've seen in a long time.  The production values and effects are true to the original graphic novel, the score is terrific, the villains suitably villanous, but the real achievement here is Ron Perlman once again nailing his signature ""monster with a soul"" character.  Perlman inhabits Hellboy's struggle to fit in; to be near Liz, the woman he loves and fears; his devotion to his ""father"", Dr. Bruttenholm; and finally his choice to reject evil, although evil created him.  In the hands of a lesser actor this would have turned into a cartoon, but Perlman gives real depth to Hellboy, and makes the movie with his performance.  This cries out for a sequel - and I'll be first in line to see it if there is one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
So good!!!,"Hellboy was one of the most enjoyable movies that I have seen in a long time!  Like The Matrix and X-Men 2 (sorry but Spiderman sucked after the first hour), Hellboy is a wonderful movie that was obviously made by people who respect and love its illustrated origins. I don't want to be cheap and spoil it for you, but you will enjoy this movie!  It has a great story, ""I'd glance at more than twice"" characters, and awesome special effects (including some creature effects whose skin might make you wonder how it would feel rubbing against you in the middle of the night)!  Don't listen to the narrow among us who might criticize this movie for being made; it does such an honor to the comic by inspiring new people to enjoy it while entertaining the long time fans!

Strangely Beautiful!,"I saw Hellboy last night (opening night in my city) and I thought it was quite good and strangely beautiful.I read a few comments from others and I am amazed at the closed-minds with which people approach fantasy material. Obviously, no one has to like the movie - but to assume all kinds of nonsense about the characters just because a) it's based on a comic book, b) is a story about a demon, c) has elements of humor, and d) develops the character from the point of infancy is really and truly idiotic. What you do is watch the movie, decide if it was internally consistent in its portrayal of the characters, and then decide if it was something you liked. That's pretty much it. Coming at anything because it isn't developed in the precise way you would have done it pretty much just explains to everyone else why you are unlikely to ever be involved in the creative process of making a movie.Logic? It's a comic book fantasy - it has it's own logic. If you don't like, don't like it - just don't complain that it's not a comic book logic done your way. When you write a freaking movie you'll be glad if people give you a fair chance too.Anyway, the strangely beautiful part is at the end and I can't tell you stuff about the end at least for a few more weeks (to be fair). I found the movie touching and I'd like to see a sequel too - so go spend your money on it right away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"We expected it to be good, but this good?","Del Toro, who evidently used to live here, decided to screen his latest (and greatest) film Hellboy in Austin, Texas March 14th at midnight.  The crowd was enormous, and Del Toro, Perlman, and Mignola were in attendance.  I expected an entertaining film, but not much more.  After all, Mimic was a disaster, I'm no big fan of Blade 2, and comic-to-film adaptations are almost always disappointments.  I was, however, blown away.  This film is not only a faithful adaptation of the original material by Mignola, but it fulfills it.  Many a scene was cut directly from Mignola's amazing artwork, and the casting could not have been more perfect.  This film is simply amazing - one can only hope it does well at the box office so that Del Toro can convince the powers that be than another Hellboy picture would be a good idea.  And trust me, it would.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"""Seed of Destruction""","One of the biggest perks of ""Hellboy"" comes from the charisma of the massive red demon of the film's title, who is played magnificently by Ron Perlman. Perlman is barely recognizable underneath that dense makeup but his tough-guy attitude and his rough voice give him away.And this is one of the many reasons I found ""Hellboy"" to be so entertaining.Adapted from the Dark Horse Comics character created by Mike Mignola and skillfully directed by Guillermo del Toro, ""Hellboy"" is one hell (no pun intended) of a roller coaster ride.Guillermo del Toro, who reached mainstream success when he directed Wesley Snipes in 2002's ""Blade II"" (which also featured Perlman in a key supporting performance), knows the material inside out and runs with it.""Hellboy"" is definitely one of the more ambitious comic book adaptations in recent years, and is also one of the more faithful. (Before seeing this film, I went to my local book store and I picked up ""Seed of Destruction"" and read that, which is where I got most of my information regarding ""Hellboy."")As a film, it captures the spirit and excitement of Mike Mignola's Nazi-spawned demon hero, who battles the forces of Hell with a really big gun and an attitude. In the closing days of World War II, renegade Russian monk Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden), who is working with the Nazis, brings Hellboy into our existence in an effort to help turn the tide of the conflict in favor of Adolf Hitler. The Allies stop the ceremony and Hellboy is adopted and raised to adulthood by a benevolent scientist, John Bruttenholm (John Hurt).Rasputin will stop at nothing to bring about the Apocalypse but needs Hellboy to do it. Hellboy on the other hand, knows that being 7 feet tall and red can be very lonely, and he's fallen in love with Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), who can start fires when she becomes excited.""Hellboy"" is a wondrous marvel from start to finish and I enjoyed it very much. I waited until the director's cut came out before I would comment on this movie so I could see it in all of its visual glory.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Could have been better...,"I've just seen this movie, and I really looked forward to it, but I was seriously disappointed. It's really because of many things. First of all, it looks terrible, when they hit Hellboy, and he slowly flies horizontally across the room. The physics are missing here, which isn't VERY important, but when it looks strange (and flat out ugly), it just doesn't work. Second, he kills a monster (which isn't easy to kill), but he doesn't really learn from it. He kicks the other (similar) monsters' butts for the rest of the movie instead of just killing them, and when he does kill them, it seems like a coincidence. That results in fighting just for fighting's sake. Third, the movie seems to go on forever and ever. The movie simply has too few scenes. There's lots of action all along, but the movie dwells in the wrong places. And finally, WHAT KIND OF ENDING IS THAT!?!? Seriously! A jealous demon is funny, and it works, but to see Hellboy getting emotional is simply too much: HE'S A DEMON FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! And he should behave more like one. No more than 4 stars for this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Let's hear it for the 'Boy!',"Hellboy was just a great movie. Of course, I like superhero movies. Well, here we go...Ron Perlman portrays Hellboy. Perlman gives the character a tough guy attitude (the demon), but still shows his emotional side (the man). John Hurt does a great job playing Hellboy's father-figure, Prof. Trevor Broom. He's tough on HB, but still treats him like a son. He's the only person that HB absolutely respects. There's also great acting from Selma Blair (Liz Sherman), Jeffrey Tambor (Agt. Manning), Rupert Evans (John Myers) and David Hyde Pierce (voice of Abe Sapien). There's more than enough humor in this movie. Most of it comes from Hellboy, but everybody has their funny lines and funny scenes. The humor also helps to keep you interested. The one thing I love about this movie, besides some cool CGI, is the supernatural references made in this movie. First of all, the evil, Russian monk, Rasputin is the villain. Also, in the deleted scenes, there is a reference to the Tunguska Event (a big, mysterious explosion in Siberia). There are lots of other references, but I'm not going to list them all right now. But the one thing I liked most about the movie was the characters' desires to be human. This showed that they were more than just monster-bashing mutants and enabled the audience to better relate to them.Good actors, some human emotions, plenty of humor, and a great action story about the supernatural. All in all, I say let's hear it for the big, red monkey.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Dark Comic,"This movie is much better than any of the ""professional reviewers"" would have you think.  Performances are excellent all around.  The special effects are integrated into the storyline nicely (as opposed to so many other movies where storyline is used to tie together special effects).  The story is interesting and, who knew(?), it ends with a moral.  It doesn't stray from its comic book origins. However, it does retain a dark comic mood. The story was plausible in a comic book sense.  The characters enjoyable. I had no idea what it was about going in and walked up completed satisfied. Considering it is still in the theaters as ""Van Helsing"" makes its debut, if you are faced with a choice - see Hellboy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A Tale of the Arbitrary Struggle Between Hellboy and Rasputin!,"First, I didn't get the same subliminal messages they're showing in all the other theaters, so I wasn't hypnotized into liking it like most other people were.  So this is a review *without* those messages.The conclusion first - this movie's in the same class as League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.The beginning of the movie was painful - a B-movie that wasn't quite bad enough to laugh at.  But grossly overdone.  You could feel the cost of your ticket being put into the special effects, which the director used because nothing else in the scene was working.After the opening, an awkward introduction of all of the characters was made.  The dialogue reeked of exposition.   Which means it wasn't natural - it was all about explaining the backstory.  (But not all of it.  Only some parts of it!)The real problem with this movie, ripped right off the comic book pages, was that it was all too arbitrary.  The world was dull, and it seemed like the writer kept throwing things in - oooh, there's a three headed frog!  Now it's snowing!  Look - Hellboy needs glasses!  And eats shampoo!  (I'm making all of these up, but the movie was really THAT arbitrary.)  You never, ever once started to care about anyone (the villains, the heroes, the danger), and it wasn't *fun*.  Movies like this need to be fun, and Hellboy wasn't.The director, del Toro, is VERY good at having goal-oriented, single-minded characters. Blade II (his movie) was schlock, but it was entertaining schlock.  Hellboy was a literal adaptation of the comic book, and it needed a director who knows how to set the mood.  del Toro has no idea how to set mood.So, in short, Hellboy's in the same class as League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  I brought my friends, and now they won't ever again trust me to recommend a movie.  Don't make your friends hate you.  Skip Hellboy.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
An occult version of Men In Black.,"Or at least, that's what it seemed to me. The similarities are very strong. Just replace aliens with evil demon thingies and you're set!That said, I actually liked this film quite a lot, probably due to the casting of Ron Perlman as Hellboy. He has a whale of a time in the title role, though you can't help but wonder how hot it got under his massive body suit and prosthetics. The rest of the cast are really along for the ride and don't have a great deal to do, though Hellboy's Man-from-Atlantis side-kick, Aqua Sapiens (or some-such) has a few good lines and at least one good underwater scene.There is also more than a touch of the Lovecraftian genre about the nature of the beasties that Hellboy has to face. Vast entities slumbering in the void, just waiting to be awakened etc. And lots of tentacles and slime. It all adds up to good fun, no matter how much plagiarism and borrowing there has been.It's pleasant to see that Hollywood can chuck out a decent comic conversion after the awful Hulk and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen fiascos. Of course, I've yet to see Catwoman, so I won't get too enthusiastic. But at least it shows they can do it, if they want to.Worth a look.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A unique hero rises to the challenge!!!,"Many think that comic-book hero adapted films have become a dime-a-dozen what with `Spider-Man,' `The Hulk,' and `Daredevil.' However, it is not like these movies have been all that bad-the best being `The Hulk' which portrayed a tormented man born with abilities that he cannot control. Now we have `Hellboy.' Hellboy himself is hardly a super-human; he is more of a super Satan. With a unique look of red skin, broken horns, and a right hand made of armor, we find a friendly and heroic character willing to save the world from the clutches of his own kind-ultimate evil. The end result is a familiar, yet exceptional tale of good verses evil. 	`Hellboy' tells the story of the son of Satan, taken from hell by a ritual in which Nazis tried to take over the world. The good-old boys of the American army botched the attempt and the creature taken from hell was adopted by the United States government and appropriately named Hellboy (Ron Perlman). Raised by Professor Bruttenholm (John Hurt), a scientist who works for a secret U.S. Government agency, Hellboy learns the ways of good and fights to protect the world from `things that go bump in the night.'Now, in the present, Hellboy is faced with the resurrected Grigori Rasputin and Nazis, as they attempt to once again take over the world by bringing hell down on earth. Hellboy is aided in his fight by another strange creature named Abraham 'Abe' Sapien (Doug Jones), a fish-like man with great knowledge; Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), a beautiful young woman who can manipulate fire; and a new recruit to the agency named John Myers, a future replacement for the ailing Professor Bruttenholm. Their adventure to save the world will force Hellboy to face his very identity and require him to make a choice between the world of which he physically is, and the world that he was brought up to fight for. 	Although the film is conventional and we can expect to see an unusual hero rise, we also find a one-of-a-kind hero that will not back down from what he knows to be right. The unconventional aspect of `Hellboy' rests in its awesome characters that are not only colorful, but also personified by their human qualities. For example, Hellboy himself is deeply in love with Liz Sherman and would do anything to protect her. There is a funny scene in which Liz enters Hellboy's room and finds him writing one love letter after another to her. As for the character of Abraham Sapien, he offers words of wisdom for Liz when Hellboy is distraught over his ailing adopted father, Professor Bruttenholm. Sapien says, `If there's trouble, then all of us freaks has is each other.' 	Identity and choice are the keys to these super-hero flicks. Hellboy has to make a choice between fighting for good or evil. Choice is imperative and it is what separates these characters from other people around them. The same is true for the characters of `Spider-Man,' and `The Hulk.' They acknowledge that they are cursed soles-but they do not have to live a cursed life. They are both normal and abnormal. It is their choice to live in a world where they can protect mankind so that people will not have to feel the same pain that they do. As for `Hellboy,' it latches on to that quality, will not let go and becomes a movie where an unlikely creature becomes a hero. ***",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Unfortunately, Del Toro seems so intent on getting the basic ingredients and aesthetic style for Hellboy precisely how he wants that he forgets all about telling a decent story: his film suffers from a leaden pace, a weak plot full of clichés (one of those story lines that feels like it's being made up on the fly), and zero chemistry between dull characters.On the plus side, the makeup used to transform Ron Perlman into Hellboy is impressive, and although the use of old school animatronic effects stick out like a sore thumb amidst all of the CGI, I enjoyed the resurrected Russian corpse with the noose around its neck.

whats with the giant tentacled villains?,"i thouroughly enjoyed this presentation of hellboy as the director gave it the feel of a comic book. ron perlman was excellent as hellboy, always spot on to his character. however there were several things about this movie that struck me as odd, first being the fact that the part of the devil was played by huge tentacled monsters locked in a giant prison...why the giant tentacles? also the film placed a heavy emphasis on hellboy's own religious feelings (as evidenced by the rosaries he and his team were wearing all the time)...if the director wanted to bring traditional religion into the mix, why didnt he use traditional villains (ie satan?). another odd thing was the seemingly futility of hellboys fighting the monster samuel, of whom two more are created everytime one is killed, and the freaky german assassin. why not just let hellboy go to town on some henchmen instead? however, as i said before, i greatly enjoyed the movie's comic book feel and ron perlman as hellboy- enough that i can overlook these shortcomings. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Hellboy Crushes Competition,"For director - and comic book connoisseur - Guillermo del Toro, bringing Hellboy to life on celluloid was a labor of love and his passion for the material is evident in every frame, from first to last. This much anticipated film, adapted from the Mike Mignola - penned comic books, has finally arrived in theaters and was well worth the wait.In a recent interview published in a nationally known film publication, del Toro states that the only actor he ever considered for Hellboy was Perlman. At one point, Universal wanted to develop the film with Vin Diesel or The Rock in the role but del Toro balked at the idea and the project remained in limbo until it was picked up by Revolution. It turns out del Toro's instincts were right on the mark. Perlman is an excellent Hellboy, hardened and tough one minute, weak and vulnerable the next. Perlman not only has the right physical look for the character but he understands the inner workings of the character, the very human side underneath the bulky red exterior. Hellboy is a super hero, no doubt, but he's also a guy who loves to drink beer, smoke cigars, and chew on a Baby Ruth and it's in the moments when Hellboy is just a regular Joe that Perlman really shines. The supporting cast is also very good, but Perlman is the real star of this show and he more than rises to the challenge.Del Toro's vision has been realized right down to the smallest detail and the film is visually stunning. Del Toro shot every inch of it himself and his mastery of the camera is evident in even the smallest of scenes. The set pieces, costumes, makeup, and special effects are all achievements of skill that bring to life the world in which the story takes place in a way that even the most casual film-goer can appreciate. As you would expect, the action sequences are bigger than life: a chase through the city, Hellboy battling the Samarrea in a subway station, and the final showdown in Rasputin's stronghold are amazingly staged. But, what makes the film really special are the little moments: H.B visiting Liz at the psychiatric hospital, Hellboy surrounded by wads of crumpled paper as he tries to express his feelings for Liz in a note, Hellboy sitting on a rooftop with a young boy as he jealously critiques Myer's attempts to woo Liz, the way in which Abe convinces Liz to stay  all wonderful, and often humorous, scenes that tie the film together and make the characters likeable.I just can't say enough about Hellboy. In terms of pure entertainment value, it is second to none, but it is also a very good film  if not surpassing at least on par with The X-Men or Spiderman in terms of brilliantly bringing a comic book hero to life on the big screen.There are more stories to tell and, in the hands of del Toro and Perlman, Hellboy could very well be the auspicious beginnings of a spectacular franchise.

The whole cast was perfect in their roles, actually.If you are a fan of Guillermo del Toro's, you will love this movie; it is his best yet.  The story flowed smoothly and his loving attention to detail is evident in every shot.  Well worth the effort.Mike Mignola is the creator of Hellboy, and he worked hand in hand with Guillermo to for a true three-dimensional rendering of his creation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Good, stylish and different, one of the better ""super-hero"" movies...","""Hellboy"" is based on the underground comic book about a demon called from Hell by Nazis in the 40s, but then ""rescued"" by American soldiers and raised to become an investigator of paranormal activity, and, well, a super-hero. It is now the present day, and Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his ""father"" (John Hurt), the scientist who rescued him, are joined by a colorful group of avengers in their crime fighting activities.  The list includes pyrokinetic Liz (Selma Blair), fish-man Abe Sapien (voiced by David Hyde Pierce), and FBI agent Myers (Rupert Evans).When the Nazis who took Hellboy from Hell - led by Rasputin (Karel Roden) - resurface...well, all Hell breaks loose (no pun intended).  Characters you like die, questions arise, and there are lots and lots of fight scenes.Overall this is a good movie.  The characters are cool and fun to watch, the style is great, there are some awesomely cool lines and its just on a different level from other comic book movies.  Ron Perlman is great as the red hero, very cool and collected, speaking dry, witty lines while fighting devilish monsters.  The other actors all put forth, John Hurt and Selma Blair playing the most interesting characters, and Jeffrey Tambor giving a funny touch to his no-nonsense director of the Bureau.Nonetheless, `Hellboy' is not a perfect film.  The action is at times hard to watch, the climax and last five minutes are  I have to say  pathetic, and many questions are left unanswered.  I guess if I read the comics I would have a better understanding, of it, but the best super-hero movies make sense to readers of the comics and to new fans.  Some stuff in this movie just didn't make any sense.  For instance, the Nazi woman is young and blonde in the forties at the beginning of the film, and still young and blonde sixty years later when the rest takes place.  Same with Kroenen (Ladislav Beran), a villain who's been shot, stabbed, castrated, and had is eyelids and bottom and upper lip torn off, his blood is dust, and he still manages to live.  How this happens is not explained.But, you really don't care; it's obviously not a movie to be taken seriously.  In the end it's nothing more than a fun, exciting super-hero flick, 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"overall,an overrated disappointment..(2/10)","contains some **SPOILERS** (but not too many =P)in my humble opinion,hellboy (the movie) sucks..of course,one has to keep in mind,whilst appreciating a superhero flick,that this kind of movies aims at entertainment rather than quality (exception made to shyamalan's 'unbreakable',but then again it isn't really a superhero movie)..still,hellboy fails to be merely good in so many ways that it ultimately becomes boring,monotonous,predictable,cliché'd and overall utterly bad..there are some good slapstick scenes (like the one when hellboy gets run over by a train),but that's about it for the positive aspects..the story is lousy (even for a superhero flick) and a bit megalomaniac and manicheistic (i mean,the Nazis and rasputin on the bad side and America on the good side,or hellboy resisting his devilish tendencies and becoming a good guy..get real!),but i can't tell whether it has got something to do with the original hellboy comics or not,since i've never read them..the acting is mediocre (except for leading man ron perlman),and most characters are slightly(?) ridiculous (remember the wind up sand doll,aka kroenen?)..sfx aren't that bad,i think,and the soundtrack..well,can't quite recall it now,so i'll skip this one..in the end,it's as worth seeing as daredevil (which also sucks big time,if you ask me),and stands miles away from all the other recent superhero movies (i'm not including catwoman* in the pack,since i haven't seen it yet)..oh,one last note - no matter how ridiculous a character kroenen is,the 'improvements' he did to his face are remarkably disturbing,and evoke some of hr giger's drawings (that's a good thing,by the way =P)..2/10*info update: catwoman sucks even more than hellboy,and should be part of the '10 worst movies list'..and then again,it doesn't really deserve that distinction..just avoid watching it at all costs,and save yourself time (and perhaps some money!)..",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Comic book movie from the better end,"Before we start, this one is written by someone who has only seen the Director's cut, not the theatrical version.As for comic book adaptations go Hellboy definitely is from the better end of the city: it's interesting, action is good and characters are really, really out of this world. How does this sound: Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is a red skinned daemon, Abe Sapien (David Hyde Pierce (voice)) is some sort of fish-man mutant and the main villains are ageless, possessed Nazi's lead by Rasputin (Karel Roden). Yes, that legendary Rasputin from the court of Russian Tzars.Original comic Hellboy has more of a cult following than anything else and as someone who isn't a huge fan of the original comic I felt that the movie was far better constructed. The comic was too loose with its stories, there was rarely anything that connected the adventures of Hellboy. Some stories were extremely good, but there are those which are just stuffing for empty space. It must be admitted here, that the plot of the movie isn't very complicated or even very original, but it works and it's full of nice dialog and good action scenes. Even the romance of Hellboy and Liz (Selma Blair) is relatively nicely done.All in all, this is worthy of a glance even for those, who are looking for good action movie. I would suppose, that if you take history very seriously and can't enjoy creative usage of world history then this movie might get you angry, but for everyone else, watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Fantastic blend of character and action!,"Guillermo del Toro has made a great movie out of Mike Mignola's wonderful comic book, Hellboy.  He stays true to the tone and atmosphere of the comic while imbuing it with his own cinematic sensibilities.  Hellboy is a genuinely FUN movie with great action and atmosphere, but also with great CHARACTERS.  In Hellboy, del Toro combines his skills as an action director displayed in Blade 2 with the artful characterizations he gave us in The Devil's Backbone and Cronos.  Ron Perlman is note-perfect as the title character, a demon summoned to bring about the Apocalypse who believes he can escape his destiny and instead fight for the forces of good.  He is both funny and touchingly emotional.  Hellboy reminds me of Raiders of the Lost Ark in the way it gives us very likeable and fully-drawn characters in a fun, fast-paced comic book adventure movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

The creature designs are inventive and terrifying, and the action sequences are fast-paced and thrilling.One of the standout elements of ""Hellboy"" is its themes of identity and belonging. Hellboy's struggles to find his place in the world and to reconcile his demonic heritage with his human upbringing are deeply relatable, and add an emotional depth to the film that is unexpected in a superhero movie.Overall, ""Hellboy"" is a fiery and fantastical ride that is sure to delight fans of the comic book series and newcomers alike.

Bad Movie,"This was a bad movie. James bond movies suck, and this was a crappy rip-off. I'd rather have someone pour hot oil on me while making me watch van Helsing than watch this movie again. Whoever produced this movie was and is a huge nerd, and the not the bill gates, so rich that he can pay for love kind of nerd. But rather the kind of nerd that thinks a movie about a big red monster guy with a soft spot for kittens is a good idea. And who rips off the alien from Men in Black, seriously. In space no one can hear you scream, and the same goes for any theater that ever showed hellboy, the whole tree falling in the woods with no one around to hear it. This movie was also a danger to society, because it gives rapists 80 minutes in which to do their worst without ANY witnesses.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Great flick! Top marks for comic to movie!,"As usual, positively LOVED Perlman (ESPECIALLY in heavy make-up, he's too hot!).  This was a totally fun flick, wonderful dialogue, characterization by actors is top-notch.  For comic book becoming movie, this is one of the best MOVIES yet.  Favorite scene(s) Hellboy with kid on the rooftop and Hellboy and Sparkie's first kiss at the end of the movie.  This is one of those movies that, if budget allows, I'm likely to re-see in the theaters (I do this MAYBE once a year since I'm tight with my movie funds) and left agreeing with whole family (spouse & I at opposite ends of the 40's, daughter 20 and son 16) that owning the DVD is an absolute must!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Overrated,"I had never seen this movie, and with the remake coming out I thought I'd watch the original two films. The first one is just fine. I don't really understand why everyone raves about Ron Pearlman as Hellboy. He's fine, he has his moments. The supporting cast is also just meh. Either over-acting or just not really acting at all. The only character I found compelling was Abe Sapian, and he's not in the film enough.I understand the film was made in 2004 so the editing style and CGI is going to be different from today's style and standard. The CGI was very good for a film made almost 15 years ago. It doesn't hold up all that well but really, only a few early 200's movies hold up today. The film is also just too long. The story just isn't interesting enough keep me interested. In fact, at one point I forgot the whole reason as to why they were doing the things they were doing.My main positive for the movie is it's visually entertaing but apart from that there really isn't much to love here. I enjoyed Hellboy 2 a lot more.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Sets the right atmosphere: spooky, occult. And hits the spot with the right amount of (black) humor.I think it's the best superhero movie till this moment.

Fiendishly fun comic adaptation,"Director Guillermo del Toro fought hard to bring his vision of the Dark Horse Comics title to the screen intact and delivered the most faithful, offbeat and energetic superhero movie of 2004.Ron Perlman is flawless casting as creator Mike Mignola's big red monster-masher, summoned to Earth as an infant by Nazi occultists led by Rasputin but raised by mentor Professor Broom (John Hurt) to work in the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence.He's not alone, though, at the BPRD and will need fishman Abe Sapiens (voiced by David Hyde Pierce), pyrotechnic Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) and several expendable agents to stop a resurrected Rasputin and his clockwork zombie assassin Kroenen from ushering in a new age of Hell on Earth.Del Toro handles his multiple character introductions well, leaving the way clear for exhilarating demon smackdowns laced with Hellboy's sarcastic dry wit and punctuated by convincing moments of personal growth.

What the Hell?,"This supernatural action-adventure is based on a dark creature in Mike Mignola's acclaimed comic book series Hellboy. Hellboy(Ron Perlman)is a red colored demon in the form of a man with a giant armored gloved hand and two circles(where ram-like horns are shaved down)on his head. Complete with a tail, superpowers and an appetite for Baby Ruth candy bars. As an infant Hellboy is rescued from the Nazis and raised as a force of good by Allied Force agent 'Broom' Bruttenholm(John Hurt). As an adult Hellboy is an investigator of the paranormal and while on an assignment comes face to face with George Rasputin(Karel Roden)who uses monsters and powers-that-be to convince Hellboy he is better off with the dark side. Aiding our demon hero is the telepathic 'Mer-Man'(Doug Jones)and a pyro-kinetic looker named Liz(Selma Blair). Undercurrents of deadpan humor add texture to the full blown battle between the demonic superhero and slimy monsters from the bowels of who knows where. Also in the cast are: Rupert Evans, Jeffrey Tambor, Bridget Hodson and Kevin Trainor.

Hellboy - A genre masterpiece!,"I never saw Hellboy in the cinema and I seriously regret that.

Ron Perlman is the perfect actor for this role and DelToro directs the movie with a very special sense of humor. The script is excellent, because it is funny, romantic and pure action and the most important thing is that Hellboy does not pretend to be absolutely serious, it is made with a constant eye-blink. The visual effects are amazing, the sound blows away your speakers and the film is just two hours of exciting funny action. I like Hellboy, maybe you will, too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hellboy (2004),"This movie is definitely one of my all time favourites. Hellboy is one of the best old time classics. This movie is action packed and awesome as soon as it begins.

Hellboy amazingly grows up to be an anchor and unstoppable force who defeats evils forces of darkness and gives hope to the hopeless.

Faithfull to the comic and a fun ride!,"Title: Hellboy (2004)Cast: Ron Perman, John Hurt, Selma Blair,Tagline: Here to ProtectReview:Well after much anticipation (tell me about it!) I finally got to see Hellboy. Guillermo del Toros love child, Hellboy has been a project del Toro has been wanting to make since his Mimic days, so needles to say his love for Mike Mignolas comic book creation is preatty evident when you see the movie.The story is about Hellboy. A demon from hell who was summoned here by a warlock called Rasputin. You see, old Rasputin wants to use Hellboys powers to bring forth these giant lovecraftian creatures from another dimension to bring destruction upon earth. Hellboy is not really willing to participate in this little escaped and therefore tries to stop Rasputin from achieving his goal.Let me make this clear, first and foremost this movie is a monster movie. Its main thing is to showcase monsters and monsters fighting each other off. Its also a very very straight forward comic book movie so you can throw your credibility out the window when you see this one. Its got magic, monsters and talking dead corpses, so be ready for that. Now, does it succeed in what it set out to do? Heck yeah! Many times over.The creatures on Hellboy are amazing...starting with the good guys. Hellboy himself is incredibly cool looking, I myself found that I could not turn away and stop looking at the screen. Hellboy was like a magnet to my eyes...I was glued to the screen!Same thing when ever Abe Sapiens shows up...Dr. Brotenholm was talking but all I could do was check out how cool Abe looked. Very well achieved make up effects. Then theres the bad guys....the Sammael creatures...damn cool as hell. Those tentacles..those eyes! Those jaws! That whole scene in the subway! I was just salivating at how realistic the Sammeal creatures looked. This movie helped me realize how much I prefer live action prosthetics and monsters to cgi. Speaking of wich...the cgi was done well for the most part, but there where some scenes in there that I didnt love, but those where very few. For the most part the CG was excellent.The action is non stop! Lots of chases, lots of fights! Hey this is a comicbook flick, we need our heroes and villains to duke it out a couple of times, and trust me my friends this happens a lot through out the flick.Id heard a lot about the warmth and level of emotion that the movie puts across, and I agree theres a couple of moments that are really emotional. Like Hellboy and Liz's romantic sequences that little speach that Hellboy tells Liz is awesome! Ron Perlman succesfully managed to put a lot emotion into that performance even though he was under tons of make up. It was sort of like a flashback to his Beauty and the Beast days.The bad, well there very few things I didnt like about this here flick...but there defenetly were a few hiccups along the way. The movie aint perfect. First off, Rasputin came off as weak. The way the script was written, theres no real conflict between the villain and the hero. Theres no actual physical conflict between them...therefore he comes of as weak. In the comic hes a more menacing and scary. Here it looked like Hellboy could defenetly kick his ass at any given moment. The character has the potential to be a great villain...but just not in this movie.I was expecting a slightly more spectacular ending. It felt rushed, I liked the fx, and the creatures but the final final confrontation between hellboy and ""the old gods"" well it was just too fast...heck I wanted that bad monster to destroy the building, I wanted a bigger fight..but no. Listen up del Toro! For your next flick, pay attention to the importance of conflict between heroe and villain! I guess we can blame del Toro for letting that one slip since he did write the screenplay...so next time Guillermo: we want the major villain to sweat evil out of his every pore!Well del Toro was wearing a lot of hats while making this movie, so I guess the film had to suffer somewhere. Speaking of del Toros direction. The man is a visual genius. He knows how to make the scenes  look like works of art. Its all about the beautiful colors and textures! My hat goes off for making a truly beatiful comic book flick. It felt like I was seeing Mignolas drawings coming to life in many instances. Even the sets looked almost identical to the drawings found in Mignolas comics. In this visual sense and in many other ways this movie was incredibly faithful to the source material.Theres a lot of winks for those comic fans out there...like those scenes with the corpse and even in one scene the humonculus shows up in a hallway of the BPRD, so be on the look out for little winks from del Toro all through out.Ok putting those minor problems that I mentioned aside, the film rocked my ass to kingdom come. It was an amazing special effects/action/monster ride that had my fan boy ass drooling like a little kid waiting for the comics shop to open. Heck this movie put a smile in my geeky heart. Thanx del Toro, keep em coming dude!Rating: 4 out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Hellboy is the movie that has it all!,I am a fan of the Hellboy comic books and was long awaiting the opening of the movie. And from the very beginning I was pleased. The director accuratley portrayed Hellboy and the story in a way that is magnificent. Hellboy is the awesome action hero with a cynical sense of humour and a roughness that makes him unique. I loved the movie for all the reasons a movie is entertaining. The action and special effects were great. The actors seemed very natural considering there was a giant red man with horns. I think the movie correctly displayed Mignola's vision and contained all the aspects that the comic book fans love.

The movie that pulled off cool when only campy was expected,"I have to tell you, this movie blew my mind. think about it, paranormal bureau? big red dude with huge gun? Rasputin? nazis? this movie had cheesy written all over it. But get this; it wasn't. in case you don't know, Hellboy is a comic book too. Here I was expecting another Van Helsing or League of extraordinarily boring gentleman, I had a pleasant surprise. this movie pulled off a big red dude fighting the forces of evil without drowning it in CGI, and instead of focusing on pure action (which is good but gets boring pretty fast) it also gave time for you to get to know the human side of all the characters. (even the inhuman ones) and this movie has succeeded where so many others have failed by combining action romance and adventure, instead of just one. that is ever so important. especially for a movie like this. none of the characters were over or underplayed despite their seemingly ridiculous and impossible to take serious roles. how odd that such a small name superhero would be so much more similar to the comic than the popular ones. trust me, if you like comics, you'll LOVE this movie, heck, even if you aren't into comics, you'll still like it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Entertainment at its most complete,"The guy who said this was the worst comic book adaptation ever was A: an idiot, B: completely lacking in taste, and C: an idiot. Maybe I'm being harsh, but calling this a worse movie than Superman 4, Batman and Robin, Catwoman, and The Crow: Salvation is just inexcusable.This movie has Ron Perlman as maybe the single most entertaining, charismatic action hero since Bruce Campbell gave us Ash. Funny, seemingly invincible, terribly vulnerable, and remarkably human, Hellboy carries you through a movie with every element of entertainment. Spectacular visuals, humor, a completely badass gas-mask-clad villain, and convincing relationships that aren't sidelined to overdone action. And possibly the most romantic line ever given to a hero who's just saved the girl.The themes are treated with, dare I say it, a bit of a heavy hand, but they're important and appropriate for an audience that will include teens and pre-teens. And as far as flat-out, wall-to-wall, grinning to yourself entertainment, this movie is second to none in 2004.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Should be a summer movie,"This movie's basically about a musclebound mutant from Hell and his work with a secretive paranormal research branch of the government. He goes out destroying these huge tentacled creatures (and their eggs) from another dimension that look like a cross between giant octopuses and the Ridley Scott's Alien. Meanwhile, Rasputin(!) has been resurrected and he has his own plans for Hellboy and the powers Hellboy's freakishly large right fist possesses. There's also a romantic subplot between Hellboy and Liz (Selma Blair), a firestarter who unleashes a blaze when someone hurts her (think Carrie). The previews for this movie make it look like a summer movie, and that's what it should be. Those of you who are familiar with how the movie business works with strategic release dates and all realize that huge action movies that are 60% special effects are released during the summer for teenagers and the MTV generation who really don't know any better. This is more of the same. I'm 25, and the special effects seemed over done, even to me. There were a few funny moments in this film, but the film overall wasn't much better than I expected. That being said, Ron Perlman gives a really good performance as Hellboy, much better than other ""actors"" who commonly get these action movie roles(this means you Vin Diesel). A lot of the reviews are more positive than mine, but I left this movie feeling kind of indifferent as to its quality.

I'm not much for sci-fi or comic-book movies...,"...but this one was well done. One of the things I use to judge a movie is does it leave me wanting more.

In the Hollywood of a generation ago he'd be a major star, and without having to be in costume. Selma Blair is OK, but not indispensable to the movie's success.

The smoldering Ron Perlman finds an underachieving low-key starring role, but an erratic story and a distracting head-shaking script really hurt. I wanted to like this, but can't call a dandelion a rose when it is, afterall, a weed. 4/10I feel like a hypocrit reviewing a film like this while unfamiliar with the comic, there's a catch 22 here.

Great entertainment delivered in a visually stylish package,"""Thank goodness."" You only need to look at the most recent cinematic adaptation of Hellboy-Neil Marshall's unimaginative regurgitation of the comic stories ""Darkness Calls,"" ""The Wild Hunt,"" and ""The Storm and the Fury""-for proof that translating material between two mediums isn't as simple as copying and pasting. The 2019 Hellboy reboot is truer to the storylines, dialogue, and even the overall structure of the comic than the 2004 film. But the new film, in its attempt to be a gritty R-rated gorefest, overlooks the comic book's profoundly ironic humanity.That emotional human core is exactly what del Toro latched onto it formulating his own version. And most of the deviations from the comics storyline it leans heavily on, ""Seed of Destruction,"" ultimately boil down to bringing themes about family to the forefront and building the rest of the story around them. This motivation results in some substantial character changes-Selma Blair's Liz Sherman, for example, bears only the most superficial resemblance to her comic-book counterpart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

hellboy sucks,"This film really blows, OK its based on a comic book, and I am sure its really great but the film was really poor.. i didn't even manage to see the whole thing it was so boring, the action is a bit shitty and far fetched and the story does not make a whole lot of sense.The story was really weak, I mean come on a supernatural hellish demon being looked after by the youngest most angelic FBI agent i have ever seen, whats the point? Things just don't add up in this movie..On The whole i would have to say that there were one or two moments where my attention was aroused momentarily before i had enough and switched the damn thing off",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

most of these comments seem far off the mark to me...,"I'm seeing far too much use of the words ""corny"" and ""cheesy"" to suit me here. There was VERY little cheese in this flick as I understand the word (and I am a devotee of MST3K, so I think I know cinema du fromage when I see it).  OK, so maybe we've seen enough movies with Nazis as occultist villains: still, Mignola wrote it that way, and I am happy to see a movie follow its source material so closely (points for including a Spear of Destiny that looked just like the bloody real thing!).  I have seldom seen Lovecraftian monsters done so effectively--only LOTR's Watcher in the Water comes close. (And as a lifelong Creature from the Black Lagoon fan, I was personally delighted to see old Blacky updated as a bookish recluse with a Threepio accent.) I thought Perlman's world-weary, stoic workingman attitude was *far* from the melodramatic, ""tortured lone hero"" pose that some are accusing him of--he's just a hardworking guy who's unlucky in love and tired of watching TV alone with his kittycats. (Nowhere near the stock, pasted-on torment of a cardboard character like Blade, IMHO.) I suppose one *could* say that having him fight off monsters with one hand while saving a box of kittens with the other was corny, but (a) we already knew he loves cats, and (b) it was sweet, darn it!  C'mon! Show me where it says big red bruisers can't do the sweet thing sometimes. =) I'll even admit that the last five minutes had me scratching my head--I get really tired of the ""Vast Enormous Evil Universe-Destroying Ritual Foiled At The Last Instant"" plot--but, well...Overall I just loved this movie.  It is so good-natured and well-intended (all Hellboy's important motivations spring from love for someone), its humor is so gentle, and it just doesn't have that cold hard internal edge that I am so weary of in big SFX action movies (Blade, Blade II, Underworld, ad nauseam..) . Like its hero, it's a big powerhouse with a soft heart.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Just read the books,"Quite possibly one of the dumbest movies ever made, though I have great admiration for the graphic novels this film ineptly attempts to adapt. Ron P is dull, wooden and witless as a goofy comic book superhero in a clown suit loosely based on Hellboy. He has all the acting skill and personality of a crash test dummy. The script was written by a 5150 inmate and the director was heavily influenced by Tommy Wiseau. I'd mention the plot but there is none. The rest of the cast is equally clench inducing. The Hollywood studio drones cannot grasp the simple fact that hyperbolic action and effects do not make a good story. This infantile bombast will leave you partially lobotomized by the end. As always, the source material is far superior.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"Boy, that was a Hell of a movie!","I have to say I'm not really into the whole superhero/comic-book adaption genre; I didn't think much of Spiderman, hated the Hulk and find Daredevil hilariously ridiculous. The only superhero that gets me to the TV is Batman, I think even Batman and Robin wasn't that bad. Owh and I really like X-men and X-men 2, just because I'd like to be able to freeze things or to lift stuff with my mind. That all was until now, cause the X-men and Batman got company from Hellboy. There's a lot to say about this movie: The story of course isn't to original [Nazi's wanting to take over the world, with a Russian as the bad-guy..come on!] But the way the actors and the director brought the story was very entertaining and pleasing. Ron Perlman is fantastic as Hellboy, I don't think anyone could have done a better job. You come to think of him as a real person or mutant or freak or whatever, but at the end of the movie you love that guy and want him to get the girl. The girl, Selma Blair as Liz Sherman, plays a significant part in the story, for her Hellboy would do anything and he cares for her so deeply that he would die for her. She's has the ability to make fire, she's pyrokinetic, but isn't happy with her powers, she feels she's not human but also doesn't feel like a mutant. She just wants to be normal and to get that feeling she gets close with John Myers. John (Rupert Evans )is an FBI rookie hired to keep an eye on Hellboy. I have to say that this role is somewhat unimportant in the story and just doesn't really make sense. The director, Guillermo del Toro, did a brilliant job on this movie. The SFX are fantastic and on the whole the movie just looks so good. The fights are well-choreographed and very believable. The characters are portrayed in good way, you care for them and see 'm as real people. Except for the bad guy, Rasputin, he's hardly seen and when you he is, he just doesn't scare you. The real baddie was the 100+ year old Nazi Kroeger, he was like Rasputins bodyguard and with his knives and his looks he really freaked me out.I really recommend this movie if you just wanna have an good night out, with nothing on your mind and just wanna watch a cool movie. It has a lot of funny one-liners innit, gripping fights, good acting and surprisingly enough romance.This movie has everything go see it even if your not really into this genre like me!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Dissapointing,"A few people had mentioned this movie before it came out and reassured me it would be good...but it was the opposite. It started out fairly interesting but it soon started to get more and more boring with every fight scene. I mean, by the time its time for him to fight the final monster, you're already had enough. Even the director seemed to feel the same way as the last fight scene seemed very rushed and irrelevant. And Hellboy's continious ""humor/cracks"" eventually got very repetitive to the point where you know he's going to try and say a corny line every 5 mins. I don't recommened this movie at all and it seems the only people that actually enjoyed it were die-hard Hellboy fans who probably would praise the movie regardless of anything.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Even black magic can't save the Nazis!,"Strangely enough, Hellboy makes me think of Ron Perlman's performance in the slightly less impressive but underrated Alien Resurrection (oh shut up, it wasn't that bad). In both movies he plays a character that approaches his work with a casual confidence that comes from long years of general badassedness. In both movies he does hard work but has never really been challenged. He also does that cool thing where he lives unseen right here with us in modern American society, protecting oblivious humans from frightening dangers we don't even know are there. Oh, and he's massive and bright red but files down his enormous horns because he doesn't like to feel like an outcast. Can't be walking around looking like Satan, after all.The movie opens in Scotland in 1944. The Nazis are falling from power and Hitler has employed a team to try to make use of supernatural forces to maintain his regime. I won't try to explain the intricacies of the process, but basically the efforts ultimately fail, but not before a portal is left open and a baby demon slips through. After the fall of the Nazis, the American military takes a liking to the little demon, taking him under their protection and, for some reason, nicknaming him Hellboy. He falls under the care of an American scientist named Professor Bruttenholm, who also cares for an aquatic mutant curiously named Abe Sapien, and the sporadic involvement of Liz Sherman, played by Selma Blair. Liz is a firestarter but is more human than Hellboy and Abe and has a tendency to be turned off by the work they have to do.And what do they do? As Professor Bruttenholm explains, ""there are things that go bump in the night. We Are the ones who bump back."" Basically they protect the United States from otherworldly dangers. The latest danger comes in the form of none other than Rasputin, a Russian spiritualist back from the dead with plans to arrange a partnership with some evil gods which will endow him with great powers if he will open their path to earth.If this all sounds confusing, don't worry, the story is not the most important thing about the movie. It's a comic book thrill ride and it works because the main characters are all performed well, particularly Ron Perlman as Hellboy and Doug Jones as Abe Sapien. The movie cleverly explains how Hellboy and his colleagues have remained secret for all of these years (something to do with an inability to get clear pictures of him, like the Loch Ness monster or Bigfoot), and even makes his existence into a legend, a bedtime story that entertains but is rarely believed to be true.The characterization is not exactly the best thing about the movie. Selma Blair's character is almost completely uninteresting, Hellboy's sidekick is almost completely unnecessary, and, Hellboy himself is riddled with stereotypes, both human and as a movie character. He's definitely fun to watch, but other than his outstanding make-up, there's really nothing original or unique about him. He is an outcast with a deep love that seems hopeless to him, which is not to stop him from spying in one of the movie's most charming scenes when he thinks his affections are being challenged.Hellboy was released around the same time as the disappointing Punisher, which represents a much lower quality film in the same genre. It is smart enough to laugh at itself, but not because we need comic relief. The movie is made with a much lighter tone than other similar films because they understand that you can't take a movie like this too seriously without making it unintentionally funny. When we watch comic book movies, we want a hero that we like but we still want to laugh and be entertained. The CGI and some of the special effects could definitely use some work, but this is a comic book movie that even my mom could enjoy. And trust me, that's a good thing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hellboy: A review,"As all of us nerds know, Hellboy is adapted from the Dark Horse comic that's been around ever since I was a kid. I've never picked up an issue, but after seeing the movie I really wish I had. And here I am, thinking I was cool for spotting one of the hockey-imps in `Dogma' wearing a Hellboy shirt. Guillermo Del Toro was a shoe-in for this film, picking a fine cast and getting them to act well! So many times have I seen good actors fall prey to poor directors, but Guillermo is rather gifted at his craft (just pretend Mimic didn't happen). After sitting down and watching several cool previews (Van Helsing is gonna be kickass!), I was thrust into World War II and into the mind of Professor Broom. Professor Broom, played by decades-worn actor John Hurt, was sent in from the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense to sweep up the Nazis! Get it? 'Cause his name is Broom! Anyway, after a small soliloquy detailing the life and times of Prof. Broom, we encounter him and the soldiers he's assigned with trying to foil the schemes of the science and witchcraft-wielding Nazis. We're introduced to the main evildoer, the legendary immortal Grigori Rasputin, played by Karel Roden (you may know him better from his role in Blade II), his cronies, Rasputin's somehow un-aging love, Ilsa, and the missing Mushroomhead member, Kroenen, and his plot to awaken the seven Gods of Chaos. After some cool action, we are introduced to the `red ape' they decided to name Hellboy. Baby Hellboy was extremely cute, even with the abnormally large Fisto-esque right hand. We're then treated to a tabloid-laden opening credit sequence whereupon we learn that Hellboy is none-other than an alternate-universe Bigfoot.As the plot thickens, we meet John T. Myers (Rupert Evans), FBI Agent and Hellboy's new nanny. Shocked after meeting Abe Sapien (played by Doug Jones and voiced by none other than Niles himself, David Hyde Pierce), the merman with the `unique frontal lobe', John is amazed after meeting Hellboy. Extremely well played by Ron Perlman (also known for his roles as Deathstroke the Terminator in the horrible anime gyp-off `Teen Titans' cartoon and One from City of Lost Children), Hellboy would be quite the frightening site to bump into in the darkness of a back alley. Despite his attempt to look `normal' by sanding his horns down, the red skin and spaded tail give him away completely, no Clark Kent/Prince Adam mind-trickery here, no sir! This wise-cracking, cigar smoking, trench-coat wearing devil is very much a tragic character; a facet they don't utilize enough. But far too many reviewers bash and bash and bash the film until it's a soft, pulpy mess that has seen better days at the bottom of a garbage disposal. Sure there were negative qualities about Hellboy, but what movie is devoid of them? The fact is we go to the movies to be entertained, and Hellboy is a thoroughly entertaining film.There is a very healthy mix of plot-rich drama (the origin story and return to BPRD of Selma Blair's character Liz Sherman), comic relief (Hellboy's refusal to take love advice from a nine-year-old while spying on Liz and John), action (Hellboy's battling of the `Hound of Resurrection' Sammael), creepiness (beasties from space that would make Lovecraft proud) and of course, bigotry (Jeffrey Tambor's portrayal of the Hellboy-hating Cochise of the FBI, Dr. Manning). The CGI-rendered hellhound is creepy, but its often sick regeneration ability is even creepier (think limb relocation complete with bone-snapping action). All in all, from start to finish, it's a definite teaser to what the summer season will bring in terms of action and the fall season will bring in terms of horror. I'm sure those Hellboy fanboys will be more than pleased with the film.Yet again, we can thank cinematic wizardry to give us lessons on how not to judge a book by its cover and more reasons to hate Nazis. I give Hellboy three out of four stars and anxiously await a movie starring the extremely bizarre Kroenin. C'mon, you all know he's the coolest character in the movie (and the comic I'm sure) the moment you see him, who're you fooling!?",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Watch it at your own risk.,"Del Toro did an acceptable job here. The opening scenes especially where we learn the origins of Hellboy and the enemy to be reckoned with. It's detailed and compelling and remains loyal to the comic. Ron Perlman is awesome. He has a gift of giving the ""brute"" humanity(i.e. ""City of Lost Children"".)So, what went wrong? Selma Blair, that's what. She is vapid, unpleasant and barren of any emotion. I would like to say you just don't care about her character here, despite her best effort, but she just doesn't seem to put forth any. During what could have been a touching moment between her and love-interest Hellboy, she pauses for drama, but you're really expecting her to call off camera... ""Line?"". On a side note, Selma did well in her role for ""Cruel Intentions"", where she played a spoiled socialite-on-the-rise who is naturally vapid, unpleasant and barren of any emotion. To this, I attribute her current success, as she probably caught the attention of many filmmakers. But now that she is mucking up lead roles someone needs to say enough is enough, and I for one am crying uncle.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
One of the Top Comic Book Adaptations,"I definitely have to put this movie up with the top comic movies that have been made lately.  That list, in no particular order is: Batman (ONLY the first one), X-men(1&2), Superman (1&2), Spiderman, and Hell Boy.In no way shape or form does this film fall into the dregs of comic mishaps such as DareDevil, Hulk, the rest of the Batman movies, Captain America, Judge Dredd, the first Punisher Movie, and the rest of the Superman movies.The plot isn't all that great, but that isn't what drives this movie.  The special effects are also good (especially the fish guy), but they don't make your jaw drop in a Return of the King way.  What really drives this movie is HellBoy himself.  The wit and machoness of the character (evenly tempered by his green feelings towards Selma Blair), make HellBoy a pleasure to watch. Perlman does this character perfectly!  The only thing knockin the movie is the lack of a significant villain.  The zombie Nazi and Rasputin were creative, but they don't really strike you as memorable villains (example: The Joker).Unlike Stallone or Vin Diesel, Perlman delivers his witty lines perfectly unlike the previously mentioned actors where you roll your eyes every time a ""catch phrase"" is uttered.  This is a great flick, definitely worth the time to see.Oh, and to the first guy who commented....Benicio Del Toro had nothing to do with this movie....the director's name is Guillermo Del Toro....learn a little more about a movie before you decide to write an essay.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good entertainment cinema!!,This was so much better than I expected it to be. The movie has non-stop action with incredible CGI and a perfect mix of comedy with drama. The plot is decent and the script is good enough but the main things that makes this movie so enjoyable is Ron Pearlman as Hellboy who manages to give the character emotion and depth as well as being really funny at times and the movie has a great heart.

partially good,"Having no previous knowledge about Hellboy, i was open for everything when i went to the theater. The result was halfway good.The movie opens brilliantly, the story develops well, fusing fact and fiction. Then roughly in the middle of it, it all becomes just another Hollywood action flick with special effects. If i remember right, the precise moment is entering the cemetery in Moscow while searching for Rasputin.Not sure why this was the case, but it seems as if the producers wanted to showcase all CGI available at the time. Surely they wanted to impress the audience, they probably needed to top some other movie of the era and market research told them they needed bigger and better special effects to do that.The result is good fun, but also makes you forget Hellboy at the moment the end credits start rolling.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Ron Perlman can do no wrong...,"After watching ""Hellboy"" at my local cinema, I left the theater feeling that though I had enjoyed myself, something was inevitably missing.  It wasn't till a few hours later that I began to reminisce about the movie. Nothing was missing, other than maybe a great script, but this comic to film adaptation was great fun and the acting and makeup and special effects were awesome.  The bad guy in the film sucked but that was the only problem.  Ron Perlman is the man, and so wasn't the crazy guy with the black mask on. Guillermo del Toro obviously loves the horror/action genre, as do I, and I hope he remains forever a horror director.  This film is definitely worth the price of a matinee admission, and it should be a cool DVD!  Now I'm waiting for del Toro's H.P.

"Del Toro is a bad ass, and I think he just getting warmed up.","Some people take themselves so seriously they could never even bring themselves to like a film like Hellboy. Pull the stick out of your butt and enjoy this unabashed comic book movie. If you don't this is a work of a genius while check out this director's third film the devil's backbone. Knowing that Del Toro has masterpieces like that in his catalog helps me to relax and realize that this film is meant to be fun.As a blockbuster action movie it is a step above. Del Toro brings his unique visual style and ability to direct actors. He brings also a patient ability to pace the story to involve many of the complex elements of the comic.Del Toro is a hidden talent on the verge of being noticed for the genius that he is. I knew it watching Blade 2 seeing that under all the studio/silly blade stuff was a stylish director who has a amazing sense of visual style. Del Toro look weird but beautiful at the same time. His style is what Clive barker calls grotesque glamour. I respect the fact that he can also make blockbusting ass kickers like Blade 2 and Hellboy and come down to earth and make fantastic works of art like Cronos and the Devil's backbone.Any hooPearlman is great and delivers lines like he went to the Bruce Campbell school of B-movie acting, which of course is a great thing. At the same time he brings a incredible humanity to playing a demon with a heart of almost gold. I was not sure the love story of hellboy would work but with pitch perfect acting and lines stolen from Del Toro's real-life courtship of his wife it worked. The action and horror are done well but do not dominate the film. A great piece of popcorn movie art.  Thumbs up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Decent Comic Book Tribute Film,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but it turned out to be a rather fun ride. Perlman delivered his lines as Hellboy with a dry wit that made watching this movie even better. It holds the interest through out and doesn't rely too heavily on the bang-up action sequences to carry it, which is a nice trick for actioners these days. Hurt and Blair provide good back up as well. There is some silliness in between when Hellboy jealously stalks Liz (Blair) because he thinks she might be interested in the young agent-dude but it doesn't detract from this flick. Hats off to the special effects people as well, who pulled off some nice eye-popping work here. See it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The Professor And The Beast,"If you were to break down the beginning of Hellboy in it's simplest terms, the Nazi's, aided by Rasputin of Nicholas and Alexandria fame, go messing around with the occult to bring forth some evil doers to aid Hitler in his conquest of the worlds.  Those doggone Nazis!!!  If they weren't out looking for the Lost Ark or the Holy Grail then they're messing around with the Dark Forces.  One would have to wonder how they ever found time to fight a war. Before they can succeed with their plan however, a battalion of U.S. soldiers, aided by a young Professor Bruttenholm, thwart their misdeeds, but not before a cute devilish baby pops into our world.  He is captured by the Professor, who promptly gives him the name Hellboy, and we fast forward a few decades to the present.  The Professor (now played by John Hurt)has raised the little dickens to manhood so that he is now played by Ron Perlman.  Having played the Beast Vincent in the TV series Beauty and The Beast in the late 1980's, Perlman is a an old pro at working in heavy makeup.  As Hellboy, the makeup is mostly red, he has horns that he keeps grinding flat to make him look more like a human, but he sports a tail so that's pretty much a useless endeavor.  He is now used by the FBI, to combat the forces of evil.  Unfortunately, the writers and director decided to gum up the works by throwing in everything but the kitchen sink.  The plot in this film becomes so convoluted at times, an extra strength bottle of Drano couldn't clear it up and I'm not sure I'll have much success either but I'll give it a shot.First off, there's the thing about Rasputin (Karel Rodan).  He's there with the Nazi's for Hellboy's coming out party but we don't know how he got there.  Then there's a blond woman named Ilsa (Bridget Hodson). There's also some weird guy named Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) who we find out later seems to have been stitched together by an apprentice of Dr. Frankenstein.  Having escaped from Professor Bruttenholm's war party, they survive into the present day, without ever aging.  Then with a little bit of Hocus Pocus Alakazam, they summon up some CGI Demons for Hellboy to do battle with.  The problem with this demon is that every time one is defeated, two takes it's place. So, soon they're multiplying faster than you can say Roger Rabbit, and Hellboy and the rest of the world is in big trouble.  Again, I have written what happens in it's most simplest of terms so you might be able to follow it.  The explanations and reasoning used in the film are partially non existent and the rest of it is a bunch of mumbo jumbo hooey that you won't understand anyway.  What makes all this so irritating is that it is absolutely unnecessary.  There are a lot of good things going on in Hellboy that are completely wasted because of the overbearing plot laid into the film.The biggest mistake Director and Writer Guillermo Del Toro makes, is that once we see the origin of Hellboy, he skips directly into his adulthood to expedite things.  We know the Professor raises him almost like his own son, but we don't have a clue as to any of the psychological or inner makeup of Hellboy.  We know he likes Candy bars, we learn he likes to take off some times against the professor's wishes, we find out he loves a good cigar, but little else.  We simply don't have a clue as to anything about him on a personal level.  It's not Perlman's fault.  He is terrific as Hellboy, often using a dry sarcastic kind of no nonsense wit, and Perlman always seems to be having a blast.  However, since we know so little about him as flesh and blood, we can't identify with him and we end up regarding him as nothing more than what he is on paper which is a comic book hero.As if we needed reminding of the major failing of the film, Del Toro also gives us a love interest for Hellboy.  It seems Hellboy is carrying the torch for a pyrokineticist named Liz (Selma Blair). Think of Drew Barrymore in Firestarter and you've got the idea.  Blair also gives another good performance as Liz, a woman tortured by her existence.  Strangely, Del Toro does give us a brief glimpse into Liz's childhood, and because of it we understand her better than we do anything about Hellboy.  We are however, never given a clue as to how the Liz and Hellboy met, how he fell for her, why she left the compound he lives in or anything else for that matter. There is one great scene where Liz goes for a walk with John Myers(Rupert Evans)and a jealous Hellboy follows them.  It's one of the few moments of humanity given to Hellboy, and it's a big pay off.  If only there had been more moments like this than it would have been time better spent.Hellboy is also not the only superhero to inhabit the lab where he is kept. There is sort of an Aquaman type being by the name of Abe Sapien who swims around in a tank, eats rotten eggs, and his psychic powers that he uses to aid Hellboy.  He is one of the most believable CGI characters I've ever seen in a film of this type, aided measurably by the voice of David Hyde Pierce. It would have been more interesting to have seen how the relationship between Abe, the professor, and Hellboy developed if Del Toro hadn't been in such a hurry to get to his idiot plot in order to burn up his special effects budget to the max.As for the special effects and the battle scenes, they are terrific just for the sheer spectacle, and it's fun to watch and listen to Hellboy as he goes to war against the monsters.  The problem with these scenes though are the same with everything else about this film.  The origin of the monsters and everything about them is so murky, and jumped into so fast, that even these scenes are viewed from a dispassionate distance.Benico Del Toro had all the tools to make the beginnings of a great new comic book series on film.  Unfortunately, when you have the tools and the only thing you can manage is to build a motorboat instead of the ARK, then I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Hellboy is a C.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Quite Possibly The Greatest Comic Book Adaptation Of All Time,"All of my friends told me to stay away from this film.All of my friends were wrong.HELLBOY is quite possibly the greatest comic book adaptation of all time. And a solid film in it's own right. Guillermo Del Toro's visual style was perfect for the world of Mike Mignola. The characters came alive, three-dimensional, complete.I have made it a habit to see all of the recent comic adaptations. I do this more as a show of support to something of my childhood than in expectation of quality or pathos. I was disappointed in the Schumacher Batmen. I was revolted by Berry's Catwoman and the new Punisher and Hulk movies. I enjoyed League of Extraordinary Gentlemen even though they took a brilliantly crafted work and watered it down so thin its taste was barely recognizable. I thrilled to see my X-men on screen - even though it wasn't them and the nobility of Erik Lehnsherr had been stripped of him and for some reason Bryan Singer had decided to adapt an adaptation rather than actually work from source. X2 was a little better. Though I encourage you to skip it and read Chris Claremont's novelization instead. Still, it was nice to see Collossus. Blade 2 was a farce. Spiderman surprised me. Spiderman 2 was a complete waste of time. When I read that Bryan Singer had signed to direct the new Superman movie I breathed a heavy sigh of discontent. I eagerly anticipate the new Batman film, even though the changes they have made to the storyline. I trust Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker even though I did not appreciate Memento. Following and Insomnia were good films. He has the proper temperament for a Batman film. The idea of a Fantastic Four film directed by the same man who directed Barbershop frightens me. The idea of a Tom Cruise Iron Man excites me. The idea of a Nicholas Cage Ghost Rider... whatever. Call back when you decide to go back to acting. I thought the idea of making Hellboy into a live action film was a terrible idea, doomed to failure. I'd always thought it would make a good anime but not a live action. I can admit when I am wrong.Beautiful cinematography. Creature effects that utilized CG only when necessary. Lovecraftian references. References galore to the real world occult. A painstaking replica of the Spear of Longinus, in reality on display in the Hofsburg Treasure House in Vienna. Such detail. Such an epic feel. And yet such simple emotion underlying each character.I understood John Hurt.I understood Abe Sapien.I understood Hellboy.I even understood Grigory Rasputin, a man who has lived so long that he has actually come to believe that the world would be better given a fresh start and in his hands. I know people like him. I understand the mindset. The best villains aren't truly villains when you scrape beneath the surface.Hellboy was a much more three-dimensional film than Spiderman 2 which has gotten so much press lately and been called the greatest comic film ever made, just as last year X2 received the same accolades. They had more action. Perhaps they were more kinetic.

His love of monsters, outsiders and more recently Mike Mignola's Hellboy has informed his own films for a long time and now, he gets to go back to his roots.Hellboy is not a superhero comic, but it is a perfect world and hero for the comic medium. It has a very tricky tone, a blend of hard boiled thriller and B-movie action, mixed with Lovecraftian lore and a fascination for the occult. Its visual style, a significant part of its success, is no less difficult to translate effectively to the screen. Taken as a whole, it is easy to see why Del Toro would be instantly smitten, and it is admirable how many years of his career have been a series of strategic decisions to enable him to one day adapt this property. After showing his action chops with Blade II and horror mastery with The Devil's Backbone, he received a very timid green-light.While he has made concessions to a wider audience by anchoring his film with one completely human everyman main character - serving as a gateway - and introducing a love story absent from the source material, Del Toro's otherwise stubborn loyalty to the comic is laudable: the tone is spot on, the look and designs are a beautiful blend of Mignola's and Del Toro's very compatible sensibilities, and Guillermo Navarro's photography often evokes the comic's hard contrast and rich primary colors.The real coup is in the casting, and again we can thank Del Toro for standing his ground: he reportedly refused a significantly higher budget by turning down other potential leading men. Thank the stars, because Ron Perlman was born to be Hellboy, a transformation further aided by amazing makeup effects. He is ably supported by a very emo Selma Blair, the always wonderful John Hurt, and the Doug Jones/David Hyde Pierce combo behind fish-man Abe Sapien. On the antagonist-side, we have an inspired collection of freaks, chiefly Kroenen, cinema's finest SM-Nazi-ninja-zombie. How can a movie featuring such a delicacy not be worth a look?Story-wise, things are a bit less than elegant at times, but the love and care at play often more than compensates, and you get the feeling the people behind this film probably thought this was the only chance they'd ever get to make a Hellboy film. As it turns out, they were wrong, and this is a perfect appetizer to the wonderful part II.Much like the source comic, it is a bit of an acquire taste, but its wide-eyed, unapologetic geekiness is worth treasuring.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
disappointment,"There was a lot of hype for this movie, and it just didn't live up to it. I was pretty bored the entire time, and the story was relatively lame. The actor that played John T. Smith was just awful - and Selma Blair was either sleepwalking through her performance or she just plain sucks.The only bright spot about this flick was Ron Perlman's ""Hellboy."" He brought the character to life and basically carried this CGI-loaded movie. And the funny thing is - he didn't even have that much dialogue, mostly just one liners. They should have used him more and let him take over.What happened to Abe Sapien? Quite an interesting character, but they failed again here in making him unavailable at the end of the movie because he was injured.Luckily there was some action, and Perlman made it watchable. Because of his performance, I would give Hellboy a 4/10. There were just a few too many corny scenes that killed this movie for me.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Fantastic movie that I'd recommend without reservation to the strong of stomach!,"I thought that this movie was absolutely brilliant. It was also supremely enjoyable. The whole thing was very exciting, as well as amusing and just entertaining. Any fan of the action genre should love this movie, as well as people who just want a good time at the movies. The only people who I would say should avoid this movie are the very faint of heart, as there were a couple parts that I found to be too much for me. However, it is a testament to the film that I plan to go and see it again and again, even though there are parts that have been giving me the heebie-jeebies (and I'll admit that I'm a bit of a wimp about some things).I'm a huge fan of the comic, and normally in an adaptation like this, any deviation from canon drives me completely wild. But when I saw the movie, absolutely nothing bothered me at all, because it all worked so well for the movie. Everything was just exceptionally well done. It was faithful to the original without sacrificing the movie at all.All the acting and the characters were also wonderful. While I missed tough-guy Abe from the comics, psychic Abe was loveable as well, and worked perfectly as a foil to Hellboy. Ron Perlman was unbelievable as Hellboy. It quite literally is hard for me to believe that someone could get so close to the character!I loved the dialogue and the plot and the emotional aspects of the film as well. One-liners tend to crack me up, and these had enough of HB's dry matter of fact- ness to stop from being the extremely corny lines that you often find, that are out of place and make me wince. I guess Hellboy's personality is well adapted to one-liners.The movie was a lot of fun to watch, and an excellent realization of the story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Mike Mignola's Monster...,"In celebration of HELLBOY's 20th anniversary, our local comic shop (Fanboy Comics) arranged a screening of both HELLBOY movies at a post-production screening room and it was well worth the effort: the ONLY way to appreciate these kind of movies is to see them up on The Big Screen; even the new, larger format flatscreen televisions don't really do them justice. The production values of the two HELLBOY movies are mind-boggling, to say the least, and Ron Perlman was the perfect choice to play Mr. Boy. The introduction of a character not in the original comics was one of the sticking points I always had with the first movie (filmmakers always seem to need to have ""someone the audience can relate to"" in a fantasy film, but they're usually wrong about that- as they were with both THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE CROW, to mention but two of the fantasies that bog down in the ""Real World""). Still, the fx are stellar- and I can't wait to see what Del Toro does with THE HULK.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
He'll always look this good,"2004 was an interesting year for comic book movies: on quite opposing sides we had Spieder-Man 2, still the best superhero movie after Chris Nolan's vision of Batman, and Catwoman, a new low point for the genre seven years after Batman & Robin. There was also The Punisher, a fun but rather conventional flick which passed by rather unnoticed, and Hellboy, Guillermo del Toro's pet project, a film he'd been dying to make ever since he first read Mike Mignola's original comics. Now, this first crack at Dark Horse's antihero doesn't come off as a very personal piece of work (something Sam Raimi mastered to perfection with the second Spidey movie), but it's impressive nonetheless (plus, how often does one get the original author to contribute to the screenplay?).Based largely on the classic story The Seed of Destruction, the film begins in 1944, when Nazi officer Kroenen and mad monk Rasputin try to summon the forces of Hell to defeat the Allies. The ritual goes awry, and out of Hell comes simply a scared little demon child. The little fella is adopted by Professor Broom (John Hurt), whose reassuring voice guides us through that introductory sequence.Sixty years later, Broom is one of the fundamental elements of the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD), a covert organization that fights supernatural creatures. Or, as the Professor himself explains to the newly arrived Agent Myers (Rupert Evans): ""There are things that bump in the night, Agent Myers. And we are those who bump back."". The bumping in question is provided by an elite team supervised by Broom: Abe Sapien (Doug Jones, with the voice provided by David Hyde Pierce, aka Niles Crane), an amphibian with some kind of telepathic/empathetic gift linked to his ""hands""; Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), a sweet-looking girl who has the ability to ""be on fire""; and of course Hellboy (Ron Perlman), the now grown-up demon whose disregard for rules or subtlety is a constant pain in the ass for Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor), the man in charge of keeping the BPRD hidden from the public. It won't prove that easy when a new disaster is about to happen, one that could have to do with Hellboy's oldest enemies.The story is pretty basic, with the big exception of Hellboy being anything but your average ""superhero"": he's rude, smokes cigars, has a passion for kicking monster ass and greets most situations with the line ""Oh, crap!"". It's that uniqueness that got del Toro hooked in the first place, along with the imagery that accompanied such a character. As such, the film is extremely accomplished from a visual standpoint, although the director doesn't go all the way, probably because he is ""stuck"" with the duty of telling the classic origin story without taking things too far (it's easy to imagine studio executives saying: ""Let's save that for the sequels, shall we?""), which means his traditional iconography, linked to ancient myths, is practically absent the whole time.Compensation comes in terms of characterization: Perlman, who was the director's (and Mignola's) first and only choice for the title role (everyone else objected), delivers the goods with a bad-ass performance that sets the old red one apart from other ""superheroes"" while still giving him a rough charm that makes it easy to like him. Jones and Pierce's joined effort is also an admirable achievement, not to mention proof of del Toro's wisdom in having the main characters achieved through classic makeup, not CGI. Hurt and Tambor are the usual quality gu arantee in the limited time given to them, and Blair isn't that bad either (her screen-time is a bit mistreated, though). Evans, however, is a problem, his role lacking any real substance (how many times has the new-guy's-point-of-view gimmick been used?), but the aforementioned actors, plus a really terrifying villain (that would be Kroenen), manage to make is presence less irritating than it already is.So, not exactly the triumph del Toro or fans hoped for, but a solid enough promise of greater things to come, just like Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
That's the way a superhero movie is made...,"I'll admit, I was reluctant to see this movie. The superhero movies as of late have been coming up short. I expected this to be as poorly done as Spiderman. The idea of seeing another pathetic superhero movie was not an enticing one. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. The story line was outlandish but within the context of the movie and it worked. The acting was superb with the exception of the ever boring Selma Blair. If you've seen one performance by Selma then you have seen them all. Her performance is always dry and predictable. Ron Perlman was outstandingly charismatic as Hellboy. He proves that he can pull off the amiable and unlikely demon-turned-superhero just as well as he played the callous villain (he was Reinhardt in Blade II). David Hyde Pierce as the voice of Abe Sapien contributed greatly to the movie. The character was both clever and lovable. The movie was fun, interesting and never had a dull moment. Many movies start to drag when they start to develop the characters, but this movie never did. With its seemingly late-night Sci-Fi Channel plot, fast-paced action, terrific makeup and special effects, its humrous moments, and its likable characters, Hellboy delivers the superhero movie we've all been waiting for.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
As was expected,"I didn't go into the theater with great, or even good expectations for this movie.  Frankly I think the movie industry is going a little overboard with the whole comic book realization thing.  Pearlman did well as Hellboy, as good as it could have been done I suppose.  The desire for a romantic connection for Hellboy to make him seem human was clear, but the script just didn't deliver in this area at all.  Of course the action scenes were great, but that's true of any movie nowadays.  I thought the ending was absolutely ridiculous.  Simply sticking a pack of TNT down the big monster's throat doesn't satisfy my need for a thrilling ending to what should have been an impressive battle between good and evil.  The characters were well thought-up, but chalk that up to the comic book creators.  I wasn't at all impressed with this movie, and I left myself plenty of room to be impressed with as low of expectations as I had for this movie.  Don't see it in theaters, and I would only see it on DVD/Video if one of my friends happened to rent it and bring it over.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A Hell of Untold Taming,"Cinematic clichés can be tolerated if, at the very least, they bring to the fore some kind of extra added value, but with Hellboy the hackneyed core stands alone, bare and raw, for world audiences to see. Sad for them.Another aspiring blockbuster very much akin to recent Van Helsing, HB's roots lie in, surprise surprise, comic books, and perhaps those thus aligned will glean some pleasure out of beholding this particularly tepid big screen adaptation. Unfortunately, unless you happen to be a fan of the source material, Guillermo del Toro's subpar product holds no enticement whatsover. Minimal, often insultingly poor, special effects and a story that wasn't original even before Raiders of the Lost Ark came out deprive the film of any serious potential, while its cast deploy disheartening letdowns in the performance department. Ron Perlman, long among Hollywood's leading choices for monster roles, and usually excellent, but now virtually absent John Hurt both suffer from not enough script and too much fluff as obstructions to proper execution. Perlman steps in a fallen demon child, born in our reality as a result of nefarious Nazi experiments in dark magic.This Hellboy grows up to become a special agent for a counter-paranormal crime agency led by Prof. Bruttenholm (Hurt). Of course there's a few sidekicks and comic reliefs, like fish person Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), mentally supercharged love interest Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), and all-human FBI rookie John Myers (Rupert Evans). All of the above, even when put together, fail to generate any bonafide excitement. They can't even sustain a palpable interest level in the movie's lackluster proceedings, which soon degrade into trite ""good vs. evil"" rhetoric addled with CGI of a standard that wasn't eyepopping in The Faculty all those moons ago. Scant few action sequences, miserly use of one-liners and come-backs (now, what's a decent action flick without those?), as well as characters you can't quite get to caring about prevent Hellboy from reaching those higher, more rewarding planes of achievement. Or anyone in attendance from avoiding a rather placid kind of sleep.Its only saving grace may be the somewhat entertaining villains, especially Ladislav Beran as ghoulish, coolly masked foe Kroenen, and Karel Roden as a funkier version of Rasputin, the evil (and now oddly undead) monk. This overall lack of appeal comes as a bit of a shock since, through respectable projects like Mimic and Blade 2, Director del Toro has proven himself a competent genre artisan. Perhaps next time round they'll get it right. Yes, there's a sequel coming. Whoop tee doo. Through visuals inferior to some video game titles now on the market, listless storytelling and protagonists that would obviously prefer to stay home and lounge rather than combat evil, Hellboy results in a tame product not worthy of its own infamy. Plus it's PG-13. Yuck.Rating: * 1/2",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hellboy is lit,"And craftsman just as much as director, he crafts this world where the creatures (which were and still are Toro's forte) are fierce and radically charged, whether they're crucial to the picture like Rasputin's rabid, rapidly hatching slug-monsters that can only be killed one or two ways, or if it's just a minor creature like the zombie Russian corpse that leads a little of the way when Hellboy and his crew are in the main hideout of the villains (""I was better off dead!""). Toro is sensitive to the characters alongside this, and makes them all pretty believable- and I say pretty cause it's all a little simple, yet effective, in the main thrust of Hellboy's emotional core being about Liz and if she may or may not go for John over him- and doesn't dumb it down too much or contrive the relationships for the audience. It's a good balance, because there is A LOT of action in Hellboy, in fact probably at least a 60% allotment to either Hellboy fighting the monsters after him (usually in the subway, or in the Russian castle), or with the possibly un-dead assassin in the mask and leather who marks as one of the fiercest forces in comic book movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Some comic book line (I have read only a little bit) but it just bothers me. That's all. But I love Hellboy, the movie is one of my favorites. And I have to fill more lines in. Okay...I love Hellboy and can't wait for the next movie to come out. Which will be a while...but oh well. I just hope that those loop holes will be fixed next movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The Gospel According to Hellboy,"Ron Perlman is so perfectly cast as the title character in this film that I have to give it 10 stars. The way he manages to toss off what could be corny one-liners and make it all seem completely natural and in character is fascinating. It is also mind-boggling to see how he can emote from under all of that make-up and be menacing, sexy, and goofily romantic all at the same time. And even though the plotting is at times lacking in continuity, it is not too confusing for someone like me who had never even heard of the comic strip it is based on.I liked the other actors, especially John Hurt as the older Prof. Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm. His character's deep affection for the creature he calls 'son' and Hellboy's return of this paternal affection is apparent. So it's too bad that for reasons of the plot Hurt and Perlman don't spend much time on screen together. There is also good interaction between Perlman and most of the other cast members. However, for some reason the interesting character of Abe Sapien is not made enough use of. Unfortunately, the evil characters are much less developed. They are the most 'comic-book' of the characters in the movie if you take that term to mean superficial and under-developed.The only real problem I had with the film is the virtual lack of monsters for Hellboy to defeat. The trailer, which was what attracted me to this film in the first place, made me expect ""things that go bump in the night"". These ""things"" essentially end up being only one thing and a surprise related to Hellboy's last fight was already given away in the trailer. Frankly, there are more monsters to be had in the 1984 film ""Ghostbusters"" which certain plot elements in Hellboy reminded me of.Despite this quibble with the plot, what makes me love this film is that the character of Hellboy actually has some depth to him that takes him far beyond recent comic-book based films like the 2003 films ""Hulk"" and ""Daredevil"". Perlman's Hellboy, similar to Tobey Maquire in the 2002 film ""Spider-man"", actually develops and changes. There is also something in this film, whether deriving from Del Toro's script alone or from Mike Mignola's original ""Hellboy"" comic strip as well, that moves beyond the superficial use of relics, Crucifixes, and Holy Water to make a point that to my mind is essential to my understanding of the Catholic faith. It is a person's choices that determine who they become and not who they are born.I ended up leaving the theater being much more impressed with the heart and soul of Ron Perlman's Hellboy than with his huge punch. I am now planning to read Mignola's original ""Hellboy"" comics to get more of an idea of how his creation differs from this film adaptation. I can't wait for the DVD and hope that any sequels improve the script without, at the same time, taking away the wonderful freshness of Perlman's performance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Ho-hum boy,"While watching Guillermo del Toro's new film Hellboy, it was easy to see the influence of preceding superhero films in the past five years, specifically the success of Spider-Man in 2002.  Spider-man was a commercial success and critics praised the film for its mix of action and the backdrop of an outcast yearning for the love of a friend.  Hellboy looks to have taken much of that script and morphed it into a darker, more sinister type of adventure.In a paragraph, Hellboy is a creature spawned from a portal opened by Nazi's in 1944.  He is then raised by humans and released from his underground dwellings to fight the evil unleashed upon mankind.  So when the Nazi's conjure up wickedness yet again in 2004, Hellboy and the other freaks of the Department of the Paranormal are all that stands between Armageddon and human survival.There is a lot going for Hellboy.  First and foremost is the remarkable casting of Ron Perlman as Hellboy himself.  Perlman is no stranger to being outfitted in latex and costume having starred as Vincent in the television hit Beauty and The Beast in the late 1980's.  In fact, his role choices of Blade II, The Island of Dr. Moreau and Star Trek: Nemesis, might not have you immediately recognize him if you met him on a street corner.  Only in action films playing the bad guy (Romeo is Bleeding, Alien Resurrection) do we ever get the see the true mug of this behemoth.Second notch of the belt has to be director del Toro.  Previous helmer of such Blade II and the Devil's Backbone, del Toro has proven to be a successful storyteller when the subject matter is dark and sinister.Third is the interesting Dark Horse comic book character that the movie surrounds.  Hellboy doesn't have the human secret identity where a pair of donned glasses trick everyone into believing there could be no commonality between the geek and the hero.  Hellboy doesn't have that luxury.  He is a giant amongst humans with red skin, shaved down horns protruding from his forehead and a tail hidden only by his fashionable trench coat.  He chomps on cigars and blatantly goes against his father's wishes.  In short, he is the anti-Peter Parker.But for all the pros, there are quite a number of cons in Hellboy.  First and foremost being the running time.  At 133 minutes, I could not remember a film where I watched so many scenes that I thought should have hit the cutting room floor.  I felt as if del Toro thought he might not get a green light for a sequel, so he decided instead to make a long movie that should have been sniped by about 45 minutes.  Between lining up for tickets and popcorn and then sitting through countless commercials and trailers, I was exhausted before the 2+ hour movie even began.  Maybe I was in a bad mood, but I really hadn't counted on spending my entire afternoon to watch a summer-fare type flick.Also holding back Hellboy from my long term memory banks were the routine special effects.  Routine I say because there is nothing new here.  Hellboy jumping from building to building was done in Spider-man.  The return to ashes demise of the creatures was too similar to the death of vampires in the Blade franchise.  And the creature effects on a whole reminded me of what Rick Moranis transformed into in Ghostbusters.  So although I won't go as far as to say that the special effects weren't well done, they have just all been done before.Lastly, I didn't buy the love story.  As mentioned, I thought this was a cheap way of trying to copy what made Spider-man so appealing, and it just didn't work.  Hellboy and his devil looking sneers and the innocent eyelash bashing of Selma Blair's Liz Sherman.  Plllee-eze!On a whole for every plus, there was a negative which probably makes sense based on my rating of **1/2 stars.  The powers of the freaks' were interesting including the David Hyde Pierce voiced Abe Sapien, who can see into the past and eats rotten eggs, but the character of Jeffery Tambor was completely unnecessary and uneven.  The humor too was hit and miss.  Hellboy fires off more quips that Clint Eastwood did in The Rookie and only about half of them hit the mark.In all, I give Hellboy a small recommendation.  I wouldn't stand in line for a great deal of time, nor would I expect too much out of a comic book adaptation, but if you go in with the right frame of mind, you may walk out thinking you got your money's worth.  Me, I couldn't help but think of all the promise I saw in the Hellboy trailers.  It looked to be an action filled adventure with a smart ass hero who is outcast by society. Instead, I got a film that was just long, sometimes confusing and now a forethought, was only slightly better than the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.www.gregsrants.com",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
True to the Comic book Genre,"If you read comic books, you need to see this movie!  The story line was a typical Good vs. Evil with the evil coming from the past.  Overall, the movie struck me as a pleasant blend of Spawn for action, Bulletproof Monk for Nazi-occult plot, and Men-in-Black for creatures.  The antagonist opening a portal to bring back ancient evil and who's first attempt brings forth Hellboy.  The special effects were spectacular!  Especially the flame sequences and both of the portal scenes.  John Hurt's performance of Professor Bruttenholm was brilliant if disappointingly brief.  The action was almost non-stop broken up by Ron Perlman's masterful and sardonically funny portrayal of Hellboy as exemplified by his line at the end of the movie ""I'm gonna be sore in the morning.""  I wish we had been able to see more of Selma Blair as Liz Sherman, her smoldering and conflicted character was a nice compliment to the in-your-face Hellboy.  The movie left me satisfied as a complete entity, yet wanting to see ""Hellboy 2"" very soon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Nice,"Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy is a visually stunning and heart-filled adaptation of the beloved comic series by Mike Mignola.

The supporting cast, including Selma Blair as the pyrokinetic Liz Sherman and Doug Jones (with David Hyde Pierce's voice) as the ethereal Abe Sapien, complements Hellboy's personality with their unique quirks and emotional depth.The film excels in its world-building, from the shadowy corridors of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) to the dark, mythic landscapes that del Toro brings to life with stunning practical effects and imaginative creature designs. The villains, led by the sinister Grigori Rasputin, are menacing and otherworldly, providing a perfect foil for Hellboy's rugged heroism.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
