Some of the most astonishing cinematography I've ever seen.,"Some reviewers have suggested that the storyline of this movie is a bit plodding and portentous, and I'd be willing to allow that. But even if this film had absolutely no plot to speak of, I would have considered the money I plunked down yesterday to see ""Hero"" to be money well-spent, because I have been witness to some of the most achingly beautiful film-making I've ever seen. As in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" the characters here fly through the air and dance across water, but ""Crouching Tiger"" surely could have benefited from the sublime camera eye of ""Hero."" One scene of swordplay in particular that takes place in a grove of trees amongst swirling yellow leaves almost stopped my heart in my chest: It was that gorgeous. And yes, there is a plot also, one that involves various assassins with names like Sky, and Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. I have to admit that the tales and counter-tales told were a bit confusing at first, but by the time the film is over, all the pieces have fallen into place, and this chapter of ancient Chinese history has assumed a truly mythical quality. At a time when movie theaters show a lot of utter dreck, we ought to be supporting movies like this.",9.0,Anonymous,History
No Man is an Island...,"It's a story of a man who's on a mission, without regret, without remorse, without contrition, has a plan that he'll pursue, resolute to follow through, with attrition and ambitious acquisition.Comprising, but not limited to outstanding duelling with a variety of razor sharp implements and tongues, a kaleidoscopic background of intense colour and beauty, several tangents to keep you on your toes, an immense scale that befits the telling of such a story with an elegance seldom encountered in Western culture when it comes to films of this time and age, buttressed through outstanding performances by the lead actors all round - outstanding.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent,"While i enjoyed this movie very much, i believe Hero will get the kinds of reviews and responses that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (CTHD) did, and still does, ie. either you liked it very much, or you couldn't see what the fuss was all about.  This dichotomy of opinions makes for interesting study because it seems to cut across cultural and intellectual differences. Everywhere the film is shown, there will a segment of the audience that will love and rave about it, and another segment that will be wondering if they had been watching the same movie.  I can't explain why this is so, but i suspect it has a lot to do with a viewer's initial expectation of the movie, and then his perception and appreciation of the nuances in the telling of the storyline.Hero is a film that is beautiful in many aspects.  The direction and photography is artsy without being pretentious.  Every shot is worthy of being a work of art in itself.  The language spoken is traditional mandarin, but oh, so easy to the ear, even though i couldn't understand every word. (I don't think Tony's and Maggie's voices were dubbed, but i could be mistaken).  The main characters were very well acted out, especially that of the role of the Qin Emperor.  Zhang Ziyi's character was largely insignificant though, so i think she's been put in to add some star power to the production.  The fighting scenes are unusual by most standards, employing an interesting combination of CGI and real action.  Some of the powers that the characters possess appear too amazing to be true, but remember that some of the fights only took place in the fighters' imagination.  The music, though quite similar to that in CTHD, is appropriate, and sticks hauntingly to the back of your mind long after the movie is over.I went to the cinema having heard some of the hype leading to the movie, but with no real knowledge of the storyline, and not expecting a lot.  I think that helped me enjoy the movie more, because the way the story unfolded actually set me thinking and anticipating in a manner that i could not have had i known more about the storyline.  The message at the end of the movie is simple, but certainly open for debate.  In fairness, i don't think the director attempted to provide an answer, as to whether the decision made by the Nameless One was the correct one or not, but rather to ask questions. I'd better not give out too much here, but it certainly set me thinking about things for a little while after the show had ended.  These days, any movie that can get me pondering after the credits go down has got to be pretty good.Overall an excellent movie.  I'm sure some areas could be better, but i can't think of any right now.  Highly recommended.Score: 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
An Academic Perspective,"A few things about this film struck me. My background coming into it is as an East Asian Studies major - I studied the language, culture, literature, film, history, religion, and politics of China. This was all done in undergrad so I am by no means the last word on the subject.First of all, I noticed heavy use of Daoist symbols. The five elements were used - one per fight - fire, wind, water, wood, and metal. A message in the film seemed to show the Daoist idea that the harder you try, the worse you do, as Moon did in her fights. On the other hand, if you can go with the Dao (think: Use the force, Luke), you will succeed.Second, I did not know before watching the film that it was Zhang Yimou's. His films are often critical of the Chinese Communist Party and sometimes have deep allegorical meaning. Some of his films are banned in China. Hero, on the other hand, seemed to be intensely nationalistic. Lately in China, the communist government has promoted nationalism (instead of populist Communist values as they did pre-1976) with a great degree of success. The use of the word ""Tianxia"" (literally ""all under heaven,"" translated in the movie was ""Our Land"") seems Confucian and nationalistic at the same time. Although I would have not guessed this film was by Zhang Yimou from the plot or message, the cinematography was unmistakable. Hero eerily reminded me of another film, Yellow Earth (Huang Tudi), which Zhang Yimou did not direct but for which he did the cinematography.Third, historically, Hero lacked in a few very obvious places. The Qin Emperor, Qin Shi Huang, was legendary for his fear of death and his Machiavellian rule. When his character states that he no longer fears death because of Broken Sword's words and invites Nameless to kill him, he is entirely breaking with the true historical figure of the emperor. Remember, this is the emperor who built an entire terracotta army to protect him from his enemies in death and spent a lot of money and effort looking for the secret to reach immortality. He was known for a Confucian philosophy spin-off known as Legalism, which is very similar to Western Machiavellianism. While his quick mind (or his advisor's) might have figured out Nameless's plot, he would never have hesitated in executing him.Overall, this seems like a break from the usual genre one would expect from Zhang Yimou. I am not sure exactly what message he is trying to convey with this film, other than an endorsement of Chinese nationalism and perhaps Daoism as well.",,Anonymous,History
Haunting beauty and provocative message,"Hero is noteworthy on at least two counts.First, there are scenes of haunting beauty(""Duel in the yellow forest"" and ""Turquoise autumn"" to site a couple) that, like the best of impressionist paintings, are so affecting that you will forever see the world in a slightly different way having once beheld them.Secondly, the overall message of the film is a provocative one. The claim is that a degree of human casualties and suffering may be the optimal path to a better world, especially when the alternative is equally brutal chaos. This is not a popular theme. It has become much more fashionable to be anti-war in all cases. And understandably so, since variations of this logic have often been used in the past to justify atrocities. But the film provides a crisp litmus test for avoiding delusion: action must be taken with a heart void of malice and an unwavering commitment to the broadest possible ultimate outcome of good for all. Can anyone live up to this standard? Several characters in the movie do, each in their own way. If the standard could be met, would the world be a better place? These are questions worth reflecting on that have not been dealt with, to this depth, in any film I'm aware of.",10.0,Anonymous,History
My All-Time Favorite Chinese Film,"""Hero"" is a visually stunning film which tells a wonderful story. It is centered around three men-a swordsman, an emperor, and a calligrapher-who are incredibly passionate and driven. All of the main characters, including the supporting female roles, are easy to relate to. Although the story is slow-paced and projects an air of calm, it has this certain sense of urgency that will never leave you feeling bored. In this way it's unlike-and maybe even the polar opposite of-every kung fu movie I've ever seen.I was told Hero was the most expensive movie China had ever made (at that time), and in this case, the money went to good use. With its superb direction, cinematography, and soundtrack, this film will certainly stick out among the typically fast-paced, action-heavy films from China.One thing that will stand out about this film is its use of color, which many of its reviewers rightfully praised. Without spoiling anything, how color is used to tell this story is both visually beautiful and psychologically intriguing. Combined with its incredible soundtrack, it will very likely have artistically-inclined viewers agape and speechless. In the very least, ""Hero"" is a feast for the senses-like a fireworks show of color and sound. At its best, it is a wonderful story about nationalism, self-examination, and love which is told in an unusually beautiful fashion.As many will tell you, if you liked ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", you're likely to enjoy this just as much-especially if you liked the quieter, more introspective scenes in that film. Because there is so little to compare it to, ""Hero"" is a difficult film to review. However, that only gives you another reason to give it a chance. And finally, it must be said that this is Jet Li at his very best.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The best martial arts film ever made,"Rarely have I been so astounded by such a magnificent, awe-inspiring film. If you have not yet placed your eyes on this masterpiece of Chinese cinema then I cannot recommend this film highly enough. 'Hero' is by far the best Chinese film I have ever seen, and already a firm favourite of all time.The imagery is unparallelled, simply draw-droppingly near perfect scenes, with bold and vibrant use of colour, symbolism and scenery. The fluent flow of the storyline, the delicate direction of the sword slicing action, the Chinese cultural concepts and the emotionally charged scenes between characters combine to produce a simply remarkable achievement.This film has a few elements from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but is far, far superior in every way. The sleek direction from Yimou Zhang is so perfectly done, just imagine two martial arts experts ensuing in battle against each other, defying the laws of physics as we know it, and yet following them in 360 degrees in slow motion as one deflects a droplet of rain from one sword to the other, at the same time spinning and leaping over water... simply beautiful. The attack sequences are also superbly set, with hundreds of thousands of the King's warriors in formation, simultaneously firing enough arrows into the city which literally cover the sky, in addition to the viewer being able to watch the journey of a single arrowhead aimed during this event. The build up to the attack along with the unnerving tune of a Chinese stringed instrument help you, as the audience, to become firmly engrossed in your seat.The individual martial arts is also second to none, for myself particularly to see the distant shots of the whole battle sequence showing the true skills involved with fighting, such as footwork, perfect timing,aggression, counter attacks and defence. Jet Li shows he is truly the grand daddy of martial arts. I cannot stress enough how much you need this film in your life.The colourful imagery imposed by the director will take your breath away with luscious, vivid, bright, wind-blown,draped backgrounds as the setting for the important progression of the story. Even the story itself is brought to the audience in such a way which ensures your undivided attention, as there are twists in the tales and hidden plots which do not develop until the end of the film.Even short individual scenes are memorable due to their sheer awesome display of skill and speed.This film even holds a political message which is relevant to all times, especially in today's American-lead world dominance. This film has absolutely everything - including an extremely sexy young Ziyi Zhang who simply is the biggest hype to come out of china since SARS.This film was released in 2002, but this is certainly one of my all time favourites and will probably be the best film I see all year. I have never been more enthusiastic to pursue films in this genre in my life. For more action type enthusiasts who like more gore and violence check out 'Ong Bak', but for people who appreciate a fuller, visionary piece of martial arts filming, this will leave you speechless.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A most beautifully questionable film,"After two years of hearing about the myth of the most expensive Chinese film ever made, Hero has finally floated on to British cinema screens. As it flies, it trails a coloured cloth that carries the film's numerous morals and messages which descend upon you like a soft layer of fabric. This is a film that can lift your spirits and have you laughing out in sheer joy as you gaze in wonder at the perfection of the mise-en-scene and cinematography. That is, if you let the film take you on a journey, without pondering the films questionable plot points.Hero is two sides of a tale as presented by Nameless (Jet Li), a mere Prefect who defeated three deadly assassins, and the King of Qin (Daoming Chen), the man the assassins wished to kill. Nameless weaves his heroic though modest story of how he killed the assassins, but the King remains unconvinced, spinning his own version of how he believed events unfolded.Director Yimou Zhang takes us through Nameless' story first, spreading the battle sequences thick, allowing them to take their own time. In the King's version, certain battles are then revised, which is remarkably brave considering that some battles are utter fabrications. In one such fictitious fight, in a faultlessly designed set, Nameless and Sky (Donnie Yen) close their eyes and fight out the battle within their minds. Screen time is being spent lavishly on showing how two characters contemplated a fight, whilst fighting each other in a battle that never occurred. It is confusing certainly, but perhaps Zhang wished for his audience to get lost in the plot's design so that they would not question the warrantability of half of the battle sequences, which make up most of the film.Yet, it is difficult to ponder these details when they are made so utterly insignificant when viewing such a spectacle. The sheer beauty of the battles, the gentle floating of the assassins as they fly around their arenas (which range from a forest full of orange leafed trees, crisp leaves falling down to the ground like rain, to the crystal clear and calm of a mountain lake), the costumes of characters at varying stages in the story line (red for passion, green for youth, white for truth, blue for love), the amazing army scenes which feature thousands of arrows being fired into the sky to create a black cloud that descends right on top of the camera, all these elements combine to produce a faultlessly perfect image on the screen, each frame a worthy photograph that gently reminds you why cinema is the greatest art form of the twentieth century.And characterisation is not lost in this beauty as one may have feared. Despite the irritating two dimensional performance of Zhang Ziyi as Moon, the other actors carry off fine performances, especially Tony Leung Chiu Wai as Broken Sword and Daoming Chen as the King. Their performances are especially credible as they are often drowning in the memories of the King and Nameless - they need to change slight mannerisms in order to reflect whose mind they are now in.The script too is of an impressively high standard. The moments of clarity that the warriors feel are experienced by the audience also, and there are some very informed outlooks of the emptiness of warfare, communicating that to achieve peace, sometimes war is the only option. These messages of course seem fitting in our current times, underlining how ancient some of the methods of our governing body truly are.Hero is undoubtedly a most beautiful and awe inspiring film. What it lacks in plot substance, it makes up for with structure and script. It elaborates on the ground work created by 'Crouching Tiger' and is an experience that I would encourage you to seek out, as long as you are willing to submit to the film and let it guide you through its world on its own terms.Rating: 4/5",7.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best of its kind,"There have been comparisons to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, these comparisons are perhaps inevitable, some say Crouching Tiger is superior, some say this is superior. I am not going to say which I prefer, both are masterpieces in their own way. The story is very gripping and diverting. While there are the underlying themes of love, betrayal and loyalty, there is one big theme that is explored very well even if a tad surprising, the defence of totalitarianism against the chaos and insecurities of freedom. As good as Jet Li is, as thoughtful the script is, as haunting the music is, as intriguing the characters are and as fine the direction is, it is the visuals and choreographed sequences that make the film. The cinematography is ravishingly gorgeous and the scenery is stunning with each scene more beautiful and inventive than the one before it, and in terms of effective scenes the highlights in my view are the battles in the rain-drenched chess arena and autumnal forest and the midair sword fight above a crystal lake. In conclusion, a beautiful and memorable film and one of the best of its kine. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,History
pretentious beauty,"I think Zhang Yimou is at all times an excellent cinematographer and often a very good director, but the director stayed at home when making Hero.  Oh, the images are stunning, but also totally artificial.  They serve no other purpose than to illustrate how brilliantly he can use colour and composition.  There is no content. Everything in this film has been done before: the subject (The emperor and the assassin, by Chen Kaige), the plot (starting with Rashomon, evidently), the use of colours (un homme et une femme, for instance), music as counterpoint to a duel (Sergio Leone, most notably in Once upon a time in the West) and of course the idea to make a Chinese Martial Arts film accessible to western audiences (move over, CTHD, or at least, that was the idea).  Whereas CTHD had likeable characters whom you could relate to, an interesting plot, emotional development, a very charming performance by Zhang Zi Yi and on top of that beautiful landscapes superbly photographed and rousing fights (especially the one between Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Zi Yi in the courtyard), Hero only has the stunning images.  It's like a coffeetable book.  Two-dimensional.  Zhang Yimou gets out his whole box of tricks, but that's what we see, tricks.  We don't get emotionally involved.  Always you can see the artifice behind it all, and this idea of: look at me, see what a genius I am.  Beauty that's that pretentious leaves a bad aftertaste.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Impressive,"It sounded like a HK Cinema fan's ultimate wet dream... Zhang Yimou to direct a martial arts epic with Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Leung Chiu Wai, Zhang Ziyi and Donnie Yen in the cast, Ching Siu-Tung doing the action, Christopher Doyle the cinematography and Emil Wada the costumes. What more could you ask for? (Well, Brigitte Lin coming out of retirement and Yuen Wo Ping and Sammo Hung sharing the action director credits, perhaps).I guess we have CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON to thank for making the wu xia world bankable again, and generating the interest and investment required to bring a project of this stature together. There's no doubt that the US Market was a major target, and US$ went into the funding. Given this it's a tragedy that Yimou let Miramax get their paws on it and effectively ruin any chances it had of major US successApart from Zhang Ziyi and the Tan Dun soundtrack (a terrible choice no doubt enforced by US investors), CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON is not a good reference point by which to evaluate HERO. Much more appropriate is Wong Kar Wai's ASHES OF TIME, with which it shares two lead actors and a cinematographer. HERO is definitely more commercially oriented, but shares a beauty and philosophical richness with AOT, and a certain melancholy mood.The story of HERO starts off quite simply, as Jet Li begins to recount his martial triumphs to the Emperor of Qin. The tale is told in flashbacks which revisit and re-evaluate the same events, elaborating on and changing the story as we learn more. It's reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON, and is a great way of developing a mystery thriller. Zhang Yimou handles the building of the tale expertly, as one would expect from such a master film maker.Zhang Yimou himself is such an accomplished cinematographer he hardly needed to hire somebody else for the job - but if there's anybody better than Yimou it's Christopher Doyle. I wonder how much conflict there was on set though, as I am sure each had very strong visions of how they wanted scenes to look. The result doesn't show any signs of it if such a conflict occured though, as the visual style seems exceptionally strong and focussed throughout. A large part of this is Yimou's use of bold colours to delineate the different sections of the story (The green, the red, the yellow, the blue, the white). With Emil Wada's stunning costumes and the great choice of locations, HERO is almost as rich in stunning imagery as ASHES OF TIME. It's a true work of art, harking back to Yimou's older films like SHANGHAI TRIAD and RAISE THE RED LANTERN - I'm really pleased to see him making such visual films again. The visuals are sometimes let down by some unconvincing CGI effects, unfortunately.Zhang Yimou has never directed an action movie before, so people were clearly worried he wouldn't know what to do with the fight scenes that a wu xia movie needs more than anything else. It's been quite a few years since Ching Siu Tung has produced any really impressive work too, so I was rather worried - especially when I heard (from good authority) that Yimou had Ching had clashed on set. Apparently Zhang wanted more grounded, realistic kung fu, which really isn't Ching Siu Tung's thing (should have got Sammo or Yuen Wo Ping!). I guess Ching got the upper hand in the end, as the fight scenes are certainly not grounded or realistic - they're very much about the twirling and whirling and the graceful flying that Ching Siu Tung virtually defined. They're not as manic as he usually makes the action when he directs himself, though - a fact that sometimes makes the wirework look a bit awkward.A real surprise is that the weakest fight scene of the film is that one that pits the two best martial artists together. Jet Li vs. Donnie Yen opens the film with some sword vs. spear action. There's some beautiful moments, but I felt the scene lacked impact and featured some awkward moves too. Oddly enough, the fight I enjoyed the most featured no real martial artistry at all - Maggie Cheung vs (well, you'll see) in a beautiful autumnal scene of falling leaves. I guess that's because Ching Siu Tung is really not working to his strengths when he tries to do ""real"" martial arts.I had held off watching HERO for months, because as soon as I got the first released DVD (the DVD-5 from Guang Dong Face Ah) it was announced that the extended version of the film would be released in a few weeks. It's generally well known now that Zhang Yimou was persuaded to cut about 20 minutes from the film by the hatchet men at MiramAXE, who really must die first when the revolution comes. I figured the first time I see it I should see the best possible version, for maximum impact, so I was willing to wait. Well it's been 2 months now and the extended version is now indefinitely delayed due to legal issues, so I finally gave in and watched the DVD I'd had lying around for so long. Now that I've seen it I have to say I don't really see what another 20 minutes would add to the film - it seems quite complete and well paced at about 95 minutes. A little more development of Donnie Yen's character would be nice, but other than that it's hard to imagine what is missing. Longer action scenes maybe? Or perhaps just 20 minutes of Christopher Doyle's beautifully composed landscape shots, or close ups of Maggie Cheung dying.I'm glad I waited to see the film anyway though, as it allowed all the hype and anticipation to die down.  Unfortunately, when a film is as highly anticipated as this it's inevitable that there will be ""backlash syndrome"" as people feel let down that it wasn't the ultimate movie of all time they heard/hoped it would be (it was amusing to watch the reviews on CROUCHING TIGER swing between ""incredible"" and ""awful"" as hype waves ruined the experience for many, and I'm sure the same will happen with HERO).Zhang Yimou is an extremely talented director in many respects, but perhaps the greatest is his ability to get incredible performances out of his cast. With such an illustrious cast on board he perhaps felt he didn't need to try as much though (or they weren't willing to listen), as the acting isn't as powerful as I had expected. It's still of a very high quality, but doesn't evoke the same strong emotions as some of the performances in ASHES OF TIME. Leung Chiu-Wai gets the top award for acting though, which will surprise few people. Zhang Ziyi only has a small part, but shows a lot of talent too - nice to see such skill in somebody that still has most of her career ahead of her. Of course, it was Zhang Yimou that discovered and nurtured her talent in THE ROAD HOME.There are only two disappointments in HERO, for me. One is the special effects, which aren't up to the very latest standards. A little less use of CGI would have made it go a lot further (like in CTHD). The other is the soundtrack, which is really just much too similar to the Crouching Tiger soundtrack. It doesn't fit HERO as well, but it is still pretty evocative and effective - just too similar to CTHD.I still intend to pick up the extended version of HERO when it's released, to see what Zhang Yimou's ideal vision for the film was. Even running shorter than he really wanted it's a mighty fine film though, and one I have no hesitation in recommending if anybody hasn't seen it yet. If MiramAXE ever do get round to releasing it in the US, I hope it does well.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Lovely and Evil,"Visually this is a beautiful movie, however at it's heart it feels like propaganda meant to explain why it is okay that the Chinese government massacred the students at Tiananmen Square, why it's okay if they may attack Taiwan to unify the country and why Tibet must be occupied: it's for the greater good. So when you see the scene where the defenseless calligraphy students are killed by the King of Qin, remember he didn't want to do it, he just doing it for the good of China 'Our Nation' (a phrase coined by Mao Tse Tung and force down the throats of his subjects). The suffering or death of individuals doesn't matter as long as the greater good of the masses is served. It carefully promotes the ""One China"" myth invented by the government to explain China's expansion and absorption of places like Tibet.It's really part of China see? Just like so much of Europe was *really* part of Germany...Speaking of Germany: This movie is on par with the worst propaganda the Nazi's created. I can only hope that people who are drawn in by the great cast, or beautiful cinematography are not so fooled that they let the evil propaganda at the end of the movie to sneak into their brains. I can see now how Joseph Goebbels (Nazi Propaganda Minister) was able to fool so many educated people. You just shroud your evil argument with beautiful images so that the victims swallow it whole.

"Spectacular, Stunning Visuals; So-So Story","After two viewings, I am still not sure what to make of this film, story-wise. I have no problems exalting praise for the cinematography which, for many people, was the drawing point. It's what got me to watch the movie. I had heard it was the most beautiful film ever made. Well, I wouldn't go that far, but it IS visually spectacular. It's even more appreciated now that I watched one of the documentaries in which I learned to what great lengths director Yimou Zhang the crew went to, to make this look so good. It took a lot of patience, waiting for just the right conditions, such as the smooth, silvery lake which only was calm two hours a day.Overall, I didn't think the story was that appealing except for the good message at the end, about the good of all being more important than satisfying one's personal vengeance. Well, who could argue with that? As for the rest, perhaps being a Westerner unfamiliar with Eastern culture, it's harder for me to relate to the mind-set. I would be interested to know how Asians viewed this story, as opposed to similar films.Sometimes I think these wild Crouching Tiger-like action scenes are too long and overdone, but at least in this film they were very original and, once again, more visuals feasts than anything else. On my second viewing, I discarded the subtitles and went with the dubbed version to concentrate more on the stunning look of this film. It paid off. Even if I don't quite follow everything, each scene is such eye-candy that you can't go wrong viewing this.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful.,"In all honesty, Hero required a bit more patience than I thought. Tarantino wanted to present this movie to North American audiences so I thought there would have been more action, but surprise! There is much drama in Hero and the movie begins with one intention and unfolds, in a deceptively beautiful fashion, into a legend that is much larger than the characters themselves are involved! Why did it have to take so long to prove such a point?Anyway, a man who shall remain Nameless has dispatched the kingdom's three top assassins, thus easing the King's mind that he could sleep at night. But the King is curious and we see the true story and how the tale unfolds.The fights are beautiful. The battle between Snow and Moon, though lopsided, was a joy. It was art in itself. But overall, be patient. With the many changes in the story, I lost my concentration adjusting to it. But any fan of martial arts and drama must see this movie. It is that elegant.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The cinematography is breathtaking and creates a vastness to every scene,"Hero (2002) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows an orphaned man with no name who goes by Hero who builds an army and sets out on missions for an emperor who is looking to conquer the countryside and place all of China/Asia under one ruler. As Hero accomplishes his missions, he receives the opportunity to meet the emperor and tell him how he won his most recent battles.This movie is directed by Yimou Zhang (House of the Flying Daggers) and stars Jet Li (Fong Sai Yuk), Donnie Yen (Iron Monkey), Ziyi Zhang (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), Tony Chiu-Wai Leung (Infernal Affairs), Maggie Cheung (The Banquet) and Daoming Chen (The Last Dynasty).The soundtrack, settings and colors in this are magnificent. The cinematography is breathtaking and creates a vastness to every scene. The acting and choreography is sheer perfection and there is a scene with Yen and Li that is legendary. I will say the triangle and storyline of Leung, Cheung and Zhang is brilliantly executed as well. The storyline is also worthwhile and keeps the conclusion in doubt until the final scene.Overall, this is a beautifully filmed and perfectly executed movie. This is an absolute must see and a masterpiece. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Poetry in Motion,"Ying Xiong (Hero) is poetry in motion. But that doesn't necessarily transfer to a good movie. I have not seen any movie with cinematography and choreography done in such pure artistic style, resulting in an almost surreal visual experience. By using traditional Chinese instrumental music, the score of the movie is also excellent. The story itself, though very much modernized and contrive, is actually somewhat believable ¨C stories of assassins at this particular time period were abundant. Most lead actors perform adequately, including Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Chen Dao Ming and Zhang Ziyi. But the substance does not measure up to the style. First of all, the dialog is just way too modernized, and at times very pretentious. Second, Jet Li may be the best martial artist ever on the silver screen, still he really cannot act. Since much of the movie depends on him delivering convincing lines, it just falls flat right here. A good film, for the visual and score along, but not a great one worthy of an Oscar.",6.0,Anonymous,History

I am somewhat confused...,"Confused, mainly because when I saw Ying Xiong on DVD-Video recently, I did not see the masterpiece promised by many others. What I saw was very entertaining, granted, but perhaps the inclusion of Quentin Tarantino's name as a ""presenter"" on the cover art put me off. This man needs to get his head out and realise he is not the messiah of cinema that he so often tries to project. Having said that, however, those who are fully involved with the film give it their all, and the results are frequently awesome. Forget all the stereotypes you know about poorly-synced Kung Fu flicks. This is a film with a serious story to tell, and that the story allows for many a fleeting display of martial arts skill is mere coincidence. All the elements for a brilliant epic are here, but something feels like it is missing. If I had to take a rough guess, Ying Xiong tries to be China's (or Japan's) answer to Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo, but doesn't quite get there for a number of reasons.Perhaps it is because of the comparatively short screen time. I am always the first to complain if a film goes on for longer than it should, but the ninety-nine minutes I saw here did not seem adequate to the storytelling task. The story, for what it is worth, revolves around an assassin who is known as Nameless. In the years before China was a unified country, he faces down three assassins who plot the murder of the feudal Lord who would unite the provinces into one nation. The film is told in a flashback style, detailing how Nameless fights down each of the assassins, and to be honest, this is where part of the problem begins. Until I read the IMDb summary, I had no idea that the film was about a warrior preventing the assassination of a King. With the flashbacks, flash-forwards, flashbacks within flashbacks, and everything in between, I was lost and confused. I have enjoyed other films where flashbacks occur within flashbacks, Ghosts Of Mars being a good example, but this risky cinematic technique was done well, as well as sparingly, in those films.In spite of the confusing edit and screenplay, Jet Li proves that he is currently the most famous lead in straight-faced Kung Fu films for a reason. His acting, especially the physical mannerisms, help to sell the character where the dialogue often will not. Some of his most striking scenes involve his complete silence. Unfortunately, the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon style of choreography is used here, with actors moving about on wires and going through impossible motions that really do not suit the story. Yes, the style worked well in CTHD, but I really felt, given the tone and serious context of the story, that a more down-to-Earth style would have helped. It is not a good sign when an even more outlandish Jet Li film, The One, features a more believable style of fighting than this one. Especially given that The One was basically a load of the proverbial, albeit one with a very sound background explanation. The fact that it had Carla Gugino, a far more likable lead actress than I have seen to date in any Asian film, didn't hurt.I admit, once the confusion over the nature of the plot is settled, it does make the film somewhat more entertaining. Unfortunately, it also raises a lot of questions that the film fails to satisfactorily answer. The question of why one would want to protect this King, who is seemingly responsible for the annihilation of a village as depicted in the early stage of the film, is high among them. Also taking a high place among the unanswered questions is why there is all the need for this study of calligraphy to defeat one of the three assassins. Yes, I realise that it is meant to improve fighting techniques, but the amount of time devoted to calligraphy in the film makes this easy to forget. I also found the derivation of swordsmanship secrets from calligraphy a bit hard to swallow. Maybe someone can figure something out about me from the way I always write in heavy block, but I doubt it will hold true once they take the time to make further observations. Still, the rolling out of the armies in each scene of this kind were impressive enough to justify the viewing time. Even if the repeated calls for Nameless' head towards the end of the film got on the nerves a bit. I am somewhat curious as to how the arrows were shot, too. If they are CGI, then they are the most impressive CGI I have seen for a while.In all, I gave Ying Xiong, or Hero as it is known here, a seven out of ten. It is not the best Kung Fu feature you will ever see, nor is it an indispensable classic of human drama. What it does have going for it is a very solid lead actor who should appear in more films, and some absolutely stunning cinematography. Fans of martial arts-based cinema need look no further, while those of us who prefer solid story or characters will also do well with a singular viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,History
What kind of hero Zhang Yimou believe in?,"As a native Chinese, I can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a 'better world'. I said 'better world' because it is a lie that Chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand years!I guess most western audience may don't know Qin Shihuang(means the first emperor), the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient China. The Tianxia(Chinese word was spoken by the king, means 'the land and the people') spoken from his mouth is totally lie. From then on, one after another, all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said.Another fact is, Qin Shihuang's empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people.Well, I do like the beautiful scenes of this movie, but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Space,"Two things interesting about this project. First, the sad news, at least for the Chinese, that the Japanese have finally won. This is a Japanese film in all important respects: the theming by lush color, the rather modern notion of benevolent conquest (genuinely originating in the Persians but only used since as justification for selfish empire, specifically in this case Japanese conquest - and adopted by the Chinese only since the war) and of course the wholesale swallowing of Kurosawa.Kurosawa is here obviously in the story: it is half 'Rashomon' and half 'Ran.' But more important is Kurosawa's theory of film as a device to capture space. As with Parisian impressionist painters, the thing painted is not the point. It provides an origin only; the painting is about all the magical things that happen in the space between the subject and the viewers eye. The paintings, and Kurosawa's films are about that space.Kurosawa invented the technique of shooting from very far away with a telephoto so as to flatten space, and at the same time creating (usually three) layers of space. Often, he would engage the space directly.This masterful film is obsessive about the point and may be the most lush swim in dimensional space you are likely to find with the technology we have. Every shot is oriented around not the action, but the space that contains the action. Falling water, dust, lots of blown fabric and hair, feathers, arrows, even book tablets and those leaves! With lots of bamboo screens, all these are used to show the space, plus the usual fantastic mountains, clouds and forests - even at the end the Great Wall and of course the moving waves of soldiers and courtiers.Many of the architectural shots are lifted from Welles' ""Othello.""The matter is not lost in the copious allusions to mental space: the game of Go, music, calligraphy, politics, and love. All these are defined, exercised and conflated with one another in terms of space and the intrigue of space with a little more effort in the latter items on the list. Then, waving lamps are used to make 'murderous intent' spatial.Unlike 'Crouching Tiger' which this resembles not at all, the camera is static, not dancing. Where Lee emphasized the ballet of the fight by engaging his camera, Zhang stands back in the space. Where Lee conceives fights not among the participants but their masters, Zhang shows us not the fights, but the battles among the true worlds of the fights - the worlds of different colors.What we see could be the imaged Go game, or the imaged fight within it, or the imaged story Nameless tells, or the one the King tells and on and on with nestings of imaginations.Every nation creates their own movie to explain themselves. We in the US seem to like more militarist stuff. Except for the thuggish motive (my war for my kind of peace), we would do well to have stories about stories like this one through four layers until they reflect back on the origin. Complex story space in rich real space.If you are going to see this, you really must see 'In the Mood for Love,' which features Broken Sword and Flying Snow in something of the same relationship they have here. It is one of the best films ever made and truly spatial in a purely Chinese manner. It will completely transform your enjoyment of this.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,History
Superb,"I just watched Hero a second time. The first time was done about two years ago. I wasn't too impressed then. Perhaps I liked Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon more and I was constantly drawing comparison to it while watching Hero. I also had extremely high expectation. As a result, I was quite disappointed.The second viewing experience was very much different. I knew what the story was about. So I focused more on the camera style, cinematography and acting skills etc. And I liked it much more.It's an excellent movie. Must-see for every kung-fu movie fan, or those who like fantasy or history or drama or romance. Well, that's almost everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Visually ravishing; philosophically suspect.,"After two years of delay, the Chinese martial arts masterpiece ""Hero"" arrives in Western theaters, and audiences look for the same dazzling swordplay that made ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" such a success (for the record, though, I wasn't a big fan of that movie). While the plot isn't particularly original, or important, it involves the arrival of Nameless (Jet Li) at the court of the King of Qin [Shi Huangdi, although his name is never explicitly stated on screen](Daoming Chen). Nameless has killed Long Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), and Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), three assassins who have vowed to kill the King to prevent his wars aimed at conquering all of China. Nameless recounts his story of how he defeated Long Sky, and then strategically set Flying Snow and Broken Sword against each other; also involved is Broken Sword's apprentice, Moon (Ziyi Zhang, from ""Crouching Tiger""). The King of Qin, however, believes that Nameless and the three assassins are in fact engaging in an elaborate deception to kill him. The film borrows from Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" (or, really, any of the movies that have already borrowed from ""Rashomon""), in that we see multiple accounts of what supposedly has (Nameless's account, the King's version, and what really happened), each one using a different colour scheme (Nameless's story is primarily red, the King's version is blue, and the real story is white; green is used in the present, as well as in a few other flashbacks). The fight scenes are superbly staged, balletic even; my personal favourite was the fight between Nameless and Broken Sword over the lake, with the two combatants skimming across the water. The scale of the film is awesome, with director Zhang Yimou showing us massive armies arrayed in the desert and at the Court of Qin, and thousands of arrows flying through the air, obscuring the sun. Acting is good, with Maggie Cheung being the best, but there are no performances that will win Oscars; martial arts movies aren't built on acting in the traditional sense. The only troubling thing about ""Hero"" is the underlying philosophy that the film seems to promote. Nameless comes to believe (as Broken Sword already did) that the King of Qin's bloody wars and tyrannical rule are justified in that they will unify China, and Nameless allows himself to be killed rather than kill the tyrant. I find that entire philosophy suspect. In the end, though, ""Hero""'s philosophy scarcely matters in the long run. It's a visual film, and a great one. I give it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Super Hero.,"Every year as August winds down, ending with it the summer movie season, I get burned out on theatrical releases, having seen most all of the major summer flicks, as well as many independent films. Typically one release resurrects my cinematic spirit, and this year ""Hero"" (""Ying xiong"") filled the role. It is the latest martial arts film from China to invade American cineplexes. In many ways, it reminds of the last such successful film, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" except that ""Hero"" has a plot. Just kidding...sort of.In actuality, the story is much more concise and straightforward than ""Crouching,"" despite the non-linear method. In ancient China, the nameless...er...hero of the story, portrayed by the familiar Jet Li, arrives at the palace of the emperor. Having slain three of the emperor's enemies, Li, whose character is nameless, has come to claim his reward. As the two discuss how Nameless accomplished his deeds, we see (through extensive flashbacks) what did and didn't happen, and the truth is ultimately unearthed.Were the plot told in a linear manner, the story would not be especially noteworthy, but how the tale is told elevates the narrative. With truths being revealed in an unorthodox order, the audience is kept off-guard and pensive, trying to match wits with the two primary characters, who are each uniquely brilliant.Like most Chinese cinema, much about ""Hero"" is drastically different from the majority American cinema. Most blatantly apparent is the vivid color scheme. Exploding off the screen, the variety of dominant colors throughout the flashbacks propels the film by generating a bold yet natural vivacity that leaves viewers eager to indulge in whatever beauty may occur next. The cinematography of some films (""Lord of the Rings"") rightfully soars due in large part to the scenery. But ""Hero"" excels using traditional photography in a non-traditional manner with a dramatically ebullient color palette that literally takes one's breath away at times.Despite the nearly peerless visual artistry, ""Hero"" still presents an occasionally difficult viewing experience, one that does not necessarily detract but does sometimes distract. I say this fully aware that as I have been raised, for better and worse, on American cinema, and am thusly accustomed to such work. Chinese films are quite simply different, and these vagaries of pacing, shot length, etc., prevent full involvement for many American movie-goers.There isn't one feature of ""Hero"" that causes this disconnect, as all aspects are well executed. The small cast, with Jet Li as the primary recognizable face, effectively exhibits the renowned passion of Chinese cinema. The editing is clean and efficient, maintaining a clear narrative when the story could easily have been convoluted. None of the parts produce the difference. It's more like watching a genre you've never seen before; you're simply not entirely sure how to react at times.Bottom Line: If you're a fan of Chinese martial arts films, then you may have already obtained a DVD of ""Hero,"" since it was released in China two years ago. If not, or if you want a different cinematic experience, then go see ""Hero"" to discover the upper tier of Chinese cinema. You won't regret it. A high 7 or low 8, out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A marvel with a sinister message,"'Hero' tells a clever, though somewhat thin story of a group of assassins who plan to murder the king of Qin, that is, the ruler who would go on to unify China in the late 3rd century BC and who is today known as Qin Shi Huangdi. Two of the group get a chance to kill their target, but both reconsider at the last moment. The story is interspersed with long and carefully choreographed fighting scenes that would stand out in no way (every wuxia film offers lots of that kind of stuff) if they were filmed less beautifully: Each fight has one underlying colour scheme; as a whole, they turn the movie into an esthetic marvel. However, it is a marvel with a sinister and deeply disturbing side. By eventually refusing to kill the king, the two lead assassins acknowledge that Qin Shi Huangdi was justified in using all kinds of terror - terror that is never shown or mentioned in the film but that covered anything from burning books to burying people (alive, that is). All for an ulterior aim: unifying China to avoid bloodshed. This is more than merely the old idea that the end justifies the means; it is the same trite justification of despotism that has been en vogue at least since Jean Bodin. In the final scene, the film heavily implies that today this 'principle' is as valid as it was more than 2000 years ago. No wonder China's ruling oligarchy were pleased with Zhang Yimou's product (and with its international reception): As a propaganda tool, it works admirably, at the same time advertising the esthetics of China's culture and justifying the brutality of its regime.",7.0,Anonymous,History

I'm still saying 'WOW', and this may go on for days.Every shot is a masterpiece of composition combined with fluid, stylized movements as graceful and technically precise as the strokes of a master calligrapher's brush. And the storyline is faithful to the best of the classical taoist fables. Lao Tzu and Sun Tzu breathe in every frame of this film.I was grateful as well to the film's releasers for not dubbing it into English, which would have destroyed the unity of this grand opus.A gorgeous film, absolutely stunning.

Superb.,"Despite any controversy or disagreements over the exact sentiment that Zhang Yimou portrayed, it is still a good movie through and through.Irregardless of the ultimate message, for which you might or might not come to fully comprehend, the movie was well-executed. Well-acted with graceful fight choreography mostly centered around swords. Colours were used purposefully. Dialogues were written to move the plot and bring about a sense of understanding and emotion, performed convincingly. Every word spoken has a strong sense of meaning and purpose.One gripe I might have about this which might or might not be of any importance to you is that although I watched the Director's Cut with a runtime of about 100 minutes, it certainly felt longer than that. Felt like an epic of more than 2 hours with its sprawling landscapes and liberal use of slow motion shots.All in all, a well-executed film in almost all aspects.

One of the most stunning movies both visually and spiritually.,"Hero, as well as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" are easily two of the greatest martial-arts films EVER made. Personally, I don't feel that the label ""martial arts"" even applies to either of these films, since they both go SO far beyond that convention and stand strong on so many other merits. The story of ""Hero"" is not that complex, but does offer a uniquely suspenseful trail. The unfolding twist in the story appear to have one main goal....""color"". I don't know that I've ever seen a more visually beautiful film, in my entire life. To me, there is a gigantic power to a film that is so grand and magical....while not superficially falling prey to a large budget or CGI. For those that understand the art of storytelling, Asian film and have a sense of spirituality...this film will make your heart cry the warmest tears.

Beautiful but disturbing pro-imperialist message,"The cinematography in this movie is incredible. While the wire work fighting scenes strike me as a bit outdated, the use of colors and music make for a poetic spectacle.The story at face value also deserves credit. However, when viewed in the context of our modern day world, one cannot help but be sceptical of what it is the audience is supposed to take away from this movie.Chinese imperialism has threatened East Asia for decades now. Tibet, Hong Kong, East Turkmenistan (Xinjiang), the South China Sea; all areas where control over the land and/ or its people has shifted to communist party rule. And fear of this becoming reality is all too real in the country of Taiwan, as well. This movie shamelessly promotes the idea that territories should give up their sovereignty for the greater good.""All Under Heaven"" is an idea that dictators through time have weaponised. This movie's creators clearly appear to favour this idea, however.A story well told, with mesmerising screen play, but ultimately objectionable in its disturbing message.",7.0,Anonymous,History
People failed to understand the story,"I never understood why people say that Hero does not have a story. The tittle explain exactly what the story is about: heroes willing to sacrifice everything for a propose. Very eastern if you ask me. And what make the story of a hero a legend? The stories which are not real, the fantasy that is built towards the real story; and it was with that that Zhang Yimou played so magically. Even the slow motion fight scene people failed to understand! Which I refuse to explain. It's a very moving and beautiful movie. The photography and the astonishing use of colors are breathtaking. But it is not an easy movie for our western culture, I have to agree. I am a big fan of Zhang Yimou and this is my favorite movie so far.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Questionable stance but oh so beautiful,"For all of Hero's striking use of colour and landscapes, the drama, characters and ideas are not sufficiently compelling enough to sustain the martial arts. It's easy on the eyes, but too segmented to gather much momentum and too art-directed to convey much urgency. However, I can't deny the result. Both thrilling and thoughtful, offering imaginative and meticulous set pieces as it considers questions of loyalty and the individual's role in history. It is not so much a historical epic as a kind of highly determined ballet: dreamy with bloodless violence, relying less on shades of character than on magnificence of gesture. For all my grievances, the performances of its leads are captivating, Dun Tan's score mesmerising, while Christopher Doyle's photography is overwhelmingly stimulating. Hero is a dazzlingly lensed, highly stylized meditation on heroism even if its ideology is confused.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Wuxia films don't get better than this.,"Hero is one of the most stunning martial arts epics ever. I was somewhat disappointed by recent releases like Curse Of The Golden Flower (2006) and House Of Flying Daggers (2004). That's not to say that they were bad because they were filmed well and were sometimes thrilling. But their stories didn't pull me in. Hero, however, is a triumph. It really touched me with its story of revenge, war, politics and devotion. The first thing I noticed while watching it was its superb use of color. The cinematography is gorgeous, and often scenes are dominated by only one color. China rarely looks this good in films. The martial arts fights are elevated to graceful and artful. The backdrops of these fights are stunning. The fights obviously have elements of fantasy. Thus, even special effects were used. None of them look fake, however. Even the fight on a lake was filmed without errors or missteps. In the acting category famous actors from Hong Kong were cast as the assassins. It was good to see them in one film. They're middle-aged now but this is fitting because they play wise and experienced fighters. The real surprise is Chen Daoming, playing the King of Qin. He's a tyrant but Daoming turns him into a likable persona, just what the film requires. He hardly moves during the film, but just the way he talks is interesting. The film's message is definitely thought-provoking. Hero is one of the most expensive films in Chinese history, and also the highest-grossing. There are many extras, big imposing architecture, and incredible martial arts fights. It's definitely a must-see film, one of the best martial arts films ever. I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Creepy film and creepy reviewers,"There are things that people must understand when we look at a film like this - the historical background and its significance in its current political and cultural settings.So first thing first - who is the King of Qin (later the Qin Emperor)? He was (and still is) a highly controversial character from over two thousands years ago, who is notable for unifying China but also someone vilified throughout Chinese history for his cruelty and brutality in the pursuit of his objective. He can be regarded as a the founder of the country called China (the English word ""China"" is often thought to be derived from the word ""Qin""), but the dynasty he founded collapsed rapidly after his death due to widespread civil revolt as a result of the hatred for his regime.What is his significance at present time in China? The Qin Emperor was hated throughout much of Chinese history, but attempts were made to rehabilitate his reputation in recent times, most notably by Chairman Mao during the 1970's. To the Chinese, historical justification of a political regime is important; and Mao, before his death, was concerned about his reputation after his death and made a conscious attempt to justify his totalitarian and brutal regime. Thus the Qin Emperor was praised for the destruction of division in favour of unification (note that this is the point made by the film), and that his brutality was justified as necessary in difficult times. In fact the criticism of him was that he wasn't ""totalitaran"" enough, perhaps in retrospect that is something that Mao was able to outdo the Qin Emperor. This image of the good dictatorship despite the great evils done is one that the current inheritor of Mao's China is keen to maintain.The Qin Emperor is therefore not just an interesting historical figure, but someone who embodies the mindset of the ruling elite of present day China. And we can therefore understand this film in term of the political and cultural context of the current regime in China (the film has the full approval of the Government of PR China). It tells us that division means violence (therefore there can be no independent Tibet or Taiwan), and to ensure peace there has to be single dictatorship and state violence is necessary, furthermore individuals must be prepared to sacrifice themselves to achieve such end.The easiest way for non-Chinese to understand this is to imagine of something that never happened - the unification of Europe by Nazi Germany (this is not an unreasonable comparison as the Qin Emperor had in China before Mao's revisionism about the same reputation as Hitler). To ensure peace in Europe, you should argue that there must be no separate nation states in Europe, and brutality is necessary to ensure peace. Peace is the be all and end all, even if as can see that in fact there has been relative peace in Western Europe after the Second World War with the separate nation states still intact.And from this we can see from this how creepy some of the reviewers are. One guy from Germany argued that we should forget about the politics and just concentrate on the beauty of the film. Just imagine saying that about Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph des Willens"", strange that it should come from a German. One guy argued that it is about peace, and unification is necessary to ensure it. But we can see that this is a completely bogus argument when we look at history (unified Qin collapsed in violence quickly, while Europe remains in relative peace as separate nation states). One guy from the US argued that, unlike the self-centredness of Western culture, people in Chinese expect to make sacrifice for the greater good. Well, tell that to the Chinese people living in US that they should be prepared to sacrifice their human rights for the good of the US government and see how far you will get.Other reviewers stated that the film is not totally sympathetic to the Qin Emperor as it showed him losing control (he cannot pardon Nameless, and must execute Nameless because his bureaucrats think he must). This makes the message of the film even worse - you should sacrifice your life for a totalitarian state effectively ruled by faceless and heartless bureaucrats? I can't imagine anything worse.It is, in all, a creepy film with a creepy message, supported by some creepy reviewers. Sad to see this listed among the top 250 films in IMDb.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Nameless, Broken Sword and Flying Snow","I've liked most of Yimou Zhang's movies. 'Ying Xiong' (a.k.a. 'Hero') may not be one of his finest films but it's the execution that is fascinating. The visuals are breathtaking and the camera-work is energetic. Yimou's use of symbolism through elements like water, earth and wind and his use of colours (namely red, blue, white and green) is very amusing. The fight scenes are well choreographed but the slow motion and gliding in thin air is overdone (though not as irritatingly as was in 'Wo Hu Cang Long'). The background score flows beautifully with the ongoing sequences.However, the main problem is the story. The first hour or so focuses on 3 different versions of one event most of which weren't true. The last 20 minutes shows us what really happened/happens and the conclusion is pointless. Well, the entire story has no point. Had Yimou picked a compelling story to tell, then 'Ying Xiong' may have been a masterpiece.Jet Li fails to impress. He fails to show any emotion at all. Ziyi Zhang's expressions look forced. She lacks spontaneity. Daoming Chen is strictly alright. Donnie Yen does well in a small role. However, the best performances come from Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Maggie Cheung. They beautifully display the love between Broken Sword and Flying Snow and make it easier for the viewer to sympathize for them in spite of their flawed characters.So, 'Ying Xiong' has almost everything going for it. It only needed a good story and better performances from some of the cast.",,Anonymous,History

"Hero is 'a tale about loyalty and trust, about a code of honour among warriors'.","I have seen a lot of films and every now and then I come across one that really touches me with its story, action and mise-en-scene. This is one of those films. Hero is 'a tale about loyalty and trust, about a code of honour among warriors'. It follows the story of a nameless assassin (Li) in the third century BC in China who tells the King of Qin that he has killed his three fiercest enemies. But is he telling the truth? This is the first action film from director Yimou Zhang and features non-action actors (Cheung, Ziyi and Chen) who manage to look like pros. They even did most of their own stunts at the director's request. The house of chess sequence includes a traditional Hong Kong style fight sequence from martial arts legends Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Hero is full of strong, vibrant colours and great choreography. Some of the film is shot in black and white (the house of chess sequence) and some scenes are almost totally red. Colour plays a dominant role as it has many connotations. It gives the film a stylised look. Hero is full of visual poetry. The wood sequence where Moon (Ziyi) seeks vengeance after her master's death is a spectacular action sequence. As Moon and Flying Snow (Cheung) fight, hundreds of golden leaves fly through the air. My favourite sequence is the one on the lake. It is so beautifully shot. It took three weeks to film as the water had to be perfectly still but it was worth it. It is one of the most memorable sequences of the film. The blue of Broken Sword's (Leung Chiu Wai) clothes blends well with the setting. There is a lot of wire work and when Broken Sword and Nameless bounce off the water you can imagine how much time and effort went into the choreography. The scenes of Hero are full of emotion and the music reflects the mood of the characters well. It also features a lot of exotic locations. Hero ticks all of the right boxes - action, story, direction, music, mise-en-scene, location... I could go on forever.

Good.,"I've seen better films with Jet Li. I've seen better films with (Maggie) Cheung Man-Yuk. I've seen better films with (Tony) Leung Chiu Wai. I've seen better films made by Zhang Yimou.With that said, HERO (Ying Xiong) is a GOOD film. It could have been much better though.What the movie lacks in plot it adds in action sequences, slow-motion and experimental color corrections. The color corrections are so well used that to the end we can clearly see that they haven't really worked on it as well as they should have. Face-colors, something that is very important, changes between scenes, since they have added to much magenta in one scene and yellow in another. Tweaking one color, without trying to keep the skin tone at one level, makes the all out color correction look like it was made by an intern. It isn't well done. Maybe Zhang Yimou tries a little bit too hard.The action scenes are nice. Not as cool as in early (1992-1995) Hong Kong movies with Maggie Cheung and Anita Mui, but they are at least nice to look at.The story is told in flashbacks. If you make a movie all told in flashbacks you really need to have a good reason for it. The reason why a character in a film is in a special state of life is not important - what we are interested in is the journey there. But we don't know the end before the tale begins. That is the bad thing about flashbacks.Yimou tells the complete film with flashbacks (and flashbacks in the flashbacks). It's not confusing, because he use other colors on the clothes for each flashback scene/world. That is nice. But it isn't fun either. Actually, when we have seen one hour of this movie, we are pretty fed up with being told the same thing over and over.The movie is really only a very short tale that would have been very interesting to see if it was a short-film. But stretched out to a feature - no. The screenplay is this films most low part.Zhang Yimou have added several humours elements to the film. That is good. Actually, all the comedy is what makes this film worth watching.This film could have been so much better. But Yimou is not an action director, Jet Li isn't a drama performer and quite frankly, Ziyi Zhang isn't a good actress.People who think this film is ""sooo good"" and ""sooo beautiful"" haven't seen anything else from China or Asia. They probably are totally stunned by the wire-performances and the neat package, and are too busy reading the subtitles to understand that this film isn't nearly as good as ""they say"". We have had the same problem before with the REALLY BAD movie CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. But that film lacked everyhting, so in comparission, HERO is very good.To be honest, I was dissapointed. HERO is probably the lamest movie Zhang Yimou ever made, and a low point in all the casts careers. That is sad. Because the sets, the idea, the filming - that is all impressive. The colors, the action and the screenplay need more work.Seek out the early films by Zhang Yimou, Jet Li and Maggie Cheung to see good and cool movies instead.6 out of 10 because of some of the technics.",6.0,Anonymous,History
I have to say it's not as good as many users had commended.,"I have to say it's not as good as many users had commended. Most Chinese do not regard it as a masterpiece at all. The plot is so surreal and illogical, the theme is way too political!I was very disappointed (even now， two years had passed). It's simply not worth to see, the film is pointless. Actually, for many of us, it's quite insulting. Initially, I couldn't believe it is directed by Yimou Zhang - one of the best directors in China, who directed To Live, He understands Chinese so well, yet he directed this - a film without HEART. The acting is awful as well, practically not much acting. The actors and actresses are the best ones from China and Hong Kong. Their performances in other films, except Jet Li's, are so much better and more convincing.People (without much knowledge and background of China and its history and culture) may be misled by this film, they might think it reflects culture, history, martial art¡­, but not really. It is an ill illustration of our culture and values. Also, some people might think it is an independent film. It was the most expensive film ever made in China. Not saying this is not good. Just saying it's an extremely commercial film; presenting art is not the main purpose. And, to get a wide release in China, the theme is strictly censored and 'modified'. For Chinese, it's a lame and overly pretentious film just like the way Americans view Pearl Harbor.One of my friends told me: ""I think it is an advertisement rather than a film, because the plot doesn't make any sense to me! "". Not just an ad for martial art or scenery, it is an ad made by the government! The way it approves dictatorship disgusts me. We simply do not agree its concepts; ordinary Chinese don't want to be governed by an idiot who kills millions of people.And, it's not a film; it's just a collection of 'beautiful' photos. Yimou Zhang is a big fan of Akria Kurosawa. From his first film till now, he reproduces the ideas, the techniques and even dogmas of Akria Kurosawa. The suspense and the 'fantastic' scenes appeared in Ying Xiong is just a combination of Kurosawa's Rashomon (In the Words) and Kagemusha (The Shadow Warrior).I just can't believe. After two years, there are so many people on the other side of the ocean, like this film so much. How ironic!",2.0,Anonymous,History
~ Enthralling ~,"Not since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon have I enjoyed a movie like this. The story is well done, and keeps you hanging as you try and figure out the truth behind the movies central characters: Nameless, Flying Snow, Broken Sword, & the King of Qin. In the tradition of the ending to Clue, it takes you through each scenario of what may have been as the watcher along with the King tries to decipher fact from fiction.The lead actors & actress are easy to watch and make you enthralled with the characters, especially as the plot takes twists. Pure enjoyment to love them one moment, hate them the next, and then find yourself identifying with them. A supporting performance by Ziyi Zhang as Moon, servant to Broken Sword is also well done as her role throughout the film changes in strengths along with the main characters.The fights move fluently and fun to watch. Anyone who is a fan of this type of martial arts film style should enjoy it. The scenery is lush and intense with vivid color changes and various terrains, pure candy to the eye. The elaborate set up of the two afore mentioned make for stunning effects as each of the stories unfold throughout the film.I enjoyed this movie best with the original mandarin tracks with English for the hearing impaired subtitles, for some reason the English dubbing was just too busy for me, and you don't want to miss any details.Overall, a true gem to watch.

A masterpiece of style and substance,"The most stylish film I've seen all year (alright, let's include last year as well). I first heard about this movie in 2004. My classmates were raving about it. Yet when I checked IMDb I found out it was released in 2002! I had no idea New Zealand was so far behind. Sadly, I missed the run it had in the cinema (I have a 61"" TV but it still can't beat the BIG screen). A couple of days ago my brother rented some 8-day DVD's. HERO was one of them. I'm so-o totally impressed with the action, the color, the story, the music and the cinematography. The whole package! Yes, even the acting and the costumes. I've watched it twice so far and I've still got a week to see it again (and again, and again....). There's a powerful, wonderfully compelling story that builds tension as the scenes progress. The fight sequences are dazzling and poetic with beautiful scenery and terrific sets. The colors used in the various scenes add mood and drama to an already sumptuous visual feast. The music, especially those drums, make me yearn for a Dolby 5.1 decoder. (I'll call my other brother to see if I can borrow his system for the week.) It's flawless. I liked Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - although kung-fu and wu-xia films are not my favorite genres - but HERO is something else, something special, something more than magnificent.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Worth Getting Into,"A subtitled martial arts film with a historical flavor that toys with reality - ""Hero"" may take some viewers time to get adjusted to. And yes, there's an awful lot of that gravity-defying wire-work that has recently surged onto the action scene and since become a favorite target for parody.But ""Hero"" is worth it for director Yimou Zhang's magical visuals, particularly his vivid, glorious use of color. One also must appreciate Tony Leung's excellent performance as Broken Sword. Whenever the story turns to Broken Sword, his lover Falling Snow (Maggie Cheung) and his young protégé Moon (Ziyi Zhang) the screen lights up. All three actors are wonderful.The film's ultimate message is something to inspire discussion. Is it about the beauty of sacrifice? The need for peace? Submission to the government?

A tribute to Chinese Dictators,"As a Chinese, I can not believe the movie got a rate this high in U.S. And I don't think you guys get it. It's not fantasy, the Emperor in it is the first guy to conquer the whole land of China, to do that, his army left a lot of bloodshed. A couple of times,they buried hundreds of thousands people alive.That's why there are so many killers aiming him, they want revenge. But in the movie, this chinese Hitler became the good guy, his side is the good, the killers are all wrong. So according to me and a lot of chinese moviegoers, Hero is a tribute to the chinese dictators behind the Tian-An-Men massacre.Its main idea is that it's everyone's duty to sacrifice himself for the emperor a.k.a the dictator.

The acting is superb with pure emotion colliding onto the screen, nothing in this movie overpowers it or understates it. The action scenes are very tasty morsels. I've never seen martial art moves like the ones in this movie. They are meticulously thought out and so well choreographed. Like I said before, everything just flows so well in this movie.

Quite possibly the most beautiful film you have or will ever see,"When I first heard about Hero, I thought to myself that someone had come along and decided to cash in on the success of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. When I saw that Jet Li was in it, my expectations dropped even further. Nevertheless, out of pure boredom or desire to be entertained if nothing else, I decided to watch Hero.By the end of the film, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was no longer in my mind. Mouth agape and heart-aching, I couldn't remember when I'd last seen a film so beautiful, so powerful and so brilliantly made. I also made a mental note to begin considering Jet Li as an actor.Hero is set in an ancient China over two thousand years ago. At that time, China was split into seven smaller countries. The king of Qin (the largest of these countries), waged many wars against the other countries. As can be expected, this made him rather unpopular with the other six nations. From this, assassins arose whose entire purpose in life is to rid the world of this man. Three of deadliest of these assassins are Broken Sword (Tony Leung), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Sky (Donnie Yen). So, when a Nameless warrior (Jet Li) is brought to the king's palace, claiming to have killed all three, he is hailed as a hero.The film proceeds to reveal Nameless' story. But soon, it is revealed that all is not what it seems and there is more to Nameless than it at first glance. And, by the end of the film, he is hailed as a hero for a completely different reason.Yes, it is a martial arts film, but one that is made by Zhang Yimou. This means that there is a solid story. Nonetheless, the fight sequences are breathtaking and beautiful to witness. However, the action can seem superfluous and tedious, and is the reason for why it takes the film so long to reveal the main body of the plot.The story is carried by a strong cast, who bring some very good characters to life. Chen Daoming, who plays the king, in my opinion, gives the best performance. But it is one that is rivalled by that of Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, whose chemistry together really makes their heartbreaking story so much more real. Though completely overshadowed by the aforementioned talent, Jet Li proves that he is more than just an action star. And Zhang Ziyi shows once again why she is a rising star.Undoubtedly, the most striking thing about this film is the cinematography and art direction. The lavishly filmed scenes at gorgeous locations are just one of the many visual treats in store for the viewer. The superb use of colour begs an explanation, but whether there are some deeper reasons behind their use or whether it was just what took Zhang Yimou's fancy is irrelevant to how provocative it is. To top it off, the king's palace is a lovingly created set and one to rival any of any film ever made and this is epitomised in the scene where Jet Li descends a flight of steps surrounded by a circle of soldiers.The outstanding visuals are backed by some brilliant musical scores composed by Tan Dun (who also did Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). It was a strong tool that Zhang Yimou used very well. It supported, but never moved to the forefront, of the visual drama.Unfortunately, being in Chinese, not much can be said about the script. However, being Chinese (grew up in England), I was able to understand parts of it and what I did seemed impeccable. But I am disappointed at how the script was completely butchered by the translation on the DVD.Even though it is not perfect, Hero is a film filled with passion and drama, culminating in a message as powerful and glaringly obvious as the myriad of colours used. And whilst comparisons are unavoidable, it is not Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. It doesn't stand with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. It stands just as how a Hero should.

"Absolutely Gorgeous, MUST SEE movie, a true work of video art","I'm not going to mince words here. ""Hero"" is a great movie.

`Hero' fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters,"It is impossible to avoid comparing Zhang Yimou's `Hero' to Ang Lee's `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'  They were both big-budget Chinese kung-fu films with breathtaking cinematography of Chinese landscape and a cast of super-stars. But aside from the obvious, there is in fact nothing else to compare. `Hero' fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters, proving that big-name stars, beautiful scenery, and action effects are no replacement for a director's artistry and vision.All the marketing hype preceding the premier of `Hero' has done nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one.  Much anticipated, `Hero' drew movie-goers in throngs when it first opened at theaters in mainland China and Hong Kong, making it an instant box-office success. However, though the script pleased government censors, Chinese audiences went to newfound heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain. On-line critics, both professional and amateur, proclaimed the film `ideologically disturbing,' `from the viewpoint of deep servitude,' written `either by an amateur historian, or someone with ulterior motives.' One article was simply titled, `Hero, you make me sick!'The deepest failing of the film is in its plot, which is not only morally reprehensible, and based on unforgivable historic fallacy but - worst of all for a film - is boring! All blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberties with the facts of history, but `Hero' goes beyond artistic license into unforgivable ignorance when it attempts to glorify an emperor that was as brutal as Stalin or Hitler. `Hero' does not make up for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or fun.  Instead, it is makes a woefully poor attempt at being `deep' and merely manages to be pretentious and preachy.Though historians agree that the First Emperor of China was ruthlessly violent, Mao Zedong was known to have admired this ruler - no surprise, given Mao's own tyrannical rule.  Likewise, the Communist government in Beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the First Emperor and its own iron-fist methods, so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by Zhang Yimou. Tony Leung, one of the stars of `Hero' remarked during an interview to promote the film that the Beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by crushing the student demonstrations, because it was needed to maintain `stability' in China.  For these remarks, Tony Leung received shocked criticisms in his home city of Hong Kong, but he merely stated out loud the underlying message of the movie.Director Zhang Yimou has stated that his goal was to surpass the values of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung-fu novels and movies, to reveal a higher wisdom. Unfortunately, his version of `wisdom' turns out to be: THE OPPRESSOR IS RIGHT. In China, where thousands of years of historical reality have rammed this message through, art was the last sanctuary where the individual could actually find freedom from such tyranny. The great popularity of the kung-fu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape into an alternate world: one where kung-fu warriors roamed the country seeking adventure and fighting for justice, free from fear and winning against all odds with their super-human skills. Only in the novel did the individual ever win over institutionalized power in China, and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions. Going against this tradition of the kung-fu hero, Zhang Yimou has not gone upwards towards a higher truth, as he had hoped, but downwards, to the level of government propaganda.  It's no wonder the government was so pleased.Some film lovers may secretly wonder, `All moralistic judgments aside, is it at least entertaining?'  Fortunately, the answer is a resounding `No!' Because the same tale is told over and over with only slight variations, it becomes tedious to watch. Moreover, the three conflicting versions of the same story serves only to confuse the character development, since it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them once the `real' version emerges.The film is not without its beautiful images. However, all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect to or enhance the storyline. The use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the tale comes across as simplistic and contrived, and the cinematography appears self-consciously rather than truly beautiful. Great for a trailer, but a disappointment once you are there to watch the entire film.For those in China who showed disdain for `Crouching Tiger's' unrealistic kung-fu, much was expected from `Hero.' Jet Li, who plays the title role, is a real kung-fu artist who held national titles before beginning his career as an actor.  His previous movies have revealed limited acting abilities, but many hoped that Zhang Yimou could use Li's lithe body movements to full effect while casting him properly in a role that would not task his acting abilities.  But it was not to be. `Hero' attempts to go beyond the kung-fu genre, so there are not many fighting scenes, and Jet Li is expected to perform a difficult piece of acting: an inner transformation leading to profound wisdom and self-sacrifice. As the casting director ought to have expected, Li fails miserably. Meanwhile, the only fighting scene that reveals any true kung-fu skill is the first one of the film, between Li and and Donnie Yen.  All the scenes that follow are a disappointment, so `Hero' fails to satisfy, even on that level.Though most audiences outside China are unlikely to be aware of the historical mangling of the story of the cruel First Emperor, it seems even more unlikely that they would accept Zhang's version of `Chinese wisdom,' which is anything but. Perhaps the only time an audience coming out of a screening of `Hero' was seen smiling - instead of yawning or frowning - was at the special screening for Chinese government officials.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Beyond your imagination...,"How to describe ""Hero""? Well, it doesn't suffice to call it an action movie; it's a lot more psychological than that. It tells of how a warrior known only as Nameless (Jet Li) defeated some assassins who sought to kill the emperor. Like many Chinese or Hong Kong movies today, it employs some scenes that previously would have only been suited to fantasy movies. But they do an impressive job with such imagery here. Maybe ""Hero"" could qualify as a fantasy, but it uses so many different methods of story-telling, that you almost can't narrow the movie down to one classification. Zhang Yimou, who continued his fascinating streak with ""The House of Flying Daggers"", made a masterpiece here. You have to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
great on so many different levels,"Flat out one of the best movies that I have ever seen. You may need to see it at least twice in order to fully understand the plot. Americans should also keep in mind that this is a Chinese movie, not an American movie about China. Therefore, the acting and dialogue might appear stilted and overly formal to American viewers. Chinese historical dramas are made in this style, it's a cultural thing.The reason why this is a truly great movie is because it is great on many different levels. The cinematography alone is stupendous. There are story lines involving suspense and romance. The movie is driven not just by action, but by character development. In addition, there are kick-ass martial arts scenes. However, this movie goes beyond the typical martial arts movie because martial arts is presented as a philosophy, not a just as a really cool method of fighting. Many people do not understand that Asian martial arts is a culture, religion and way of thinking unto itself. The ultimate goal of a martial arts master is self-control,inner peace and non-violence. This is achieved by becoming so proficient and so well-known that no one ever wants to fight with you. This concept is crucial to the viewer's understanding of why the romance ultimately fails between the two lovers.The other aspect of this movie elevates it above so many others is the theme of national unity versus individual agendas, of collective nonviolence and peace and the giving up of the individual right to revenge, no matter how honorable. This movie came out during GW Bush's administration(s), when the United States was divided over the Middle East, 9/11 and Iraq. Not only is this movie well-made on many different levels, it achieves a cultural and timeless relevance. At the end of the movie, the assassin (Nameless) finally ""gets it"" and realizes that his motives to kill the Emperor pale in significance to the Emperor's attempts to achieve peace by unifying China. That is why he gives up his assassination attempt and why he becomes (one of) the hero(es), the other being the Emperor himself. In America, there are those who believe that the best way to end violence is through revenge. Others believe that giving up one's right to revenge (not self-defense) and working for peace through a higher authority (e.g. the collective authority of many nations) is the more successful way. No matter what side you're on, this movie addresses these timeless issues.Amendment: I should acknowledge that I wrote all of the above before reading some of the other reviews on this site. As an American, I did not realize that the character of the Emperor was based on an actual historical figure, nor did I know anything of the brutality of his reign. At the same time, as an American, not for one instant did I think about any parallels to the Communist party in China, nationalist propaganda or dictators such as Hitler or Stalin. Call me ignorant, but I took the movie at face value, which I saw as a fictional story about the philosophy of martial arts, non-violence and peace.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Fabulous,"I see that many others of you have commented on this amazing film. However having just seen it for a second time (on this occasion on DVD) I felt impelled to write. This is probably the most beautiful, elegiac, balletic film of epic proportions that you are ever likely to see up to present date (i.e. 28/3/2006). There is nothing to criticise. The acting by Jet Li, Tony Leung, Donnie Yen and Maggie Cheung as the hero/assassins is faultless and gripping. The direction exquisite and deliberately mannered which fits the style of the story impeccably. The photography is simply unbelievable, as are the sets and the costumes. The sound track, whether the sound effects such as falling rain drops or the music itself (composed by Tan Dun and played by Itzak Perlman)is heart-stopping in its loveliness and appropriateness. The editing is flawless. The choreography spectacular. What else can I say other than the story itself is deeply thought-provoking and heart-rending.

Not wild about it,"I came to this movie expecting that I'd really be into it. I guess all I can say is that the colors were interesting but not enough to sustain an entire movie. I guess part of it was that the false-flashback perspective the movie took made it impossible to get inside the characters' heads, which made it impossible to identify with them and thus, care.The fight scenes really didn't do it for me, either. It seemed that in every fight, one of the characters simply strikes a pose and floats around motionless like a statue under telekinesis. I enjoyed ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""'s use of the wire-suspension technology, but it seemed to have a fluidity and sincerity that this film lacked. Honestly, I would have preferred that the filmmakers drop the wires and simply let us watch a Jet Li bouncing up and around and obeying the normal laws of physics in a creative way.Not to disparage the many people who did like the film--people take Internet criticism too personally sometimes. Just my humble two cents.",,Anonymous,History
Beautifully acted and photographed but not much more than spectacle,"Given the early success of this film around the world and its belated large-scale release in the USA, plus the earlier artistic and financial popularity of Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" and Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger"", it's probably safe to say now that the conflation of art-film and martial arts is a genre that is not going away.I'm glad; the martial arts film is every bit as important to the pop film culture of Asia as the western is in the United States, and there isn't any reason to believe that the potential quality of the ""chop-socky"" couldn't reach the heights that Ford, Hawks, Mann, Eastwood, and Leone among others hit with that quintessentially American (and later, Italian) genre. ""Hero"" as much as ""Kill Bill"" wears its influences obviously, though perhaps in a less overt and flashy see-what-I'm-doing manner. The story of ""Nameless"" (read: Clint Eastwood's characters in Leone films) as he bests the finest of assassins is retold several times in several ways, leaving us to ponder Rashomon-like the real truth. The feats of individual skill and heroism are reminiscent of and even more impossible than those in ""Crouching Tiger"" or ""The Matrix"" (itself heavily indebted to martial arts films), though in keeping with the conservative and heavily censored Chinese film culture the violence is strictly PG-13. The film pushes its mythic single-hero capable of defeating armies conceit to the point where any tangible association with a real historical past is moot; these are Gods walking the earth.The film is awesomely beautiful with intricate color schemes changing scene by scene; the camera-work typically crisp, clean and painterly as in Zhang's previous films; and the performances are a good as you could expect from four of the greatest Chinese actors of their generations -- Eastwood-like Jet Li, emotional and vulnerable Tony Leung, fierce and proud Maggie Cheung and wild, impulsive Zhang Ziyi. I'm totally in love with Maggie who I've been following since ""Irma Vep"" and ""Comrades, a Love Story""; hard to believe she turned 40 on the day I originally wrote this piece.And yet, the great parts don't quite add up to a masterful whole. It's incredibly beautiful, stunningly acted and fought, and fairly tightly plotted, but there just isn't a lot to grab onto; the characters don't transcend their archetypes, and the end seems predetermined. Perhaps this would appeal most to the hard-core aficionados; I liked it quite a bit, and I'm glad that Zhang (once beloved in art-house circles for ""Raise the Red Lantern"", ""Ju Dou"" and ""To Live"") has a hit and that the foreign-language film seems to have some hold in America yet, but it just didn't leave me with much. Worth a look for sure, but it doesn't improve on its forefathers.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Stunning, beautiful cinematography from Yimou!","I wanted to watch this purely because I enjoyed House Of Flying Daggers so much however I was slightly disappointed but not quite. Really Hero is an odd film to review. At times you're left wowed by typical Yimou cinematography then you're left confused by the plot. Nonetheless I did enjoy the stunning fight sequences and use of colour throughout and the chemistry between Maggie Cheung's character and Tony leung's; which is understandable considering they have worked together on numerous occasions.I've never actually seen a film with Jet Li in oddly. Usually because he just lacks that little something I like to see in actors and at times, what he acts in. He did act farely well but it wasn't particularly great considering he was in a Yimou film. I did get confused by his character, amongst other things. I couldn't quite make out what he purpose was as a character and why he is doing what he is doing. The characters of Maggie Cheng, Zhang Zi and Tony Leung were also confusing, again i just couldn't figure out what their purpose was and, again what the hell they are doing. I suppose my review is looking at little confusing while you are reading this, but you will see what I mean when you watch this.Overall a more stylistic piece of film rather than substance but it is worth watching if you're a Yimou fan for instance and to see why on earth Tarantino marketed the film himself rather than Yimou!",7.0,Anonymous,History

Colorful Propaganda,"The message of Hero is quite clear: the idea of Greater China is more important than the death and the suffering of millions. At a time when China is dangling its war toys over Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to endorse this piece of over-produced, government-sponsored, dogmatic trash.Particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. Roger Ebert of Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein of Slate, Charles Taylor of Salon, and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed Hero. In so doing, they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message. The only critic (that I know of) who saw through the film's glossy facade was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice, who wrote of the film's ""sanctimonious traditionalism"" and its ""glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness."" I, for one, sign my name under Hoberman's final pronouncement: Hero is nothing more than ""fascinating fascism.""",1.0,Anonymous,History
visual poetry,"As a martial artist I am very picky about a lot of things when I go to watch action films. As a movie enthusiast I'm not really looking for much more than good, thoughtful, solid, entertainment. ""Hero"" is the only movie I can say deserves MORE than a perfect 10. It's not that this movie is good, or is artistic, or stars 2 of my favorite martial artists (Donnie Yen and Jet Li), or is big budget (by HK standards). It's just that this movie BLEW ME AWAY.So people complain that the martial arts in it is unrealistic. So what? Martial arts is my life, but I don't expect every action movie I see to be realistic. If that were the case, then car chases in films where the cars flip over and crash and immediately explode would not exist. No action film would be innocent of staying completely realistic then. Plus, this story is about a myth, a legend. You expect everything to be real? People say most fights in real life end up on the ground anyway, and if Jet Li and Donnie Yen fought and ended up on the ground, it'd take away from the artistic aesthetic of the film.Both my parents are half Chinese, my dad speaks Mandarin and Cantonese fluently and my mom speaks Mandarin. They loved this film Even though the Emperor was portrayed in a way that undermined the Chinese view of him, it still doesn't take away from the film. As far as I know, Hero is not a documentary. It's a movie, and the actors portraying the characters do a great job to further the plot. Even if these characters really did exist, historical accuracy was not the point. If it was, why was everything from the sets to the swordplay to the music so poetic? Why was the focus on the characters and their relationships and on the aesthetics and not on this dynasty that existed? Hero is visual poetry, and poems have no use in life other than to please/entice/stimulate/provoke the emotional center of the human spirit. And Hero did just that.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Totally sweet. . .,"The movie is simply a work of art. Better than Crouching Tiger in my honest opinion.The acting rocked.The visuals rocked.The story rocked.The fight scenes rocked.The arrows were. . oh, mmm. . I won't say anything about that. . but keep in mind the word ""arrows."" You'll know what I'm talking about when you see the movie. I love that part, hah hah hah!Oh, and the twist in the movie is totally badass. Of course, the American trailers screw it up and give it away to the astute viewer. Listen, people, ignore the previews and trailers for the movie unless it's, like, a Chinese version. The ones you see in the American theaters just don't present it right (unless, for some reason, they changed the dialogue in the movie).And finally. .God, I have a theory about Jet Li. He rocks in Chinese films but as soon as they put him in an American one, the movie sucks. We should learn from that, you know?

Not What You'd Expect,"If I were forced to use one word to describe this movie, that word would have to be beautiful. Beautiful locations, beautiful swordplay, even the plot, as straightforward as it appears, is beautiful in its twists, subtleties, and poignant ending. This movie has some of the most powerful imagery of any I have ever seen. Though some may not like the high-flying wire martial arts (a la Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), no one can deny the grace of the combat. Though the movie was released under Quentin Tarantino's name, and is often compared to his Kill Bill series, the resemblance is only passing. Where Kill Bill revels in violence and excessive gore, Hero focuses on the thought and philosophy of combat, and blood is seen infrequently. Instead of relying on pools of viscera to affect the audience, Hero uses clever and artistic camera angles. Though the swordplay makes up a large portion of the film, at the end of the day Hero is a tale of emotions, motives and philosophy, sacrificing oneself for the greater good. The films most noticeable blemish is the pacing, some scenes are just too long, but this is a minor complaint. Based in history, and steeped in the Chinese mythos, Hero's real battle takes place in the minds of its viewers, challenging perceptions about what a martial arts film can be.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Defines the true meaning of art in film...,"I never even saw this movie in theatres, and my sister wanted to see this when it was available for rent and I still didn't really want to see it. I thought it was going to be a pointless film showing off the vast array of wild moves that martial artists are capable of. Yet, when we rented it, I sat down and saw it. I was truly in awe when I did, it's one of the two movies that have actually gotten that reaction from me. Yes, the theme is complicated, and the movie itself is hard to follow (if you don't pay close attention)-the only inferring factor I've found is that people seem to focus too hard on the subtitles, or from what I know of. But, in all honesty, I appreciate art in true form; this is a piece of it that I highly appreciate for many reasons, the reasons being that this has an elegant storyline (depicting the birth of a nation: China), with each story being beautifully told with a predominant colour to emphasize the mood), the astonishing fight scenes (the movie, surprisingly, was not built upon one fight scene after another... which made them even more enjoyable to watch), the fluent dialogue (though all of it was subtitled-thank God, I hate dubbing in film-if you paid well enough attention to it without being distracted from the overall beauty of the movie, you'd understand that it was worded and translated masterfully), the scenery used, and the brilliant cinematography, which goes hand in hand with what I said about the colours. There's not much else I can say without spoiling at least something about the movie... but I recommend this for anyone who appreciates a brilliant piece of art shown through film, as well as follow along with a movie that has a rather sporadic way of storytelling and subtitles... whole-heartedly. 10/10 - This definitely is my favourite movie of all time!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Little short of a masterpiece,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was marvelous and I loved it, but ""Hero"" is even better and I feel it is little short of a masterpiece. What makes it so is the brilliant combination of superlatives: fine acting and sharp dialogue; exciting fighting sequences and stunning scenery; evocative sound and music; and a breathtaking use of colour and composition. This is quite simply a triumph for Chinese director Zhang Yimou - and the budget was a mere $2 million.The setting is the Qin kingdom in the 3rd century BC when modern-day China consisted of seven warring kingdoms. An astonishingly proficient warrior known only as Nameless (Jet Li) is brought to meet the Qin emperor (Daoming Chen) on the basis that he has managed to kill the emperor's three most formidable enemies: Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung) and Flying Snow (Maggie Chueng). The story unfolds in a formal structure involving a series of flashbacks, as Nameless explains to the emperor how he dispatched each foe, but we see the same conflicts in different versions as a result of successive plot twists. As each segment of the tale is told, Nameless moves closer to the solitary emperor - to what end, we can only speculate.The movie looks sumptuous with magnificent natural settings (including Inner Mongolia) and balletic fight scenes in the rain and the trees, among banners and leaves, and even on water, while the different flashbacks are distinguished by the predominant colour of the scene and the characters' costumes: red (passion), blue (love), green (youth), white (truth), and finally black (death). The sound - whether horses thundering across the countryside, massed soldiers marching into position, swords clashing angrily or arrows winging impossible distances - is terrific, while the original music from Du Tan (who scored ""Crouching Tiger ..""), with Kodo drummers from Japan, is wonderfully atmospheric. The cast is huge, but the speaking - using classical Chinese grammar but pronunciation in the Mandarin dialect - is confined to less than 10 characters. Besides the actors already named, we have the young and beautiful Zhang Ziyi - another link with ""Crouching Tiger.."" - as the servant girl Moon.My only reservation about the movie is political rather than artistic: the use of tyranny is defended on the grounds of nationalism. That apart, I cannot fault this utterly sensational work which for me is up there with such classics as ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" and ""Gladiator"".",,Anonymous,History
Possibly the Year's Best Movie,"About halfway through the film, as Broken Sword considers the betrayal he just experienced, I was engulfed by the feeling of ""this is why you go to a movie.""""Hero"" is beautiful, heartbreaking, thrilling and thoughtful. The screen is constantly full of breath-taking images and perfectly balanced throughout. If you're going to watch a full-screen version of this, don't waste your time. The composition of each shot is so perfect that any hack job will only make you wonder what everyone is so hyped up about.And the story--wow! I expected a straight-forward action movie, but ""Hero"" has more twists than all of M. Night Shyamalan's films combined. Is Jet Li's nameless character a hero, or does he have a secret agenda? Is the emperor a caring leader or a maniacal dictator? Just when you think you know the answer, another twist unfolds.Some may dismiss this movie with words like ""propaganda,"" but don't be fooled. No character in this movie makes a choice lightly. The cost of every decision is weighed heavily, and Nameless recognizes that his ultimate decision will lead to less than perfect results. Still, the ideal is there, and it is an ideal that transcends time and culture. The ultimate moral of the story is hardly a call to arms but a reminder that war doesn't lead to peace; peace comes from a vision in which war has no part. That's not propaganda. That's a message of hope in an imperfect world.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Pretty, Just Not Beautiful","Numerous films have been made surrounding the 'King of Qin' period in Chinese history. Take a look at 'The Emperor's Shadow' for the best plot or 'The Emperor and the Assassin' if you desire the full-scale Elizabethan drama angle. This latest take is really little more than flashy CGI, wire fighting and pretty prettiness.Scenes are little more than staging for the scene after it. Slow-motion shots and perfectly-formed tears take the place of emotion. Characters are magically whisked away to the exotic locales in the blink of an eye which robs the film of the scope attained in depicting great journeys. Hair blows in the wind. Gowns blow in the wind. Candelight blows in the wind. Wire sword fight after wire sword fight after wire sword fight. The only interesting part of the plot is the choice to film both sides of the story and even that was lifted from Rashomon.As a piece of visual sequencing, I give it high marks. Sadly, as this is one of maybe two epic Chinese films to ever receive wide American distribution, it will be thought of by many as more than it is. Exotic = better. Look at the pretty fights. Many, many other Chinese films eclipse it in both substance and fortitude -- and not just because they're more obscure.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Decent story, great cinematography, ridiculous fight scenes","Ancient China and the Qin Empire is out to conquer the six kingdoms. This makes its king a target for assassination.

Treated as a hero, he is summoned for an audience with the king.Interesting story, set against historic events. Some nice twists and sub-plots along the way. Superb cinematography, especially the use of vivid colours. This is the highlight of the movie, as the colours and artful use of them is certainly the most memorable thing about the movie.However, most of this is offset by the action scenes. The fight scenes consist mainly of the ridiculous unrealistic, well-choreographed-but-stupid type.

Stunning,"I saw this movie last night when it first opened up in Canada, and I must say that throughout the duration of this film I was mesmerized. The use of colour to show different perspectives (although not an original idea) is used to perfection as it gives the scene more depth and meaning. I walked into the theatre knowing that the cinematography was supposed to be good, so I had high expectations. By the end of the film, i was practically speechless. And this is just the cinematography. The martial arts (although perceived as somewhat slow) is amazing. All of the actors fight almost flawlessly, with such grace and poise. It is amazing as to how each fight scene was made, as it goes to incredibly fast at times (at least in my opinion). Now I am a huge Tarantino fan (but in no way will I compare the 2 directors) and I can see where he has adopted a lot of his visual styles from.A forewarning to anyone going to see the movie: There are subtitles, so if you do not like reading what everyone is saying, this may be a little tough to watch.Lastly, I will comment on the storyline. The story starts out fairly simple. But it gradually gets harder to grasp. Now I believe that I understood what they were trying to say (although I could be wrong) but I will admit that it can be a little hard to understand. But then again, anyone in doubt can just read the many topics on the forums.Overall I would have to give Ying xiong (Hero) a 9.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Hero definitely did this for me. I was so into this movie that I hadn't realized how much time had passed. Most movies I believe spend most of their funds getting a Star in their movie, then it goes to the special effects and the story suffers from it. Hero presents a story within stories that doesn't leave you hanging. Magnificent story of warriors dedicated to their mission and would do anything to achieve it. The visual's were excellent, the use of bold colors in the story made it easy to connect it with the whole plot. The acting was great and the fighting scenes weren't bad at all.

Still, what comes to this movie as an experience, for me it doesn't matter really why somebody has made movie like that, as it isn't literally a political movie, direct propaganda, or something alike, as I see it.Maybe it is because I have luxury to be distanced enough from Chinese situation, and politics.

Visually Beautiful but...,"I certainly disagree with the message. I understand that this is a telling of how China came to be by ""uniting"" the different kingdoms but it, possibly inadvertently, sends the message that war and conquer are good. The king is a ruthless man who will do anything to achieve his goals of bringing the different kingdoms together. This includes the killing of many individuals. Sometimes war is necessary. To protect. But never to conquer. We should all be united, but not in the way this film presents. We can live separately yet together in peace. The different kingdoms could have thrived separately but this king was willing to kill so that they would all be forced under one rule. Not because the others were dealing with injustice or the like but because that's just how he wanted it. So while the film is obviously stunning visually - the choreography, the use of color, lighting, etc. it all ultimately fails in its portrayal as the message is not one that deserves to be uplifted. It's a great film for its endeavors but ultimately shameful in what it's trying to tell us. Allowing the king to succeed may have stopped the killing but he started it to begin with and this choice undoes the entire sacrifice of nameless and the two lovers and their pain.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Magnificent Cinematographyat its best... Storyline at its VERY worst.,"Well I'll be definitely bucking the popular trend for this film. For me on the whole I was VERY disappointed. The storyline(s) is extremely disjointed and confusing. It had a nice overall message of integrity, but to be honest I was so frustrated with the disjointedness of the movie it over-rode any fondness I had for it. The simple concept of the movie was dragged on and on to the point it lost its cohesiveness.Yes there is one saving grace; the cinematography is so outstanding, I have to think very hard to find another movie to rival it. The location is magnificent and the use of colour is magic. However the use of the colour tended to exaggerate the obvious disjointedness of the story(s).Jet Li was terrible. He seemed to never put any real effort into his role. He was like a stone most of the time from his introduction to... well the end.The shifts of stories was so bad I wouldn't even rate it a 1.

a great dramatic film,"most of the reviews of this film referring to its politics, that i've read so far, have failed to see it in what once was called 'a world-historical perspective'. first, it should be pointed out that all films by Chinese - including those made in hong Kong, Taiwan, and even in the west - avoid direct presentation of domestic political issues. i don't know why, and it's too broad a topic to discuss here. but i mention it because when a Chinese film reflects Chinese politics in a strong way, even if indirectly, we should definitely pay attention and give it a chance.secondly, i remind the reader that during the 20th century c.e., the Chinese suffered through two major revolutions, two civil wars, and two world wars, not to mention the chaos of the gang of four's 'cultural revolution' and the disaster in tianaman square.throughout this period the Chinese experimented with a different governmental and economic structure with each of these bloody affairs, tampering with democracy, fascism, socialism, Marxist-socialism, Stalinist-Marxist socialism, 'back-to-the-farm' cadre organizations similar to the kibbutzim of Israel, and western style capitalism. no other highly populated nation in the world has suffered through so many violent changes in so short a time - ever.'hero' is a film about forgiveness. the Chinese will never progress if they simply dismiss the revolution of '49 as a big mistake; nor can they continue to follow Maoist state-socialism. if they make tianamen square a critical political issue, they could end up back in civil war; but no one in china is likely to forget it.so what else can they do, but to admit that everyone was wrong, and everyone was right. few Chinese participated in these violent crises in order to turn a profit - i.e., the instigators of all these violent moments hoped to produce good - and usually did, if only in a small way. if the Chinese can forgive each other of their own past, they will certainly produce the world's next super-power - and they know it. and that's what this film is about.the cinematography is beautiful; the editing may seem a little leisurely, but i found it graceful. the acting is highly impressive, and the actors have a fine script with sparse dialog to work with. the story is moving and elegiac, but never 'sad'. it is, after all, a movie about hope.as for jet Li fans - well, this is not a 'jet Li action movie'. this is just a great dramatic film that happens to star jet Li - and does a great job with it.see this without preconceptions; and i am not saying forget the politics - i'm saying, think about it.that's what a great dramatic film is supposed to do - get us to think about it.",10.0,Anonymous,History

All too often I forget how much this film means to me. If ""favorite movie"" means ""most signifigant"" then Hero is my favorite movie. I cannot remember a movie that has made me sob every time I watch it. Understand that I'm a guy, and given as most guys to limited range of emotional expression. This film is perhaps the greatest film *ever* made. It's beauty, intelligence, storytelling, soul, craft, dialogue, acting, directing, writing... it is all exceptionally without flaw. If I ever make a film this great I will count myself as blessed beyond my greatest hopes. Unlike some movies which bring tears because of the spirit and intentions of the film - but which are flawed in other respects (Gladiator, Braveheart, etc) this film is one that brings torrents of tears and each one of them is more precious than platinum.

"Beautiful, moving, historical fairy tale","This was known as ""Hero"" in US distribution.The famous Chinese book on its history, ""Three Kingdoms,"" begins with words something like this -- ""It was ever thus -- China long divided must unite; long united, must divide.""This movie captures one phase of the efforts of one king, the Emperor of Qin, to unify a land of six warring kingdoms.A notice at the end of the movie says that the events of history were treated ""compositionally"" meaning, I suppose, that several emperors who were instrumental in unifying China and the events of those eras were distilled into one.The movie has a striking beauty and often a ballet-like motion all its own; some scenes are reminiscent of those in ""Crouching Tiger..."" in which a wire and flying seemed to take place. But many others are quite original, such as those seemingly shot from under the surface of a lake while the swordsman run and duel across its surface. There are many striking scenes -- the machines of war unleashing arrows; or horsemen riding with their lances and banners; or scenes inside the palace, the palace grounds, and soldiers in formation there.""Hero"" unfolds a story from several points of view, somewhat as ""Rashomon"" did. But ""Rashomon"" did that to raise the profound question of what is the nature of reality -- is there a single one or really multiple realities, each one dependent on who experiences it?The alternative realities in ""Hero"" are not used for that effect or question, but as different hypothetical story versions, one set told by a swordsman who wants to kill the emperor and uses his versions to get closer to his quarry; the other versions are by the canny emperor who proposes the same events can be cast in a different way.But ""Hero"" does raise some important questions -- when one leader wants to transform a country and end recurring warfare, is it justifiable to kill many innocents to accomplish that end? Does that accomplish the greater good? And when one's native land and one's people are endangered or killed by that emperor's actions, how justified is it to oppose him and his goal? And who suffers most from revenge? -- the target or the person harboring it? Are words and ideas ultimately far more powerful (and preferable) than using deadly instruments (the pen vs. the sword)?Those questions have been faced in ancient times. They also can be quite pertinent today.",,Anonymous,History
Epitome of Internationally known Wuxia,"A beautiful masterstroke from director Zhang Yimou, Hero is a beautifully constructed wuxia film that is infused with history, Chinese culture, honor, and themes of overcoming hate and the pain that can be caused from not conquering that hate. Through this film, Zhang Yimou not only creates a terrifically entertaining martial arts action film, but he also creates a film that is a moving and stirring look at the unification of China and the sacrifices that went into that monumental step.While the movie does take some liberties with historical retelling, what top box office film doesn't? Without fail, the movie plucks at the heart-strings of its viewers and masterfully captures the human aspect of War and how it affects the minds of the ruled.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Stunning cinematography, technical 'tour de force', dubious historical accuracy make for a disappointing movie","Hero is a film that has to be seen, if only to make the inevitable Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon comparisons. Much-awaited wuxia, Hero is a visually-stunning mixture of art film, martial arts action, and dubious historical accuracy. Even though the oversimplified politics could raise the eyebrows of the initiated, the photography of the film only is a delight for the eye and a reason to see the movie. Looking at the film I understand better where the focus went. The scenario took 2 years of writing and yet the film fails at this level. Zhang Yimou wanted to redefine the definition of Hero and did that through an oversimplified political plot, the results from a story telling stand point is catastrophic as no emotions whatsoever arise from the characters. Their depiction is reduced to almost dull snapshots. Even the Rashomon-like storytelling does not work that well as technique can never replace substance. However the glorious cinematography of Christopher Doyle who uses specific color tones to highlight different versions of the events is a tremendous achievement. Red designates a more passionate accounting, while blue highlights a version colored by personal loss and sadness. Green, white and yellow come into play too, though to assign meanings and motifs to each and every color scheme. If anything, the different colors work as an effective narrative device that separates the various versions of the tale. In fact technique is what Hero is all about and in that matter, the film is a masterpiece. The costumes, production design, cinematography and martial arts choreography are all award-worthy. To note most martial arts fans will be delighted with the work of choreographers Ching Siu-Tung and Stephen Tung Wai. We've isolated the facts that Hero is a technical masterpiece with a catastrophic story telling dynamic but what about the message? First of all the fact that the story is based on history causes a few problems. The film posits that Ying Zheng's quest to conquer China is as much about protection as it is about tyranny, a version of events that not all historians may find agreeable. Is it proper to simplify the forces of history into a palm-sized package? More troubling are the modern political implications of the film's message. There is an obvious nod towards the importance of the greater good: ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one."" That's a fine message still, if one were to apply that thinking to modern times, some people (like the Taiwanese) might not be so swayed. I rarely saw cinematography that beautiful, however cinema is first about telling story, Zhang Yimou might have lost himself in the aesthetic realm of cinema...",6.0,Anonymous,History
Hero is a visually arresting martial arts classic.,"It's not often I say ""classic"" for this genre, there are certain milestones. Much like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon back in 2000, Hero became popular in western audiences due to its easy accessibility and minimal dialogue. This film is absolutely gorgeous. One of THE most beautiful, stunning, majestic cinematic pieces ever conceived. The use of colour is so extraordinary that me attempting to describe it won't do it justice. Whole scenes are built on colours. Costumes, production design, the environment...all based on one colour. An example would be the fight scene in the woods where all the leaves and trees are autumnal, the costumes are shades of red. Then later on in the scene, the shades of yellow and brown transition to red seamlessly and it is just so damn beautiful. If a scene takes place in a desert then everything is presented as yellow. How about in the King's palace? The interior design, armour and costumes are black. It's not even subtle, so you will notice it but it's entrancing and makes the experience ever so hypnotising. The film is about a Nameless warrior retelling his eradication of three assassins to the King, but not everything is as clear as what he says it is. It's an intriguing narrative, if I were to dive into it it would spoil the plot. But there is a point where we have a flashback within a flashback (flashbackception?) so that should give you a clue regarding the linearity of the plot. Important themes are explored such as the similarities between idealism and love, how one can kill or be willing to die for an ideal or love. Excellently acted by Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, two assassins who are embroiled in a complicated love affair. Donnie Yen and Jet Li are there to provide the amazing action. A martial arts classic is not without its action, and Hero is damn full of it. The choreography is rapidly insane...how can anyone comprehend the speed at which these guys fight is beyond me. Just...watch this. Please, it's so good.",9.0,Anonymous,History
An excellent display of visual art and storyline,"This movie is one example of movies when at it's best. The director, who also directed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has once again created a movie with spectacular visuals and a plot that gives Hollywood a bad name. Although the plot is complex at times, it's almost impossible to not to be impressed. This movie is a masterpiece all the way. The actors does a great job, Jet Li is not known for being a great actor but in this movie he stands out, and so does the whole cast. The storyline is in fact very romantic and it contains a big deal of emotion such as jealousy and hatred. So with all those features combined with each other and a soundtrack with one of the best orchestras in China, what do you get? Do not be afraid to see it just because it's in Chinese I promise you, you won't regret seeing it.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Worthless Crouching Tiger Cash In,"From the Hong Kong actors to the Tan Dun score this reeks of a Crouching Tiger cash in by director Zhang Yimou . Unfortunately, Hero is all style and painfully little substance. In fact, on the rare occasion when you get substance or ideas, they are usually so abhorrent you'd have rather they hadn't bothered.Briefly, the story centres around a nameless one - the man with no name - (Jet Li) an assassin. He has killed three enemies of the Qin Emperor who, in reward, has granted him an audience. As the two men talk, three versions of the Hero's story are told, exploring themes such as loyalty, honour and revenge. Each dominated by a prevailing colour. This all sounds very interesting. Problem is, it isn't. It's 96 minutes of exquisitely pushed out excrement. But let's concentrate on the good points for a minute.Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are excellent. OK, may be that took less than a minute.So what's wrong with this film. Well firstly there is no character development, just a few good looking Chinese folk waving swords in a mildly diverting manner (think the opening ceremony of the forthcoming Beijing Olympics). Because of this you can't really give a monkey's about any of the characters, least of all Jet, who scowls his way through the movie without ever giving you the impression that there's anything more meaningful on his mind than the sweet sound of sword on flesh.Then there is the up-its-own-bottom-pseudo-artiness of it. There is an important point here. In Crouching Tiger, when Chow Yun-Fat and Zhang Ziyi dance on top of the bamboo forest, it is beautiful, not because the colours are rich, the imagery is splendid and movement is graceful. Li Mu Bai is a character you care for, showing a nobility of spirit we would like to aspire to. Ang Lee has already engaged you in his story, you want to believe he can do it. Cue Tony Leung's spot of calligraphy while Jet Li and Maggie Cheung ward off a cloud of arrows. Graceful? Yes. Colourful? Yes. Foetid brace of severed cojones? Unfortunately so.I mean there are so many reasons to dislike this film I could go on all day. But, since the main function of this review is to spare you the effort of seeing this worthless piece of tripe, let's finish on the one idea this film pushes out in its hour-and-a-half passage through the lower colon of Chinese cinema. I'm going to give you a clue to the end of the film now, so if you're still planning to see it (poor sucker) look away now.Apparently the emperor is just a misunderstood guy. I mean, he's raped, pillaged and slaughtered his way across Asia for one reason: to unite China, to end war (presumably because anyone who didn't agree with him is dead). To this the nameless one replies 'oh yeah, I guess you're really a nice guy then', and makes to leave. Some reviewers have said that Yimou doesn't comment on this explanation or decision. If this is so why does the director choose to end his film with a cut to the Great Wall of China, with a nauseatingly jingoistic caption underneath saying 'Our Land'? So that's all right then. Hitler? Misunderstood Euro-federalist. Stalin? Cuddly people-hugger. Rape of Nanking? Chinese just didn't understand what was good for them. See what I mean by 'rather they hadn't bothered'.To compare this monstrosity to Crouching Tiger is like whizzing on a Picasso (to quote Mike Myers). Watch Springtime in a Small Town or Twilight Samurai. For goodness sake, watch anything but this. If W made a movie about early America, it would echo Hero. I can think of no greater criticism. 3/10 (if that).",1.0,Anonymous,History
An outright beauty.,"This is definitely one of 'THE' most beautiful movies in the market. Not only are the visuals and locations dripping in color, but the actors too have given excellent performances. Maggie, 'Flying Snow' delivers one of her most evocative performances in this movie. It is the beauty of her eyes, the stillness of the face that you cannot but watch the movie again and again to decipher her face. The fight sequences are more of a dance which pleases the soul and captivates the imagination of every Martial arts aficionado. What the fighters achieve is perfection of their art with perfect and precise ballet like movements to fight. There is absolutely no vulgarity of strength in the movements of these masters, but reminds one of the feel of satin on one's hands. Please watch the movie for Maggie's portrayal, or at least the fights or finally at least for Jet Li's action.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Was surprised to find that I liked it.,"I've never seen a Asian movie all the way through before. I actually went to see the incredible visual scenes and the fighting. Had no idea that I would like it as much as I did. It's an incredible visual epic story. And it's nothing like anything out of the US. The story line is not as straight forward as many other films, it takes time to tell the real story. It's a typical fight movie with more deepth and strength in the love scenes than many others of it's type.The Story goes from something like we've seen hundreds of times before. But then it turns out to have alot of twists and turns. Perhaps the story isn't the most original or best written. But what the film lacks in story, it gains in stunning Effects, action, grand visual scenes and the well made distinctive change from storyline to storyline.I loved it and plan to see it again.Like other before me Ill go to the comparison between ""Crouching..."" and ""Hero"". First of all the comparison isn't that easy, it's two very different stories. ""Crouching..."" is a more personal and less colorfull story about being true to yourself. ""Hero"" is a small part of the long history of China, it's more a stunning colorfull film about the choices Heroes make to become Heroes. My Favourite is ""Hero"", probbaly because I saw that one first. I've always liked colorfull esthetic settings, and the Fights in their minds are mindblowing. ""Crouching..."" is a slower film it takes more time, and even if some of the fight and emotionel scenes are better made, ""Hero"" is my Favourite.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A stunningly beautiful film--A perfect first movie for your new giant flat screen TV.,"I am surprised this film is not more well known considering how stunningly beautiful its cinematography is. 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' does not deserve to get more credit than this film. The landscapes are breathtaking and the scenes with autumn leaves stirring up, billowing curtains, thousands of synchronized soldiers, hair and costumes flowing and whirling are utterly amazing. The whole ""Quentin Tarantino presents..."" aspect to this film may turn some viewers away or give the wrong impression, but this movie really is a true work of art if you look at it in terms of a composition overall. How often do you have the pleasure of watching a movie and actually find yourself saying ""wow!"" or ""whoa!"" out loud?!

A truly great movie!,"I'm one of those people who tends to pooh-pooh martial arts films because of the unbelievable acrobatics that the combatants demonstrate (see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for an extreme example). So I was prepared to do the same with this film until I read a review by Roger Ebert. Roger said that the best way to accept the unbelievable was to think of this story as myth and legend. Afterall, no one expects mythology to be true to life.I gotta tell you, it worked! My suspension of disbelief during this movie allowed me to appreciate the true beauty of the film. Great scenery, fantastic sets, great acting, an emotional and involving love story, great direction and a story based on the history of China all combined to make an actually great film experience!This movie had jumped just about to the top of my list of all-time favorites.

something about the history,"So many people here have blamed the King of Qin because they believe he ordered his army to kill ""400,000 surrendered soldiers from the neighbor state Zhao after one battle, just to crush the morale of other resisting forces.""That is not true.The battle happened in 260 BC, one year before the King of Qin (259 BC-210 BC) was born in the state of Zhao. So he had nothing to do with that tragedy.Actually at that time, the 7 states battled with each other. Each state wanted to defeat the other 6 and unite the whole China. So the wars were not only between Qin and the other 6 states but also frequently among the 6 non-Qin states.In the film the killer finally gave up his plan because he realized that he could not stop the wars by simply killing the King of Qin. The only way to have a peaceful China is to let one state quickly conquer the other states.",,Anonymous,History

As good as it gets,"I have nothing bad to say about 'Hero'. It's the kind of movie that reaches a level that hordes of other movie makers only can dream about achieving. Every single scene is stunningly beautiful. Music, costumes, cinematography & acting is great & the whole experience is as close to perfection as anything human can get.The basic story is pretty simple. It's set in China around 2000 years ago & tells the legend of some incredible sword fighters who are involved in a plot to kill a warrior king. Still the story evolves in an ingenious way (reminiscent of another Asian masterpiece: Akira Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' from 1950), so we are guaranteed unpredictable development & spectacular fight scenes well beyond the standard Hollywood formula. But more than this, I conceive the film as a dazzling tribute to the amazing power of human imagination and the glorious beauty that we are able to produce through various works of art, whether it's music, calligraphy, sword fighting or movie-making. 'Hero' feels like a celebration of the depth of the human senses & everything that is colorful in this world. It's fascinating to see how director Zhang Yimou manage to merge great action & profound poetry without ever being boring or overly pretentious.

SilverRating,"Hero (Ying Xiong)- China 2002This is #3 on the list.This movie, is, is unpredictable yet also extremely predictable. And it isn't bad acting or bad directing that gives away the plot, it's just the story and how it progresses. After all, this movie is a 6/10The acting in the movie is alright, I understand that they are acting the customs of how their characters were at the time (generation) of the Qing dynasty, but it leaves the acting dead and bland. Fight scenes were magnificent, but, differing from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" Hero feels choreographed. Well besides the first fight in the rain, the rest feels like a choreographed dance. I loved it, as I tend to love these type of fight movies, but it just felt choreographed. Not silly, just you could tell that the movements were planned.The camera angle, not involving Jet Li or the Qin Emperor, but of the others, were really cheesy. Maybe it is the fact that I love Akira Kurosawa to death, this movie disappointed, because I was already given high expectation of these types of movies.SilverRating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Simply stunning.  A genuine masterpiece.,"When sitting down to watch 'Hero', the Quentin Tarrintino presented, Yimou Zhang directed martial arts epic, there are a few things you should know: First, it is in Chinese. If that's a problem for you then the second part might even more so: it is a movie heavily steeped in Chinese and oriental culture. Third, this is not in any way, shape, or form a typical kung-fu movie-it is far more philosophical and meaningful than even Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. In short, this movie puts the art back into the concept of martial arts.In 200 B.C., China was split into seven kingdoms. The ruler of the kingdom of Qin (played with gusto by Daoming Chen) sought to unify China into one nation, but attempts on his life from the neighboring kingdom of Zhao have left him paranoid and afraid that he will be unable to fulfill his dream. Zhao seeks to stop the King using its three top assassins, Long Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), and Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chui Wai), who each have attempted to kill the King in the past. In enters Nameless (Jet Li), a local prefect of Qin, born in Zhao without a name, claiming to have killed all three and seeking an audience with the King to claim his reward. Slowly, Nameless tells the tale of how he outwitted and overcame each of the assassins and through the course of the film, the story's facts change as the King questions details of the tale, exposing more and more of the truth of what did and didn't happen and twisting the plot further and further.The closest movie to compare this to would be Akira Kurosawa's 'Rashamon', which used a similar flashback technique whereby the same story is told through several different perspectives. Unlike the earlier masterpiece however, this movie only uses two storytellers, each asking questions and telling details of their own experiences with the assassins until the truth can be learned. The stories themselves are each filled to the brim with warrior philosophy, long discussions of how art and swordplay are intertwined, love triangles, metaphors, similes and all the other goodies that a deeply layered film exhibits.The photography used throughout the movie is quite simply jaw-dropping. Each flashback and version of the story is told through the use of a different color palette, some in deep green or fiery red or fine yellows, each symbolic in terms of the story and the imagery captured. There are flourishes as well, such as the pink plumes atop the Qin army's helmets or the fiercely yellow candles that sit in front of the King. Each camera angle is carefully considered and composed, lending weight to the editing and acting. This movie looks amazing. In one scene, an endless hail of arrows rains down on a school and Nameless and Flying Snow go outside to deflect arrows while Broken Sword remains inside painting a poster board of calligraphy. Somehow, amidst this black rain of wood, in a time of war and turmoil, is a man whose only concern is finishing a piece of art. This might possibly be the most beautiful film, visually, that I have ever witnessed.The pacing of the film is intentionally slow, but not overly so. It gives the film a very contemplative mood, allowing one to think about what they're seeing more than react to it. This even applies to the many fight scenes in the film. Combat occurs very quickly yet the detail and mood are such that you don't so much hang onto the edge of your seat waiting for the next sword-stroke, but think about the movement and patterns and beauty that the martial arts can be capable of. That isn't to say that the fights are not exciting, merely that they are different from what most have come to expect from a film of this nature.Those who do not like warrior angst are probably not going to get too into the story of the film, since there are long bouts of the leads discussing the nature of what they do, but I found none of it intrusive or overly long.Indeed the only fault I could find in the film is an unintentionally misleading camera shot at the end of the film. Otherwise, this film is as close to perfect as I could hope for.Do not ignore this import. This is a movie that can be seen by a dozen people who each have a dozen different things to say about it. This is a classic in every sense of the word and a landmark in the martial arts genre of movie-making, taking further the strides that Ang Lee took with 'Crouching Tiger'. Simply put, this movie should be seen by everyone regardless of whether or not you are a fan of the genre.4 Stars (out of 4).",9.0,Anonymous,History

Orb in the movie? I think so.,"Fist of all I would like to say wow! When I watched the film for the first time it was like looking at a beautiful painting for the first time. It felt like pure art and that is exactly what it is. Art. The film is about a warrior who has defeated the three most threatening assassins to his king. In return for his efforts he is awarded money, land but most of all the privilege to sit within ten paces of the king. As the warrior tells the king of how he defeated these three brilliant assassins we go back in time and get a quite stunning visual interpretation of the warriors story. However the king is not convinced of this story as he knows of these assassins and almost lost his life to one of them. What we get now is the story from how the king thinks these events unfolded and this includes the king thinking this warrior has defeated these assassins because he knew he could get close enough to the king to kill him himself. Is the king right? I don't want to give anything away because this was an absolutely incredible experience for me and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. The movie has many layers and unfolds very exquisitely bringing out almost every emotion we have as human beings. Not many films can do that.Now time for me to explain the tittle of my review. What is an orb? We know they are in the shape of a ball, small and fast moving. They are also sighted in areas that are ""haunted"" or areas that have a lot of history or/and both. Orbs are not visible to the naked eye and they are either caught on camera and rarely captured on home video. Nobody really knows what an orb is. Some say electricity causes them and some say they are a form of ghost. Either way I have seen a lot of movies and never in my whole life have I seen an orb captured in a motion picture. Until now.The first couple of times I did not notice it. But yesterday I watched ""Hero"" and noticed something in the corner of the screen. I thought nothing of it at first but I wanted to be sure so I skipped back a scene and watched very carefully. If you want to see this orb skip through the movie until the time passed says exactly 1 hour 26 minutes and 39 seconds. This object which I believe is a orb is visible for exactly one second and it starts off at the top right hand corner of the screen and ends up in the bottom middle of the screen. When the DVD is on pause I suggest you zoom in as much as you can and press the pause button another nineteen times and you can see the path it takes from start to finish. Now that's something you won't find in the special features.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Wuxia masterpiece with extraordinary screenplay and action scenes,"If I had to describe this film in one word, it would be ""surreal"". In all honesty, I wouldn't even classify this as a historical fiction film, it fits more as a fantasy film, but I'll explain that later.From the very beginning to the very end, this film has little dialogue between characters, yet the film still has an extremely interesting and complicated plot. The suspense and mystery elements of the plot are expertly crafted with just the right mix of probable yet unsuspecting. Without spoiling too much of the film, I will just say that the plot keeps viewers engaged from beginning to end. The moral ambiguities of the characters allow viewers to generate their own interpretations and understandings of the plot as it goes, which is atypical of most Wuxia films. The plot of this film isn't one of those ""good guy beats up bad guys"" films or ""saving the damsel in distress"". The protagonist and the antagonist (so to speak) are both just fighting for their country, but the theme reveals something much larger. Although some people may argue that the plot was being overly dramatic, unrealistic, and too cheesy, I would say that the plot plays perfectly to the fantasy-like historical setting and surreal action.Moving on to the characters - as I said, this film contains very little dialogue, while perfectly building each character's classiness, mysteriousness, and frankly just their coolness. Again, some may argue that these characters are way too unrealistic and cliché, but as a Wuxia film, these characters, again, fit perfectly. Where each character has their flaws, we all get a sense that these people are above human in almost every way, and that's what the director wants us to feel. These Wuxia have been training for their entire lives, and ARE above us in a godly way, making the film that much more satisfying.Of course, this film isn't known for its characters and plot, but rather the action and environment. While many Chinese films feature cheesy acting and low budget settings, this film creates a truly epic feeling rivaling that of Saving Private Ryan. The action is truly satisfying with actors the likes of Jet Li and Donnie Yen playing badass roles. And this film takes it to the next level with high budget action scenes that feel surreal from beginning to end - it's everything I've ever wanted in Wuxia action scenes. And finally, the setting of this film is absolutely stunning. Almost every single scene is worthy of being screenshotted and set as a wallpaper. The film captures the complete beauty of nature (presumably during the Warring Kingdoms in China) with the colors of every scene reflecting the tone of the film. I really can't say much more other than this film is an artistic masterpiece - see for yourself. The blend of colors by using the tone of the scene, the props, the clothing, and the scenery itself in every single setting always creates a harmonic and surreal experience for the viewers. If anything, I would highly encourage you to watch it just based on the cinematography. I haven't seen anything like it, not even in the Grand Budapest Hotel or the Secret Life of Walter Mitty - perhaps due to the oriental and historic setting, but nevertheless it's a truly extraordinary experience.I rate this film a 10/10 not because I think it's flawless (it has a few continuity issues and the pacing isn't exactly amazing), but because it's a Wuxia masterpiece unlike anything else I've seen. I'm a sucker for cinematography and action so that itself deserves a 10/10, but with an amazing plot as well, it's one of the top films I've ever recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,History
This film is breathtaking,"I just saw this film today, a week after its American release, and I have to say it is the one of the best films I have ever seen. I will not rate it up against other films, I will appreciate it as it's own entity. That is the highest honor I can give to a film, where comparing it to other films would be an insult. Part of the beauty of this film is seeing it in it's original language, and not dubbed in English, often the re-dub takes away the emotion the film is trying to convey. The use of color in this film is simple, and spectacular at the same time. They mostly billed this film as a Jet Li vehicle, and while he has shown more range than he ever has before, the other actors deserve Kudos for their performances, all of them. What I would like to say about this film is the underlying social commentary about ancient China is very poignant, and still holds true today all around the world. Can anyone be brave enough to lay their sword on the ground, and overcome pride for the sake of peace? I would recommend this film to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Most expensive comedy ever made,"To say that Hero is an ""epic"" is a joke in itself. Even though it does boast some scenes of China's wonderfully breath-taking landscape, it doesn't fully live up to its potential. It would have been much better if the large supporting cast of Qin soldiers were involved in one or two huge battle scenes (like the Helm's Deep battle in The Two Towers), possibly with the Zhao army. Instead, this grand army is reduced to shooting arrows at a school house and chanting ""Wind! Wind! Wind!"", while the Zhao army is nowhere to be seen. The martial arts stunts are beautifully choreographed, but they are too exaggerated even for a fantasy flick. Obviously, none of the choreographers have been schooled in the science of physics or gravity. The Qin king was simply hilarious, especially when he literally handed his sword to his unarmed assassin, even complimenting his would-be killer as though he wanted the killer to get it over and done with. Hilarious. I was bitterly disappointed in the film's plot, where the assassination scheme was retold from 3 different points of view. The sub-plot on the pseudo-love triangle between Broken Sword, Flying Snow and Moon was weak and unnecessary. And we were never told which of the main characters was actually the ""Hero"". Hero is essentially a beautiful, artsy film with a so-so love story and a fake pretense of grandeur. I managed to enjoy it cos I didn't take it seriously and took every given opportunity to steal a laugh or two. 4 out of 10.",,Anonymous,History
Better than Crouching Tiger,"There were a lot of similarities between this movie and Crouching Tiger as well as another movie Jet Li was in called ""Swordsman 2"", but I would give this movie the nod over Crouching Tiger. Whereas Crouching Tiger was more of a love story, this movie had that element as well as the element of revenge, nobility, courage, and selflessness.The story was excellent. It was brilliant in its simplicity, and I could see that the writer subscribed to the principal of less is best. The cinematography (if that's how it's spelled) was good as well. The director did a great job with the shots to capture the feeling of the moments. I had to deduct points due to what I felt was overkill on redundancy, plus there were a few slow moments which could have been done without. Anytime I look at my watch then the movie has hit a slow point, and I didn't look at my watch until an hour in.Though it hit a snag, they made sure not to drag the movie on unnecessarily.The movie is only about 90 minutes which was perfect. All in all, I liked it a lot. I didn't want to quite give it an 8 because of a few parts I've seen in other movies, plus other redundancies, so I settled for giving it a 7.Still a must see.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Dazzling,"Enormously entertaining, Zhang Yimou's dazzling epic manages to revel in all sorts of stylistic delirium while maintaining at all times a controlled sense of dignity. Part martial arts actioner, with enthralling, satisfying fight sequences, and part Chinese history lesson, Zhang paces his story (written by Zhang, Feng Li and Bin Wang) with a rushing torrent of sharp images sure to keep today's distracted audiences locked in (it makes sense that the film is 'presented' by Quentin Tarentino; it's precisely the type of movie he admires--subtle yet exciting--and could probably never make) while delicately unfolding the mystery surrounding the motives of a nameless loner (Jet Li) summoned by the King of the Qin province (Daoming Chen) to be rewarded for bringing down the King's three greatest threats. Aided by the peerless cinematographer Christopher Doyle, there isn't a wasted shot and the perfect symmetry of visuals and sound editing (a myriad of sound editors are employed) is as captivating as the story being told. Zhang has a great love for his country's history and its ritual--he seems proud to present the tale of the unification of China as well as the compassion and pragmatism of the people who forged that unification--and he trusts his content, rather than the emotions of his characters, to be his means of expression; yet when the performers do put themselves across, even the most minimal inflection (the slightest smile, for example) is devastating. With Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk and Tony Leung Chiu Wai, the soul mates from Wong Kar-Wai's sublime 'In The Mood For Love', as two of the three threats to the King; again, they're perfect. 'Hero' is a film to surrender to--you're aware of the joyful look on your face even as you're hypnotized by it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Real Message of This Chinese Film: Individualism Must Be Crushed,"HERO is a visually satisfying film - glorious colors, diaphanous, flowing garments, exotic scenery, and some of the best - if not the best - computer-enhanced sword fighting scenes ever filmed. The film even purports to have a spiritual message of sorts: that renunciation of violence and a yielding to the will of the King is the road to happiness - how Gandhi-like, but how strange when coming from the Chinese. However, there is a darker message here, too.If you look at the real philosophy behind this film it is this: no matter how justified the cause, no matter how heroic the individuals, the state must ultimately triumph in order to secure a greater good for all. Individualism must be crushed, no matter how heroic it may seem. As incongruous as it may seem when attending this kind of fantasy film, watching this movie's army of ancient Chinese archers flooding the skies with tens of thousands of well-aimed arrows - and a spectacular sight it is, too - brings immediately to mind the current Chinese Communist regime's threat to rain down a flood of missiles on Taiwan, should that island insist on declaring its total independence from China. Gee, I hadn't expected to be inundated with political thoughts when I went to see this movie, but I just couldn't avoid it. Show the courage of the students in Tien An Men Square and the King or State will reward you with the glorious death you apparently so yearn for. And all this is packaged in a film that is supposed to be an ancient martial arts fantasy.Frankly, despite the wonderful sound track of the film and the fantastic scenes of sword-fighters flying through the air, I think that this film doesn't compare entirely well with its famous predecessor, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. HERO is just a bit too good in the computer department; a but too slick. Still, it's a very impressive film, indeed. Perhaps even more impressive is to see a packed theater of average American movie-goers watching almost two hours of a sub-titled Chinese Mandarin film. For me, that is the most amazing thing of all.Finally, let me criticize the theater in which I saw this film, the Silverado in San Antonio, Texas. The film was entirely too dark, and those glorious colors in the film were nowhere near as brilliant and bright as they should have been. At times the films sets were so dark as to be almost black along the edges of the screen. I know the film was not made this way, and I can only assume that the management of the theater is using bulbs of too low a wattage in their projector. It took the pleasure out of what should have been a visually glorious film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Spectacular cinema,"I think I spoiled it: it's a great film. The technical stuff first: cinematography and sound were impressive, detailed, and creative. Occasionally it became a metaphor for an heraldic time with myth and fable, and the unreal. I guess I have succumbed to the flying as a regular detail of this genre.The movie picks up some time after the ""Emperor and the Assassin"", and characterizes the emperor as a visionary and ignores the barbarism of the time. Perhaps the accuracy is regained toward the end of the movie. The twists and turns keep you guessing in an imaginative way and make it challenging to follow. The ""Mandate from Heaven"" takes a back seat to people debating the best path for history to come. Should the vengeance of the loser yield to a better future?I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. On another perspective, I've been studying Chinese for nearly three years, and the dialog was fascinating in Chinese (at least the parts I could get). I would see again; I will buy the DVD when it comes out, and it's worth being seen by younger members of the family. My ten-year-old son very much enjoyed it as did my 17-year-old daughter.Go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
More art house than action,"(2002) Hero
(In Mandarin with English subtitles)
ACTION/ ART HOUSEAfter the success of ""Crouching Tiger..."" in which actor Jet Li personally turned down, he decided to make amends by starring in this one that's similar to it produced, co-written and directed by Zhang Yimou because of it's serious artistic overtones using the Chinese warlords as kind of a backdrop. Picturesque looking movie with very serious dramatic situations which I'm not too much a fan since they tend to overshadow the actual point of the story line. Anyways saw this one at the theater to see Jet Li in action but the fighting is less effective and less enjoyable than say ""Fist Of Legend"", or ""Fong Sai- Yuk"" and his much popular ""Once Upon A Time In China"" movies to name a few.

I was blown away then, and still to this day it mesmerises me how seamless and astonishingly well crafted it is, with so much subtlety that you notice more of with repeated viewings, especially the fight scene between the Emperor and Broken Sword, which may be the most poignant / best 2-3 minutes of audiovisual material ever put to film. I say that from watching it dozens of times over and over just now, and its subtleties are endless.It's my favourite Chinese movie, and in my Top 10 movies ever, alongside Lonesome Dove, LOTR Extended, Kingdom of Heaven Directors Cut, Kimi no Na Wa, and others.I really love Yimou Zhang's movies, and for me, Hero is definitely his best.",10.0,Anonymous,History

In other words, if you took away the flying through midair and dancing on the surface of the water scenes, the movie would have scored at least an 8 or maybe a 9 with me. I'm sure that puts me in a distinct minority, but I sure would have enjoyed this movie more if it had stayed with a much more realistic portrayal of the Qin dynasty.

Henhao - very good,"As a movie goer that generally knows very little about China and Chinese tradition, I watched this movie with awe and amazement. Its message is simple and talks about honor and duty, as it was in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. The caracters in Hero (In Mandarin: Ying Xiong) are not as complex as in 'Crouching Tiger...', but Hero's story goes further than its predecessor in that it takes a political stand. It's a story about a viscous king maturing to a wise emperor, worthy of managing 'all beneath the sky'. It's a story of valiant legendary warriors willing to sacrifice their own lives to ensure a higher purpose beyond any king or emperor. It's a story about the little man educating the big man through deeds worthy of remembrance. I can imagine this plot is a center piece of Chinese people's self understanding, something they carry with pride. For me as a bloody Westerner, I get a kick out of it, too.This film is beautiful. No lesser word can describe it. The camerawork is extraordinary, the use of colors fabulous. The use of slow motion is sublime, the kung-fu is in a class no one in the West can muster. I didn't notice any CGI during the movie, or though I can imagine rain droplets, yellow leaves or multitudes of arrows could have been CGI. As in 'Crouching Tiger...' caracters are capable of flying to right and left, something that I suppose is as natural in Chinese legends as the magic in the Lord of the Rings.Don't ask me about the acting, I'm a Westerner that has hardly seen any Chinese films...yet. However, Jet Li's stone face is perfect for the warrior Nameless, sitting merely 10 paces before the king, patiently waiting to unleash the blow of deliverance. (Watch the film to see what I mean.)All in all, the film is mysterious to me, it's a China filled with wonder and fascination. It's 2500 years of applied philosophy that provides a little hope for this mess of a world we live in.All beneath the sky...that is SO cool!",10.0,Anonymous,History
beautiful but weak in plot,"I can't understand why the rating is above 8. I would only give 5 or 6 to this movie. In Hong Kong, or China, many people will say this is not an outstanding movie. Yes, the shot is beautiful. The fighting is great. But the moving is quite boring. Most importantly, the plot is weak and does not truly refect the Chinese culture.The story of ""Hero"" is like this: there were seven kingdoms in China and Qin was the most powerful one. A few assassins (""Nameless"" (Jet Li) being one of them) wanted to kill the King of Qin. But ""Nameless"" ""discovered"" that the King of Qin can unite the China for the good of the whole Chinese citizens so he gave up killing the King.In ""Hero"", it described the King of Qin as a good King who wanted to unite China for peace finally. But in the history, we Chinese all know that the King of Qin was a cruel king who by all means of foul to achieve what he wanted. There was really (or a famous legend or story) a assassin from one of the seven kingdom had tried to kill him but failed. The King of Qin ruled the citizens under high pressure. I have no idea whether the movie has any political reasons, but it really distorted the Chinese history.Another thing which is quite absurd is the use of colors. Its painstaking to use one or two color tones. But it is overused which makes the movie laughable and stupid.",5.0,Anonymous,History

This was not a kung fu movie, as many going to see it here in the US might think (and therefore be disappointed when they see it).

Beyond images and words,"""Hero"" was one of the movies I liked from the first minute watching it. Although it has some ideas and characterizations I would generally dislike it has left some deep impressions - in some sense it gives you insight into something hardly reachable by images and words:Looking at the portrayal of the characters, one could find them superficial and hardly realistic. Most of them are exceedingly over glorified - as the English title already says, they are partly portrayed only as ""Hero's"", with almost no further dimensions. The story and the events lack any realism at all - one is obviously watching a fairy tale.And at this point you have to accept all those clichés as the means of any fairy tale - and remember that they serve telling an allegory. Otherwise you will miss the quintessence: This movie gives insight into something beyond images and words, a state of mind you probably can only experience. The state in which everything goes with ease and your actions seem to be guided by an inner flow. And this is what you could probably try to call it today, the state of ""flow"".The unspeakably beautiful images serve this and every other aspect of the movie, making it not at last one of the most marvelous fairy tales ever told.As far as for political dimensions, I for my part haven't noticed them when watching the movie - but of course if you apply the fairy tale's ending on todays china and its people - which I do not find entirely convincing - you will get a horrible message.",8.0,Anonymous,History

However it moves very slowly and, as noted above, has only the worst of Hong Kong cinema's martial arts choreography.

Beautiful Cinematography,"The cinematography of this movie is excellent, as is the storytelling. It is without a doubt one of the best Asian films I've seen yet. Examples include the color changes as different stories unfold, and a rain-soaked chess house. These are some of the most interesting cinematic moments I have seen. Many people may mention a fight scene involving flying leaves and an interesting forest/garden. However, I did not find that very well done. But it was certainly interesting.Unfortunately, I have never much enjoyed the flying around which was so prevalent in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It is less obnoxious in this film, but it's definitely there. Of course, the whole genre includes that motif, but I don't like it, and I find it cinematic ally boring.The sword play is exciting and fast paced. The music of a blind beggar on an ancient 7 stringed instrument (somewhere else has the name) is very exciting when set to one of the fights. The soundtrack is definitely engaging and exotic.I thought the constant relating of calligraphy, chess, and music to swordplay was kind of trite. Though I thought it was a visual masterpiece, I felt the analogy was not very interesting. However, it was interesting to see the melancholy absorption of Broken Sword in his calligraphy work. A strong, emotional performance offsets this rather lame analogy. It didn't overly bother me.I thought the movie was great, but it's message (while terribly Chinese), kind of rubbed me the wrong way. The film is about what a hero is (which I kinda liked, even if it wasn't a new theme), but it is also about the importance of the group, the nation, the collective. That's a very Chinese thing - as an American raised in our school of Liberal Democracy, I have different ideas about the value of the state. But, it is interesting to see how our civilizations differ.So, to summarize, while I thought the hero theme was a little trite, and while I just disagreed with the ""big picture"" about society (which I don't hold against the film - it is important to be confronted with that which you don't believe in), the emotion, the melancholy, the excellent cinematography, and the music make it a masterpiece. It is brilliantly executed.I gave it a 9/10. I love it, and would consider buying it on DVD (I own precious few).",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""Hero"": Visionary Meets the Technical","Technical virtuosity versus the eponymous creative vision. As modern movie buffs, we are usually dealt one or the other, but rarely both. The newer Star Wars episodes and to some extent, the Matrix films, tend to be heavy on the technical pyrotechnics, but tend to be short on the pure beauty of visionary cinematography. Movies like ""Amelie"" and ""Lost In Translation"" are marvels of the color aesthetic, but their technical brilliance is subtle. One of those rare films that merge the two is the new Jet Li driven vehicle, ""Hero"" (""Ying Xiong"").This eagerly anticipated film by Yimou Zhang has finally hit the U.S. theaters, even though it was actually released overseas in 2002. Much like its genre predecessor, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", this film shows off the martial art known as wuxia, which deals with swordplay. Both films could be referred to as ""wire-fu"" since both heavily use unseen wires to allow the actors to appear to float on air, hang by a foot and walk on water. The difference between the two seems to lie in the addition of Matrix-style freeze frame style effects fused with the brilliant color play that Zhang uses to create contrast between versions of events. The combination is truly evocative and yet is still able to maintain the film's sense of integrity to the time period.The cinematography and effects are truly the main characters in this film, but Jet Li turns in a quietly effective performance as Nameless, the hero of the epic tale that is part Greek tragedy and part ancient Chinese philosophy. In addition to Li, there are remarkable portrayals by Tony Leung Chiu Wai as the introspective assassin Broken Arrow and by the stunning Maggie Cheung as the tenacious Flying Snow.For all the dazzling effects, inventive cinematography and its quixotic script, ""Hero"" owes a lot to the legacy of Akira Kurosawa, the legendary Japanese director who created some of the greatest foreign epics of all-time. Much of the storytelling and scenes are straight out of some of Kurosawa's greatest works ""Rashomon"" and ""Ran"". Even though Zhang seems to liberally channel the spirit of Kurosawa through some elements, the remainder of the film is purely modern. The use of stop action and slow motion photography is probably a little overused, but the techniques do create a striking tableau of billowy dynamics. The one problem I had with the film lies with the actual use of the subtitles, which are obviously necessary, but it makes one look away from the vivid images that Zhang creates.If you are a fan of martial arts movies, epic tragedies or just a sucker for vibrant celluloid art, then you are in for a treat as ""Hero"" will appeal to all of you in some way.

One of the best martial arts movies in China,"""Hero"" is a milestone work directed by Zhang Yimou. It tells the story of various swordsmen assassinating the King of Qin during the Warring States Period. The color, sound effects and pictures of this film are all excellent, and it has received a lot of praise not only in China, but also overseas. This is not just a story of assassinating the King of Qin. In ancient China, during the Warring States period, people sometimes regarded their goals as higher than their own lives. In this movie, no one cares about their own lives. They all regard themselves as a part of history.

Review,"Hero is a visually stunning canvas of energetic movement and dancing colour caught up in an emotionally reminiscent battle of wits between a king and an assassin. Most of the amazingly captured fight scenes may leave you wondering what actually happened, therefore my best advice is to pay attention and note what colours are being worn during each scene. The story is historic and purposely confusing and would set a contemplative mind into much reflection, which in my opinion is the avenue to which the moral makes it's point. Besides the intellectual, the actual ""Hero"" of this film is the fight scenes themselves and the brilliant use of colour. Now I know the point of the movie I may now go back without my reading glasses (sub-titles) and just sit and watch the amazing martial arts. I would give this one a 7 out of 10.",,Anonymous,History

"Beautiful, but far too bland","I was really shocked and let down by the IMDb.com rating system this time around. I actually talked the wife into going to see this movie based on the 8.2 IMDb.com rating, and we were both extremely let down.Before you assume we are just another pair of idiot ""Hollywood"" film fans, we aren't. In fact, we appreciate nothing less than a refreshing and well done movie, from script to film. We enjoy movies like Memento, as well as films like Crouching Tiger, Lord of the Rings, etc.When I saw the 8.2 rating, I got quite excited, a rating usually reserved for movies that brought something original, exciting or wonderful to the table, like Jaws, A Clockwork Orange, The Wizard of Oz, The Sting, 2001, Finding Nemo and Annie Hall.We both found this movie visually beautiful. The camera work and effects were amazing. The fight scenes were well done, but it's standard stuff you've seen before (not as good as Crouching Tiger in my opinion). In fact, it almost seems like a complete ripoff of Crouching Tiger as far as the combination of dancing and people hanging on strings to fly around in (almost silly) slow motion.As for the characters ... you can almost tell they are all solid/fine actors, but their characters border on being hollow and completely out of touch. You cannot relate to any of these characters at all, with the exception of the relationship between Broken Sword and Flying Snow, which at times borders on being interesting (those times are short lived).Then you have the character of Sky, who is introduced early on, has one or two lines and becomes extinct from the movie early on.The character of Moon is puzzling and annoying, as she serves no real purpose. I largely wonder if she (Ziyi Zhang) was inserted simply because she is a ""hot item"" in the Asian cinema these days ... there is even a small gratuitous sex scene with her involved as Broken Sword's servant. Neither myself nor the wife understood what the heck she was doing in the movie, aside from a few overly melodramatic screams, cries and sword scenes.Some of the fight scenes were so silly that the wife started laughing out loud in the theater. You know that ""I feel embarrassed for the movie"" kind of feeling that you hate, where you start to feel like people are going to get up and walk out on the film? Yeah, that feeling. Two guys in a sword fight that keep stabbing the tips of their swords into a lake simply because it looks good on film visually, but with no real purpose.Basically this was like an old low-budget Bruce Lee film, with the same stone-like uncharismatic characters and facial expressions, but mix in some beautiful cinematography and some downright strange behavior. If you remove the exceptional art work, the film struggles to even be mediocre. With the advent of effects, I give it a 6/10 rating, and will certainly never see it again.Would love to see this film crew work with a better script though.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Visual splendor mixed with intriguing storytelling,"Director Zhang Yimou is a household name among wuxia fans. He's the maker of such films as House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower. From his more recent efforts I remember The Flowers of War the best. But this here is his magnum opus, his grandest gift to cinema.Hero is a confident film. It opens where most movies would end, with the protagonist presenting himself to the emperor to receive his rewards. And from there the story is told almost solely through flashbacks. An intriguing choice that would condemn a lesser of film, but Zhang makes it work. A lot of that has to do with the storytelling device where the exact same story is told over and over again, but every time this happens, it's told slightly differently. This beautifully emphasizes the importance of viewpoint as well as existing prejudices and expectations when either telling a story or hearing one.And even then it would have gotten pretty boring, with the exact same actors going through exact same routines, but the cinematography is so well designed that the every time we return to a familiar scene, it feels different, and not just because it plays out with slight variations. The colour scheme is always drastically different, the layouts have changed a little bit (yet the settings are always identifiable) and even the score seems to underline the moods in new ways.It's a fascinating film to watch and it always keeps you guessing until the very end. It speaks of richness of its characters that at the final scene I had no idea what the protagonist was going to choose. Not because his character was too unpredictable, but because I understood his blight and the difficulty of the decision. I also appreciate how well the film understands the underlying ethos of any martial art worthy of the name: the fact that you learn to fight in the hopes that you'll never have to.If you have any love for wuxia films or Chinese culture, or if you'd like to see a story told in a way you've rarely seen, you owe it to yourself to watch this film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"More Maggie, less movie","Maggie Cheung looking in to see her lover in bed with another is captured perfectly in the light from the screen. It is perhaps one of the most beautiful scenes in the entire movie. It is also about where I began to get weary.There is really nothing new in Hero. The courtyard with thousands of warriors was done better with the real life participation of the Red Army in the Last Emperor (a fitting contrast to this the story of the first Emperor) the sword play that was imaginative and innovative in Crouching Tiger is a bit yesterday, and repetitive here. The story is good enough though huge holes appear in the end and one wonders why the story must end exactly as it does. Death is always senseless, but in this case the death of one character is uncalled for, it advances nothing, the character essentially dies for nothing. Other deaths make sense but this one is just dumb. If you see the picture you will know which one I mean. OK, I think you get the picture.If there is a real star to this movie, it is as usual Ms. Cheung. She is an incredible presence in her every scene. The writing does not always work for her, however, we have no clue why she is so adamant about not providing red ink, maybe I just need to learn Mandarin but It would have been nice to get a clue as to what was going on.

Propagandistic tripe,"Like so much of Chinese cinema, ""Hero"" is a dull trudge through an absurdist, politically-motivated fantasy of ancient China. The action scenes are typical Chinese-styled indulgent impossibilities of both physics and entertainment and the entire goal of this film (which contains less illuminating dialogue than can fill a scene, let alone this ponderous attempt at a movie) is a shameless retelling of the attempt on the life of the hated first emperor of China.The representation of Shi Huang Di is especially ridiculous. Portrayed as a strong, upright individual whose goal is the ""noble"" unification of what was to become China, he bears no resemblance whatsoever to the picture history paints of the first Qin emperor. An insane and overbearing legalist who was so unloved by his court that an assassin was allowed to make an attempt on his life without the slightest intervention from the attending mass of courtiers who supposedly owed him allegiance, he was thoroughly despised throughout the ages following the end of his brief dynasty. Contrary to this undisputed consensus on the first emperor is his portrayal as a man who stands up to his would-be assassin and engages in a farcical pseudo-philosophical debate which further alienates the discerning viewer.I was ashamed to see Quentin Tarantino associate himself with this pathetic piece. None of his films are baldfaced attempts at revisionist history whose sole goal is the unashamed glorification of a nation's manufactured past. Not to mention that string tricks have long outstayed their welcome.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant!  Best Rental.,"Absolutely Brilliant! Enjoyed the Movie immensely. The individual martial arts is also second to none, for myself particularly to see the distant shots of the whole battle sequence showing the true skills involved with fighting, such as footwork, perfect timing,aggression, counter attacks and defense. Jet Li shows he is truly the grand daddy of martial arts. I cannot stress enough how much you need this film in your life. This film was released in 2002, but this is certainly one of my all time favorites and will probably be the best film I see all year. I have never been more enthusiastic to pursue films in this genre in my life. For more action type enthusiasts who like more gore and violence check out 'Ong Bak', but for people who appreciate a fuller, visionary piece of martial arts filming, this will leave you speechless.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Confusing Plot, Charismatic Visuals","'Ying Xiong' is quite confusing. Jet Li's character Nameless tells so many stories to the King of Qin (played by Chen Dao-ming) and I couldn't keep up with any of the stories. And because these stories were shot in so many colours matters were even more confusing. I was too busy gawking at the screen, going ""Oh! my, that is wonderful"" and in the meantime, another story passed me by.Zhang Yimou's story is grand. Three warriors, each one better than the other, from the different warring provinces the King of Qin wants to unify under his rule, come together to assassinate the King. Since killing the King is no easy task, they hatch a plan. 'Ying Xiong' is the story of their plan and whether they are successful in killing the King and freeing their respective provinces.The three warriors have been played by three of China's best known actors. Tony Leung Chiu-wai as Broken Sword, Maggie Cheung Man-yuk as Flying Snow, and Donnie Yen as Sky. Jet Li  the most best known star in this film  plays a character called Nameless who is an official in the province of Zhao and who has, supposedly, killed all these assassins. Killing these assassins was difficult but now he is faced with the toughest task of all. Convincing the King of Qin that he has, indeed, finished the assassins.Zhang Yimou's scale is grander. If 'Wo Hu Cang Long' opened up the doors for classy kung-fu movies, 'Ying Xiong' could very well be considered the Mother of all Wo Hu Cang Longs. And that, perhaps, takes 'Ying Xiong' down.Time magazine, issue dated 21 January 2002, says this about 'Ying Xiong': ""Zhang Yimou's martial-arts epic 'Hero' has a boffo cast, a big budget, an award-winning crewand the burden of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'"" This burden sinks 'Ying Xiong'.'Wo Hu Cang Long' was simple, fluid and feminine. It had a linear plot with no twists and all. The serious Chow Yun-fat, the gorgeous Michelle Yeoh, the good bandit Chang Chen, and the cute little dynamite Zhang Ziyi were like people we know. Though the characters belonged to a different era, each one was like so familiar. Chow Yun-fat was like a father-figure, a man we could always rely upon. Michelle Yeoh was like an aunt or an elder sister, one who does embroidery, makes tea, keeps secrets, gives the best advice. Chang Chen was like this neighbourhood lout who climbs trees, plays games on the street, bullies young children. And Zhang Ziyi, well, she's like that daddy's spoilt daughter who wants to run away, try a bold dress or hairdo, mix with the guys, stuff like that. In 'Ying Xiong', you could hardly identify with a character. There are stars, my god, all of them. But that connection with them is missing. Plus, there are so many sub-plots, a different colour for each one of them  red, blue, green, white, yellow  and these sub-plots (the entire film, actually) has been shot so well, so well, that this beauty just acts as a distraction. The actors put in a great job, a very great job, but somehow it is only the non-action scenes that stand out. The action scenes seem so unconvincing and (after 'The Matrix' and 'Wo Hu Cang Long') so repetitive.The technical aspect is the real star. Christopher Doyle  Wong Kar-wai's right-hand man  could actually shoot day scenes. I've seen Doyle's work only in Kar-wai's films  'Cheun Gwong Tsa Sit', 'Hua Wang Nian Hua', 'Chung Hing Sam Lam' and '2046'  and I had ended up believing that he specializes in no-lights photography. But his work in 'Ying Xiong' is so superb I had to change my opinion. Doyle could do anything.The music by Tan Dun sounds like 'Wo Hu Cang Long' but the tunes are different. Sounds good. Very good.Time magazine has gone ga-ga over the fight scene with Maggie and Ziyi (who has a very small role as Moon, Broken Sword's disciple). I found it quite ordinary. Maggie and Ziyi are just doing acrobatics and there are leaves flying around. Not that appealing. Plus, after seeing Maggie in Wong Kar-wai's films, it is hard to accept her doing action scenes. Ziyi is so lithe, plus, I still remember her as the girl who stole the Green Destiny, so, watching her doing action was more OK. Tony Leung's action scenes are nice. He carries this grave expression throughout and that saves him. Maggie looks good crying. Another Wong Kar-wai hangover. The action scene I particularly liked was the Arrow Deflecting scene featuring Jet Li and Maggie. It's amazing. The Lake fight scene is also good but it looks like an extended 'Wo Hu Cang Long' water-surface fight scene.I would give this film 9/10 for the technical aspects, which are the real stars; 9/10 for the acting because all actors are very good  Tony Leung, especially; 6/10 for the story because I ended up confused  although the end is nice, the reason that Broken Sword gives. That adds up to 24 out of 30. That is, 80 out of 100. So my rating is 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Without question, one of the most beautiful films I have seen in years!","Director Yimou Zhang produced a minor masterpiece in 2002 when Hero first appeared. Two years later, after much success and the development of a cult following, the movie was re-released to be met with even greater success. Often looked at as a combination of Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon and Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero is actually more than the sum of its inspirations. Yes, it does tell its story in a manner that fans of Rashomon will immediately recognize, and the brilliantly choreographed martial arts sequences due owe quite a bit to Woo-ping Yuen's work in Lee's picture. Yet, with its gorgeous cinematography, brilliant story, and the emotional performances of Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Broken Sword), Maggie Cheung (Flying Snow), and Ziyi Zhang (Moon). Jet Li gives a quiet, but by no means less-powerful performance as the nameless prefect. Also of note are the performances of Daoming Chen (King of Qin) and Donnie Yen (Sky). But what would these great performances be without a moving story? Jet Li plays ""Nameless,"" a prefect of Qin, who has apparently slain the three most dangerous assassins in the land. His reward is to speak with the king, whom he has so loyally served. During their conversation, Nameless tells the story (seen through a series of flashbacks) of how he was able to defeat his lord's most-feared adversaries. I won't go any further into the plot, because I do not want to ruin anything. This film is worth the price of admission just to watch the martial arts scenes, as spectacularly choreographed by Siu-Tung Ching and Wei Tung. The splendid use of color in the film is another pleasure to behold. Cinematographer Christopher Doyle presents a lush painting in motion as Nameless and the king discuss the prefect's adventures. Extraordinarily beautiful, and not too be missed!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful Rip-off,"After highly anticipating this movie's release, I must say that I was a little disappointed. I can't quite pinpoint what it is about this movie I didn't like, but something was...missing. It is a really well-made movie, from thecinematography to the set design and even costuming. They were all nothingshort of awesome. But where ""Hero"" went wrong was it's originality. I know it's been said before, but it was EXACTLY like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""Not because it's ancient China or a beautiful ""kung-fu"" epic, but almosteverything that made CTHD great was spliced right into ""Hero."" From the music to the love story to the visual elements and fighting styles, it has the same feeling, mood, and characters that CTHD did (but without the heart anddevelopment). I enjoyed Jet Li immensely and like I said, it's very well done and visually beautiful, but too little originality and not enough development to be CTHD.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"'Rashomon' + 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' = 'Hero'","The film takes place 2,000 years ago when China was split into seven feudal kingdoms. The tyrannical but shrewd and insightful King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming) who wants to unite seven kingdoms in one powerful country, is the target of three legendary assassins: Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung), accompanied by Moon (Zhang Ziyi), his devoted servant. The titular Hero, the man without the name (Jet Li), who defeated the assassins, receives as an award a unique private audience with the King of Qin in his Royal Palace...I believe that this is an amazing film which has everything working perfectly: great story which is told in the manner of Kurosawa's Rashômon, romance, action (and what the action it is...), political intrigue, suspense, fantasy - and if this is not enough, 'Hero' is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen - Christopher Doyle's cinematography, jaw - dropping use of colors, costume design, Tan Dun's musical score, and artfully choreographed fighting sequences leave you breathless.",10.0,Anonymous,History
What Makes A Hero?,"I inevitably compare ""Hero"" to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" because both are Chinese made films, and thus the latter is the only real reference point to which I compare the former. I enjoyed ""Hero"" more than I enjoyed ""CTHD,"" largely because I thought the story was easier to follow. Like ""CTHD"", ""Hero"" is filled with beautiful photography, brilliantly choreographed martial arts scenes, and excellent stunt work and special effects. That latter strength, however, is ironically one of the weaknesses I found with both movies. While I'm sure it's a cultural issue, I find the flights of fancy in the martial arts scenes distracting, as people soar through the air and walk on water. To me, that lends an air of unbelievability to the fight scenes, which should be the heart of the movie. Instead, they just come across as fantasy. In this case, though, a very good story helps overcome that problem.The story is set during the time when the ruler of Qin sets for himself the goal of unifying various warring kingdoms and creating a unified nation, which would become China. To do that, he has to overpower the strongest of his enemies, the neighbouring kingdom of Zhao. Zhao is powerful, and has three assassins constantly trying to kill the king, until one day, a low-ranking official named simply Nameless (Jet Li) is brought to court after apparently having defeated all three assassins. He weaves a story to explain how he accomplished this, but the king is suspicious and offers what he believes is the real story. Both stories are told through the use of flashbacks.In the end, as the title implies, we deal with the question of what constitutes heroism. Who is the hero here? The unknown official who apparently vanquishes the assassins? The assassins themselves, fighting for the very existence of their nation of Zhao? The king who understands that the constant warfare and suffering of the people can only be stopped by the even more ruthless warfare required to unify the country? There are a variety of possibilities. It's an interesting story - and an interesting moral question about war and violence. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

'Music and martial arts have the same principles,"....both grapple with complex chords and melodies' so aptly quoted in the film, nothing can be more truer about Tan Dun's heavenly background score. It transforms an already beautiful movie into something almost divine and ethereal. Using multiple scales to convey a change of scene, moods and settings each composition blends masterfully into each other like a jigsaw piece puzzle to paint a beautiful canvas. If you just close your eyes throughout the movie the music is powerful enough to convey what is going on the screen!Tan Dun uses the minor pentatonic scale with an added 2nd note very characteristic of Chinese traditional music. But surprisingly he uses a very different signature scale - (called Raag Bhairavi of Indian classical music); gives a kind of haunting melancholic melody that runs throughout the movie. The transitioning between scales and melodies is pure musical genius!",10.0,Anonymous,History

Charming Yarn; Visual Feast,"This is a ""martial arts"" movie, meaning that it has nothing whatever to do with ""real"" martial arts, any more than Hollywood gun fights have anything to do with real gun fights: it is all like ballet, really.All the more so in this lovely picture, where the performers fly, do calisthenics over the surface of water and levitate within whirlwinds of Autumn leaves that change colour when one of the dancers is nailed. Very pretty, though juvenile.The plot, such as it is, is a bit of a labyrinth, in which the same narrative is seen to have several different meanings; this is a wonderful excuse to have the handsome Leung killed several times over in different manifestations of the same setting, always by his lover. This is the most erotic sword play I have ever seen. The women are something else.There is at least some effort to illustrate the Confucian ethic of The Good of the Many over selfish, individualistic concerns. But this does not keep the King from doing the [eventually] selfless hero in, which leads to a very picturesque Wagnerian procession with said Hero borne on his shield.Finally, though, it is the visual magic of Chinese landscapes, Chinese interiors (not to mention the idealised beauty of the very decorative cast!) that make this short (96 min) lively film spellbinding. It is probably too pretty for the grunt-and-slash young male fraternity, but I am very happy I saw it. There is something very much like poetry here at times.",,Anonymous,History

Cinematography at its finest; film as art.,"This artistic action film has it all, a true feast for eyes & mind. Great plot, acting, action & stunning beauty from start to finish. Put aside the politics & enjoy this epic story with all its breathtaking beauty & creative action. Nothing here is routine. As a westerner, I truly dislike subtitles. But there's little reading here, as one sees the tales explained mostly by action & drama- not many words needed. Hearing the actors true voices adds to the drama- no chatter heads here.
Allow yourself to be submerged in fantasy- little CGI, just incredible vision delivered by the director, actors & photography director. Jet Li is in fine martial arts form, just like his co-stars for the action fight scenes. The use of colors, flowing garments & hair, use of nature, camera angles, backgrounds, costumes, sets, wire work are all exceptional & uniquely beautiful.
Plot: Pre Dynasty China, 2000 plus years ago, Jet Li plays a man who tells a king how he obtains 3 rare weapons the king desires. The tale is then retold by the king's view, & the viewer later sees the truth. The 3 versions do NOT repeat in any way- it's 3 different tales, each uniquely portrayed beautifully, in unforgettable cinematic epic format with matching soundtrack. Some of the music is a bit odd to westerners but it works because it's faint background, not foreground sound. Nowhere does the movie get slow or feel dragged out, & it's not a typical ending. There's plot twists & humor too.
It's a shame China does not allow these films deemed ""nationalistic"" to be made anymore. It's based on some historic facts but is a fictional story. This film proves nudity, sex & gore, nor blasting sound effects are NOT needed to show full range of human emotions, thrilling action.

A movie worth seeing for its stunning photography,"I just went to see Hero, Yimou Zhang's movie based in a Chinese legend that describes how several assassins try to kill the King of one of ancient China's states, Qin (pronounced 'shin', which later gave China its name), until one of them comes up with a twisted plot to accomplish that goal.The plot is, in in my very personal opinion, the failure of the movie, which is told in three major flashbacks, each one in a different color, and each one supposedly true, only until the next one arrives. I wouldn't have a problem with that except for the fact that the changes are subtle, and on the third one I was just praying that the plot advanced with something different and not with another 'version' of the same little story.Aside from that, in line with what everyone says, the movie's cinematography is second to none; the handling of composition, color, and themes is breathtaking.

Lyrical Cinematography Keeps Pace With an Ambitious Tale,"During China's ancient ""Warring States"" period, a solemn warrior appears at one royal palace bearing gifts: the collected weapons of three notorious assassins, whose prior attempt on the king's life did not succeed. Now paranoid due to the attack, the monarch sits alone in his throne room, not even his advisors allowed within a hundred paces, but allows this steady-eyed visitor to draw near as he tells his story. What follows is an act in three parts - two hypotheticals and a truth - that describe identical topics through biased eyes. We see fact stretched into fiction, though the telling is so sweeping, vivid and resonant that we often overlook the context clues.Director Zhang Yimou's vision is breathtaking, an intricately detailed work of moving art that blends seamlessly with the romantic martial arts epic at its core. Fabricated memories take on a dreamy quality, reflecting the speaker's sweeping exaggerations. Fight scenes flow like syrup, a poetic ballet of impeccable fighting stances and wuxia acrobatics. Environments pulse with life and color. The lush, mesmerizing golds and reds of a leaf-coated orchard during autumn, perhaps the most memorable setting in a film that's absolutely stuffed with them, still leaves my jaw agape.A strikingly gorgeous film, crafted with expert care, that's equally profound on a thematic level as it is on a compositional one.

simply stunning,"I saw this movie without seeing any previews or reading any reviews so I had no expectations - but wow what a treat!The story appears to be fairly straightforward - set in China in the 3rd Century BC a nameless warrior (Jet Li) reports to the King of Qin how he has killed three of his most feared and dangerous enemies. But things are not so simple and we are taken on a journey of several versions of events.The cinematography is as good as anything you will see. Stunning landscapes are intertwined with scenes featuring close up slow motion work. The use of colour is spectacular, some scenes having a theme colour which is changed as we move forward.The fight scenes are fantastical with the protagonists gliding through the air swirling swords and spears in their amazing costumes. They've obviously used a large amount of wire work but unlike say The Matrix you are left admiring the grace of the movements rather than being conscious of special effects.The scale is grand, they appear to have used thousands of extras rather than CGI, and the result is impressive. There is some CGI used but it is seamless and complements rather than dominating.The soundtrack is a pleasure to hear. Funky Chinese music with plenty of drums a-banging while swords are a-clanking.And after all the main characters have spent the whole movie trying to kill each other the themes that emerge are love and peace.

"Sensual masterpiece--but wait, there's more","Two continents and two epic movies in as many days. Perhaps I was a little too jetlagged to enjoy ""Alexander""? Nope it's because I'd been spoiled by ""Hero"". I first saw this in Australia because I thought it might have left US theaters (Nov 2004). Luckily it hadn't and I got to see it again--but under severely strained circumstances: the theatre did NOT turn the lights off because they needed to ""watch the audience"" (huh? I complained to the manager and that was hisreason) and so the full effect of the glorious cinematography was lost. Thank you Aussie Chris Doyle for thrilling my eyes and providing me with material for my film classes for years to come (Explore film symbolism with reference tocolour, Chinese symbolism, and how they are deployed in ""Hero""?). Thanks tothe costumer (Wada) for feeding my frock-flick appetite (""In the Mood for Love"" was my last feasting). Thanks to the auditory inclusions (the drop of rain, the * musical* first battle). The battle scenes are masterfully filmed, they must have been a choreographer's nightmare (I kept wondering--how do they NOT step oneach other's toes and all start tumbling down the bloody steps?) Sigh, the film is simply a sensual masterpiece: the sounds of battle, the swish of a bladethrough water, the ballet of a duel. The many many minor details that will drive my students mad for the next few semesters (heh heh heh). Also thanks for the kick-ass female role/s (and not a nipple in sight, see my review of 'Alexander').Now we've done with the narrative, let's turn to plot. Certainly the warrior/ emperor framework was a little stilted but the flickering candles diverted me enough not to make this a serious flaw. The film is not difficult to follow (say like ""Momento"" which I love for its 'wait a second' plot); we simply have at least one unreliable narrator (but who is it ?) . The film is emotionally engaging--as English reviewer Williamson noted in the potential symbolism of the calligraphy school and the tumbling scrolls. Some claim it's politically devious? Thephilosophy is humanist rather than communist-the film does not preach-- viewers have to develop their own interpretations. What puzzles me is whysome commend Oliver Stone but condemn Yimou Zhang.Lastly--I still don't get the Tarentino reference--credits claim him as 'presenter' but he wasn't in either version I watched. BTW, I saw the 109 Aussie version and the supposedly shorter US one --couldn't pick the differences but I was toopeeved by the theatre lighting.

Apart from fighting this movie shows some of his other talents. Donnie Yen isn't exactly well-known, at least he wasn't until this movie. And so this movie was a good opportunity for him to show us what he is made of and he did so by also performing brilliantly. This also counts for Maggie Cheung and Ziyi Zhang, although Ziyi had already shown his skills in the equally brilliant movie ""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon""The Colors: Zhang Yimou uses the power of color to strengthen the story and to make the battles look more intense. A great scene in the movie is when ""Flying Snow""(Maggie Cheung) and ""Nameless""(Jet Li) fight against incoming arrows of the king's archers on top of a building. And after that when ""Moon""(Ziyi Zhang) seeks revenge for the killing of her lover ""Sky""(Donnie Yen) by ""Flying Snow"".

Over-rated Propaganda,"CCP-inspired neo-orientalism. What can I say? Obviously a lot of people love this film, so this is a dissenting opinion. I had no preconceptions before I saw it but I was tremendously disappointed, and I don't want to waste too much breath on this mediocre work. The plot is silly, the characters predictable. Yes, the cinematography is gorgeous, but that alone is not enough, and only raises it from a zero to a three(out of ten) on my scale. The message -- China must be united whatever the personal cost to those on the Chinese periphery (look out Taiwan! bye-bye Hong Kong!) is tired and worn-out and, well, do we really want a message in such a film? Clearly Zhang Yimou is working hard to ingratiate himself to the Party censors, but that doesn't mean his audience needs to fawn over such sycophancy, as I fear so many in outside of China have. I think we can expect more from lavishly produced works such as this.",3.0,Anonymous,History
A Stunning Work of Art,"The Hollywood action crowd could learn a thing or two from ""Hero,"" a martial arts picture that tells a complex story to go along with its fight scenes and generates one unforgettable image after another.Set in the period before China became a united kingdom, ""Hero"" deals with such classic themes as courage, self-sacrifice, honor, revenge and romantic passion, and does so on a scale that is both intimate and epic. In this tale about the founding of a nation, the protagonist is a master swordsman, known only as ""Nameless,"" who is either an assassin of other would-be assassins who are out to kill a king, or an assassin bent on killing the king himself. The beauty of the story is that it unfolds in the form of a mystery, almost ""Rashomon""-like in the way it views the same incidents from the differing and often contradictory perspectives of various characters, some of them eyewitnesses to the events and others spinning tales out of pure speculation. Like the images in a kaleidoscope, the plot points are constantly grouping, then falling to pieces, then re-grouping into other patterns until a full-blown picture of the entire story at last emerges.The kaleidoscope analogy is a fitting one, for it is in its visuals that ""Hero"" truly becomes a masterpiece. The film is like an artist's canvas brought brilliantly to life, a canvas covered with the most vivid and eye-popping colors imaginable. Whether it's the sight of huge armies marching against impressive landscapes, their flags of war fluttering in the breeze, or thousands upon thousands of arrows soaring through the air in a literal rain of death, or a beautifully choreographed fight scene in a meadow strewn with impossibly yellow and red autumn leaves, ""Hero""'s imagery makes an indelible impression on the viewer. As is the custom with many recent Chinese films, the swordfight scenes have been turned into slow motion ballets, with the participants defying gravity by flying effortlessly through the air to unimaginable heights. This emphasis on the surreal gives the film the mythic quality it needs to tells its ancient tale.Yet, even with all its visual sumptuousness, ""Hero"" never forgets that it is, first and foremost, a story about people - their lives, their loves, and the conflicts they face as they play out the roles assigned to them by history. Rather than getting buried under all the visuals, the characters are able to stand out from the background and make their mark on the viewer's heart. This is helped immeasurably by the fine performances from Jet Li, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, and Maggie Cheung among others.Kudos to writers Feng Li and Bin Wang, director Yimou Zhang, cinematographer Christopher Doyle, costume designer Emi Wada and all the other talented artists who have had a hand in crafting one of the most visually exquisite and intellectually satisfying films in recent memory.

Why Martial Arts? The Answer: Hero.,"How many times we have heard our friends and relatives asking us about our fascination with action-movies or films with martial arts? We always expect a film that could teach them how artistic could be Action and Kicks and Punches.The Wuxia Genre is the perfect way to tell stories so deep, emotional and philosophical such as the stories told in Ying xiong (Hero), but in the past and due to the high amount of movies of Wuxia that deliver Hong Kong these aspects sometimes are deluded in stories that just deliver action and energy. This particular film could perfectly be the sole justification of the existence of cinema of martial arts. But is not the first and hopefully won't be the last time when Asian filmmakers teach us why the Adventure and the Action speak better about ourselves rather than other movies. There are many undiscovered Martial Arts Films that has similarities with Hero.Slightly based in reality Hero is more a fantasy, at this point we should be careful with any accusations of wrong perception of history. The subtext and the moral that surround the plot are mature, intelligent and personal. Zhang Yimou view of heroism is superb. It's not a slow movie, but Hero leaves space for dialogue that has the same transcendence that the fights have. Hero not only dares to stretch the boundaries of storytelling also has and incredible visual style (Chris Doyle's cinematography), and colors also help to understand the story better. The final touch is the music of Tan Dun, a whole narration itself, Tan Dun give us a memorable score. Jet Li is probably the best martial artist alive and a good actor (two things that hardly are bond), and a rich story such as this one needed a talent like Jet's. Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen, a cast that is a mixture of dramatic actors and martial artist, all of them teaching us how the physical and emotional acting are one thing. Sorry for the super-stardom that believe in the use of a body double in almost every scene.Enjoy it and watch it again, tell your friends about Hero.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful Opera,"If you want to see a perfect example of Chinese acting, storytelling and cinematography (Christopher Doyle), as well as one of the best directors in the business, then you can't go wrong with Hero.It won 21 awards (It should have won 23, but the Golden Globes and Academy voters were idiots!) Director Yimou Zhang (House of Flying Dragons, Curse of the Golden Flower) has given us a stunning ballet of China two thousand years ago.The cast includes some of the very best in Chinese movie epics and includes Jet Li (KIss of the Dragon, Romeo Must Die) in his greatest role; Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Infernal Affairs or the real ""Departed""); Ziyi Zhang (Memoirs of a Geisha, TMNT); and Maggie Cheung (2046).Like great opera, this film bears watching over and over.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Still the best of the genre,"Ying Xiong is a rare gem among WuXia (chinese historical kung-fu) movies. It has the perfect balance of all the elements: story, writing, acting, cinematography, visual effects, music etc. The only other movies of the genre that achieved this are Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and House of Flying Daggers, and in my opinion Ying Xiong is the better of the three. All other movies in the genre are lacking in one or more of the elements, and especially lacking in the recent crop of big-budget WuXia movies are the story, writing and acting. More often than not, these movies concentrated too much on the visual effects, i.e. way too much CG with way too poor story and acting (e.g. Tsui Hark's Zu Warriors (2001), Wu Ji (The Promise 2005), Ching Din Dai Sing (Chinese Tall Story 2005)). But as exemplified perfectly in Ying Xiong, sometimes less is better than more. The spectacular and beautiful visual effects in Ying Xiong are perfectly in tune and blend in seamlessly with the rest of the movie, thus enhancing the overall experience instead of being jarring distractions like the CG used in so many other movies of the genre. But what's more important, the story in Ying Xiong has an elegance, gravity and nobility which is so seldom achieved in other movies of the genre. It's the result of mature writing and superb acting.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Extraordinary images!,"I admit that I am unfamiliar with the genre of martial arts films and therefore probably missed many points that would be recognized by enthusiasts of these, primarily, Asian films. Having said that, I was totally mesmerized by the beauty of this amazing film that I watched this afternoon. I tend to judge films more on the quality of the visuals that I see rather than other major aspects of film so this was a visual feast of virtually unmatched beauty.At the beginning of the film is the opening fight scene-shot in dark greys in the rain[!] and I was totally hooked after that. The beauty of Zhang's shot selection and Doyle's photography made those first minutes the worth of the film-the remainder was just cake frosting for me. I don't think that I will ever see a scene more beautifully composed and filmed for the rest of my years. Later on the fight scene with Maggie Cheug with the screen filled with the yellow leaves of autumn was nearly as beautiful.Zhang's choice of billowing robes for the costumes in the martial scenes left an otherworldly aspect to what, under another director, would have been a standard fight scene fueled by the martial activity; his direction took the scene into another realm-one unanticipated by this viewer with the result being memorable.A fabulous film that I will anticipate viewing a second and third time-the BEST!",,Anonymous,History
"Good, but not great","PROS:1. Good story and plot... there are a few layers here. Not the tired: ""You killed my master, and I'm going to get you!"" I'd say the story here is even better than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.2. Good costumes3. Good acting4. They are lucky to be riding on the coat-tails of the Kill Bill series that re-ignited peoples appetites for these types of films. Also, Passion of Christ was in a foreign language and subtitled. So people are more receptive to this type of film now.CONS:1. Sound - not in THX or anything CLOSE... lacked a big theatre feel. The style of music was OK.2. Too unrealistic. e.g. arrows when they were doing calligraphy not hitting anyone. Tired of the running on water sequences. It really takes away from it. Some of the wire work could have been better.3. Mediocre fight scenes. No epic fights. Everything I see here, I have seen in other martial arts films... some done even better. See works of Yuen Wo Ping for excellent fight scenes. (e.g. Yuen Wo Ping was action director for The Matrix.)4. G rating... really took away from its potential content. Needed to be at least PG-13.OTHER:All the actors are solid. Ziyi Zhang (Moon) is a hot cutie. I've seen many of Jet Li's films and I'm afraid this film is too Crouching Tiger to stack up. If you want to see really great Jet Li films, see:1. Tai Chi Master also known as Twin Warriors (with the sensational Michelle Yeoh/Khan) [See almost anything with Michelle Yeoh/Khan... she's worth it.]2. The Defender3. Fist of Legend4. Romeo Must Die (with Aaliyah)I would recommend Hero/Ying Xiong, but I can't give it more than 7/10. I think some people are being swept by the novelty of the film but if you have been following Jet Li or films of this genre for some time, you know he has done better movies.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Exquisite Chinese Martial Arts Ballet,"""Hero"" is another one of those Chinese sword-fighting action films, exquisitely designed from the same kind of cloth that was used for the recent Academy Award-winner, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" Both films help to define a unique cinematic genre that might be called martial arts ballet.Like Crouching Tiger, Hero features lush imagery, constant acrobatic sword-play, intriguing special effects, and characters who leap impossibly through the air while they fight. Like Crouching Tiger, Hero uses the structure of having a character tell a narrative, with flashbacks interwoven at different segments of time to illustrate the narrative. Then, another character relates the same salient events from a different point of view, thus rebutting the first character's version while twisting it into a new and exciting dramatic situation. This type of story-telling technique not only provides a flexible and versatile (if somewhat artificial and forced) cinematic structure, but it also conveys the message that nothing is at it seems at first sight: there is always one more way to view a series of events. The truth will come out only if you can obtain the correct perspective on events. At that point, a person's true character will be revealed by the action he takes.Woven deep within the fabric of the acrobatic sword-play, Hero, like Crouching Tiger, has a poignant love story element, in which the lovers must somehow sacrifice for the greater good. In this case, the meta-message of Hero, which is set in a time of China's distant past, turns out to be that even unnamed heroes possessed with skills that go far beyond the reach of ordinary citizens, must sacrifice for the greater good of a unified China, poetically referred to as ""Our Land."" The clever way in which this political, ideological theme is interwoven into the love story and the martial arts scenes makes this a very powerful movie for nurturing a sense of nationalistic pride and patriotism among modern Chinese, for it mythologically links them back thousands of years ago to their ancestral past. In a country where ancestor worship is an established religion, this is powerful stuff.Unlike the rugged individualism and the Ayn Randish self-centeredness that functions as the primal undercurrent in the heroic cinema of the West, movies like Hero spring from a culture in which the primary social value requires that the individual subordinate his egocentric self for the greater good of his family, his community, his nation. While the West seeks to question tradition and to promote individualism within the context of developing an independent or rebellious spirit of mind, in the Orient, it is much more important to be interdependent with those around you, as well as to respect the authority and the values of those who preceded you.The entire narrative of Hero —and its underlying meta-message— is so seductively cloaked by a magically droning, ethereally haunting sound-track that you are slowly, but surely, hypnotized as you watch the different versions of the story unfold. The overall effect on a viewer's psyche is so subtle that no one would dare call this outright propaganda. But the legends which are being narrated, the new myths which are being created, and the cultural collective unconscious which is being nourished through martial arts ballets like Hero (and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) lead me to believe that these brilliant Chinese filmmakers have raised the art of cinema to an entirely new level of integrating mind, heart, and psyche. Western filmmakers, psychologically savvy statesmen, and open-minded, cross cultural entrepreneurs should take note.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Makes a person feel good about power,"Basically, the way I felt about this movie is that while it was beautiful to watch, and thrilling in its tribute to human skill and ability, in the end it amounted to a justification for statehood and dominion.In other words, it's stylistically captivating, but one should remain clued to the ideological message being conveyed. To accept this film part and parcel one must disregard logic and justice and a few other things relating to a healthy disdain for those in power. By harnessing the ethos of pacifism, the spirit of enlightenment, and the aura of human excellence to advance the idea of dominion, cloaked in a message of peace, it makes a bad idea seem good. Namely, that peace and unity can or should be obtained by the use of force by one people over another.Some people may condemn this movie as ""Communist"" propaganda, but I think it is much more in line with the ideology of the West than anything to do with socialism, or China for that matter ;)",6.0,Anonymous,History

Propaganda and Sellout,"Westerners criticize this film and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon for its fantasized action scenes. Just like in western culture's Sword and Sorcery, a wizard can cast a spell and let out lightnings and stuff, it's a culture thing. Walking on water, speeding on rooftops, that's part of Chinese Martial Arts Literature, an ability to move fast and swift.As for Hero the movie, it's been badly received by Chinese Culture based viewers (including Taiwan) not only because it changed the history, also because it's a commercial movie aimed for westerners, selling out beautiful but empty, flawed Chinese culture and icons. It's a sellout in box office, true enough, and also a sellout to our culture, only to please westerners who have no idea what real Chinese Martial Arts Literature is.In most of recent decades' Martial Arts Literature such as Jinyong's works, the Martial Arts Hero/Swordsman (pronounced Xia), just like Euorpe Knights and Japan Samurais, has a basic belief that is to help the poor civilians, overthrow tyrants and corrupted officials. Martial Art Heroes are often against the government, they don't belong to any kind of authorities or organizations, they stand on the same side with the people, just come and go in their own will, carrying out their own beliefs in justice. And in Hero, it works the other way around.Sure enough, Hero is a propaganda movie made by the Chinese Communist Government. Remember what the movie is all about? It teaches people that, for the course of greater good, one must sacrifices his own life to fulfill the country's need. Even though in the real history, the emperor killed all the scholars at that time, and burned out every book he can find, in order to keep his people from getting educated, so that the mind-numbed-never-go-to-school-people will not stand up against him, the movie teaches people to just tolerate the tyranny for the country's sake.That's so nonsense. So right winged. Hero is just a tool for political brainwashing.",3.0,Anonymous,History
wow wow wow wow wow,"Hero is a movie of wow moments. In fact, the movie seems to have been designed with the goal of making the viewer go ""wow"" about once a minute. Much of this is achieved through the film's amazing visuals. While ostensibly a martial arts movie, this is really closer to a dance film, with whirling, colorful principals leaping and soaring in impossible ways. The movie is cinematic in a way few movies are, and is basically the movie I was expecting to see after hearing about the disappointing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.The film shows the sort of mastery of pure cinematic film making of someone like Kubrick or Kurosawa, although the style is dissimilar to both. The director has an unerring feel for both pure visual composition and for the beauty of movement.Wow moments come both from stunning sights like a woman spinning so quickly that arrows are pushed away and cool ideas like two opponents facing each other as they quietly imagine the fight they will have as a musician plays. The movie elicits a pure visceral wonder, the sort that makes people shout out, ""Awesome dude, that is way cool!"" There's not much actual story and the film certainly never pulls you in the way Roshomon does (a film some have compared with Hero, although it's a very superficial similarity). But the film is so stunning from one moment to the next that I really don't care about any deficiencies of plot. This is a work of art and a piece of entertainment that has rarely been matched.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Masterpiece Of Cinema And A Prime Example Of Visual Storytelling,"Film is - obviously - a visual medium, but if I had to pick one piece of Cinema that exemplifies that like only few other movies do, it would be HERO. The film is all images, all movement, all colors; it's all show - not just tell, and it demonstrates just what the art of visual storytelling encompasses when a maverick director such as Yimou Zhang does it at the peak of his game. Here he paints with celluloid like a master painter would with a brush, and the result is a movie of such breathtaking beauty the audience is often simply left in stunned awe. There are stories within stories in HERO, each with a different narrator and a slightly different perspective, and each storyline has its own color palette until all all the stories merge into one epic, multicolored tale. A masterpiece of Cinema, plain and simple, and one of the most outstanding films of the last 20 years.P.S.

Visual piece of art,"I have never been very keen on watching Chinese films. Hovever, I was told that this film would surprise me, and, it is true. It shows the story of a man who killed several assassins that wanted to kill the King of one of the seven territories in which China was divided.This plot leads us into several flashbacks, that play with different colors and songs, making the film visually attractive. Dividing the different theories in colors was a very good idea. On top of that, I like the actors, particularly Jet Li, who has done the best film in his career.However, as in many other Chinese films, the plot is too repetitive (as the one in ""House of flying daggers""), and if it wasn't for the artistic spectacle, the film must have been much shorter. I believe that not knowing the Chinese culture might make you loose some details, but the film could have had a better script.So, to sum up, I must say that this film is a visual spectacle that could have been one of the best films n history if it was accompanied by a better script.",7.0,Anonymous,History

One of the better modern genre flicks.,"As much as I love old material arts movies, I just can't seem to like any of the modern newer ones. The movies just don't do it for me it all, with neither its story, action or characters. But having said that, this movie still has plenty of value to it. It gets really saved and made interesting by a fine last 30 minutes, or so.I'm just not a big lover of wire fu at all. It makes the action so totally ridicules to watch and totally takes me out of a movie. This movie also has some incredible over-the-top action moments in it, which defies all the laws of psychics and gravity. While most people seem to just love this and are absolutely taken by the visual beauty of it, I'm absolutely annoyed by it. Besided, the action at times suffered from some poor editing, which made it hard to tell at times what was exactly going on.But the action is not just the only problem I had with this movie. It's story was still a much bigger problem for me. The movie is mostly being told in flashbacks but that's not all; it's constantly telling you about the main characters but as you soon find out most of the stories are not true at all and merely a device to confuse the enemy. It's fine if the movie did this once or twice but it constantly keeps doing this. After a while this caused me to not care for the story at all anymore, since I knew I couldn't thrust anything it told me and wouldn't reveal the real truth until its very end.And I admit, when its storytelling became more linear and I started to see what it was all leading up to, I finally got more and more into the movie. It was only then that movie finally became interesting and it was also then that the true motivations of all of the characters finally got revealed. I did not liked that for most part of the movie I had no idea who the good and bad guys and gals were and who I was supposed to feel and cheer for. The movie constantly confuses you with its storytelling and characters. You could call this a good and positive thing but I feel that in this case it worked out unnecessarily confusing and even annoying at times.But still, I see this as one of the better and more entertaining modern genre flicks. Even though the movie annoyed me at times, it also did still entertained me and it really wasn't a punishment to watch this movie. The movie, the story and its actions definitely do have its moments, though I still prefer an old fashioned, Hong Kong, material arts flick over this movie any day.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,History

A different kind of hero,"Hero is a very good film and well worth seeing for the beautiful and highly stylized fight scenes, which are superbly photographed. The philosophical concepts developed are also interesting. However, there is a disconnect between the fairly serious concepts of a real hero and the beautiful but fantasized fight scenes.Despite many people saying the flashbacks are like those in Rashomon that is not exactly correct. In Rashomon they deal with three different people's descriptions of an event, each favoring the individual speaking. The viewer is left to conclude what really happened for his or her self. This is what makes Rashomon a great movie.Hero's flashbacks go from a simplified deception to more or less what really happened, eventually resolving the ambiguities. In Hero the flashbacks and dialog develop a concept of what makes a real hero. It is an interesting concept of a hero; not exactly the usual one we see in typical American films.",7.0,Anonymous,History

As the story moved on with changes in the 'colour scheme' used in the movie, I began to change my opinion of the movie. I definitely loved the way Zhang chose to tell the story.

Empty Spaces,"Hero revels in wide open spaces; for the most part these are empty spaces, upon which the director can paint his vision. Or, rather, I should say his visions. In that way, Hero acts visually as those sand-boxes upon which calligraphy students practice their art. On a narrative level, calligraphy also serves as a useful point of reference - the 19 ways to write sword paralleling the Rashomon-like story.Unfortunately, despite the glut of ideas concerning politics (conquest as a unifying force), love (its sublime nature), and art (its ephemerality) among others the film lacks a center. It is un-focused and much like the landscapes depicted herein empty.Hero has no soul.Soul is, of course, intangible; yet the audience, if trained, can perceive it or the lack thereof. With its gorgeously composed and thematically colored shots, Hero lulls us with its beauty.Unfortunately, after a half hour we realize that, really, despite its ideological ramifications, there is nothing more to this film than surface.A beautiful and stylish surface can work, as it does in the work of De Palma, on its own to give the movie its soul. De Palma understands that (and so do other directors like Kurosawa, Tarantino to an extent, and Hitchcock). These directors understand that it is not what a movie is about, but rather how it is about it.Style is important, then.Yimou Zhang fails in that respect. Hero is not about style; it is about visuals. These are two distinct entities. Style encompasses mood, visuals, atmosphere, acting, direction, etc. Style is the whole package. Hero has the visuals, but lacks in every other category. The performances are wooden; the direction is static.The imaging of this world is beautiful, but, on its own, that cannot carry the film.Look at Kurosawa, who stylizes his pictures to perfection. Look at Kobayashi and Shinoda. These men meld a painterly visual sense with appropriate atmosphere, stylized acting, and impeccable direction. Watch Kwaidan, Ran, Hara-kiri, or Double Suicide and then watch Hero. The lack of soul will be apparent in the latter and so will the lack of skill.**Note: I saw the extended Chinese version of this film, thanks to a brother with an exuberant love of all things Asian; that film, at almost and hour and fifty minutes was tedious. The American version, cut to almost an hour and a half is probably a better movie but my criticisms would still stand, I think. Slimming the film down will not give it a center and focus it.",,Anonymous,History
"Think ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""","""Hero"" is by all accounts a very big if not huge movie with plaudits aplenty from critics and public. The film tells a sort of epic adventure fairy tale about an assassin (Jet Li) and a handful of cohorts who conspire to kill a king which is high melodrama Chinese style and not likely to have a great appeal to westerners. What sets ""Hero"" apart from most other martial art films is the spectacular locations, sets, costumes, music, CGI, and state-of-the-art production value. Lyric, beautiful, and very Asian, ""Hero"" will play best with fans of ""Crouching Tiger..."" who don't mind watching people flying around like Peter Pan while flailing away with their swords.

A beautiful painting first and foremost,"I watched Hero about five times but I never took it as a mere movie. Its story contents, historically and politically, may very well be questionable; I can agree on that without hesitating. The one thing however that seems to be without discussion is its tremendous visual beauty and amazing music score. I sometimes put in the Hero DVD just to listen to the music only.To get a broader view of the historical topic, the Chinese unification of the seven kingdoms under the emperor of Qin, the movie ""The Emperor and The Assassin"" by Kaige Chen may be taken into consideration as well. Yet when it comes to Chinese movie arts, Hero surpasses every Chinese movie I have seen up to now (not very many I have to admit).In contrast to other opinions I will not comment on the martial arts aspects, nor on symbolisms found all over the place. To me this movie simply represents a beautiful painting containing people moving and fighting, loving and deceiving. The painting is accompanied by one of the most wonderful Chinese music scores I have listened to so far.Hero clearly needs to be enjoyed, not discussed.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Lacked Passion,"Overall this was a good movie and I am glad to have seen it. But it just seemed to miss something. Namely passion. The 'fight' scenes were nicely choreographed and very beautiful but also very long and drawn out. They lacked a sense of urgency, I never felt that the 'hero' was in danger nor did I care.I found myself slowly falling asleep during the fight scenes, but then waking up during the conversations. Usually it is the opposite for me! And it was subtitled! The story itself was fine, but nothing out of the ordinary.6 of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Great movie,"The plot may be next average but this is no big deal for this movie as far as I see it.. There are at least four reasons for that:1. Hero is a gorgeous film. The imagery, colors and cinematography are stunning in every scene.2. The battle scenes are very good. No one believes that Chinese mythology's flying or walking on water but these scenes are so well crafted that I enjoyed them very much. And also there are some awesome conventional fight scenes - as when one of the assassins humiliates seven elite royal guards without unsheathing his spear.3. The kings army strategy is the most believable I have ever seen in a movie. In all other movies archers shoot a number of volleys and then hand to hand combat begins. Stupid. In contrast the king's archers in ""Hero"" will shoot dense flocks of arrows literally for days whoever they confront (even helpless civilians, academies, etc.) and after that infantry moves to clean whats (if any) left.4. Ziyi Zhang is so hot. For me the hottest actress. I never bothered to read the subtitles while she was on screen so I have little idea of her character (Moon).",9.0,Anonymous,History
Universal themes,"I gave it 7/10 just because I don't care that much for martial arts movies with a lot of needless fighting and choreographed encounters. But I do think that this was a better told story than Crouching Tiger, easier to understand. It also had universal themes, unifying a country, self sacrifice and warriors having to put down their swords to become leaders. These are not communist or socialist themes as some have said. Seems to me unifying a country was the theme of ""Manifest Destiny"" on this continent. I liked the story of Snow and Broken sword, seems to be it was truly their story more than nameless'. Also I liked the ending even though if was a little melodramatic.",7.0,Anonymous,History

In showing a brutal tyrant ( Qin Shi Huang or replace that with Mao Zedong ) is actually a good thing for 'our land' is blatant People's Republic of China apologists propaganda. So thinly veiled, it makes this movie unbearable and tasteless. The country in which this 'cartoon' was made doesn't even have basic human rights and this film advocates that system.

Incredible,"The scope of ""Hero"" is incredible, weaving together a tale that expands across a whole empire, different time periods and even different realities. Lush cinematography brings the world of Ancient China to life as a vast landscape of possibilities, punctuated by the adventures of poetic assassins and accented by strong colours that define differing perspectives of hidden narratives. Starting out as a simple story of a ""hero"" vanquishing assassins who were out to get the emperor, the story quickly delves into many layers of treachery as the constantly shifting narratives and relationships between the assassins of the past transform relentlessly to reveal a hidden plot behind the entire telling of the story. The emperor himself has a major and imposing presence that binds together all the stories as the centre point of the action. From a simple premise grows a lush, incredible and complex film. Well worth watching on the biggest screen you can find!",8.0,Anonymous,History
".. it is true, and I saw that her name was god......","Suffice it to say that I'm neither the first, nor will I be the last to mention or compare this to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but it makes the world easier to understand to group together certain things, and I have just the limited amount of scope or vision to fall back on such easy mnuemonic techniques. This is a beautiful film. It takes nearly all of the positive attributes of CT,HD and levels them up another notch. Along with the required complex and gravity defying (does gravity ever apply to the Chinese) choreography of the fighting and action scenes, the brilliant use of CGI (which normally drives plots instead of accentuating them), the tremendous acting by all, including the radiant Zhang Ziyi, and a wonderful plot that shifts in sequence, and perspective (Kane, no?) there a host of other little details that go almost unnoticed. Several sequences harked back to the very particular moves and actions that I remember from some of the classic kung fu movies of the 60's 70's and 80's.

"'Rashomon' meets 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'","HERO (2004) ***1/2 Jet Li, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Maggie Cheung, Ziyi Zhang, Daoming Chen, Donnie Yen. (Dir: Yimou Zhang) 'Rashomon' meets 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' Although foreign films are not my forte I do attempt to catch any buzz worthy flick no matter if it's subtitled or not. Attempting to broaden my cinematic horizons I was pleasantly surprised and rewarded with the latest Asian action flick cum romantic fantasy from master filmmaker Yimou Zhang ('Raise the Red Lantern').With a nod to Sergio Leone, the film begins with a stern faced warrior with No Name (literally called Nameless) played by stony stoic Li who sets out to assassinate the king of pre-unified China, Qin (Chen) for vengeance and freedom but in order to do so he must pass a series of basically Mother May I, in being allowed by the leader no less (!), to advance a number of paces after telling him the story of how he came to his plot to waste him and the only obstacle is the truth. Should he lie the king's armed soldiers  all awaiting for just the right time to do just that, will immediately kill him.Nameless has a vivid imagination and gets most of his story right in the way that he enlists a triumvirate of notoriously fierce swordsman (and woman) to join him in overthrowing the stranglehold of the emperor by jousting to the death (or so it would seem) to have him as a murderous proxy. What follows is the various viewpoints that is told several times a la Kurosawa's classic tale of chicanery 'Rashomon' where small details are changed and new layers are revealed.What is most striking about the film is the amazing production design by Tingxiao Huo and Zhenzhou Yi in displaying each summary in astounding primary colors  blue, red, yellow, white and green  that practically sear the viewer's corneas with such vibrancy and textures. Equally impressive is the beautifully rendered cinematography by Christopher Doyle and impeccable art direction by Tingxiao Huo. All are Oscar worthy candidates in arguably the most handsomely filmed epic in some time.Zhang has a commanding presence incorporating David Lean epic with Kurosawa's assured hand in presentation and character including the trio of fighters including Chiu Wai, Cheung and Yen, the former duo impassioned lovers who love the sword only slightly more than one another and the latter a quiet yet impressive marksman. Li adds his own flair with the atypical flights of fancy that echo 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' which have been all the rage lately in both Eastern and Western film and admittedly are running on fumes yet here they do add more to the story that seems fit.The battle sequences with literally thousands of the nastiest arrows ever set in a quiver are astounding in their CGI splendor and add visceral moments of anxiety as to where they will meet their targets.One of the year's best foreign films and best films of any genre for that matter.",,Anonymous,History

Charting the supposed unification of China, some of the scenes are very much over the top, especially the whole arrow bombardment mid-way through, was there every so many arrows in the same place at the same time?!

one of the  most beautiful films,"I really like the beautiful/colorful scenes and music in this film. Being the most successful commercial film in domestic(china) history, although there are many criticisms about it, I think it will get the positive admission at last. Some fans don't like it because they think the film praised the emperor who was really tyrannical and the film isn't artistic enough, but I think the reason is really ridiculous. Everyone knows the director is an artistic film director, and he never directs a commercial film before. But he made a big surprise to everyone. This film introduced a commercial way for Chinese film industry. Before that, every Chinese film is low budget and low box office revenue, including the director's own films. Many Chinese directors shoot their films for international awards, because the awards can bring back investment. If no box office revenue, how will the capitalist/company invest the film？ At last, the film Hero indicates a path: high budget, high revenue.",9.0,Anonymous,History
great film if you're looking for action,"Besides the great intensity of the action scenes, the movie contained much more. Action, romance, and history are all a part of this movie and how it is all sequenced together is well done.

Jet Lee's character is very well played as he goes through the movie portraying a man who actually could be a ""hero"". One con i may have is that the movie might have had some unrealistic areas.

Insidious,"Those who talk about the lush cinematography, well-blocked fight scenes, and other visual details of this film are correct. Visually, it is a stunning film.However, this is a pretty film with a deeply suspicious message at its center. The Emperor, who conducts offensive wars of genocide against neighbor kingdoms in the name of unity, and rules his own populace with cruelty and an iron hand in the name of order, has all of his actions rationalized and even glorified. The Emperor is also an unapologetic nationalist. In other words: having the streets run red with the blood of innocents is perfectly acceptable, even noble, as long as it is done in the name of unity and order.It is probably no coincidence that a highly authoritarian government noted for brutal crackdowns on dissent and offensive wars against neighbor states in the name of ""unity"" (like Tibet) financed a film that glorifies its most egregious behavior. Unlike so many in the West, this insidious message was no doubt not lost in Tibet or Taipei.",1.0,Anonymous,History
its a hero of a film,"After I saw crouching tiger hidden dragon, i knew that Hollywood was a load of rubbish nowadays. HEro takes not only action further but just the essence of human emotion that acton films usually lack(besides crouching tiger).The plot can be confusing sometimes, as the story folds around four warriors out to kill the king of Qin. Jet Li is excellent as a warrior with no name called Nameless, who is the one chosen to kill the king. THe story is told several times, in colours to highlight the new aspect shown to us. IT is also significant that the true scene in the finale is show in white, which in China symbolies death.Everything about this film is stunning. Even though the numerous techniques does feel like an excuse to show off the beauty of the film, you ignore that as you experience the feelings of these characters. Maggie Cheung looks stunning, and the scene with Ziyi Zhang in the woods is absolutely breathtaking. The music is beautiful (i put some of it on my ipod!) and the film captures what being a hero actually means. The only drawback is that it doesn't go at a straightforward pace, but the retelling of the stories only adds new dimensions to the story.JEt Li has made his best performance, and thank god, that this is not a dumb flick such as Enter the Dragon or something.

A visual feast,"Perhaps the most visually beautiful movie of the year. This epic tale of moral dilemmas, heroism and the legendary and supernaturally gifted swordsmen of the warring states before the unification of China, leaves you gasping with the sheer audacity of the artistry. The only real connection with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (which I'm afraid I personally found a little tedious) is the use of stunning imagery and landscapes to make, I suppose, what was traditionally a male-dominated film market - boys doing battle - appeal to women as well. But the similarity stops there - Hero is about moral paradoxes, self-sacrifice, difficult questions of leadership - but all handled in a sublime panorama of visual extravagance. A nameless official challenges the evil ruler. His skill in swordsmanship has been aided by the study of human relations, of calligraphy, of numerous other arts. We travel across China - the Viet-nam-like tropics with strange mountains, barren plains, breathtaking mountains, colossal palaces. The characters dress in a way that gives further clues as we see the story from different sides - green, yellow and red all having different symbolism. The one jarring factor is the dubious political message which smacks of justification for totalitarianism - with not only a wink to modern China but also to the United States and its expansionist foreign policy and the sort of justifications that Bush type administrations use. The film has possibly meddled with history in terms of the main characters and their actual moral fibre or real motives. In what has become a legendary injustice, the Disney/Miramax empire did not released Hero in the USA until February 2004 - fourteen months after it was released in Hong Kong, and a full year after it received an Academy Award and Golden Globe Nomination for Best Foreign Language Film of 2002 (a fact not highlighted in the promotional trailers and posters very much).",9.0,Anonymous,History

Stunningly beautiful film hides weaknesses,"Sumptuous is the word that springs to mind when watching this particular film, and it is truly stunningly beautiful to look at. The choreographed fight scenes between the Nameless Hero and the various would be assassins are spectacular, the stunning military scenes with the casts of thousands, the arrival at court etc leave you gasping for breath (the particular fight scene between Nameless and Sky in a very rainy and wet tavern is particularly stunning, even though virtually everything is various shades of grey!).It does, however, lose itself. Told in a series of flashbacks, there is little in way of character development. There are few opportunities to identify with any of the characters (with maybe the exception of Moon, Broken Sword's young servant) - consequently there is little in the way of emotional involvement. Final result is one of merely 'watching' rather than being drawn in. There are too many one on one fight scenes, particularly early on, and, wonderous though they are, I found myself thinking 'not another one' as Hero faced Snow yet again in combat.I may have been overgenerous with a 7 marking as I did leave disatisfied, but on reflection, it was spectacular to watch on a giant screen.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Narcissistic Chinese sherbet,"Nameless avenger gets access to the despised king of a Chinese kingdom a couple of thousand years ago. The aesthetic deliberations far outweigh the dramatic ones in 'Hero' which had the whole world at its feet when it opened.

But there are no ambitions beyond the coy titillating of the senses with a tiresome haute couture-ish, narcissistic exterior.

Most beautiful film ever made?,"Well maybe, maybe not, but there's no doubt it's something special. Right from the films opening moments through to the spectacular finale, Ying Xiong (Hero) manages to create both a sense of scale to equal Lord of the Rings while focussing on the individual stories of the central characters.Although this is advertised as Jet Li's film, and while he certainly has the lion's share of the action, the heart of this film belongs to Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Broken Sword) and Maggie Cheung (Flying Snow). Their romance, while not the main plot of the film, is by far the most intimate and intriuging part of a film which doesn't shy away from trying to link a story around its mind-blowing action sequences.Whether it achieves this is debatable, for while the Sword/Snow subplot has substance the main plot, although simply told, has its problems, especially as an audience trying to follow the story through subtitles may get slightly confused from time to time as to what exactly just happened. But just be glad the studio resisted the urge to dub it, for having the film in any language other than Mandarin would surely detract from it.Having said that though, the most compelling sequences are those where everyone shuts up and the astounding cinematography does the talking. Every fight scene from the golden autumn forest to the tranquil lake is beautifully choreographed and wonderfully shot. The film is told as a series of flashbacks, with each one having a different colour theme, such as Red, Blue, White and Green. But although this may sound like a gimmick to Western audiences, each colour represents an emotion in China and all the colour themes are just subtle enough so that, while still glaringly obvious, they act only as an aid to the story, rather than taking it over.This is an astonishingly beautiful film to look at and, although the central story is a little thin, fine performances and the aforementioned fight scenes mean this film is a cut above most martial arts films.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Beautifully shot but slightly unsatisfying...,"Anyone seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon? Great film. Anyone seen Hero? Not so great. Not bad, but not as good.

Sequence after sequence explains what has happened in the life of Nameless (Jet Li). This film is shot beautifully, with perhaps the best cinematography ever. Despite this, it feels slightly unsatisfying whilst being viewed. There is nothing particularly wrong with Yimou Zhang's effort, it just isn't great. And definitely not as good as it should have been. When looking at the poster advertising the film, it looks brilliant. But when watching it you'll find it's not as great.

Pretty picture but typical Hong Kong film,"The only reason why I am commenting is because this movie is currently opening all across the US.  I saw this movie about 2 years ago when I was on a business trip to Hong Kong.  First of all, I am not a fan of the martial arts film where people are flying all over the place, regardless how pretty it might seem.  Second, I generally like realism in my martial arts movies, although I love those Hong Kong martial arts movies from the 1970's and 1980's.  I can accept certain amount of exaggeration for action sake but not flying like Superman.If you like Crouching Tiger Hidden Tiger, then you should like this movie although the former movie, in my opinion, had more of a story than this movie.For those of you who do not know about Chinese history, around 500 BC to 300 or so BC, was called the warring states.  China had splintered into various feudal kingdoms with constant warfare being the norm.  Towards the latter part of this period, one kingdom began to dominate the others, which would eventually unify all of the feudal kingdoms.  Some of these kingdoms sent assassins to kill the future emperor of China.  One of the assassins is played by Jet Li.  His mission is to kill this new leader of this powerful kingdom.This type of martial arts movies have great cinematography but that is about it for me.  I am more partial to martial arts films such as Yojimbo or Game of Death.  Therefore, if you are like me and do not like martial artist flying like Superman, avoid it, but if you liked Crouching Tiger Hidden Tiger, then go see.  Better yet, go to your neighborhood Asian video store near you and rent it.  They should have it given this movie was release in other parts of the globe 2 years ago.

This had to be one of the most gorgeous movies to look at I have seen. The use of colors and the locations were just great. As if that were not enough it had a very good and emotional story to go along with it. The first part of the movie contains the most action as there are some good fight scenes plus other visual action scenes. The arrow scene and the fight between the two women in the orchid are both very well done. Then the movie shifts in more of a story mode as things are revealed and sacrifices made. The movie unfolds from different perspectives as the one known only as Nameless tells his story to the emperor. The characters all have some rather cool names as well such as Flying Snow and Broken Sword. The movie is a bit of a sad one, but it works very well.

very mixed feelings,"First of all I read several reviewers on this one and I think they really overrated this film. The movie obviously is a Crouching Tiger ripoff, in terms of style and action. I'd say it has much better visuals than Crouching tiger, but it pales in comparison when it comes to plot. There were many amazing visuals in this film (did I say that already? Well, it's because there really isn't much else). I found the story overly melodramatic, even laughably at times. The movie jumped into another long martial arts ""ballet"" way too many times. It reminded me of a musical, where the actors break into song 10 times too many and you find yourself actually bored by it at some point.

One of the best films so far this decade,"Some films are heavy on style and lack substance somewhat, other films have a lot of substance but lose out in the style department. Ying Xiong, however, doesn't lose out in either; it is the perfect fusion of style and substance.The story of the film, is most definitely secondary to the amazing visuals and stunning direction, but it is not incidental; the plot of the movie is also very important. The film is set in ancient China, which at that time was divided into seven kingdoms. The ruler of one of the kingdoms, Qin, has found himself under threat from assassins; the three greatest of which are named Sky, Broken Sword and Falling Snow; stupid names? Indeed. When a young man claims to have defeated all three of these martial art masters, he is summoned to the palace in order to tell the king his story. The way that the plot pans out very much resembles the classic Japanese film, Rashômon; in that several people end up giving their versions of events. The film switches back and fourth from past to present effortlessly, and manages to do it without being convoluted or confusing. The narrative of the film is very well structured in that way, and despite the relative complexity of the plot; the film never becomes challenging for the viewer; but that's not to say it isn't thought provoking either.If someone was to ask me what Ying Xiong was about, I would predominantly say sacrifice. All of the characters in the film sacrifice something, whether it be their love for another character, or their life for the cause that they believe in. Their actions are always explained, and nothing seems out of place or like it's happened by accident, which makes the story flow well and allows the film to be strong in the story department. The thing that will stick out in the viewer's mind once the credits role is without doubt the vibrant use of colour that Zhang Yimou delights in portraying. The fight scenes are spectacularly beautiful; they're well choreographed and extremely aesthetically pleasing. I'm not a fan of the use of slow motion in fight sequences as it detracts attention away from the action, but Ying Xiong manages to use slow motion in a way that it ends up being of benefit to the movie. Most of the time it looks fake, and like the movie is trying to be overly arty; but here it adds to the beauty.Ying Xiong is one a few films released so far this decade that is set to achieve classic status in years to come, and it demands that you see it, if only for that reason. This film is not one that you will want to miss.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Living Anime (If You're Into That Sort of Thing),"""Hero"" is a Chinese high-art film. It tells the story of a sword master (who is never named) who kills three assassins and goes to the king for his reward. But it is not quite so simple. There is intrigue here, exploring issues of trust and subterfuge.In essence, ""Hero"" is really a comic book. Not your average ""Green Lantern"", but from the anime genre of comic books, artistically done, beautifully drawn, intriguing in their own way. The film's characters are all symbolic avatars of emotion or thought or action, involved in fanciful fight sequences surrounded by a lush and beautiful landscape of scenery and set design. On set design alone ""Hero"" deserves an Oscar nomination.The problem with ""Hero"" is it serves a niche audience: those who favor such comics and anime features such as ""Gundin"" and others. It is not a particularly strong film beyond that. The fight sequences are overdone and so unbelievable as to be boring. The characters are really one-dimensional, and the plot is quite transparent.

Dig the change up and go rent it.,"Alright, since this came out in theaters a long time ago the question really is whether this film is a valuable ninety-six minutes of your life spent or if you should do something else, like drinking beer while you clean the garage. First off, this movie IS a lot like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon only because there are big kung-fu, sword and other really cool exotic weapons battles. Also, both have that epic flavor to them, you know like with the scenery and the music and costumes and all that talk about Zen and climbing the mountain and all. Oh yeah, everyone was Chinese. Other than that, at least to a good old boy like myself, that was about it. CTHD was a love story, but with a lot of martial arts. Hero is really more of, well, a hero story. So all of yall can quit comparing the two because they are apples and oranges. I like to keep my reviews short so here it is. To the Tobasco Kid this was worth your hour and a half time. I guess if you have half a brain you can follow it, and it keeps you interested until the end waiting to see what happens to the hero and the Emperor and the slow parts don't drag it down too much. My score: ""Go ahead and dig up the change and rent it while it is still in the primo section at the video store and don't wait for it to get downgraded to the regular DVD section (I think that is 4 stars of of 5 for DVD's)"". In my opinion, it is worth the $3.96 plus part of a Saturday afternoon. Just send the kids to their room to play Nintendo and tell the wife that you are trying to get more intellectual by watching foreign movies. Maybe they will leave you alone long enough to watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Ying xiong (2002),"First things first I guess I should state that Eastern films are not my ""thing"", I haven't viewed many films from Asia, the last film I saw in a cinema from this genre was the hugely successful 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. I am not one of these movie fans that saw that and all of a sudden knew everything about these kind of movies!!!!!""Hero"" was flawed in places but it has to be said that it was probably the most beautiful looking film I have seen in the cinema in 2004. The cast do an okay job though I wasn't impressed by Jet Li in the movie, I'm not a fan of his anyway. I thought the key factors in this film was the direction, photography and good support cast.I was surprised with the amount of people who who were in the cinema laughing EVERY time the fights had flying etc in them! Did they not expect this? Mind you exactly the occurred happened when I saw C-T-H-D!""Hero"" is a film I would urge the world to see!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,History
An action film far better than anything the West can concoct...,"Now, when I heard that critics were saying that this film is even better than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon I imediately thought NO WAY.My god, was I very, very wrong.I loved CT,HD. I loved the way it looked, the way it was choreographed, the way the actors delivered their performances, the way it made my soul soar away and wish that I could do the things they could do. Now enters a film that does this all of this, but even better.I found it quite amusing that there are effects in this film that are almost the same as in The Matrix sequels (moving in slow-mo through the rain and so) and yet this Hero does it even better. In The Matrix I was laughing my arse off. In this I was awe-struck.This film is intelligent as well. It knows what its message is and it delivers it with clear precision: You have to sacrifice everything for the greater good. The stories told are separated clearly through the clever use of colour coding (red, green, blue and white) so there's little to get confused about at the end, provided that you've paid attention. There is an unhappy truth in this film: those who deal with death and destruction do not generally live. Hence the sad end of the film (my mum, bless her, said that she thought the end was pointless).Now, for those of you who are going to see this film with a retarded prejudice against all things Chinese, just remember this: Chinese takeaways are far better than pizzas, despite being heavy, oily and goddamn tasty.",,Anonymous,History
Likable,"As far as these types of movies go, I would say that ""Hero"" is probably one of the better ones. Miles ahead of ""Crouching Tiger"".Jet Li looks very good in his role and does a magnificent job with the action sequences. I think it is neat that he remains nameless throughout the film. His character is really driving the movie as he really does look like a hero up against insurmountable odds. Zhang Ziyi is again typecast in the same role that US movie goers identify her to be in. She is on par in the role as usual.The sound and music in this movie are very fitting and assist the battle scenes. The colors are amazing throughout the picture. Whether a scene be mostly done in blacks and grays, or mostly reds and oranges, or any different colors, they always look beautiful. The shot with the arrows is a very memorable one.This movie is second to ""House of Flying Daggers"", and is worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Chinese enchantment and beyond,"A splendid magical work of cinematic calligraphy, beautifully authentic watermarks, and a dream of spellbinding cinematography, Hero is a movie soaked in a captivating Chinese spirit that never fails the viewer at any time, the story of an ambiguous warrior and his memories in defeating three infamous assassins, but it doesn't stop there and will surely take you far beyond your boundaries and will emotionally sway at many major points, and will arouse imminent feelings of passion, grieve and glory. The directing is superb, succeeded in carrying out the visuals intact with the storyline and the acting which is not quite solid but fair enough for the atmosphere, and I'd advise you to watch it in Mandarin and use English subtitles, it will feel more original. Hero is a movie that happens only in thoughts, so it wouldn't be wise to always refer to reality, for example the incredible fighting scenes are hard to believe but if you'd imagine yourself dreaming of it, it will get closer to your mind, watch it with your heart and you'll certainly enjoy it. Overall, hero is a must see to all enchanting marital arts patriotic spirited movie lovers, I know this isn't a category, but I certainly recommend it, and remember to feel what you see and most important of all to acknowledge the meaning of a Hero in the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A stunning display of cinematography and action!,"This is a film from Director Zhang Yimou about the King of Qin (Daoming Chen) planning to conquer all six kingdoms under his rule in feudal China, and three warriors plot to assassinate him. However, a prefect named Nameless (Jet Li) claims to have eliminated all three assassins and recounts to the emperor how he did it.The events of the movie's plot are told in different point of views in how Nameless claims he eliminated the warriors to the unraveling of the assassins' plot and the true course of events. This made the story interesting, making the audience eager to know what is truly happening on screen; however, I thought that the overall movie lacks momentum and suspenseful plot points, making the story drag at times - especially during the subplot of warriors Broken Sword (Tony Leung) and Flying Snow's (Maggie Cheung) relationship.The setting of the breathtaking buildings and structures was done in beauty and splendor and the costumes used for the cast were elegant. The sword-wielding fights were thrilling to watch, choreographed beautifully, the acting was dramatic (if a little emotionless at times) and the cinematography was stunning.From another reviewer's viewpoint (thank you aeo) China was a country that was split into several warring feudal kingdoms, and, in the movie, I suppose the King of Qin was trying to unite all kingdoms under his rule for lasting tranquility and prosperity. However, I didn't think that that plot device was emphasized enough in the movie and made it seemed that the King was just one power-hungry evil leader and we were asked to sympathized with the assassins (naturally, portrayed by leading popular Chinese actors Jet Li, Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yuen and Zhang Ziyi), who I guess were technically supposed to be the real antagonists. ***spoiler ahead*** Therefore, it kind of gave the movie a bummer ending when some of the assassins met a not-so-positive fate. ***spoiler ends***Overall, though, it's a pretty good historical action film.Grade B-",7.0,Anonymous,History
Stupendously overrated movie,"I was looking forward to this movie. Folks who had talked about ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" (both far superior films, by the way) had lauded this movie as though it was the next coming of ""Star Wars.""The plot, what there is to speak of, seems to center around a humble ""prefect"" (which apparently means mind-numbing assassin in the time period in which the movie takes place) who had executed three assassins that had formerly threatened the king. Something that is blatantly obvious from the beginning of the film is the intense ""evil"" of the king, the likability of the assassins, and the intense boredom which is Jet Li -- all of this contributes to the complete ""I don't care"" attitude of the viewer (me). The plot unfolds in flashback style as Jet Li regales the king in what can only have been the worst story ever told. He hunts down the assassins for about five minutes, then fights each of them for about 8 hours. I suppose if you're the kind of person who likes to watch someone else play Street Fighter II for hours, this is your kind of movie.A lot is made of the artistic side of this movie. OK, I admit, there are lots of water droplets, leaves, and guys and gals flying around on cables. In a movie like ""Crouching Tiger..."", you might be inclined to be so drawn into the movie where you don't notice or you may even buy in to it, as we all buy the laser and jet sounds in space in Star Wars. In a movie where you notice these kinds of things-- well, it seems fake and contrived. And they don't look very good, folks-- Especially the scene with the rain of arrows. The billowy cloths were nice though, though I can't say they served some purpose other than to be cool or billowy.Finally, if you manage to survive the intense displeasure of watching the movie in English (as opposed to English subtitles), you'll notice that all of the voice actors seem to have attended the Hayden Christiansen International School of Acting Really Hard. Money well spent, folks.The DVD commentary, if I could write it, would go a little like this: ""Well, I couldn't really come up with a reason to have everyone fight one at a time, so I just had everyone stand around and look real intense like they were fighting with their MINDS! Intense, huh? Then, I had Jet Li mercilessly beat the crap out of somebody backstage to get all of his emotions out of him before he came into the studio. This was important, since I couldn't get him to act so boring without it.""Personally, I liked this movie better when it was called Wrestlemania XII.",3.0,Anonymous,History
A 'Hero' to fight for,"In the year 2000, Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was released in America, and unexpectedly found blockbuster success. Who would have thought a Chinese-language martial arts epic set in ancient times, featuring characters walking across water, flying through the air, and fighting on tree branches would have ever gone on to gross over $125 million in the U.S. alone? Audiences embraced the beauty and magic of the film, and hopefully they will do the same for ""Hero,"" a film that's no less amazing.""Hero"" seems to exist in the same world as ""Crouching Tiger"" does, a world where skilled warriors can battle over a vast sea, with only a slight touch of the water needed to balance them. A world where enemies don't have to fight physically, but can challenge each other simply in their minds. It's also a world where an onslaught of arrows launched by a formidable army can be stopped by the deftness of two swords. If you can't accept this world as believable, or if you can't accept the thought of reading subtitles for a good hour and 45 minutes, then by all means, go see ""Anacondas."" Jet Li escapes his American prison of Joel Silver-produced action movies to star as a nameless warrior in ancient China, determined to protect the ruler of the Qin Dynasty from three master assassinsSky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung). The film unfolds in flashbacks, as the nameless one details to his majesty how he was able to defeat his deadly adversaries. If you think I just ruined the film for you, relaxthere's a lot more to the story than that.What follows is multiple accounts of the same series of events, all involving the aforementioned characters, as well as Moon (Zhang Ziyi), Broken Sword's apprentice. Academy Award nominated director Zhang Yimou and cinematographer Christopher Doyle use different color pallets to differentiate each version, including lush hues of red, blue, green and white. It's tough to put into words just how great ""Hero"" looks on screen. That vision is something that must be experienced firsthand, especially in a gorgeous duel between Cheung and Ziyi, set in an autumn-like environment complete with powerful gusts of wind and vivid red and bright orange leaves.The scenery isn't the only beautiful element of ""Hero."" All the swordplay is spectacular and expertly captured on film by Yimou (""Raise the Red Lantern""), which is surprising, considering his inexperience as an action director. The performers all move with the swiftness and grace of a ballet troupe, albeit a dangerous one, armed with swords and staffs and knives. The acting performances are just as expertly choreographed, proving how adept Yimou is at dramatics. Cheung and Leung stand out the most, thanks to their meaty subplot as rivals and lovers. The duo are incendiary together, setting off fireworks on screen with their radiance and chemistry.The film's only downfall is its pacing, which most likely can be attributed to the script. Since the story is told through flashbacks, it does get repetitive and overlong at times, and the transitions between the past and present become a bit jarring. However, that detail is minor at best, and does not detract from the film's magic. ""Hero"" is an epic accomplishment all around, and it's a mystery why the folks at Miramax have kept it on the shelf for so long (it was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2002 Academy Awards). Comparisons to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" are inevitable and well-deserved. Hopefully ""Hero"" will be able to find the audience it deserves, just as ""Crouching Tiger"" did.",9.0,Anonymous,History

What i needed to make number 48 was something truly exceptional; Hero was exactly that.With respect, nothing in this Earth is perfect; 9.999 is about as close a rank i can give Hero. What i thought would be a re-run of 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' turned out to be an unbelievable experience that has raised the bar clean out of sight. A nameless warrior (Jet Li) is given time alone with the Great King to recount how he killed the three most deadly assassins in the land: Sky, Broken Sword and Flying Snow. With each story told the entire movie expands and contracts as multiple events eventually come together by the end, and what happens in between will break your imagination. The cinematography is something that inspires and amazes; you find yourself in awe that such beauty could be created on screen; the fights are expertly choreographed, directed and edited; the high wire methods allow for some of the worlds best fight scenes ever committed to screen. The movie creates it's own myth; shrouded in an invisible sheen of the stuff of legends. Some of the major army battle scenes force the viewer to go temporarily numb (Sky and Flying Snow take on the 3000 bodyguards as they launch their assault on the King's fortress/ the hundred thousand arrows ripping into a small calligraphy school as Li and Flying Snow try their best to shield Sky) What you see here is something you will find yourself watching over and over again, seizing the same amount of emotion that you did the first time, because no matter what, a Hero's spirit never dies.9.9/10 ***** A* Buy the DVD and experience true brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful and visually stunning throughout with an excellent story.,"Interestingly for this film I walked in not knowing what the story for this would be. Usually the trailer gives everything away of the movie (see Aliens vs Predator for the entire story of the film in only one minute), however this trailer actually gave me a totally different idea from the movie. This ended up being just as bad for me as I was a bit disheartened at the beginning, but that didn't last.The tag lines are flying all over the place for the PR, ""...most beautiful movie ever made..."", etc. Well they really aren't wrong; this really is visually stunning and is just a joy to watch. The locations, the costumes, the movements of the actors, it's just all so luxurious on the eyes.Talking of the actors, the quality is superb. For me, Jet Li wasn't the strongest, it was by far Tony Leung Chiu Wai as Broken Sword, followed by the very intimidating Daoming Chen, the King of Qin. Excellent jobs!Story wise, well I really am not going to summarise this movie, not that It'll spoil any plots, it's just that there isn't an easy way to do it credit in a short blurb. It's an excellent story however, and although you never really know what happened for definite, the journey is what makes this such a great movie.That, and of course, the beautifully filmed fight scenes. They are stunning, with some superb wirework that just rises above what has been seen in similar movies. Each single scene for the fights seems to have been thought of from a cinematic experience, and there is never a case where the fighting is there for the sake of it, each is there for a dramatic reason.The story plays out from multiple viewpoints, each presenting a different slant on the history leading to the opening point of the movie, and which do you believe?The beauty, I thought, is that all this just continues to build tension to the point you've been waiting for early on in the movie. The tiniest detail of the film represents a great moment, and the sparse dialogue helps to highlight each of these to perfection.I would thoroughly recommend this, it really is as it is billed, a spectacular movie. However, don't go expecting Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the story here is very different, and although there are a few similar themes, the story plays out very differently and is filmed in a very different way. Also, listen for the superb Japanese Drumming group in the soundtrack.Excellent movie, a must buy on DVD when it is finally allowed to be released  check out the original date of this movie release in the Far East!",9.0,Anonymous,History
best meets worst.,"I don't know what it is about foreign films from China and Japan, but they all seem that they are all trying to live up the the greatness that is Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Not that this movie was bad, but that all of the movies that keep pouring out of the east all seem to just be generic.I think the worst thing about this movie, all together was the way it was the water fight scene. The idea that they were using their swords to balance on the water, well it kind of make me think about a cartoon my cousin was watching. The idea that some one could use a sword to balance themself was kind of strange to me. The running on water I could kind of believe. Other then that, the battle scenes were okay.Now the biggest problem with the movie is that some people could not understand it. I know I did since I've read up on martial arts and am not a complete moron, I saw some people leaving to movie muttering ""I have no idea what just happened."" So if you have a small attention span or no idea how to follow a story with out an explosion or two... don't see this movie.I gave it a 7/10 because the idea has been done before, but the story was compelling.",,Anonymous,History
A Great Movie,"This movie combines martial arts with, a well written storyline and plot, and great actors. The director also did an awesome job at it. The storyline is very well written and very interesting. I love the way that they portray the characters in the different roles. The action sequences are very cool, and the movie has great special and visual effects. The sensuality is very mild and last for a total of about two minutes tops. Jet Li portrays a nameless character who has something very secret planned along with some other people. But I will not let you know for if I did you wouldn't enjoy the movie! The mystical Chinese jumps and flying things are in this but it very much works with the plot and storyline. The screenplay is also very well written and with the DVD you can choose to have it's spoken language in English instead of Chinese. This movie in about every aspect is a great and awesome movie.

Wonderful exploration of issues -- pity about the translation!,"First things first -- while I enjoyed the movie tremendously with its alternative take on the concept of the Hero with its various possibilities played out through the different scenarios, I was also horribly annoyed by the gratuitous display of flying / floating figures in the film. It's time we moved on from Crouching Tiger!On the subject on the concept of the Hero, I wouldn't attach any political reading to the narrative of this movie though. What this movie really illustrates, perhaps, is that what heroism is really about is making a choice, being true to your beliefs, and taking your beliefs with you right to the very limit. This is perhaps what makes the rather unique genre of wuxia films rather universal in this regard.This being a 'Chinese' movie with a rather unique cultural setting, it is perhaps understandable that certain aspects of Zhang Yimou's filmmaking have been 'hidden' in cultural barriers...*caution: rather unfamiliar cultural references to be made next*One example of this is the motif of the wind. While this is more visible visually then as a metaphor, it did not help that 'all hail! all hail! all hail!' was chosen as the translation for 'feng' (i.e. the Chinese noun for wind). However, this reference may also be taken as an allusion to the Chinese 'feng chen', which may be loosely translated as 'happenings in the world around us'.Many other instances of culturally obsolete constructions abound. Unfortunately there may not be a better translation ever, or a 'Chinese Culture 101' guide handy when you watch a film. Kinda sad that an intelligent film is lost to a large audience this way.",7.0,Anonymous,History

beautiful but story in second half problematic,"China is divided in seven warring states. The ruler of the Kingdom of Qin intends to forcibly unite the states in bloody battles.

With no family name, he worked to become the greatest swordsman. He supposedly killed the three assassins and allowed to approach the king. First he kills spearman Sky (Donnie Yen). Then he stokes jealousy between Broken Sword (Tony Leung) and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) with Sword's apprentice Moon (Zhang Ziyi).This is undoubtedly beautifully shot. It's a thing of supreme artistry. The battles are colorful ballets. I like very much the story in the first half. There is a twist that becomes very obvious. Then the second half starts taking more turns. Not all of them are to my liking. I was expecting a different path and I believe a superior path.

"the new China's ""hero""","The movie Hero has all the elements to appeal to two types of audience--some of the new Chinese middle class who are actually proud to be Chinese because of their nationalistic education and new wealth, and the sinophilles in the western world that surged in numbers post-crouching tiger hidden dragon, who either seeks thrill in Kungfu movies or in the exoticism of oriental culture/girls/customs or all of the above. As a poor student from Hongkong I do not qualify to be part of the target audience, and am quite disappointed by the filmmaker's misuse of a kickass cast, a large budget, and many interesting aspects of Chinese culture/history.There are many cool concepts that were put into the movie, but are almost always mishandled: For example, the crossbowmen scene--the interesting posture the archers use to tighten their crossbow string was actually depicted in ancient military illustrations. Yet it was immediately marred by the horrible special effects showing the arrows flying into the city--which was too much exaggerated and definitely not nicely done. The use of different monotonal color schemes for different sections of the movie is also a very cool idea, but some of the monotonous building interior are simply ugly. The custom design is extravagant but have neither originality nor historic accuracy. The Qin soldiers rather looks like they are borrowing customs from the roman infantry in the ""Gladiator"".Extolling the ""hero"" (Jet Li), who gave up the chance to kill the tyrant of Qin as he was convinced that Qin Dynasty would unite the whole China (which it did, if only for a few decades) and give the people peace (which it did not, nor was it likely the emperor's intention), director Zhang Yimou unnecessarily sings along with the political agenda of the Chinese government--to unite Taiwan with the People's Republic. The movie lauds the role of the Qin dynasty in uniting China, while ignoring the fact that Emperor Yinzheng was without doubt a tyrant--he enslaves people for his vast building projects, burnt books and buried intellectuals who disagree. Such things are of course encouraged to be forgotten in the new China, because analogous crimes are still being committed by the current government.Hero's strong nationalistic sentiment and lack of taste might not be felt by the average western film-goer seeking a good kungfu fight scene or some artsy cinematography in an oriental setting. For everybody elsethe earlier film ""the Emperor and the Assassin"" offers far superior treatment of the same story and is in every aspect (plot, customs, acting, cinematography, customs, sets--and the characters are actually human beings with emotions, not robots talking about building empires or fighting for humanity) a far better movie.Were ""hero"" mainland China's answer to Ang Lee's ""Crouching tiger"", it is a very pathetic one. Sadly, though the film hardly gets any enthusiastic response from Chinese communities inside/outside mainland china, it is still a reflection of a force in contemporary Chinese culture that is rather twisted: a tendency to de-emphasize human conditions while glorifying national greatness and material wealth.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Breathtaking epic!,"I am not familiar with the genre which this movie represents, so I am not competent to comment on how well it works -- or doesn't work -- within its constraints.However, I have a long background in appreciating samurai movies (well, that dates me!) so I relate to this movie from that perspective.With those caveats, let me say uniquivocally that this is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen!Each frame is exquisite, yet the human dimension is not overwhelmed by the emphasis on color and composition. I certainly was moved by the death of the lovers and by Nameless' stolid fatalism at the end.Quite frankly, I was so in wonder at this movie that I think my mouth was open in astonishment during the entire film.It had the emotional depth of opera, dance, and the greatest war epics like Ran. It's use of CGI may have been wanting to some aficionados of that technique, but I thought the overwhelming forces produced by these effects compared favorably to those in Lord of the Rings.The fight scenes were perhaps too dance-like for some, but for me, they were a transporting experience.Well, I should stop gushing.

Visually stunning,"I went to see 'Hero' having read some negative comments on the script/plot line. Fortunately those fears were unfounded - Hero is a visually stunning epic. The choreography and photography are first rate, with some truly unforgettable scenery and martial arts.The multiple flashbacks a la Rashomon could be confusing, but thankfully the careful use of colors to ""mark"" each version of events helps to keep the momentum going. Admittedly Jet Li is a bit distant for a leading character, but this is a relatively minor quibble.Anyhow, this is more than compensated for by a show-stealing performance by Maggie Cheung. She delivers a whole spectrum of emotions (from passion to cold murder) with great screen presence, and the heartbreaking scenes at the end were perfectly handled.All in all, a masterful performance. Let's hope the upcoming House of Daggers manages to deliver to this level of quality acting and filming!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Really Good,I am not a big fan of martial arts films. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is really the only one I liked before Hero. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was a masterpiece and one of the best films of 2000. It had a great story and was very powerful. It was also one of the most beautiful films ever made. The Cinamotogaphy is just stunning. Hero is while not anywhere near as good as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon but is just as beautiful if not even more. The cinematography is is some of the best ever. The art direction and costume design are also similar. The performances are mostly fairly wooden but Ziyi Zhang is wonderful in a small roll as a great warriors maid. What a beautiful film. Hero is wonderful and one of the greatest martial arts films ever just behind Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.,8.0,Anonymous,History
This movie do not deserve such high score,"As you may not know, most Chinese people don't like this movie.for the first reason, real Chinese don't speak like in the movie, a real Chinese assassin wouldn't act that way, and real Chinese emperors and assassins don't think that way.for the second reason, a Chinese could see easily from this movie that the story, the lines and the kungfu were designed particularly for western people, especially Americans.The colours are like too much fat and oil in food, they are totally non-sense. Silk in the palace is only a meaningless symbol, assassins wear that, they make love in that, they fight in that, but, what difference will it make for them to wear plain cloth, to make love in bed, or to fight in an arena???Although the pictures were shot quite beautifully ,kungfu was exciting and we can see digital technology which is never seen in movies from China mainland, the story, the lines and the ideas Zhang Yimou wanted to tell us is nonsense.",,Anonymous,History
a confrontation between the good of one and the good of many....,"If i had to give this movie a one word rating i would label it gripping. At times i felt that it did propel forward at a less then desirable pace, however this made what some might call a bit of exaggeration, seem more artistically refined. Definitely one great film with an excellent story so I understand why it's rated as high as it is here, (which i will admit was one of the larger contributing factors to me seeking out this film).What i found particularly strange about this movie is that i really didn't care how it ended. I put that much trust in the goal of the main character. Ironically, at the beginning of the movie i found myself doubting its high rating because of some rather iffy dialogue and exaggerated fighting, but then i came to realize that the power of some lines were probably lost during translation so i couldn't fault the movie for that and the fighting is still acceptable. So as the story progresses it becomes so engrossing, that i stopped asking questions and picking it apart. I just wanted to truly understand the vision of ""Hero"" in it's entirety.I will not try to pretend to understand the culture of ancient china or any of the symbolism in this movie, but i will say this. The director seemed to use colour to express certain theatrical emotions and I believe this idea was implemented most excellently. One particular scene that comes to mind is the fight with the King and Broken Sword during a flashback. As he approaches the kings palace,both him and snow are dressed in pale green garb and so are many silk drapes that decorate the area. This, plus the fact that the many soldiers that surround them are wearing dark colours allow for the effect to be well, quite effective. Just one example, but there still remain quite a few scenes like this, easily making Hero a very visually emotional accomplishment.There are some things i didn't like about the movie. I wasn't simply astonished from the fight scenes like i would've liked to have been. I didn't like this ""floating"" fight style very much in Crouching Tiger and i don't really like it that much in this film, either. For some reason even though they really try to make you see it as graceful, blending so many mini angles to achieve a sense of motion does the exact opposite for me and i see the scenes in pieces and it bugs me. using wires i believe can and has been done better, but that's just one trade off i can deal with.I noticed i didn't go into detail about the story but thats because many reviews here already have and i believe your should just watch the movie to determine whether or not you like it. I, personally think Hero is a great movie with a story that will draw you in, pick you up, and leaving you feeling emotions right along with the characters. I would recommend this to anyone interested in a movie with heart and a passion for honor, coupled with some good visual effects.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful Fantastic Film,"A defense officer, Nameless (Jet Li), was summoned by the King of Qin regarding his success of terminating three warriors.This film is very much in the style of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", with the bright colors and flying warriors. The ""dance"" effect is somewhat toned down, but fans of one will no doubt be fans of the other.

Ebert knows what he is talking about, and Tarantino was wise to get this film a wide showing in the United States.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Very Pretty,"I went to see this movie to see what all the fuss is about. I don't get it. OK, it looks pretty. But as a story - zzzzzzzzzzz. This one came across as a bit of a propaganda-flick promoting the idea of one ""great"" leader.Every scene is SOOOOOOOOOO slow, and this is down to the simplistic nature of the story. A 5 year old would be bored by this story line. You could have told this story in 10 minutes. The whole thing is very stylized, photography, acting etc. And ooh look, people can fly (in a very silly way).Not only was the story slow and simplistic, but it didn't seem to make an a lot of sense. The whole thing is one, gigantic, drawn out, spectacular, anti-climax. The characters behavior was either obvious or absurd.No, it's not for me - and I honestly can't see what people find entertaining about these films.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing first impressions - with a bitter political after taste,"Stunning images, great use of soundtrack and sound effects with many a vain-heroic, fatal charge onto a sharpened blade. With one exception the characters are mean, one dimensional, selfish failures. Moon alone stands out with integrity and consistency. Perhaps this was the only opportunity the director dared take to get across a humanistic message. But in the end Moon is also abused by the party machine as she urges Nameless to rethink his plans to assassinate the murderous King/Communist Party. Without her character this movie is pure Communist Party propaganda = suffering, cruelty, sacrifice and oppression are acceptable for the 'greater good'. So Tibet and all Chinese democrats can expect to be obliterated for the sake of National Unity. Taiwan should also be worried. Academics can expect to be visited by a mighty army and destroyed just like the calligraphy school. I fact, the military extras were all drawn from the Red Army! It's an epic and operates on a grand scale - enjoy it for the visual spectacle and sounds and very long hair. Try, if you can, to avoid thinking about the message and its sinister undertones.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"An martial arts movie you need to watch, even if you dont enjoy martial arts.","The use of colour to tell different perspectives about an event has been done beautifully. Combined with the mastery of great camera work and light makes this a movie you can't miss one shot off. Every image has been shot like it's a painting, and as a result this film is stunning to look at. Also, the editing has something great about it, it fluently moves between different story lines that jump in time. Never have I been distracted or confused with this relative difficult story structure.As a martial arts movie it also succeeds in every aspect of its genre. The fight scenes are choreography beautifully and remind me of classic martial movies like Crouching tiger hidden dragon.Even if you dont enjoy martial art films I would recommend this movie pure for the experience.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Movie, Hero","The most thing I loved about this movie was how the outcome was at the end of the movie, I found out that the assassins that Nameless was going to take on were going to help him escape the Emporer power over him, but Nameless was killed in the end. Also how they had a lot of martial arts action and the fighting scenes were very interesting to watch over and over again. One thing that I did not like was that Sky had to die right in the beginning and show up in the end and he was the only one who used a spear and his motion with it is just so swift and steady. He would have been a big help in the movie if he was still alive. One of my favorite parts in the movie was when Nameless and Snow were defending the school, it was amazing how they blocked the arrows and hoe Snow was using her robe to stop the arrows. She was my favorite characters in the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A visionary masterpiece!,"Following the success and pure class of Crouching Tiger, there was a long wait for something as good to find its way over to the states, but now it has. Hero is an exceptional piece of film-making from director Yimou Zhang. The film is a lush and gorgeous piece of art that makes Crouching Tiger look like an ugly sibling, hidden away in the basement being chucked scraps of raw cow. Now this is quite something because Ang Lee's visionary epic was itself a very gorgeous film. Everything that Lee's film had going for it is right here with Zhang's film, from the gorgeous cinematography through to the wonderful production design, costumes, score and an engaging story full of philosophy, myth, religion and history. Which of the two films is better? Well it's a tough one to call. Both films have their strengths over the other but for me Crouching Tiger would narrowly pip this to the most because Hero's story becomes a little convoluted as it goes on. Also Crouching Tiger did have Chow Yun- Fat in it too.Hero stars the one and only Jet Li. Li is not known as a great thespian and it was essential that, being primarily a martial arts star, aside from the ass kickery, he had to hold his own against some great actors, such as Tony Lueng. Li's understated performance is excellent. It's a very stoic role but it requires a performance to come from within. It has to have the same power hat Bruce Lee gave in Enter The Dragon and Chuck Bronson did in Once Upon A Time In The West. Li pull's it off, it's a performance of real restraint and inner power and he looks a far cry from his wooden persona in Hollywood pap like Cradle 2 The Grave and The One. He is almost a narrator in the story and is the centre piece and Li was not the initial choice for the film. A more respected actor was wanted for the part, like Chow Yun-Fat, but Li thoroughly rules his role and makes this part his own. Tony Leung steals the movie though. Leung is fantastic a really great performance adding the gravitas that Chow did in Crouching Tiger. He is a great actor, right up there with Chow and deservedly was recognised in the HK film awards. Also starring is Maggie Cheung. Cheung is fantastic as well and unbelievably gorgeous. She made me want to break down and cry at the glorious creation of womanhood, and simultaneously go at it with myself in the cinema screen, but the threat of arrest was just about enough of a deterrent. You can sit and merely marvel at her gorgeousness with the sound turned down. Not far behind in the yummy stakes is Zhang Zhiyi who also starred in Crouching Tiger, she is also superb in this.The action in this film is brilliant including a fantastic martial arts fans' wet dream showdown between Jet Li and Donnie Yen. All the action scenes have a specific tone to follow and have certain colours affluent throughout the scene that will represent things like truth, courage and honour. The action looks amazing and beats that of Crouching Tiger in sheer imagination. At the same time this has a remarkably toned down Jet Li in the action, it's all very minimalist with his movements and doesn't utilize his fantastic kicking ability as much as other films have. The action shows Li as an ultimate fighter who does maximum damage with minimum effort. Also the action is far more weapon orientated than most of Li's other films. There are some great sequences here and understandably Quentin Tarantino was a big advocate for the film and whose determination almost solely got the film it's long awaited US release.This is arguably the film of the year and is a joy to behold. It's another lesson to Hollywood about doing an epic with subtlety and an action film with heart, and a drama with true power on a fraction of those inflated budgeted American star vehicles. Not to be missed. *****",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Best I have see with Jet Li,"I admit there are a few aspects of a film that can make us ask ourselves about defining oneself. After I saw Hero, it turned out to be everything I didn't expect in this film. The way the mood of the film is heartwarming. No one can ever create another film such as this. I don't know why a film like this was never shown before but it is truly a masterpiece and a must see. Great martial arts and great acting from the cast. If I ever meet the director, I would clearly bow down and be honored to meet him. Anybody who reads this should really see this film because no matter what others say about the film, don't listen and see it for yourself. No one should say it is bad film because they have to prove it first.",,Anonymous,History

Well, more like seeing a story from a different view-point, more of which are shown later on.The colours are simply stunning, as are the settings, scenery, direction, sound, and editing.A use of slow-motion techniques shows raindrops falling, close encounters with weapons, or ballet-like swordfights.Colour is used to convey emotion or a point of view across an entire scene, from silks to costumes, to the colour of leaves on a tree.A delight for the senses, and leaving you wishing more ""World"" cinema made it's way into movie theaters to displace films produced on the Hollywood production line.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Second Time Is Charming,"I have to say that after watching this in the theatre the first time, about a year and some ago, I would have given it a 6.5 or 7.5, I generally rate a film not on it's production value, rather, I consider the emotional pull it has. I believe this was, in part, due to the fact that I was too consumed with the cinematography and design, both are overwelmingly beautiful! Seriously, I would love to make posters of the frame grabs. The story, acting, directing (to some extent), and emotion was lost on me. This was before purchasing the DVD last night and watching it for a second time.While watching it a second time, I was able to be completely drawn in to the film as a whole. It was great. The story is consistently flipping, the acting is deep, direction was great in every aspect, and the emotions were there as I became entranced. This is definitely a movie to watch twice or more. Once for the eye candy, probably the strongest ingredient of the picture, and then sit back and revisit it letting yourself take it all in with out as narrow a focus.It definitely deserves a 9. It is truly excellent. The production value is far above average, possibly deserving of a 10, a 9.5 without question. The story is hearty, like a novel, you feel like you have invested your time in something worthy. The acting was award winning, wraught with depth so that you believe that they feel exactly the way they are telling you that they feel. Never once do you question their emotions, definte 9! This is one of the best films made. Give it a chance. If you don't ""feel"" it the first time, revisit it and try again, you might just find that your first impression was clouded.

Made For Cinema,"This film is undeniably beautiful. I enjoyed it immensity but it is undoubtedly made for cinema. The cinematography, set and costume design and the direction are superb and I can imagine that on a nice 50 foot screen it would be a magical experience to say the least. Unfortunately, for me at least, I only got to see it on a rather disappointing 14"" screen. I say unfortunately because it takes away everything that is brilliant about this film and leaves only the rather thin plot. The plot is interesting but is basically the same story told by different people which, without the overwhelming beauty of the pictures can get rather tedious. This is still film making of the highest quality but really needs to be seen on a decent sized screen. A 14"" screen is just not worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Shed your Western pretension to sophistication to enjoy the movie.,"I will not get into summarizing the plot here, as many reviewers have already done so splendidly. However, I would say that it is advisable to lay down your prejudices against China/the Orient if you want to have a chance at enjoying the movie.It appears that quite a few Westerners jump all over ""Hero"" for its supposed ""Communist"" message, namely, sacrifice for the greater good. This criticism is, in fact, quite asinine. Though the message comes through very strongly in the movie, it is hardly a Communism-specific ideal. In fact, I would say that all historical heroes, the Western ones even, became heroes not for acts petty self interest (called ""individualism"" in the US), but rather for acts based on ideals which transcend individual gratification. It is thus quite interesting to see many Westerners decry Hero's message as Communist. This curious phenomenon brings us to the point of Western pretension to sophistication.The crux of the matter, truth be told, is the knee-jerk hatred and contempt many Westerners have for China. Most Westerners know next to nothing about China. Yet vitriolic polemics are always guaranteed to spout like the Old Faithful. This is the antithesis of individualism at work. This is ""group think."" Nowadays, it is no longer sufficient to simply watch a movie as a piece of entertainment. One has to ""interpret"" the movie, back and forth and inside out. There MUST be a deeper layer of meaning. One MUST see past what's apparent to dig out a hidden twist. Unfortunately, given the general ignorance of Westerners about China, there is not much material to work with except mindless bashing. Communism! Propaganda! The same o' Western tripe.So what is a hero? It seems that for many Westerners (not all), it is someone who survives 500 rounds of bullets to rescue the damsel in distress and, of course, to eventually fornicate with her.""Hero,"" or ""Ying Xiong,"" is not a historical documentary. If you can't figure that out, you have much graver problems in life. ""Hero"" is a piece of entertainment. A visually stunning and emotionally powerful one at that. Have no fear, go ahead and watch it. It won't turn you into a Communist.*PS: The words Broken Sword writes do no mean ""our land."" It literally means ""all under heaven.""

"A good film but a bit too worthy and lacking in pure entertaining value as it grasp exceeds it's reach, certainly not as good as the hype would have you believe","For over a decade the King of Qin has lived in fear of assassination from a trio of powerful warriors in the unconquered regions. This time has come to an end with the arrival of Nameless, a middle-ranking official in his kingdom, who brings news that he has defeated them all. As Nameless claims his rewards in the presence of the King he relates his story of how he defeated the assassin Sky and used the love between Broken Sword and Flying Snow to defeat them. However the King questions some of the things that he is being told.It is pretty much impossible at the minute to get a balanced review of this film  there are a handful on this site and I hope that this will be another one (but with this film riding high on the top 250 I imagine I will be slated for not drooling over it!). This film seems to suffer from hype for two reasons. Firstly this is a foreign film and many viewers seem to be forgiving of a subtitled film than they would if the same film was a Hollywood blockbuster (I am guilty of this at times too). Secondly, there seems to be plenty of fan-boy fighting over this movie. For example you're not a real fan unless you've seen the 'blah' version and boasting of how early viewers had seen it  I dread when it is released officially and we'll have fighting over how you need to have seen the region whatever DVD to be a real fan! Sigh! Anyway, I am a fan of martial arts and I eventually decided that I could not wait till late 2004 before I saw a film with Li, Yen and Ziyi all together.I'm sure I will be told that I didn't see the 'right' version of the film, but I can only review what I had and not some wondrous director's cut or whatever. Anyway. Let me say that I thought the film looked great. The cinematography is impressive with use of locations, colours and good (albeit it obvious) use of CGI to add spice to some scenes. The fights themselves are very well done and, again, look impressive but, and here's the crux of my problem, they really aren't what you'd call entertaining. In fact the whole film for me lacked entertainment value because you could feel that it was trying so very hard to be a big impressive grown-up film that is oh-so-worthy. The plot starts well and is interesting but, instead of twisting to become more interesting and involving, it actually twists to become increasingly dull and 'worthy'  again sucking a lot of the life out of the film as it attempts to be important.The film has a message and it labours it. The message seems to be interrupted in several ways and there is a certain amount of anti-war message in there, but this is not the main thrust. No, the main thrust is about the importance of the many over the rights of the individual  it is a rather disturbing message and it left me cold no matter how much false sentiment was put into it by honourable deaths and sentimental music. It delivers it's message to the detriment of the plot and further weakens the ease with which one would get involved in the film. The lack of characters is also a big problem as it is hard to find an entry point  I mistakenly used the mystery behind Nameless' story as my way in only to find myself led down to a dead end. This is not to say that the film is rubbish, for it most certainly is not but it is far from the perfect film many would claim it to be. The main problem comes from it's aim to be 'worthy'. The action scenes are not really enjoyable because they are all very solemn; the plot's mystery element is lost in the rush to deliver a worthy message type denouncement typical of a film stretching to obtain some sort of artistic value and the actual substance of the film is really rather dull and uninvolving and, trust me, as someone who has been excited about this film for a while, this is hard for me to say.In terms of performances I will say that all the cast are very talented and natural when it comes to the martial arts side of the film. They make the wire work look a lot more artistic and acceptable than many Hollywood stars do (who often look like they are being pulled in very unnatural ways), however I'm not a massive fan of fight scenes built 100% around flying, floating and levitating. I have already said that the fight scenes lack excitement and an awe factor but they are still impressive and worth seeing  it's just a shame that I saw unmoved by such talent. In terms of actual acting the film suffers from the cast being mostly stifled by values of honour and sacrifice  ie they are not real people and suffer from lack of character. Li is not a great actor but he does what his character requires and does it well; he is really more about his other skills. Yen was a letdown with very little to do outside of his one early scene  I like him a lot and wanted more of a performance, although it was some consolation that his movement was impressive. Cheung is a fine actress but she is rather stale here I thought. I could see she was trying to bring a lot out with small gestures but the film asks her to be impassive and that's pretty much what she does. Ziyi has no character but at least she has plenty of raw emotion  something the film desperately needed. Chen is good simply because he is not bound by the 'worthiness' that affects the rest of the cast. Standout for me was Tony Leung, an actor I always have time for. He is able to bring a lot out of his character and he managed to involve me where the others didn't really.Visually the film is a feast  the landscapes, the effects, the fights, the colours, the movement, the costumes, the sets, the extras  they all look great and contribute to an impressive feeling film. It is just a shame that it kept stretching for something else that it never reached. It wants so desperately to be worthy and respected that you can hear it say 'look at me, look at me  I'm so much more than a martial arts film' in almost every scene! I don't wish to sound harsh but it is this aspiration to worthiness that really damages how involving and enjoyable it is (and I don't mean I just wanted fighting and nothing else  I can enjoy the most sombre of films, if it gets everything right).Overall I found this to be surprisingly plodding and to have tried too hard to reach a status that it never gets to. It looks fantastic and some may be taken in by this feast for the eyes combined with 'worthy' aspects and an emotional score, but I needed more substance and a more assured delivery. It is a good film no doubt, but it's flaws are obvious and I feel sorry for QT's minions hoping for this to be Kill Bill 3 only to find it to be rather dull (although I imagine they'll hype it regardless!). See it for what it is  a beautiful film with great choreography and cinematography but sadly not the plot, audience-involvement, characters or performances to really do the visuals justice. Good but no more than that.",,Anonymous,History
Masterpiece of Cinema,"Say what you will, this film is impressive on just about every level. The only minor flaw, and one thats just annoying me right now so I'm at 9 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10, is the pacing is just a tiny bit slow. But it will pass as I come to realize what a mistake that was.The plot is simple, a man named Nameless presents to the Emperor the weapons of his three greatest foes, he then recounts how he obtained them.The visual style of this film puts most epics to shame, regardless of their origin. Since most of the film consists of stories the wire work and flashy action and vivid style only enhance what were are seeing and simply are the way things are.How do you describe this film?You don't you simply hold it out to people and tell them to see it- more so if they like Crouching Tiger since this does what that does but in new ways.Simply one of the greatest films ever made...even if I'm rating it right now as nine out of ten.SEE THIS.Though lets hope that Miramax doesn't completely ruin it now that they are calling it Jet Li's Hero and have trimmed three minutes from it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"If you suspend all disbelief you'll like it, maybe even love it, despite some confusion in the film's structure","Hero, translated here in the states as Ying xiong, is the kind of film that must've seemed either one of the great post-modern epics for their country (called ""Our Land"" the film tells us), or a flamboyant, ultra-dramatized version of the true events. At the least, Hero is helmed by a talented painter of the canvas, Zhang Yimou (responsible for the classic Raise the Red Lantern, a film about repression in Chinese society), who in-between and sometimes during the highly stylized (in the new Crouching Tiger movement of getting the characters flying high in the air as they fight), gives splendorous colors and landscapes, faces, settings, and moods. Along with cinematographer Christopher Doyle, at the least Hero aspires to a technical mastery, and it does work most of the time. By keeping the story in a tale of legend amid what was based in truth, the characters can believably be suited in the palettes Yimou puts them in.What gets the film down, for me at least, is that it's not entirely comprehensible on a first viewing. It may help it to some that it's dense and achieving a level of wonder in the non-linear structure, sometimes I didn't know who was dead and who wasn't, and perhaps in the Rashomon sense it was effective. But to lose track of the story when the technical side is trying to be moving, by default, creates style over substance. This isn't helped by the practically emotionless Jet Li as the ""nameless"" one, and with a constant use by the director of slow-motion in the fight scenes. The supporting cast gets put to some good use, which includes such Chinese film heavy-weights like Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen, and Zhang Ziyi (the actor who played Broken Sword, Tony Leung, may have been the best out of them from my perspective). And by the end, the story thrusts them into the reign of the tragedy, and it almost becomes like another character, one that isn't completely honed as it should've or could've been.When I walked out of the theater I knew that despite not being all in tune with the story (as it moved around I knew where it was going and not at the same time- a few scenes did make me start to lose interest until the next fight scene came) Hero asks to be seen more than once (maybe both times of cable, no?). On the level of the pure imagination, the film aspires to something it reaches, and it is in and of itself an epic. I just don't think it is a great one. The string sections by Itzhak Perlman are a nice touch, by the way.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Visual Poetry,"""Hero"" is a jaw-droppingly gorgeous film that is truly worth seeing for its lush production design alone. Director Zhang Yimou brings a visual elegance to the kung-fu genre film, and a magical realist sensibility to the narrative itself, the results of which are a very violent film where the violence seems to have consequences, and the line between hero and villain isn't so much a line as a vast field of shaded grey.The film is reminiscent of ""Rashomon"" in its fragmented approach to telling its story; one is never sure whether or not the version he is hearing is the truth. That may be because in the world of ""Hero,"" the truth is very open to interpretation--one man's noble act is another man's crime.The film pays its respects to various art forms, all of which are compared to the artistry of swordplay: music, literature, dance. Just as a skilled swordsman can yield nearly unstoppable power, so can the artist impact the world around him.No one will accuse Yimou of being a subtle director, and I do have to say that the continuous fighting gets ever so slightly monotonous. Yimou does a good job of combating this monotony by changing the color palettes and showcasing increasingly dazzling choreography, but when the character of Snow challenges the character of Broken Sword to a duel for what feels like the fiftieth time toward the film's conclusion, I sympathized with Broken Sword when he says, ""Must violence always be the answer (paraphrased)."" Still, this is a minor quibble, and one must also remember that this film is working within the confines of its genre, and that that's just how these films are.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,History
It could have been better...it could have been worse,"When I watched Hero the first time, I left with an overwhelming feeling of disappointment. Hero is, by no means, a great movie. At best, it is mediocre. At worst, it flat out sucked. While all outward appearances would indicate this movie was made to match Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (which I thought was only a bit better than mediocre as well), it fell far short of its target. It has the production values--great costumes and use of color, amazing cinematography, excellent fight choreography, an all-star cast, a talented director, and all the other makings of a great movie. But none of these things could make up for its greatest flaw. Like all other ""westernized"" Chinese movies these days (CTHD being the first, Hero, House of Flying Daggers, Warriors of Heaven and Earth, Shaolin Soccer, etc.) the story is sadly found wanting, some more than others. Without doubt, Hero falls into the middle of the pack.My gripes with Hero's story is its meaningless, meandering nature. Like all other westernized Chinese movies, it was made to make money, to showcase incredible eyecandy and cool fight scenes. But note that every year, dozens of such movies are made in Hong Kong, since Shaw Brothers and the golden age of kung fu movies in the 60's and 70's. Western and westernized audiences will probably find these movies great, but only because they do not know how to tell a diamond from a cubic. Then again, because Chinese culture and history is so great (in terms of size), it may be that western and westernized audiences will not understand what makes a diamond like Once Upon a Time in China a diamond and not a cubic.Hero takes place during the Qin dynasty near the end of the Warring States period. The Emperor, Qin Shi Huang, was a ruthless tyrant who stopped at nothing to completely conquer all of China. Partly out of fear of what should happen should this emperor defeat the other states, partly because it was the way of things in that day and age, assassins from the other states decided to attempt to assassinate the Qin Emperor. Hero is about the journey of a group of elite assassins in their bid to kill the Qin Emperor.My disagreement with the political message the PRC government required to be included in the movie before allowing it to be produced aside, I found the story boring and trite. For one, it attempts to redefine the meaning of ""hero"" by labeling certain characters heroic when they really did not fit into the idea of being a hero, on top of an overused cliché of the hero. In effect, Jet Li and Tony Leung's characters are fake heroes, or ones created and honored only by their enemies--which left me in a state of limbo. Was Jet Li the hero or the anti-hero? Knowing Chinese history, and thus what was to come after the events of the movie, it is difficult to say.My next comment is that the story doesn't really move. Much of the movie is a flashback, but most of the flashbacks don't really advance anything, except perhaps the intrigue that is supposed to surround the characters. Unfortunately, because of this, it feels as if the plot is moving in circles. While there's nothing wrong with one big circle, Hero seems determined to traverse the same circle several times, each time offering slightly more insight into what happened that the previous traversal did not offer. A whole hour is wasted in the movie doing this.Finally, while the acting by most of the cast is above par, the movie offers no opportunity to actually relate to them. Thus, the outcome seems trivial and unimportant. Indeed, throughout all of the supposedly emotional scenes, I knew I was supposed to be feeling something for the characters, but there simply was nothing to emotionally grasp. For example, when the character played by Donnie Yen dies early on in the movie while fighting Jet Li, there is supposed to be sadness at his passing, for the character was considered a great hero of his people. Yet, it seemed almost as if the movie shrugged it off. Again, I blame the story for not developing the characters more.In the end, I must admit that it wasn't ridiculously terrible, and that it is still quite watchable--as much so as CTHD in fact, which may or may not be a good thing. It is merely unfortunate that it does not live up to its hype, or for that matter, its potential. I would have to say that watching one of Jet Li's B-movie, The Evil Cult would be far more entertaining than watching Hero. Even though the story was left hanging for a part two that was never made, the screenplay was adapted well (albeit very loosely) for the 1.5-hour format, and even though some of the characters were introduced late into the movie, they still had far more personality than the characters in Hero.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I think this is what God invented light for,"My mind is just so clouded with enthusiasm that I'm not sure I can judge Hero well, but I definitely had the feeling that I was watching a film that would instantly be one of my very favorites. I loved it, every damn second of it, to death. It can be compared to any number of films, directed by any number of directors around the world, but it comes out as something completely unique and amazing. The one reference I would like to emphasize, because I'm guessing that it hasn't been noticed (although I missed every previous conversation in the preceding two years surrounding Hero, and I'm doubtlessly wrong) is this: Hero reminds me a heck of a lot of Alexander Nevsky. Nevsky is a straight-out propaganda piece, aimed towards WWII audiences, and Hero veers late in the film towards a weird theme of Chinese national pride, which is certainly a kind of propaganda. But neither film is too interesting in that aspect, except from a purely historical point of view. Nevsky is constantly misunderstood by modern audiences; it feels archaic, and it's a deliberate archaism. Sergei Eisenstein invented an entirely unique style that, as far as I know, has never been copied. Similarly, Zhang's creativity explodes into something the likes of which I've never even imagined before. Hero is stylized beyond belief, with ridiculous theatrics in one corner, and visuals controlled with a color co-ordination controlled with an iron fist in the other. To me, the nationalist epic intention for Hero is moot. This is the invention of mythology, a mythology that we're never meant to believe anyway, but just to absorb. The complex narrative structure is reminiscent of Rashomon, but I think it's using its idealized, and often lying flashbacks in a different fashion. I'm guessing that some of the film's critics harped on this point, that many of these passionately told stories and miraculously eye-popping set-pieces are in fact invented by the characters on screen. This criticism, I think, is just when talking about, say, The Usual Suspects, but not with Hero. I haven't come close to plumbing the depths of this movie yet  just far too awed at what I saw  but I like the concept of these tragic, mythical heroes having story after story woven around them. For instance, the story of Broken Sword and Flying Snow is told at least four times. Each time, the plot differs slightly, with the events happening a bit differently, but always with the same results, and, more importantly, with the same emotions. It's like these characters are so well known, their story arises spontaneously from their character traits.This film was obviously made on the heels of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I absolutely love Lee's film, but Hero surpasses it by miles. I love watching Lee's film, feeling its emotions, watching its startling action sequences, which were so new to me at the time (they still hold up, of course). When I watch CTHD, though, as much as I love the tragic romance and the story of the cocksure teenager, I anticipate the fight scenes. As good as everything else is, the action takes center stage. In Hero, the action scenes are even better, more beautiful, more startling, and more inventive. And they are just the icing on the cake. My one and only complaint about the film has to do with CTHD: the music. It's far too close to the beautiful score of CTHD, almost matching it note-for-note at times. It perhaps should have been much more Chinese.Other than that, what is there left to say? A lot, I expect, but on subsequent viewings. I ought to say that I am in utter disbelief that I was able to catch this at my local multiplex. I was sure that it had been dubbed, though I had not heard that they dubbed it. As far as I know, it is the first foreign language film ever to play at that theater. I was sure I would have to wait for DVD. I wonder if it will stay there more than a week. I wish I had time to see it once a day. Hell, every showing. I haven't slept in 22 hours and I know I'm just babbling now, but I'm pretty sure that I have a new favorite for the current decade (and millennium, while we're at it). Perhaps it is the only recent film that may be able to break into my hallowed top 10. Okay, now I know I'm crazy! 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History

one of the best movies in its genre,"'Hero' is one of the best movies in the genre of Asian historic and martial art films, and one of the best movies that I saw lately. The story line is quite familiar to the fans of the Chinese and Japanese film fans - a mix of legend and history from the far Chinese past. We have seen it many times especially in Japanese movies. What is different and special here is the smart use of flashbacks in the story, re-creating and re-discovering the story with new twist every time. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, one of the best I have ever seen. The fight scenes are good - I am not a big fan of the human flying effects that reign in the genre in the last ten years, but the fight scenes in this film are more than just physical fights, they are confrontation between the characters, melt in same as the dialog ad the rest of the action. The moral of the story makes sense, and is beautifully translated in cinematographic language. I also like the atmosphere of Oriental mystic - certainly commercial, but at least coming from the real source. Indeed, China is the source of some of the best cinema in the last years. The film gets 9/10 on my personal scale.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Amazing Visuals, Terrific Acting- Zhang Yimou's masterpiece","I saw this movie twice, once in only Mandarin and once with English subtitles. I only knew enough to understand lines like ""Under Heaven"" the first time, but the visuals need no language. They are a feast for the eyes that outclass any I've seen in other movies. The acting is also superb; Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung have a real chemistry that shows onscreen. The story may be confusing at first, but the theme of the movie and everything that happens becomes understandable at the end. I looked forward to this movie for a long time, and I was not disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"The fact that spaghetti westerns rarely, if ever, feature spaghetti should tell you something about dishonesty in film making.","It's really good, but you should try not to view it with the expectation of conventional film making, despite the time tested method of storytelling.Watching this film for the second time recently, someone I was with remarked that this film resembles a sort of Greek tragedy. I think that's actually a really good way to contextualize this film. The way this film is written and presented is more evocative of ancient methods of storytelling which precede traditional film. I'm not really referring to the way the way the characters speak to each other necessarily, nor the predictability of the narrative (though in fairness, the narrative isn't super hard to follow or even predict). The methods I'm referring to run more along the lines of storytelling by the characters, exaggerated supernatural ability of the characters, and the clear sense of morality and ideology by both the characters and, it seems, Yimou Zhang. The writing of this film reminds me more of Homer's Odyssey than a kung fu movie.Speaking of Homer, the characters in this film are presented in the action scenes as being superhuman in skill and ability. This is done, of course, via beautifully choreographed wire fu. These scenes are plentiful in the film and greatly accentuate the poetic nature of the story. I should clarify though, for the most part the action in this film is meant to express emotions that have very little to do with tension. They're not typical movie fights. The point is not to wonder what will happen or who will win, but rather to understand the emotions and motivations of the characters through a sort of elaborate dance. If you understand the nature of the story and how the action compliments it, then you will see its true value.The common complaint I hear concerning this film is that its somewhat shallow. I would actually agree with that, in a way. This film doesn't really ask any difficult questions, and I can't imagine any intelligent audience would find it especially challenging on an emotional level. While I do admire the relatively unique method of story telling, so far as the context of the film medium is concerned, I can't say it lends itself too well to the type of moral quandaries or meditations which are characteristic of great films. It's akin to a children's film. The observations and themes it presents are things which are just common knowledge for anyone older than 12. That's not to say it's bad. This is a very good film. Bear in mind though, that your emotional resonance with it might not amount to much.It's a visual feast, and a love letter to historical storytelling. Check it out, but don't come with too many expectations of a conventional film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best foreign films I've ever seen,"Jet Li stars as Nameless, a silent warrior who sits before The King of Qin and recounts his battles with three great warriors and how he ended up there within ten paces of the King.Chinese cinema is fantastic. From the brilliant artistic fantasy Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon to House of Flying daggers it continues to improve with marvellous direction, choreography and cinematography and this Oscar Nomination hit is no exception.Jet Li stars as Nameless, a talented warrior with a troubled life. Sitting infront of the King, he recounts his fights with 3 other great warriors, Broken Sword, Snow and Sky.The plot is told through flashbacks and many at that where director Yimou Zhang (Flying daggers) chooses a very colourful way of telling quite a dramatic story about loyalty, truth and love. There is also a strong ideology behind ""doing the right thing"" which is executed brilliantly by director and cast.The flashbacks provide excellent twists and turns to an exciting edge of you seat narrative. Though sometimes confusing they are visually stunning, especially the fight sequences.The choreography is astonishing with excellent one on one fight sequences. The lake fight is the best of the entire film, with the little drop of water proving so delicate and effective to the character's reactions and feelings.I have heard some people say that these special fighting sequences are sometimes a bit repetitive but that doesn't stop them being brilliant.These little fantasy elements to these films give the plot something extra, a bit of edge and extra excitement.The settings are wonderful, especially the lake and watch for the changing colours in the forest fight, similar to Flying Daggers.Out of the three mentioned, I personally favour Flying Daggers but Hero has the best use of flashbacks, mystery and rivalry to make it a great watch for all ages.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A deeper meaning,"I have to give it an 8, because while the fight scenes are good, I felt they could be a bit better.That saying, the show is more about the story behind the 3 characters than the fight scenes. Which is what a sword-fighting show should be about (see the show for the 3 principles of swordsmanship and you will understand).The true hero in the show isn't the one who went to try and assassinate the King of Qin, it is someone else.The subtitles are bad in the DVD. The true meaning of a lot of the words exchanged between the characters are spoiled when translated. I feel there could be a better way to translate the words. That saying, watch this and compare it with the Lee Ang film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, where the spoken Mandarin is not reflective of the times. People who spoke Mandarin during those times, spoke it in a very formal way, like in Hero, while in the latter film, it was very informal, closer to the modern way of speaking.While the King of Qin is portrayed as kinder than he said to be, remember this, we will never know the truth about the King, but essentially, unification at that point in time was important.At the last scene, there are some words in Mandarin which the translation is not available.

Too much hype = anti-climactic disappointment,"Having heard so much of this movie during it's recent UK release, I was eager to watch the Chinese Extended DVD in my possession, which was beautifully packaged in a collector's box.I had been informed by a friend and film buff that it as an ""art film"" that should not be missed.Having seen it, I must say, visually, yes it is stunning. Amazing colours, vivid photography, wonderful martial arts. But, it is surprisingly boring and the suspense in discovering the meaning at the end just collapses.If nothing was said about this and someone watched in by accident, they would have enjoyed it more- especially if they had not seen ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""- now comparing this to the former, it certainly is no masterpiece and now Crouching Tiger, in my opinion, should be elevated as a consequence.Back to watching Jet Li's other movies such as ""The One"" and ""Kiss of the Dragon"" I think....",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Zhang Yimou returns to epic filmmaking with a wonderful story, brilliant cinematography and acting.","Hero has to be a labor of love for China's preeminent filmmaker, Zhang Yimou. Based on a Chinese legend about China's first emperor Qin Shihuang and the assassins sent to assassinate him. Zhang Yimou returns to epic filmmaking last seen in To Live (1994), employing a style that that is so unique and distinctly Zhang.Hero is definitely the most ambitious Zhang film in over 8 years, with a story of historical proportions encompassing honor, love, determination and sacrifice. Set over two thousand years ago, during the time of China's Warring States period, the King of the Qin kingdom set out to unite Qin with the other six kingdoms. It was his determination to carry out his mission that made him a target of assassins from the other kingdoms. Even though he has managed to escape previous attempts, he has become fearful of three legendary assassins - Broken Sword, Falling Snow and Sky.Hero opened with the arrival of what seems to be China's new hero, Nameless, to King Qin's palace. Nameless has succeeded in defeating the other three assassins and was promised significant wealth as his reward.In Hero, Zhang has succeeded in constructing an epic tale of honor, love and intrigue. The story is told as a conversation between the King and Nameless and in a Rashomon-esque style, Zhang brought to live a wonderful landscape filled with color and sound as the audience is magically transported back to ancient China. Zhang's directing and cinematography is impeccable and the acting was superb. Zhang has brought together a world renowned cast consisting of Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung - the two were simply amazing as Falling Snow and Broken Sword. Zhang Ziyi has also proven herself as a force to be reckoned with her powerful performance as Moon, Broken Sword's loyal student and servant. Finally, veteran actor Chen Daoming gave a strong performance as King Qin.Hero is an amazing movie. The directing, acting, cinematography, story, editing and music will leave you in awe and begging for more. There will many who will want to compare this to Crouching Tiger. I have been a fan of Zhang for almost ten years and I firmly believe Zhang did not intend to copy Crouching Tiger. You will be enthralled with the martial arts in Hero as you were in Crouching Tiger but the focus is not on the martial arts but the drama and the intrigue. The ""fighting scenes"" seem to flow like the soundtrack, complemented by the most wonderful use of color.Hero is testimony of Zhang as one of the world's most talented director. I would not be surprised to see Hero's nomination for the Academy Awards.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A simple movie with one goal: perfection,"This is not a movie about fighting; it is a movie about values, honor, and sacrifice. We see tremendous sacrifice from nearly every character as they journey closer and closer to realizing perfection in their martial arts. Ultimately this journey, and the movie itself, transcend martial arts, and we are left with souls grappling with the question of what, truly, is the highest possible of ideals.The conclusion that Hero draws may not be fully understood by western audiences, but that only underscores the essential Chinese-ness of this movie.This is the most breathtakingly beautiful movie I have ever seen, and no movie without Zhang Ziyi in it will ever be able to rival it. In addition to the sublime beauty of miss Zhang, the landscape, the colors, and the imagery are all dazzling.This movie is flawless in form and structure, order and symmetry, beauty and correctness. This movie gets a 10 -if only to prove, as the movie itself seems to posit, that perfection is humanly attainable.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The colors also help clarify the different stories.The translation is also better than the Hong Kong subtitles, which at times did not complete sense.

Like another Jet movie ...,"This movie is visually quite stunning, but it is not a perfect movie with a perfect story. For one thing the characters did not seem to relate to each other in a realistic way. They were almost cardboard cut outs of the actors. I am sure its not the actor's fault, since I have seen them perform quite well in other movies. I do like the way the story evolves depending on which point of view it is being told from. The colors and settings are magnificent. Two of my favorite scenes : the fight between Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi in the woods ; and the scene where Broken Sword meets the Emperor at the palace. There are elements that did not really work for me; namely the relationship between Broken Sword and Falling Snow and also the disappearance of Donnie Yen from the movie. He has one great scene and thats it. The ending was also lackluster. It felt very contrived and laced with propaganda. It reminded me of the ending of another Jet Li movie - the Bodyguard from Beijing. All in all, I recommend you see this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Dull Jet, waste of Donnie, overall mediocre","Angst, angst, angst.  Fight fight.  Angst, angst, angst.  That's really what Hero comes down to.  Where is the charm?  The gentle humor and intimacy that complements the pathos and makes Wushu films so enchanting?  Well, let's start with the good - the cinematography is amazing, an excellent use of the entire widescreen aspect and a wonderful use of lighting and color; some clever directorial decision-making, as well, in the changing colors of Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung's costumes and the lenses used to tint the film. Also, these two actors also put forward very very strong performances; unfortunately, I've only seen each in one other film, and I was very impressed by their work here (especially with Maggie Cheung, though I've only seen her in the mediocre The Heroic Trio, so I came in with ""modest"" standards!).  Donnie Yen also does a fairly good job...but just isn't given enough screen time to really develop a character.  But the fighting choreography is superb.Now the bad.  First, Jet Li's performance is dull.  Very dull.  Usually the man can add life to the weakest script, but in his effort to project stoic hatred, he just projects, well, nothing.  Nothing at all.  And as I noted above, Donnie Yen doesn't get enough screen time to contribute much, other than a little moping...what a waste of talent!!  But the real problem is bigger than the actors; the movie lacks intimacy - we're TOLD the story, not SHOWN or DRAWN INTO it.  That's also the problem with CTHD, in my opinion. And hiding behind an ""artsy"" or intellectual facade just doesn't cut it. For a far, far better analysis of Kantian vs. utilitarian ethics (the question of killing the emperor; the question of whether or not to kill Jet at the end) check out Iron Monkey, in the brillant contrasts drawn between the ethics of Dr. Yang and Wong Kai Ying; similarly, to continue the CTHD comparison, for a much more fun - and more probing - examination of gender roles, watch Wing Chun, an earlier Michelle Yeoh work (with Donnie Yen too). These two hours of vast landscapes and non-stop tears, with no fun and joy and humor inserted here and there...well, it just wears you down and moves you from catharsis to boredom.So, in sum, Hero is not at all horrible...but with such an outstanding cast and respected director, it should have been much more.  Came in with (too?) high hopes; left disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Mesmerizing movie.,"Hero is visually pleasing and artistically beautiful masterpiece by Zhang Yimou. It is a Chinese martial art film and the director presents this majestic art from using minimal bloodshed in the movie. Zhang Yimou re-tells his version of the assassination attempt of King of Qin( 220 - 210 BC ) with Jet Li as his protagonist - ""Nameless"". This movie also brings up the subject of Maoism.Hero is a rare movie which blends storytelling into a visual poem. The color composition it blows your mind away, even more so when you realize the significance of each color with respect to the story. It is the central grace of the movie and the director, Zhang Yimou, reportedly made incredible efforts to fulfill his requirement. There is mesmerizing natural imagery and costumes in the film which takes us back to the ancient china.The acting was good, though at some places it felt a bit unreal and forced. Music in the movie complemented the visual poem Yimou was trying to create. In conclusion, I would like to say that I liked this movie a lot and would recommend this to anyone who appreciates natural beauty and art.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Most beautiful martial arts kitsch opera to date,"Without the breathtaking visuals of the lake scenes, that are truly visionary, and a couple of outstanding pieces in terms of color in movement (but I've seen better from Yimou, in ""Raise the red lanterns""), this movie would just be another of these Chinese kitsch martial arts operas. Posters in motion. Clean, dis-incarnated, pretty, empty, forgettable.The History/Magick story is mundane and relies on tired clichés that even the cheapest Asian TV series treat with more wit, but it's not the point anyway. In such a movie, the story is a mere pretext, a distant annotation to please the masses, for the director to have his real fun in creating a dary audiovisual vocabulary that at the same time enthralls and annoys.The problems is that most of the ""beauty"" pictured is, actually, mere aesthetic bombast, this being underlined by countless pretentious slow-motion shots, the melodramatic score, and by the very unnatural looking wirework, with movements that look utterly phony. At least most of it.But there's a payoff. It's not long, but it turns the whole movie into a rewarding experience.When the film reached what I guess was Yimou's original vision, the lake scenes, my jaw dropped. This is terrific stuff, really admirable. The level of abstraction of the movement, and the celebration of the beauty and power of nature, in these scenes, are astounding. The characters are extensions of their environment, so are their spirits and their blades. For a short time, we viewers experience pure grace, genuine transcendence.Too bad that the rest of the movie is mostly an empty hull.I still prefer Hsia Nu (Touch of Zen) by a fair margin. It reaches the same heights without resorting to kitsch and trendy clip-like tricks.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Fantastic- didn't let me down,"First, let me say that I have been dying to see this film. The combination of Jet Li, Zhang Yimou (Director) and Christopher Doyle (Cinematographer)gave it a superstar billing both in front and behind the screen. The additions of Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung, Donnie Yen and Zhang Ziyi just heightened it.Within 20 minutes, the film had already surpassed my expectations. Yimou is never a dull director, and he reconstructed heroism. Other reviews compare this film to Kill Bil and Rush Hour. INHO- that's a disservice, those films are parodies of a genre (or classic western appropriation).The other film it bears comparison to is Crouching Tiger, but it is better in several ways. First, to get ti out of the way, the fight scenes. Second, and much more important, the film is cerebral, with it's intellectualism supported in the fights and colors. The film explores individual action in the context of a society, and like Rashomon before it, breaks each story into an individual context. It completes the Postmodern context, resetting back into the overall repurcussions (something the Deconstructionists have yet to rectify).Each protoganists story is told differently, in different colors. The colors are left up to us to interpret. Red- perhaps revenge. Green, innocence and youth.Each heroe's stoy is also a different role. Jet Li starts as a character seeking personal vengeance but begins to think it terms of the greater the good. Tony Leung also makes this transition, at an earlier stage. His lover, Maggie Cheung, holds on to her motive of revenge and pays a price (I am being a little vague so as not to give it away), her emotional path effectively boomering back on her.How far should the hero in persuing the personal cause? How far in the political? What actions are permissible in either realm? ANd what is the greater good? All of this is debated.This film will rank with Seven Samurai in the genre of the action film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A grandiose cinema fantasy, but not a fantastic film.","For the eye this film is pure joy, but it doesn't speak to the heart.

And I didn't care so much for the outcome of the actions or the story either. But the plot is told in a surprising way, even though it's quite simple. The fighting scenes and the fencing is marvelous and the photo is beautiful.

A work of art with many different angles.,"For those of you who think this movie as a propaganda movie, it's really sad that you ignore the history and knowledge of propaganda. I am a Chinese and grow up in China. I have seen many propaganda movies but this one has nothing similar.This movie is definitely operatic. For those of you get confused about the story, here is the plot. The story has been told three times. First time, Nameless make up a love triangle story but the King reveals that the story is not true. Then the King starts to tell a story from his own view. Of course, this is not true either. Eventually, Nameless told the true story. If you watch the three different versions of the story carefully, it tells you a lot about the characters' personalities. The fake story told by Nameless is a common love triangle story, which shows the limitation of Nameless' view of the ""Tian Xia"". The second story in the King's mind really shows his respect to Broken sword and Snow. The way he thinks how the story should be really touched Nameless' heart. The third story(the real one), really shows the love and passion of broken sword and snow.Another confusion has been the fact that Broken sword has been killed for so many times in the movie. You have to watch it carefully that many killings in the movie are fake ones. Sometimes the story is fake and some other time the victims are just seriously wounded ( pretend to be killed to convince the king).I can't believe some people, especially some Chinese people claim they saw propaganda in this movie. It sounds like they have never seen a propaganda movie and they already forget about Chinese history. The fact at that period of history is that 7 states were fighting with each other for a long period time. Every one of them wanted to conquer all the others. Qin was the strongest one during a particular time. There are no similarity of between what we saw in this movie and the current Taiwan-China, Bush-Iraq issues. The movie is trying to deliver a dream for peace of human kind. Unfortunately, different people have different views. It is true that the king of Qin becomes a brutal one after he unify China. But it's not going to be better if Nameless kill the king. The movie doesn't even particularly praise the king. All the main characters in the movie can be considered to be hero. If you are particularly interested in the King, it's your own view. Clearly, that's not the director's intention at least.I love this movie and I love the style of the director. The most beautiful scene is when moon is dead after fighting with Snow in the fake story. It's simply beautiful and beyond imagination. Many people hate the part where the actors are flying around. If you watch more carefully, they flying around only in imagination and those fake stories. In the real story, none of them are actually flying around. To me, I have no problem to see those characters flying around so elegantly. It's just a fantasy and imagination. I enjoy this more than watching spiderman flying around.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Good, but a tad overrated.","What many people probably don't know is that Zhang Yimou's ""Hero"" spent 2 years on the shelf before finally making it to the big screen, in America, anyway. Before it made it to American theaters, It was a smash hit in China and has already garnered a Best Foreign language Oscar nomination. I can say with absolute certainty that ""Hero"" is one of the most aesthetic films ever made. You'd be hard pressed to find a movie more visually breathtaking than this one. Every single frame of this film is like a Van Gogh painting. It simply has to be seen to be believed.As a life-long martial-arts film enthusiast, I expected more in terms of entertainment but found the film a bit on the slow side. I'm not gainsaying that fact that the film was very well-made, I just wasn't very entertained by it. The story could've been a bit better. It was a bit too simplistic and prosaic for my liking. There isn't much to this film plot-wise. The fight sequences were a bit of a letdown for me. I prefer the fast and furious type of martial-arts fight sequences as opposed to the Peter Panesque, slow-mo ballet dance.There were certainly several moments of sheer brilliance in the film, and for that reason, I'm recommending it. The performances are impressive. Jet Li isn't exactly a great dramatic actor but he's effective here. The beautiful acclaimed actress, Maggie Cheung, never fails to impress. She shines as ""Flying Snow"". Zhang Ziyi is wonderfully understated as ""Moon"". Tony Leung Chiu Wai, who appeared in Kar Wai Wong's masterpiece, ""In The Mood For Love"", with Maggie Cheung, also makes his presence felt. Donnie Yen, an accomplished martial-artist, had such infinitesimal screen time, much to my chagrin. I was hoping he had more fight sequences featuring him and Li.In the final analysis, this is a very good film, but it isn't the masterpiece ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Beautifully filmed with an interesting historical theme, yet...","Having just watched this film for the first time (although it was released some time ago), my reaction is not quite as gushing in praise as other reviews, in spite of many impressive elements. Jet Li is a charismatic presence who possesses some of the most amazing martial arts skills to be seen anywhere. He's turned out some very entertaining films, from his early Chinese productions ('Once Upon a Time in China', parts 1-3, 'Fist of Legend') to his more mainstream Hollywood films ('The One', 'Romeo Must Die', etc.). It was, then, with anticipation that I put the DVD of 'Hero' in, set audio option for 'Mandarin DTS', with English subtitles, and hit the 'play' button. The movie began solidly, telling the tale of the Nameless warrior recounting to the Emperor (through flashbacks) his battles with three skilled assassins (see other reviews for more detail of plot). But as the film progressed, I became increasingly let down. But first, the positive aspects: the story line, polemics included, was an interesting philosophical exercise, well analyzed by other reviewers. The photography was, without question, beautiful. The use of certain dominant color schemes with each of Nameless's battle scenes was wonderful to behold, and added a rich emotionalism to the action. And, to be sure, there were some impressive swordplay and fighting scenes. The problem I had with the film was two-fold: first, and of less import, was that some of the many scenes between two of the assassins (Broken Sword and Flying Snow) dragged on too long, with too much contrived emotion between the two. But most negatively for me was the excessive use of 'wire fu' throughout. For this film fan, to see people ignoring the law of gravity and flying around like Peter Pan, soaring over tree tops, walking on water (literally) and controlling nature by creating windstorms, etc. with the wave of a sword leaves me cold. Try as I might, I cannot take any movie seriously that employs such ridiculous imagery. I don't mind trick camera work, a little CGI and other film tricks to make fight scenes exciting, but this nonsense (as was the case in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon') just causes me to shake my head and lose interest. I realize others will strongly disagree, and consider this film to be among Jet Li's finest. While, as mentioned, I enjoyed his character, the lavish photography and the philosophical elements dealt with, the cartoonish wire-fu fight scenes (and there were many) almost ruined it for me. While I've not seen all of Jet Li's films, among the several I have seen, I rank 'Fist of Legend' and 'Kiss of the Dragon' his best. To be honest, even some of his lesser films ('Romeo Must Die', 'The Enforcer') were more realistic and, consequently, more enjoyable than this gorgeous but flawed film. I give it a score of 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Stunning Visual Poetry...,"Zhang Yimou was quoted to have said that ""Hero"" was his most commercial work to date. I am happy to say that the director of such great classics like ""Raise the Red Lantern"", ""Judou"", ""Not One Less"" has not let his artistic touch play second fiddle to the lavish and majestic settings where this movie takes place.I won't be commenting much about the story. Anyone who enjoyed Kurusawa's ""Rashamon"" will find this movie to be a little more than a deja-vu. But then what makes this movie great is the treatment of the story in itself. Told and retold in different narative viewpoints, audiences get to see a story that slowly unravels itself. The investment in time and attention will be greatly paid off at the end when the ""hero"" has to make a choice between staying true to his beliefs or abandoning them for a greater good.This movie itself is filled with dramatic and fantastic fight sequences that had never quite been captured on film before. Christopher Doyle, known for his work with Wong Kar-Wai, has shown great restraint in the camerawork- making each frame of the movie tight and beautiful, almost good enough to be framed as an art work in a museum. One dissatisfaction that I had was that the score by Tan Dun is reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".Zhang Yimou's touch can clearly be seen in the acting. Some of the character's face, though revealing no apparent emotion, can convey their thoughts. And that is the beauty of this movie. It seizes you from the very begining and makes you think every step of the way. Production quality was exceptional with generous but not overtly whimsical shots of Chinese mountains, lakes and desserts.The version that I saw was 90 minutes long, though I did read reports that a 3 hour version is being shown in some parts of China.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Very good, very Chinese, but still overrated","I'm surprised to see the IMDb crowd rate this film in the top 250; while a good film, nearly lyrical in the use of light and wire-fu, the story a great deal of sound and fury that ultimately signifies very little.The story is told in a series of flashbacks, as most everyone already knows. I would comment more, but this is film whose content is difficult to discuss without giving away major plot points.But still...Top 250 #133 for a 96 minute movie that's about 70 minutes of fighting?Many will comment on the blatantly obvious propaganda value of ""Hero""--the unifying message in the film seems particularly unsubtle as Taiwan edges closer and closer towards full independence in name and deed and fact, from Mainland, so-called 'red' China.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful but boring,"This is an obvious attempt to ride on the wave of success that followed ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", and to cash in on the interest for this type of movies. However, ""Hero"" has none of the qualities that made ""Crouching Tiger..."" such a fantastic, joyful masterpiece. Sure, there are tons of beauty - it seems that they consciously picked some of the most beautiful Asian actors around - and lots of action. The problem is that all the visual goodies and effects etc in ""Hero"" - however beautiful, stunning and impressive - has none of the substance, depth and relevance of ""Crouching Tiger..."". It's beautiful but boring. As for the story/plot in ""Hero""... It's so thin that I can't even describe it without giving too much away. Just a poor excuse to make a rip-off of ""Crouching Tiger..."", which actually has a pretty good story/plot. The action scenes in ""Hero"" and the martial arts-techniques are also similar to those in ""Crouching Tiger..."", but in ""Hero"" they are just too mechanical, cold and ""perfect"". It's like comparing a supermodel to a stunning, warm, natural beauty. In this scenario, ""Hero"" is the supermodel. Furthermore, ""Hero"" lacks all the humor, wit, warmth and genuine emotion that ""Crouching Tiger..."" is full of. Yes, there are plenty of tears, heartbreak, sorrow and screaming in ""Hero"", but it's way too staged. Too much slow motion, close-ups, vacant/stiff facial expressions... like a piece of art that everyone is supposed to like because...why? Whatever. Because of all the work? The flawless technique? The perfection? The details? It's just not enough. No substance, no feeling, nothing genuine, nothing or no one to sympathize with. It doesn't work. All the slow motion sequences, close-ups and stills are probably meant to create a sense of sincerity or something, but it's just annoying. It all amounts to some kind of cinematographic pornography: a visual firework display with thought-out combinations for its own sake, to be impressive and breathtaking, but it doesn't mean anything. It's a hollow shell - a meaningless facade. ""Hero"" ain't got nothing on ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".",2.0,Anonymous,History
style when done with substance,"excerpt, full review at my location.Finally, two years after its creation, and as a result of severe petitioning to Miramax Studios from Quentin Tarantino, Zhang Yimou's Hero obtained its western cinematic and unedited DVD release. Following in the mould of its spiritual predecessor Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Hero is a succession of sweeping landscapes, vivid colours and high wire action that sees Jet Li return to his native China to assume the lead role.Whether it be through majestic landscapes, the vibrancy and range of striking colours on show, or the graceful movements of some of China's finest stars, Yimou Zhang champions a case for style when done with substance.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An outstanding film by any standard...,"An outstanding film by any standards and not to be mistaken for just another eastern import or martial arts extravaganza. The camera work is implausibly good and the pacing is beyond reproach.A difficult, but hugely rewarding plot is played out simply and concisely, being very careful not to substitute art for coherence.Once again Tony and Jet prove themselves as among the best you'll see on any screen. The action surpasses eastern expectation and demolishes western fantasies of being martial arts savvy. By my reckoning this film has put western screen writers and directors alike in pale contrast.

If you DID actually enjoy this film, I can suggest several other epics that are dreadfully dull and overrated: The English Patient, Gandhi, and Ryan's Daughter.This is NOT to say that I dislike epics or long movies--just not ones where you could care less for the characters (with the exception of Gandhi) and where the pacing is so slow.

Stunning but empty,"The Chinese historical drama is a well defined genre, complete with fly-by-wire swordplay, and 'Hero' is a fairly typical example of the breed. It's beautiful, but stylised to the point of near-ridiculousness: it's maybe better to think of it as ballet than fiction. What is unusual about this movie is the plot, which is little more than a formal construct, and its nationalist ethic: this is a story about the foundation of China, although ""story"" is pushing it, and the film is full of epigrammatic symbols that hint at profoundity but which may just be empty. I liked watching it, but at some level, it wouldn't have been so different an experience to view it without the subtitles, so limited is the substance.",6.0,Anonymous,History

A Cartoon,"'Hero' was visually stunning. The colors and cinematography were excellent but I have a bit of a problem with the story. It was the same basic story of all martial arts movies. I'm going to kill you because you killed somebody and I have to avenge the killing so I have to fight you. Though each segment of the movie was in a different color the plot within each segment was basically the same, two people fighting. The segment continued until the stoic fighter beat the other fighter. I found it somewhat boring.The story was simplistic and the fighting, though maybe highly skilled, repetitious. The wire fighting scenes were ridiculous. I find them to be more Stan Lee than Bruce Lee. I think comparisons to Kurosawa misleading since Kurosawa had much deeper stories and characters. This movie is a cartoon. It is a nice visual treat and in that sense it is worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"...what I do not give, you must never take by force.","whether you like martial arts and war epics or classical stories you will enjoy this story. this is the gripping tale of the bloody end of 10th century Tang Dynasty, it has all the ingredients of a Shakespearean plot -- love, hatred, betrayal, murder, revenge, adultery, incest, suicide, assassins, massacre, insurgency and counterinsurgency, even a large fireworks display !!the acting was convincing and casting well matched the characters. unsurprisingly, Chow Yuen Fat gives a stately performance as he did with Crouching Tiger. like Hero, the visuals were very impressive, particularly the Chrysanthemum festival, which sets the scene for the final military ambush. clearly most of the sets are CG, including the Forbidden City. the audio was particularly disappointing, to say the least, with badly dubbed American accents -- it would be far better to wait to see the original Mandarin soundtrack; the score was cheesy at best, with a blend of modern German and Italian classical pieces thrown in, it comes off as a lame rendition of Wagner, with no harmony to the period, location or style of the film (this may only be the English version).certainly this is another good effort for Zhang Yimou's résumé, but it is lacking in key areas.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A Movie which is nothing less then Magnificent in every way.,"A true work of art which can mesmerize anyone. Every frame of Hero is designed and presented so beautifully that one watching it forgets to blink the eye. Magnificent and giant artwork is enough to keep you with the movie and increase your interest in Chinese history. Lavish yet clean living style of the people and the costumes, not to mention the colours and the way the events are narrated. However, movie is more about the complex love story between two assassins then another one with extreme speed. Essential Chinese arts of Qin, Wéiqí ,Calligraphy and Painting are amazingly blended with the themes while first 3 are expressive shown, Painting is rather subjective to the audience perception of colour work through out the movie.

It is clear that this movie was not made from the same mold that has 95% of all American cinema in a strangle hold. 5) It makes you think.The only thing that was not perfect was the effects that are not up to the Hollywood standard, but hard to notice.

The story line is quite different and the treatment is quite different from Crouching tiger. This is not a sequel nor a rip-off, just like Crouching tiger was not a rip-off of Chinese Ghost Story 1. However the style is inspired, and I think it's just the new Hong Kong style.Hero has very good army scenes, and the archery attacks are pretty awesome, reminiscent of the CGI work done in Lord of the Ring.The only unsettling thing for action fans is that the movie is multiple, though very different, renderings of the same events, narrated by different people until the truth is reached.Cinematography is very good, a little similar to Peter Pan 2003 where the colors palette is retouched depending on the emotion.Enjoy!..

Beautiful movie that depends a little too much on its visuals,"Hero is a beautiful movie, full of rich colors and sweeping backdrops. Each flashback is a joy to watch simply because of that beauty and it's the beauty that keeps you watching.The storyline itself is contrived at points, but I can forgive that because this is meant to be a parable, and the movie ends so well I found myself not caring. There are times during the movie where emotion is lacking even though those should be the most passionate times. I have a feeling that is a directing or editing error though, because the actors are all marvelously in tune with what they should be feeling- something that changes a lot in this movie.Crouching Tiger wins against this movie. Ang Lee's movie has both stirring visuals and an assured, passionate story. Hero, however, is definitely worth watching and I recommend it to anyone who loves these Chinese martial arts movies.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Art.,"Martial-arts-movies as a genre has forever been plagued by the lack of substance. While no one is going to argue that the classics aren't fun to watch, the truth is that most of them are just flash, with little or no emotion behind the flurry of kicks, sword thrusts and wire-work.This is not the case with Hero.In this movie, director Zhang Yimou, together with the brilliant cinematographer Christopher Doyle, and a stellar cast, has created a modern masterpiece.Every frame of this movie is art, and it's painfully beautiful. And the fights are brilliantly realized.The use of different colour-palettes for each of the segments work beautifully well, and adds a dimension, and a level of polish rarely seen in this genre.But it's not all eye-candy.Despite the fact that not much time is spent on the story, Yimou manages to give every character just the right amount of time to establish itself. You're never wondering ""Why did she/he do that?"", nor do you suffer from an over-explanatory narration. You aren't daddied around.And this is all accented by the brilliant cast. Maggie Cheung, Zhang Ziyi, Tony Leung, and Jet Li all deliver amazing performances.This is a movie where everything clicked. The art direction, the cinematography, the choreography, the music and the acting.Zhang Yimou proved once and for all that martial-arts is just that, art.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Thank You Miramax...,"Hero, which is gorgeously made by a dream team. Zhang Yimou as Director, Emi Wada as Costume Designer, Christopher Doyle as Cinematographer, Tan Dun as Composer, and a large talented cast.The Story: As incoherent as it goes, it plays with the audiences guilibilty. Left to chose to believe either the Emperor or the man Nameless. This is as close as we can play reality with the film. To leave everything to the audiences' decision. The story is filled with conception of honor, loyalty, and value. We really have to figure out what's right and if it's worth fighting for. The story plays quite well, although due to lack of explanation. The story doesn't quite play through.The Acting: Although I do feel dissapointed that Donnie Yen made the tiniest of cameos, I wish that he would do more for the role. The acting here varies, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are the scene stealers, they really blew me away. Zhang ZiYi actually is better than she was in CTHD, she delievers a great range of expressions. Jet Li is where the problems starts, although I do think that he's a great fighter. His cold expressions were plain, and I thought that was great at first. But, he played it too cooly. They should have given him more character development. Chen Daoming was perfect for the role of the emporer, he played interestingly in his scenes. His curiousity for the truth and what he thinks what really happens. The acting team is great, but with lack of screen time, it really doesn't help out the characters and the film.The Production: The Production team is the greatest yet! With my all-time favorite DP, Christopher Doyle, he gives my eyes remedies. The lighting, the color, the angles, and the shots. They're all just perfect. The costumes are great, I especially love the white costumes, and the Emporer's Armor. The film score is very moving as well, and its a big improvment from CTHD. The editing is nice, very smooth cuts, and the special effects are great. Although I do think that the Arrow in the Red section was a bit sloppy. It must've been very hard to have millions of arrows shooting towards a building. But, I thought that it looked too fake... I did like the forest fight scene though.The Fight scenes are also great, we get to see a different kind of martial art. Something that hasn't been quite used in a while, there are clean quick movements and smooth graceful movements. It's an actual ballet with swords.The Politics: This is where MY title comes into effect. Now, I do say Miramax has done a great job of releasing Hero in America...Oh wait...they haven't! Wow....Great fighting scenes, great cinematography, great score, great editing, great costumes, great acting, great story, great special effects, and also great direction. What could possibly make Miramax shy this littleBIG film from America? Maybe, Chicago had something to do with it... Maybe Miramax won't get their money's worth when they release it only in some 100 art-house theaters across America. Well, I have so much anger for Miramax's lack of support for this film that I don't want to explain it here. I know that there are millions others that agree with me. Those who are afraid of risking there own, will have already risk losing more. So, When Miramax does eventually end up releasing the film, don't buy into it.  Miramax actually have the guts to ask Zhang Yimou to cut 20 mins of footage that was of Two Hours of film, and this was released worldwide. There is NO International Cut, or Director's Cut. Only, Miramax's Cut, which runs 98 mins. Sucks doesn't it...Maybe that's why the film was a bit less coherent.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Propaganda Disguised as Art,"""Hero"" is visually stunning and beautifully filmed.  Unfortunately, the film represented, in my belief, an effort on the part of Communist China to justify the foreign policy they have pursued since the tragedy of the Communist take-over of that great country.The justification that the mainland Chinese government uses for their invasions and occupations of Tibet and portions of India, Mongolia, and Vietnam, as well as their continued threats against Taiwan, is that all of these territories were historically part of a ""unified,"" Chinese kingdom. The Chinese point to the earlier, ""unified"" Chinese dynasties to support their claim.This movie attempts to show the 1st Dynasty, the Qim, in a positive light by arguing that it united China in ""peace"" and created the uniform writing system still used in China and other Asian countries today.  The writing system claim may be true, but I personally doubt that the Qim emperor was really motivated by thoughts of ""eternal peace under heaven"" when he brutally conquered his neighboring Asiatic kingdoms.  Also, I don't believe that a ""unified"" China that includes any territory or people that ever belonged to any of the Chinese dynasties, is necessarily the true ""essence of the sword and calligraphy"" as this movies states.The victors do write the history books and that is what China is trying to do with this beautifully filmed movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"""Heroic"" and beautiful","""Hero,"" completed in 2002 but through some special promoting complements of Quentin Tarantino, was finally released to the American public in the summer of 2004. I've seen it twice; this is the most delicate and beautiful of what I call the ""art house"" martial arts movies (i.e., ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""House of Flying Daggers""), and I'm simply amazed at the film's production, cinematography, fight scenes, and of course, Jet Li. Li is the most talented martial arts superstar the movies has seen since Bruce Lee. Li plays Nameless, a wandering magistrate who, as the film opens, entices the imperialist King of Qin (Daoming Chen) with a story of how he single-handedly defeated three assassins who had each vowed to kill the king. Much can be said about the film's fight scenes, which are beautiful and are amazingly choreographed, but the biggest problem, I think, lies within the story. I had to sit through the film two times before I felt I could get a grasp on everything, but maybe it's just me. The movie sometimes tends to meander through some of its slower parts and that could take points away from an otherwise excellent film. But as I stated before, the fight scenes are magnificent, the standouts of which come to include a fight between Nameless and Sky (Donnie Yen) that takes place inside a chess house, and the two float and practice their swordsplay as a blind man plays music during periods of when nothing goes on between the two men, and they just listen to the sounds as the man plucks away at the strings. And there is another scene where Nameless battles Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) over the serene mirror of a mountain lake, and the two men are careful to not break the water's surface. An excellent and delicate film.""Hero"" - 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

From stunning cinematography to the best direction I have witnessed it really is an event in every sense of the word.

"A Chinese ""samurai"" film borrowing heavily from Kurosawa","This is a Chinese film but it struck me as very Japanese for a few reasons. First, the way the plot unravels is ""Kurosawa-esque"" and some of the large battle scenes were reminiscent of ""Ran"". That being said, neither the plot nor the battle scenes were on the same level as Kurosawa.The film fails to make us sympathize with any of the characters.

A visual masterpiece of color and choreography.,"After the success of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) in most of the worldwide markets, it's no wonder that a film like Hero (2002) would make an appearance. Capitalizing on the choreography and visuals that brought Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon success, Hero takes these acrobatic battles to the next level, even to the point of them becoming ridiculous and semi-cartoonish. Add to this the deliberate color theming for each of the film's different sections, and Hero almost becomes a piece of art in its own right. It's almost a shame that there haven't been more movies like this in the years since.While some of the CGI hasn't aged well since 2002, and the acting can sometimes be too flat or too over the top, the story is still entertaining. The language barrier did make it slightly confusing at times, but the twists were top-notch. It did help to have the ""framing"" of the throne room to not only show the progression of the story but as a separation between the different colorful acts. If anything, it also added to the conclusion of the plot and the surprising ending that I didn't quite see coming.Partly because I watched this film in its original Chinese, I found the visuals to be so beautiful to the point of almost being distracting. How often was I watching some visual spectacle, only to realize I wasn't entirely sure what the characters were talking about during the scene. It does help that the plot is simple enough to pick up the missing pieces and understand what's generally happening. In the end, though, Hero is a visual treat in many regards, and it should be held as a high standard for what visual art can be in the hands of those who understand it.A visual masterpiece of color and choreography, I give Hero 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,History

extraordinary interpretation of the classical martial arts film,"This film takes the genre of Martial arts films in a direction much neglected by modern western cinema.  Unlike Kill Bill or Rush Hour, though wonderful movies in their own right, Ying Xiong stands apart in it's attention to one of the most essential elements to martial arts: art.  The action scenes are flawlessly smooth and textured both in the movements of the actors and their surroundings.  The various settings of each fight set the tone of the actors movements, as well as the movement and subjectivity of the camera.  When not fighting, the camera presents us with shot after shot that would each unto themselves qualify as a work of art.  When meshed together, they create a seamless continuity into which the fight scenes mesh perfectly.  This attention to the art of martial arts was touched upon in both Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (Bamboo forest) and Brotherhood of the Wolf (Opening rain fight), but neither of these films had the daring of Ying Xiong's pacing.  The camera work is so confidant in it's depth that it dares to slow fights down for artistic effect, not dramatic, and to slow the scenes between fights down rather then rush it's audience to the next fight.  This respect for the audience is evident in every shot of this visual masterpiece, and as both a martial artist and a Movie goer, I give this film a strong vote of ten out of ten.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Nice cinematography, poor dialogue and story","This film is incredibly difficult to rate and review.Plot line is fairly simple. Nameless man in ancient China visits the King of one of the kingdoms to receive his prize for dispatching 3 notorious assassins who have been trying to kill the king. The story proceeds with the man relating the story of how he killed the 3 to the king.The cinematography is excellent with a great deal of blatant if somewhat obvious symbolism. The heavily stylized fight scenes are often interesting and creative.The film has a few problems. First, the characters are not developed very well. Fully one third of the film turns out to be false character development. There are at least 2 fight scenes which have nothing to do with advancing the plot, the characters or the story, and in fact are being told to the king by the Nameless man who was not even present to witness the fights. The dialogue is often boring and as unrealistic as the fight scenes.I found myself halfway through the movie saying please get to the point I've seen enough of people flying through the air and blocking arrows with silk dresses and unexplained physical abilities.The other thing I found uncomfortable about the film is it's simplistic message of the benefits of totalitarianism. In today's cinema, American films with simplistic patriotic or politically black and white messages are panned. Yet for some reason it's not the case with this film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
It's a good film but not a great one,"Hero is a pretty good film but it's not as good as I would have thought. Jet Li plays the warrior Nameless, who has defeated three assassins sworn to assassinate the king of his region. As he tells the story of how he defeated them, it becomes obvious that every story can be told a number of different ways. The plot is pretty good and sounds interesting enough, while the execution was pretty good as well. Hero is visually stunning and it has a lot of breath taking fight scenes. The fight scenes are done well but the rest of the movie isn't really worth noting. I'm not saying its terrible but it's just not very interesting to watch and it was kind of boring. However, the film is only 94 minutes long so it didn't bother me to much. Its kind of hard to judge the acting but I did like Jet Li a long with the rest of the cast. Yimou Zhang does a decent job of directing keeping the film at a slow pace which can sometimes be annoying. I did like the way they carried out the story of how he told how he defeated everyone. The cinematography was amazing as well and if it had not been nominated for best foreign picture then I'm pretty sure it would have taken home some Oscars. Rating 7/10 a pretty amazing film at some points however not all of it is like that. Hero is still worth checking out though especially if you liked Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Simply Exquisite...,"Having been dragged to the theatre by my wife to see 'Hero', I halfway expected it to be yet another martial arts two-hour time waster. Lord, was I wrong! This was, without any doubt, the single most stunning movie I've seen in a month of sundays. On many fronts. Jet Li plays 'Nameless' an assassin, deadly at 10 paces, sent to kill the emperor of Qin, a despot who uses whatever means available, including murder and pillage, to unite his country. 'Flying Snow' (Maggie Cheung), 'Sky' (Donnie Yen) and 'Broken Sword' (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) are the Emperor's enemies whom Nameless must kill in order to win the Emperor's trust so that he can get close to him. But things get even more complicated because while Flying Snow is sworn to the Emperor's demise, Broken Sword, her lover, must stop her.Visually (bowing to the fact that the story always takes a back seat to the visuals with American audiences), Hero was beyond breathtaking! Zhang Yimou treads dangerously the line between narrative and art, allegory and realism with this one. How he accomplished many of the effects, so seamlessly composed that even a jaded movie goer like myself was left gasping, I'll be considering for years to come. I'd love to try to describe what I saw and experienced, but I simply couldn't do it justice. Suffice to say, if you're a Special Effects aficionado, they alone makes this movie a truly worthwhile experience. On the other hand, if you happen to enjoy a movie with an intelligent plot, fully realized characters and a wagonload full of passion, I can't think of a better movie to recommend. Hero is a visual symphony.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Astounding dream like film,"This film is amazing, it is beautiful and it really does knock anything Hollywood can do for six. Jet Li doesn't get the respect he deserves in Hollywood, he deserves much better American films than the likes of Romeo Must Die and The One. He has amazing screen presence in Hero and is an amazing martial artist. Some of the scenes, like the fight over the lake are amazing, its like watching a dream. The story can be slightly confusing, well to me anyway but is well worth the effort. I hope Jet Li can follow this up, but it is a hard act to follow. Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung offer classy support and Jet Li even gets a rematch with Donnie Yen in Hero. If you liked Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon I highly recommend this film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Breathtaking cinematography, good fights, interesting story. Arguable final.","My eyes (or whatever else part of anatomy that's responsible for perceiving aesthetics) that's been starving for quite some time for something aesthetically nourishing, swallowed this movie in nearly orgasmic spasms. Chinese do know about aesthetics. Dixi.The story is interesting and managed to surprise me a few times (usually it's 1 or 2, so ""a few"" is more than good), although the parallels with Rashomon was striking and made it taste of recycled polythene. On the other hand, what isn't recycled after 10000 years of our attempts to civilization, so I just shut up.Once, only once the movie made me wanna say ""oh, boy, why in the world would you need THAT?!"", it was at the end of the movie.You remember those awkward moments when while visiting a foreign country you're invited to see a local school children choir singing for you in your language a typical folk song from your country, which they make sound like a message from an alien civilization to the Supreme Council of Guinean tree frogs, and everyone's smiling their teeth out and looking for traces of approval in your face, and you're ready to harakiri yourself with a ladle just to escape this realm of overpowering cutesy that looks feels and sounds like a baby shower at Sailor Moon's?OK, so that's how I felt while watching this final scene. Gosh, why make it THAT obvious?... First I just frowned in disgust and thought that I didn't need it at all, I'm enough interested in Oriental culture to not need it at all. Then I thought that maybe there's lots of Western people who in fact need this as a message of intercultural communication (aliens and tree frogs?) or whatever it was... So, well, OK, let it be.Anyway, even the last scene couldn't spoil the aesthetic fiesta I had while watching this movie. I'd give it 9 out of 10 and buy a DVD when it's released at last.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Stylized Hero,"A Chinese proverb says that who a man is one of three things: who he thinks he is, who others think he is, and who he really is. ""Hero"" (Ying xiong) embodies these distinctions in it's unique visual and narrative style. In this case we have the color schemes of red, blue, and white representing the three perspectives. Director Yimou Zhang's visually stunning metaphor is ambitious and satisfying, but ultimately it is not entirely novel storytelling given the epic nature of this movie. Zhang's previous work included the great love stories, ""Raise the Red Lantern"" and ""Ju Dou"". His ""Hero"" is also a tragic love story set in ancient China prior to unification and the building of The Great Wall. However, this is more distracting, given this is suppose to be about the ""Hero"", Jet Li.Qin is one of the 6 kingdoms of pre-unified China. The King of Qin (Daoming Chen) is a ruthless, brutal, and uninspired ruler whose ambition is to rule all of China. Jet Li plays Nameless, one of his officials, who presents the king with the weapons of his three vanquished assassins-- Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung). The suspicious King listens to the story of his ""Hero"" determining whether he is his true savior or an assassin in a grand conspiracy. ""Hero"" has a great premise which falls flat. Jet Li is awesome as Nameless, probably a homage to the Clint Eastwood character in the Sergio Leone movies. Then again this character may be the Chinese mythology. Li has a silent power about him, and is perhaps the best martial arts star of his time. ""Hero"" illustrates the classic path of enlightenment for a warrior/ martial artist-- he trains his body and spirit to defeat his enemy, only to discover that protecting or granting life is the only noble pursuit. This is a great distinction, but I think it is muted somewhat at the very end.The dialog at the beginning of ""Hero"" is very dense. One gets Nameless (Li) is man of few words and a man of action. However, we get a lot of words in the beginning, literally subtitled. The action sequences are beautiful, stunning, and very stylized much like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" in the use of aerial wires. In one sense this is a waste given the world class talent of Jet Li. The best fight scene occurs early on with Nameless (Li) and Sky (Donnie Yen). That is amazing grace, power, and passion. Too bad this spirit is not carried throughout the rest of ""Hero"". ""Hero"" is beautiful to look at, and has something worthwhile to say, but the audience has little emotive investment in the outcome. That is really a shame.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A beautiful and intriguing film......,"This is a wonderful film.First and foremost it is a work of visual art. Every scene is made to be as appealing to the eye as possible. There are shots from the film that one could frame and hang in a gallery. It is a pleasure to just watch.Secondly, the movie is about political intrigue. ""Who is nameless?"" ""What are his motives?"" ""Did he really kill the most dangerous assassins in the land?"" These are the questions the movie asks. The story is quite good. It has no clear good or bad guy, and flips around the perspective several times. The story is one of the best in Chinese action films, and stands up against even more story-driven films.Overall there is little wrong with this movie. Most westerners would disagree with ""The individual doesn't matter"" way of thinking, and it certainly does smack slightly of communism. However, it is a foreign film, and they see things differently. The only other complaint I have is a minor one. Some of the scenes are a touch indulgent. They last longer than necessary and are just prolonging nothing. But that is a matter of taste not quality.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The Usual Suspects entering The Matrix in China,"The fans of this movie may tar and feather me for my opinion: But i am not a fan of all the exaggerated fighting-scenes. Of course, they are well made and really beautiful (i.e. the impressionistic ""Duel in the yellow forest"" remembers me to the gorgeous autumn-leafs-scene in ""Bambi"" ;-), but they are disturbing the story of the movie for me: The fighters ""dancing"" on the roofs, running over the water, flying trough the air... It looks like ""Matrix in China"" for me, but in ""Matrix"" all the fighting scenes are in a logical context, because the complete world in which they fight was only a simulation. But the story of ""Hero"" played in the real world. And i think, that even the best swordsman can't simply ignore the gravity laws. Maybe this is the way such stories was told in China; more like the traditional Chinese theater?On the other side: The story, the core of the movie, was very good: The story was told trough different eyes in different versions, and if you think, you got it and know the truth now, another version of the same incident comes up and all is open again. It was sophisticated and twisted like ""The usual Suspects"". The ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" are not separated. Every new point of view give you new hints... and sometimes the wrong hints.IMHO this movie would work better with less ""Matrix-like"" special effects and with a closer view on the captivating and twisted story.

Garbage,"I acquired the movie Hero on a vacation to San Fransisco, where I encountered a Chinese DVD store and found it ON sale for $10 on DVD. I was initially shocked! A movie which will be released in theatres in a month, on dvd, FOR 10 DOLLARS!!!!! I snatched that movie faster than you can say `Orange Chicken'. So I brought the movie home and watched it. I was impressed at some of the battle scenes during the movie. I waited until the credits where over and then I wiped the confused look off of my face and decided that it was a bad movie.WHY HERO WAS A BAD MOVIE: 1. Movie has only major characters and no minor characters, the movie only employed 7 actors, and the Chinese army 2. Too unreal for me, Crouching Tiger was pushing my limit of Chinese flight while sword fighting, but this movie went way over the line. 3. How the movie was made chronologically, Just garbage. Quentin Tarentino tends to morph the space time continuum with his movies but Hero goes far over the edge by showing you scenes that don't have anything to do with the true plot of the movie!. 4. The moral of the movie. Basically the moral is that if you get revenge you only make things worse. 5. Again I say garbage, for a good reason to. Because that's where this new DVD is currently located in my TV room, In the garbage. (AF rating 57% out of 100) Grade F+ good battle scenes + Go Chinese Archers (So cool) + Jet Lee!!!! -	Bad storyline -	Bad moral -	Slow moving -	After the movie you leave with a feeling of disgust in your mouth, like you just threw-up spaghetti",5.0,Anonymous,History

This was an opera of motion.,"I kept thinking this movie was staged like an opera. The Emperor's courtiers all spoke in unison like a chorus. The colors, the sets, the movements. It was dramatic, poetic, vivid.The movie also kept one guessing through its retelling of the same tale at different layers. There were some parts of the movie telegraphed surely ahead of time. Moments when you knew how it would inexorably resolve. Yet one watched them to see the playing out of tragic demise, just as one might watch Hamlet or Romeo and Juliet. It was not that they were to die, but how.The key to it was the periods of inaction. The pauses before the display of violence, or after.

Beautiful cinematography can't (or shouldn't) help this poorly done film,"This may be a beautifully shot film,it may also be the most beautifully shot film in motion picture history, but i'd like to think that the minds of cinema goers are a bit more open than to have a few nice shots win them over. My major problem with this film is the fact that due to the storyline, all the fights seem to involve someone letting someone else win for one reason or another, so those people wanting to go and see two guys with swords trying to kill each other will feel a little cheated here.Another problem i had was that the director/writer seemed to be trying to throw to many ideas at the screen at once, and although this did result in some good scenes (fight in desert), it did throw up some stupid CGI filled scenes (fight in forest). Which leads me to another point, it could be imagined that the country that seems to be the inventor of martial arts would like to create films that makes martial arts look real and impressive and human. But this film insists on using special effects to show a raindrop bouncing of a sword or to show a whirlwind of leaves which didn't tickle my fancy.Finally, because the script is done badly, it creates characters that are hard to relate to or understand, so when one off them gets killed off, its hard to care.

This is the film Troy should have been,"Ying xiong (Hero) is the film that Troy should have been.  The thing that makes Hero a great movie is the cinematic style rather than the story. Yimou Zhang is a director with a vision on how the film should look and like our dreams, the images prove to be more powerful than the narrative.Like Troy, this is an epic film set in the past, full of legendary characters.  Troy told it's story by filming its' actors reciting their lines.  Hero, on the other hand, develops exquisite images that linger in the mind and burns the legend into our subconscious.  If Yimou Zhang were to come to Hollywood and have $180 million budgets, image that masterpieces he could make.I didn't care for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Compared to Hero, it is a pretender while Hero is the real thing.  I generally avoid foreign language films but Hero is my favorite foreign language film of all time.  The story is pretty simple and people who put more importance on the story over the style will probably be disappointed.

Beautiful in so many ways,"I bought the DVD for HERO as an import from Hong Kong, not knowing what to expect. I had heard several recommendations that the scenery and visuals were gorgeous, but that's about it. I was surprised to find that it actually had a very interesting and engrossing plot as well. The acting was well done, particularly in the portrayals of Flying Snow, Broken Sword, and his servant Moon. The artistic nature of the film is in the vein of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (though don't bother comparing the two beyond that, they're completely different entities other than fighting style, which was a different enough concept here to be original), and literally every camera shot and scene is breathtaking. The unsung heroes of this film are really the cinematography team. There is not a single scene where I didn't marvel at the visuals, or commend those behind the film for creating something original and stimulating. At first I thought the plot was simple, until I got further into it and realized that it was much more complex than I imagined. The storytelling is almost a nod to Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"", changing the nature of the story through different perspectives in flashbacks.Yes, Jet Li's ""Nameless"" character was a tad one-dimensional, but in the context of the film, he's *supposed* to be. You end up feeling less for him, and more for the characters that surround him, but I believe that's the entire point of the film; the concept that the character was only as deep as his mission at the start, and how the events that occur within the story lead to changing him at the end. The same could be said for the plot, which is deceptively more than it appears to be at first.I would fully support a North American release of this film, as I think it's the kind of movie that deserves to be seen by a wider audience.",10.0,Anonymous,History

An Action Film with Several Twists and Turns,"This picture begins in ancient China during the ""Warring States Period"" which features seven rival kingdoms all competing against one another with the Zhou and Qin kingdoms featured most prominently in this film. As the story unfolds, a warrior known simply as ""Nameless"" (Jet Li) comes to the ""King of the Qin"" (played by Daoming Chin) to report that he has killed the three greatest assassins who threaten the King's life. The warrior then goes on to recount the story during which the King grants certain favors to him as a symble of gratitude with the main concession being to allow Nameless to advance to within 10 paces of him. It's at this time that the King begins to observe some flaws in the story which puts a new perspective on everything. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that viewers of action films will probably enjoy this movie quite a bit as it has that one ingredient in spades. It also has several twists and turns which are certainly interesting in their own right. Unfortunately, as far as the action scenes are concerned, there were a number of preposterous stunts which I thought actually lessened the film's overall entertainment value. Likewise, the manner in which the story kept being recounted-with certain key changes in the process-didn't help that much either. In short, although this film was well received by most viewers, I didn't find it all that entertaining and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Awesome flicck,"Director Yimou Zhang takes us through Nameless' story first, spreading the battle sequences thick, allowing them to take their own time. In the King's version, certain battles are then revised, which is remarkably brave considering that some battles are utter fabrications. In one such fictitious fight, in a faultlessly designed set, Nameless and Sky (Donnie Yen) close their eyes and fight out the battle within their minds. Screen time is being spent lavishly on showing how two characters contemplated a fight, whilst fighting each other in a battle that never occurred. It is confusing certainly, but perhaps Zhang wished for his audience to get lost in the plot's design so that they would not question the warrantability of half of the battle sequences, which make up most of the film.Yet, it is difficult to ponder these details when they are made so utterly insignificant when viewing such a spectacle. The sheer beauty of the battles, the gentle floating of the assassins as they fly around their arenas (which range from a forest full of orange leafed trees, crisp leaves falling down to the ground like rain, to the crystal clear and calm of a mountain lake), the costumes of characters at varying stages in the story line (red for passion, green for youth, white for truth, blue for love), the amazing army scenes which feature thousands of arrows being fired into the sky to create a black cloud that descends right on top of the camera, all these elements combine to produce a faultlessly perfect image on the screen, each frame a worthy photograph that gently reminds you why cinema is the greatest art form of the twentieth century.And characterisation is not lost in this beauty as one may have feared. Despite the irritating two dimensional performance of Zhang Ziyi as Moon, the other actors carry off fine performances, especially Tony Leung Chiu Wai as Broken Sword and Daoming Chen as the King. Their performances are especially credible as they are often drowning in the memories of the King and Nameless - they need to change slight mannerisms in order to reflect whose mind they are now in.",8.0,Anonymous,History
It's a beautiful movie.,"What people who aren't Chinese and who don't know much about Chinese culture fail to understand, is that the warrior mythology portrayed in films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero has its roots in a particular genre of fiction that has been around much longer than television or film.Having grown up reading a bunch of these stories of epic fantasy, I remember being surprised when I went to watch CTHD in the theaters, and saw the audience break out in laughter at the flying stunts. I suppose the concept probably does seem ridiculous to foreigners.The whole deal with the flying is this:In the stories, the world of ""Giang Hu"" mentioned in CTHD is the unconventional part of society in which the characters that practice high transcendent martial arts exist. ""Giang Hu"" literally translates to something like ""lakes and rivers"", which kind of is a cultural allusion to the fact that most of these people wander a whole lot participating in great duels of swordsmanship and all kinds of tragic drama.One of the forms of transcendent martial arts is ""chin guon"", which translates to something like ""the art of lightness"". It's a skill that these warrior folk develop from a young age using various methods that make it so they can move as if they were light as a feather. I think the idea is that they're trained so that they progressively have less and less of a perception of their own weight, and thus they can run up walls and fly across rooftops in style. If you don't understand, well, too bad.I find Chinese warrior mythology pretty interesting, and the problem is that these novels do not translate well. I'm not sure if anyone has ever tried. A lot of what goes on in them has a lot of cultural relevance and wouldn't be readily understood by certain people who have Western sensibilities. Hong Kong and Taiwan have for a couple of decades produced a lot of television shows that portray these stories, but they're mostly pretty cheesy like American soap operas. Which is why I find a film like Hero refreshing. Everything about the film's cinematography tells the story as as a fable, a fairy tale, a good myth where the characteristics that make the hero aren't so easily defined.I might as well also say that I enjoyed it far more than I did CTHD, since everyone else is comparing this film to that one.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A feast for the eyes that, ultimately, ends up being mostly empty calories.","There's no doubt 'Hero (2002)' is lavish, with opulent production design decorating sometimes upwards of eighteen-thousand period-dressed extras and elaborate fight choreography coming up in almost each and every scene (whether or not it's honestly needed). However, all of its splendour tells a tale that essentially amounts to very little other than thinly veiled pseudo-propaganda (though an argument can be made for full-blown propaganda) that paints one of China's past ruthless dictators as a misunderstood 'hero'. No amount of overindulgent excess can fix that or do anything towards making you care about the admittedly impressive visuals you're seeing. All it does is drive the budget through the roof. This was - at its release, at least - China's most expensive motion picture and, while it certainly shows in the scale of the scenery, it isn't reflected by the scope of the story. It's not like the movie is particularly bad. The action-sequences are usually quite breath-taking, using their literal 'story' nature to 'make sense of' - or otherwise solidify - and accentuate their slightly fantastical nature. They often fall into a place of total inconsequence, though, with some being entirely invented even within the possibly invented narrative in which they appear. They also usually lack the weight to make them feel tangible, impactful or properly consequential. This is something not helped by the fact that we know how most of them turn out, due to the poorly acted framing device. This actually acts as more of a limitation than a unique way to tell the tale. It does allow for various perspectives to be placed upon similar events, which are portrayed with varying colour schemes to initially unnoticed but ultimately appreciated effect, but doesn't allow for enough divergence within the narrative and neuters the possibility of anything having any real consequence until the movie catches up with itself. Once it does, its message becomes even more confused and more likely to inspire an eyebrow being raised than the swell of pride that's intended. By this time, the poor pace of the piece has become grating, to the point that the previously somewhat awe-inspiring fight-work has become kind of a chore to sit through, which, perhaps strangely, makes the ending feel less definitive than it actually is. This is really because there isn't a sense of structure, no proper finale outside of an uncharacteristic choice that only serves to pander to the movie's agenda, as opposed to the natural direction of the character's intentions. There are some slightly resonant themes stuck in there, though, even if you have to read past some pretty operatically iffy outside elements to get to them. In the end, the film is much more impressive from a visual standpoint than a narrative one. Even this doesn't hold up, though, because you don't really care about the characters and, as such, can't stay fully engaged throughout. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History

Wow.,"Beautifully made cross between Rashomon (the storytelling), Ran (the 7 kingdoms) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (the effects) has a nameless warrior (Jet Li) on a visit to the King of Qin. He tells him how he defeated the King's 3 main enemies. But not everything is how it seems in this wonderful picture.Zhang's recent picture House of the Flying Daggers might not have been what everybody's been expecting, but 'Hero' is so beautiful at times it hurts your eyes. Scenes in particular to look out for are the sword dance on the water and a breathtaking scene including thousands and thousands of bows. You keep your mouth closed in that scene...Maybe not such a huge surprise as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but a movie for everyone to see. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Unlike some on these boards, I have no problems with the performances of the actors. They do justice to the script, despite some interesting subtitling. Nor would I fault the big battle group scenes. I loved the Kurosawa influences. A sea of banners and flags always looks great in the wind.

A film that needs two reviews,"Hero is a unique film in that it needs two reviews. The first review would be founded upon the standard set of criteria: production, directing, scripting, acting, cinematography. On nearly all of those measures, Hero remains an outstanding effort.Unfortunately, there is another criteria that simply cannot be ignored, especially with regard to this film. This film fails miserably in terms of its message. It is, in fact, a government sponsored propaganda film, and given that said government is the Chinese Communist Party, then this message cannot morally be overlooked.We have here a beautiful film that tells the story of a young man with exceptional kung-fu talents, so well developed that it appears he is impervious to mortal risk in combat. And yet, having spent over an hour of film explaining this reality, as well as treating said man's honorable quest to right great evil, when presented the very moment he has carefully planned for, he abandons his entire quest and allows himself to be killed by the very evil man he wishes to vanquish.Why the sudden change of heart?Nothing more than said evil leader's appeal to the nationalistic need to even embrace evil if said evil controls the future of a nation!This sort of fascistic evil would hardly be tolerated if any western director and production studio had attempted to peddle it. Rightly, such a production would be widely condemned for defending evil.For those who have to earn a living within the Chinese Communist system, such as director Yimou Zhang, one has to carefully phrase things to balance between a compelling desire to tell the truth, and an understandable desire to avoid torture in prison.For his part, director Zhang has said, ""The Chinese censorship system has been in practice for many years. I don't think there will be much change in society in the short run. This situation has been present for a long time and it is a reality in China. I work and live in this system.""He also said this, ""When I look back at the times I shot artistic movies, I found I learned quite a lot from them. I hope to do both -- make more personal films which I prefer; and in certain circumstances, I will shoot some other commercial movies like these two -- Hero and House of the Flying Daggers.""Finally, to perhaps fully explain the director's actual views, there is this quote he made: ""Western audiences can gain an impression of China from my films. This is an excellent channel for promoting China's culture.""When one puts those three quotes together, one can piece together the honest expressions of a conflicted man, one trapped in a system of censorship, where he has to produce movies paid for by the Chinese Communist film industry, and also avoid any criticisms of it that would land him in prison.On every moral foundation, Hero must be looked at from both an artistic and political level, because it is a movie spectacularly well made, that was intended from the start to be a propaganda film that supported the Chinese Communist government. The masterful director who created the film seems to be trying to thread his way through a risky political needle, to both express his fears, but also avoid suffering for those expressions.A movie, who's mission is to support evil, cannot be considered a positive effort, regardless of how hard the people work to try to make it a masterful creation. This is sad, because it reveals human talent being abused by selfish interests, and in that regard, the ultimate truth of this movie is that it stands as a warning beacon for the dangers in state sponsorship of films. Perhaps one day, even those who made this film will be able to finally stand free and state their own moral angst at having been forced to make it the way they did.Until then, we, who do live free, must say it for them. This movie, ultimately, must be measured more by the politics that created it, vice the production values it otherwise possesses.",5.0,Anonymous,History
All of the above,"Judging by the wide range of views expressed in the ever enlightening IMDB boards, I'd say Hero is destined to become a ""classic"". Real art invites multiple interpretations.Yes, this may be Chinese propaganda. Yes, it may be Kurosawa-lite. Yes, it's incredibly beautiful and provocative. Yes, it can be boring and indulgent. Yes, it's a post-modern assessment of what it really means to be a hero. (Jet Li told a reporter recently, ""I wish the world didn't need heros."")I quite enjoyed it, for the most part.

"A true work of art, but with a weak plot.","I think this is without question the most beautiful film I've ever seen. As far as cinematography is concerned and it is a pure delight to watch. Some amazing visual effects, particularly with a fight scene in the rain, an entire army firing arrows and leaves falling from trees and changing colour all had the audience gasping. Also some stunning location filming too. I've heard some complaints however from my Chinese friends that the film is simply 'too beautiful'. This is because this film is considered to be not a true representation of the 'wushu' fighting style as it is slowed down and made more appealing for a western audience. To me this does not diminish my enjoyment of the film at all. My only complaint would be that the story although having a beautiful ethereal quality, it's only really somewhat of a weak fairy-tale. It could have had more of a historical storyline with a plot that was really leading somewhere of substance. In my view well worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Eye Opener,"This movie was incredible. To start off, the story line was brilliant, and the acting as well as the special effects was very well done. Jet Li was awesome throughout this entire film. To Start off... the plot: The plot was very well throughout. There are so many different twists from start to finish i don't even know where to begin. But, even with all of these twists, it was still easy to follow. But i must say, the writing of the script definitely made the film. Although the dialogue didn't play a major role throughout, it was very simple and philosophical. As great as the plot was, lets not forget that this was an action movie. And it did not disappoint, the mystical fighting i feel has not worked in the past (crouching tiger, hidden dragon sucked), but it definitely did in this movie. The scene where they fight over the water was incredible. Not to mention that each scene throughout this movie had a theme of colors that typically followed what the characters were wearing in that scene. This particularly worked well throughout this movie because the colors are so vibrant and alive that it made the fighting sequences throughout that more special. Overall the camera work and cinematography was without a doubt some of the best i've ever seen, and i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to take a break from all of the Hollywood crap.",9.0,Anonymous,History

A Visually stunning epic,Hero is a gorgeous looking movie probably best seen on the big screen. The colors are phenomenal and the action sequences are beautifully choreographed. A lot of people will probably be put off by the subtitles but this film will work best in its original language because it adds greatly to the atmosphere that you are viewing historic events in a distant land.Favorite scene is the fight sequence in the forest amid the fallen leaves. So amazing and Zhang Ziyi never seems to disappoint me. She is wonderful even in her smaller role here.The story is actually pretty simple on the surface though the fact that the scenes are not sequential will throw off some of the audience. You do need to pay attention. Then there are other layers thrown in to the story that deal with the philosophy of the Chinese people that give the story its richness.

"Very, very disappointing.","Okay, I just watched the movie the whole way through, after giving up about one-third in, on the first try. I don't see what is so ""beautiful"" about this - Sure, the scenery is great, but I can't get past the fact that the ""Martial Arts"" is so completely bogus. If you want martial arts, rent a Jackie Chan flick (or at least, I should say, one of the good Jackie Chan flicks.) If you want to see a movie even worse than CTHD as far as ""hey, we're Chinese, we don't HAVE gravity or physics of any kind here!"" goes, rent Hero. I'm not sure about the message they're trying to get across with this film - it was pretty difficult to tolerate. There was no realistic fighting at all in this movie.

Too Short...Way Too Short,"This was a GREAT movie! It was a lot like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but with almost non-stop action. Jet Li played his usual quiet unassuming, but confident hero. He is a good martial arts star, but he is NOT what made this movie great...The direction and cinematography were what made the movie great. Spectacular scenes like a rain of tens of thousands of arrows and a duel in the autumn leaves. There was the constant blowing of silk in the breeze. It was a stunning motion picture...Ziyi Zhang, from Crouching Tiger and Rush Hour 2, was her usual snarly self.The characters of Broken Sword and Snow were much more complex and enjoyable. In the various retellings of the same story, relationships are invented, changed and destroyed. People die in flashback, only they didn't REALLY die, only maybe they did...who knows.An interesting feature to this movie is that you never see blood on any of the characters (my son noticed this). It might pool at their feet or drip off of a sword, but the wardrobe remains untouched. I feel that this symbolizes the god-like purity of the characters.The only problem that I have with the movie, outside of wanting more, was they death of key characters at the end (I won't tell you which one(s)).

A very good movie except for the wirework,"Hero is a classic Chinese drama/tragedy.Comparisons to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon will be made, but the two movies are very different. The cinematography in Hero was better and the tale is told in mostly flashback as opposed to ""realtime"" in CTHD.I must admit, though, that I think the wire work detracts horribly from the grace and beauty of the martial arts scenes. I really don't know why Chinese directors are so enamored by it, and unfortunately American directors are becoming more enamored with it, too. And to be bluntly honest, this movie could have used at least one unarmed combat scene, instead of being all weapons.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Very moving reflection of the Chinese spirit,"This visually stunning story illustrates key Chinese cultural concepts and behaviors. The twining of calligraphy, a literate art, and swordsmanship, a martial art, into a spiritual guiding principle within one's heart is a very basic tenet of Chinese accomplishments. The idea of revering high-level ideals above one's own personal goals and the willingness to sacrifice oneself is also very Chinese. The idea of deeply respecting one's enemy as an equal versus the political need to kill any potential opponents in order to establish unity is also a fundamental aspect of Chinese history and politics. As a matter of fact, Chinese people have a ubiquitous cultural tendency to compete constantly and to seek individual glory, frequently leading to dissension among the land. The sub-plot of Snow and Broken Sword's love story is also an interesting story, frequently illustrated in the Chinese psyche: how a woman can sometimes become caught up in one's own emotional perception without understanding her mate's vision and thus ultimately destroy each other... All scenes are breathtakingly haunting and gorgeous, whether the intimate indoor scenes, the outdoor scenes, the fight duels, the army maneuvers, or the face to face conversation with the Emperor Qin. I was moved to tears by the ending, the self-immolation of Nameless own free will... Martyrdom for the greater good is very much a part of the Chinese psyche. Thus, our Hero, he who is well-named.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Another Great Zhang YiMou Film,"Many of Zhang Yi Mou's films are artistic in their portrayal of often very simple messages. While the plot of Hero is intriguing and even sometimes confusing (seeing it twice or three times clarifies), Zhang keeps the message to a point and still places heavy emphasis on creating beauty. Like a masterful artist, he relies on a wide range of media to create his masterpiece: from simple dialogue (two words in the end) to majestic scenes (of rocky desert mostly) and (quite simply) a lot of color. Some of his other films such as The Road Home and Red Sorghum also share these similarities.Hero pushes a very simple idea and yet takes a very intricate path of telling it. Never is any scene overly emotional, nor is any scene forced. Although many scenes are seemingly repeated, they are never the same and sometimes seem to contradict what already happened. Most people I know who have seen this movie felt it was confusing the first time around. Once they saw it twice, they all agreed that the movie flows flawlessly until the end.Hero also has one of the greatest soundtracks of any Zhang movie, rivaling that of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon's Soundtrack. Dun Tan lends his skills to the soundtracks of both movies. While the two OST's cannot be directly compared, I would prefer listening to the OST of Hero anyday.Overall Score: 10/10 - No complaints here",10.0,Anonymous,History

Stunning with expert craftsmenship,"Zhang Yimou is one of the best filmmakers alive.  All I needed to see was Red Shorgum to know this, but Hero confirmed it.  With this cast (5 of China's (and the world's) best), crew , and budget, this film was basically destined to be great.  Even with that, I was worried Zhang might take the Kung Fu movie and slow it down (like his later work) beyond recognition. Thank the gods this did not happen.  It was quickly paced with innovative and beautiful fights that were shot as well as anything Zhang yimou has done (which is saying a lot).  The first fight of the film was particularly incredible in it's editing, sound, choreography, and cinematography.  And the narrative structure and characters were interesting enough not to get in the way of the shear beauty of this film.A couple of extra notes before I go... This movie has nothing in common with Crouching Tiger besides genre, so stop comparing them because you've seen no other Kung Fu movies, it's ridiculous. Also, if Miramax releases a shortened version in theaters (which is likely) call Miramax and tell them you hate them, because that's just stupid.  And finally, to the Americans reading, I implore you to go and find out why Zhang Yimou is as good as Scorcese and anyone else in the US and, indeed, is head and shoulders above the rest in terms of cinematography.  His films are consistently more beautiful than anything else I've seen.  I HIGHLY recommend Red Shorgum and Ju Dou.  They rock.  As does Hero...with authority.",10.0,Anonymous,History

9/10 - Cinematography at its finest,"Review: A movie filled with great use of colour scheme and background makes for a beautiful movie. The story itself is quite long-winded and feels a bit 'slapped together'. Overacting works well in this movie because it emphasizes the behaviour of each character (the strong voice of a king, the neutral voice of 'the unnamed warrior', the calm natured voice of Leung Chi Wai). The cinematography is at its FINEST, there is no other equal (unless you include IMAX films). The landscaping shots however include a very ominous musical score that tends to make me go to sleep (not literally sleep but contemplating it). Scratch off 1 point for the undeniably long scenery shots.9/10 - Cinematography at its finest",8.0,Anonymous,History
A stunningly beautiful thesis on the role of a hero,"As many will say, this is not a mainstream movie.  It is an art film.  And if you watch it, hoping for some grand epic tale, you will be disappointed. However, if you look closer, you will find one of most well-done films in recent memory that attempts to define what the role of a hero is and the sacrifices it requires.  It is an essay on human nature and how circumstances may often compel us to do what we would have previously considered unthinkable.  The real strength of this movie lies in its structure - it is a story told within another story.  This framework provides the director amazing flexibility in utilizing visual cues to portray metaphors and symbols.Note:  Reading up a little about early imperial China and the Seven Kingdoms helps to provide context for the movie and brings greater weight to the events and allusions in it (such as the emperor declaring that he would standardize the written language).",10.0,Anonymous,History

Sets are more real than real. I'd heard that a lot of this film was shot on actual ancient locations in China, and it certainly seems to be the case. The action is oddly paced for American audiences, but once you let yourself fall into this movie it absorbs every crumb of your attention.  You *believe* in these people. The message at the end, which some here are misinterpreting as the crushing of the individual, is one of profound depth . . . that the highest expression of the warrior's art is to make war no more, to move beyond the need for it.  To see that the trivial battles of the moment are in the long run more harmful than helpful. Like ""Crouching Tiger"", the film holds the audience spellbound despite the undubbed Chinese dialogue.  The actors' lines are sparse anyway, and the subtitles never seem to intrude or break the fourth wall.

However, this movie impressed me a lot. I've watched this movie in school for film class. At first, I was not expecting anything because I didn't really like Chinese movie. However, as I watched all the movie, cinematography started to impress me. The story was kind of weird (I guess that's the reason why I couldn't give 10) but the cinematography grabbed my attention and started to make me enjoy the movie more.

But instead of Kurosawa's extreme realism,Yimou fuses Chinese pre-dynastic history and fantasy in a mannermuch more similar to classic HK martial arts films. While theevents leading up to the first Chinese emperor has been donemore credibly elsewhere, it's never been presented more vividly.Jet Li (who would have been a welcome replacement to ChowYun-Fat in Crouching Tiger...) is one of only a few actors who couldpulled off both the athletic and acting demands here. Donnie Yen,Maggie Cheung, Zhang Ziyi, and Tony Leung round out a fine cast.The action is spectacular, often shown in medium slow motion tocapture the grace of the martial arts.

Visually Amazing But Not Yimou Zhang's Best,"""Hero"" is popular and commonly known as Yimou Zhang's best movie and I heard it has the biggest Chinese movie budget .. well, it is a good movie but I think the visual effects were superb but the story was So-So .. so, that's why it isn't my most favorite of Yimou Zhang's .. the acting was good, nothing special though .. I expected something from Jet Li but unfortunately he was just about the average. I prefer others of YZhang's to it such as: House of Flying Daggers, The Road Home, To Live & Not One Less.What bugs me about is that some of the fighting scenes aren't that good but some also were amazingly perfect. I believe the passions weren't shown in the best way .. when I was watching I felt something is missing. Overall, it is a joy to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The word for today is ostentatious!,"Ostentatious pretty much sums up ""Hero"". Ostentatious being something that is made to be flashy/showy. That's this movie in a nut shell. Made to look pretty, but the fire shown in the fight scenes in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" isn't here. In fact the fights all look and feel astonishingly staged to the point that you are rolling your eyes. The performances are over-dramatic. Example: Jet Li is fighting another guy on a lake (and I mean on it, they're jumping off the water) and a drop of water from their fight lands on the body of the guy's dead lover, so this guy ignores Jet Li only to run over to his lover's body and wipe the drop away while looking mournful. That's not deep, that's asinine. The shallow depth of all the characters is attempted to be concealed by fancy dialogue and incomprehensible actions by the characters. Overall weak, and over-dramatic.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"""The sword resides not in the hand but in the heart.""","Don't really have a whole lot to say other than it was a great film, the fight scenes were spectacular to marvel at, the colours were an absolute feast for my eyes (even if I was unable to interpret what the colours may have symbolised), and the twist was simply shocking, and that feeling was intensified by a plentitude of successive plot-twists as the third act became progressively nuanced. The third act is really where things stepped up a notch or two, as it is just incredible to say the least.But the reason I'm not giving this a perfect rating is purely because this picture didn't have as much of a deep impact on me as I would've hoped for or at least expected.But in saying that, there aren't actually any obvious faults with this feature so it's definitely one that I'd recommend for your viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Combines action and visual artistry to spectacular effect,"Set in the Warring States period when China was divided into seven kingdoms that all fought with each other for overall supremacy. An expert swordsman simply called Nameless is brought to the king of the most powerful kingdom, Qin. He has the weapons of the three most feared assassin enemies of the king, all three he claims to have killed. He is allowed access to communicate with the remote leader and from here he tells the stories of his victories.It has to be said at the outset that the primary reason that this film is so successful is its absolutely incredible imagery. The cinematography is simply breath-taking with the cinematic frame used in a spectacularly beautiful manner. Specifically, the use of colour is quite wonderful. Each story segment has its own specific colour scheme that defines it and is utilised to impressive artistic effect. The stories are highly stylised, yet tell a historical story and while the scope often feels epic there is a very personal approach taken much of the time. The characters often express intense emotions and this personalises the events considerably. Like others in the wuxia sub-genre, this one includes many scenes of martial arts performed by highly skilled individuals who glide through the air in gravity defying routines. These fight scenes are filmed with an extreme focus on aesthetics and they are consistently rather beautiful. It's all over-the-top in the most glorious way and, for want of a better description, Hero is the ultimate example of an art-house action movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History

a special movie,"The first time I saw this movie, I thought it had lots of problems. For example, many fighting scenes disobey physical laws due to the wireworks, which renders them unrealistic.

It seems to have some special attractions.Maybe because it is too beautiful and arty: The mountains, lakes, deserts and ubiquitous winds, the fighting scenes (although sometimes not realistic), the yells during the fighting (borrowed from Peking Opera), some creative SFX and super cool body movements.In a summary, this movie is recommended for a viewing.

A brilliant movie despite the rhetoric,"There are a lot of comments out there that this movie is trying to brainwash the chinese population. Perhaps. Then again can I ask you what movie does brainwash us? Every movie portrays some sort of ideology, Disney for instance often portray a patriarchal society. American movies often try and sell the idea of Democracy to the rest of the world. Now I am not anti-democracy, but these movies still brainwash. A lot of the people that make the comments on brainwashing only see them, because they come from another society and mentality. To a chinese the idea of falling in line with the West or a war in order to prevent the spread of Communism (e.g. Vietnam, Korea, Angola etc, etc) might seem brainwashing. So when you watch this movie, rather than judge it by its principals, enjoy it for its stories, characters and cinematography...and if you have a problem with brainwashing start at looking in your own culture before judging others! As they might be judging you the same way!This movie is great to watch!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Disappointing,"I had been waiting for at least a year when I went to see ""hero"". So maybe I was expecting too much, because it really was a disappointment to me. I don't know if the dubbing was part of the problem. When I watched ""crouching tiger,..."", I saw it in Chinese with English subtitles. But this time, the film was dubbed in English, and I can't stress enough on how bad it was. All the dramatic scenes were overplayed, and because of that, the movie theater broke into laughter on many occasions during scenes which were supposed - I think - to be dramatic. And the translation didn't help either. I mean the English-dubbed script doesn't sound of Chinese origin, at least in martial arts movies. It sounded like a parody.As for the fight scenes, well I don't want to keep comparing to ""crouching tiger,..."", but the director seemed to be over-stressing on the artistic side of it while wasting much of the substance. I understand that the color theme of each scene was on purpose and it was related to each version of the story told by either ""nameless"" or the king, but this was too distracting to really enjoy those scenes.Regarding the actors, ""Jet Li"" was plain and unimpressive as usual. ""Maggie Cheung"" was good, and ""Zhang Ziyi""'s role was useless; at least how her acting made it seem to be.Again, I never really thought that dubbing a movie could pretty much ruin it, so I think I'd have to watch it in its original version so I could make a clear opinion about it, but for now I'll give it a 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Crouching Tiger meets The Usual Suspects,"Superb cinematography, striking base-color costumes, fluid fight/ weapon choreography, exquisite sceneries ..... all at the expense of the plot - which is so thin (in order to deliver the many versions of the same events) that not even the stellar casts could pull it off. To those of us that have some background in Chinese history of the period -the entire story becomes utterly implausible, and the lack of character development rendered the main protagonists two-dimensional (only one actor shines through - the venerable mainland actor Chen whose portrayal of Emperor Tsin is somewhat fleshed out). In my opinion, Zhang YM should return to what he does best - vignettes of peasant lives or family dramas.Despite incorporating the many breathtaking Chinese landscapes and organizing thousands of army extras into some of the grandest scenes since Ben-Hur, Zhang definitely lacks Tsui Hak's vision of what constitutes a great period Kung-Fu movie (nor did Ang Lee succeed in this genre - CTHD was a novelty to the uninitiated Western audience but largely panned by jaded Asian audiences).Granted ""Hero"" was a beautifully-crafted vehicle to showcase Zhang's talents, but what a waste of resources! The film would have been a masterpiece in the hands of someone like Tsui, but now it's only a shadow of the equally inadequate CTHD.See it for some of the most stunning picture compositions in recent years, ignore the storyline and don't expect anything new in the martial arts scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A revolutionary Chinese film, but can be done better","After the first screening of Hero in China in the end of 2002, it was said that half of the audience cried while another half fell asleep. I think this is a very good and accurate comment on this film. I personally enjoyed this film a lot because of the cast (Maggie Zhang and Tony Leung are my favourite), the score, the cinematography and even the costume design. It is indeed the largest budget film ever made in China, and with Zhang yimou, it can not be bad.However,the ideology of Hero is a strange and arguable thing. On one hand, the idea of union and sacrifice is perfectly understandable to Chinese people (if not so understandable to people from other parts of the world.) This is the reason for those people who burst into tears. On the other hand, it is somehow overdone and appears to be too ideal. People who fell asleep said the story is hollow and stupid; the film clearly aims to get an Oscar,therefore just a piece of commercial rubbish. I am in between of these two argument, I believe that as the best director of the fifth generation in China, Zhangyimou is ambitious to make something big. And if An Lee can won an Oscar by directing Crouching Tigger, why can't he make it? This motive certainly add the commercial factor in the film. But as Zhangyimou said, he is a Wuxia fan since childhood and always desires to make a film about it. He is now in his prime of career and has gained enough fame to make the world take notice of his talent, I think it is natural that he directed Hero which is so different from his previous works. And now his second Wuxia film is coming out soon, I am looking forward to see it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
SO beautiful and brilliant ...see this film!,"I believe this may be the most perfect film I have ever seen.

The costume design was astounding and beautiful - such difficult historical-based set and costume designs at that. The musical score is haunting and sweetly sad, just like the story - pay close attention to everything. Direction, cinematography, editing - all sharp and flawless.It was 96 minutes of some of the most beautiful moving art I've seen.One would be extremely hard pressed to find fault in ""Hero/Ying xiong"". I am hoping it may qualify as a Oscar contender, but it may not happen as it was released in 2002. But that all doesn't matter. Corny as all this may sound, I feel this picture is one everyone must see. And the end's message is so very timely and truthful.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Good film,"Zhang Imou always gives us a visual feast and this legendary fantasy with Jet Li is no exception.  From the standpoint of the expression of the mythic journey in Chinese culture, the conflicts of human passion and morality often take complex turns and varied appearances.  The flashbacks work well, with the mendacity of the plot well integrated into the storyline.  The movement of the tale develops slowly, deliberately, like the metaphoric calligraphy wrought by the warrior artists.  The whole tale becomes a huge canvas upon which these intersecting plots mingle, change and emerge at the end.  It's not perfect and there a few strands that do not get tucked away, but the film works and works well-- as long as you don't look at with the criteria of a Western drama, which several reviewers herein have done.  To be sure, you can say anything damn thing you want in this commentaries but to stretch this fine piece of art on a board built for a Euro-American epic misses the point and renders a disservice in my view.The film is visually satisfying with many wonderful moments of fine acting. Jet Li who often is cast in the protagonist role of a Rice Western, is superb in his controlled performance.  I plan to see this film again on the big screen and get the DVD when it's available.  I suggest the same for you.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A little too much violin for me.,"Sure, visually stunning. Sure, great story. Sure good acting. Maybe I'm a little biased because I have been watching Martial Arts movies since I was about 12 (in my early forties now), but even though I liked ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", the overused violin during the fight scenes is something I just can't get into. I find it makes those scenes, in particular, really boring. I do like the trend of using subtitles instead of dubbing in English. Some of the voices used in some of the earlier Martial Arts movies were just awful.

"Beautifully Shot, Amazing Fighting and Well Told Story!","Hero is beautifully shot. The scenes are mesmerizing and the fighting is flawlessly displayed. This is an instant movie classic on par with Crouching Tiger. And like Crouching Tiger, this film stands firmly as an adventure/drama and does NOT attempt to weave in comedy or slapstick, as the last follow-up to Tiger did (Iron Monkey - also a great and classic film but very different). And also like Iron Monkey, Hero was previously released in Asia years before the American debut. I would highly recommend this film to any fan of martial arts films. Jet Li has a champion role, but Donnie Yen, Maggie Cheung & Zhang Ziyi are all in top fighting form. Plus, the acting from this all-star cast is excellent as expected. Unlike Iron Monkey and Crouching Tiger, Hero uses a non-linear approach to tell the story. This approach works very well for Hero, even though some of the flash-backs/perspectives may confuse some. However, in our post-Pulp Fiction era, this approach is to me always refreshing. And in Hero, it is an appropriate device to slowly reveal the true essence of each character and their real motives in the tale. Hero is the kind of movie to be watched again and again!",9.0,Anonymous,History
***Now this is traditional Chinese cinema***,"This movie was the best movie Jet Li has made. The story really pulled you in and kept a tight hold, and the cinematography was pure eye candy!

This was right up there with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". This movie is a must see, specially if you like traditional Chinese martial-arts cinema. Not the bastardized versions America puts out, low-grade knock-offs that they are. All violence and no story or heart. However as I always say, Make up your own mind.

...like a fine Artwork from a real Master,"...and nice moments will this movie presenting you. After the whole bunch of film masses products this film exposes like a fine jade figure from real master. A composing of pictures,colours, lyricks and mystic elements. The character studies are not based on deep psychological analysis, the are more representionals for the state of mind in this chinese era - pride,anger,vengeance,fear,brave,...(comparable to the Knights in Europe)and are surpassed by a higher ideal - a new time has began for the biggest Nation of the world. So its Not so deep in philosophical questions like f.ex. Nitzsches works (oh dear! :-)) but much more heart-captive. This unusual high-quality work is very unorthodox is oundstanding from the masses of Hong Kong-Productions. The film is entertaining and spiritual as well, and is especially interesting for people who are interested in China`s spiritual elements in its history. Despite the fighting scenes are awesome, this film is not made for hardcore-martial art fans, but for people who always liked to hear tales from far countries and kingdoms with surreal elements. So i would this tale more with western tales like King Arthur from Camelot or Wallenstein, the tragic german hero.Overall, if you like watching movies in cinema, you will ""need"" to watch this movie - its like bracing shower.4.5 of 5 Stars (or 8.5 of 10).P.S.

Delicately put together,"When China was at war with itself and one king attempted to conquer all of it, a nameless man comes to him claiming to have killed the three assassins that have tried to take him out. This shows the Asian love of flowing movement(clothes, hair, leaves), a respect of natural elements and a poetry to the movements and choreography of martial arts. It is beautiful, and at the same time, the action is very cool. There is careful use of slow-motion and close-ups. The story has twists and is thoroughly engaging, and the structure is somewhat like Kurosawa's Rashomon, with the truth being revealed gradually, over time, as different stories are told. This is presented as a legend, and how much of it is true is unclear. That gives it a level of freedom that it uses rather well. Several of the laws of physics take a bit of a backseat to the splendor of the fights(and we get at least one battle that I've never seen equalled). The plot is inspirational, if not everyone will agree with the moral. This has pretty good acting, if Li remains unemotional even when it seems like he should express something. There is a little blood and suggested sexuality in this. I recommend this to fans of the genre. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Not Too Bad, But No Crouching Tiger","Hero has some good features: some good fights, good acting by Daoming Chen (the king), great locations, and a couple of interesting stunts. But on the whole it's not a very good movie.The biggie: the plot. It's annoying to see the same scene played out over and over again. (as one filmgoer asked, how many times is she going to die?). The overt message of peace (in a martial arts flick?) is blatantly contradicted by the explicit endorsement of the brutal slaughter of innocents in the name of 'Greater China'. The dialogue seems stilted, and the story is shortened to incoherence by being played out four times.Also weak: most of the action sequences. The wirework (flying scenes a la Crouching Tiger) is not up to Crouching Tiger/Matrix standards. It's hard to explain, but where in those movie people leaped gracefully, in this movie people sort of shoot here and there like jet planes. It's distracting and not very elegant.Other annoyances: Most of the acting is not very good and the movie demands acting since there is a lot of screen time devoted to lovers sacrificing themselves, tense dialogues, and political statements. Xhang Ziyi is badly misused as little more than a pretty porcelain doll that cries rather too often. The soundtrack is really rather bad, distracting from and sometimes clashing with the scenes, mostly too loud but sometimes hard to hear. There are also a lot of 'Gladiator' style graphics that are poorly executed, especially the flying arrows.On the whole it could be enjoyed over beer as a rental but it's no 'must see in the theater' classic. Not only is Crouching Tiger greatly superior but so are a whole generation of Hong Kong kung fu epics (including most of Jet Li's earlier movies). Do yourself a favor and rent one of them instead of paying full price for this one.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful and complex.,"This film is visually beautiful and its story complex.  The visually stunning aspect is something that one can only describe in words and those who have no sight would need a great wordsmith to give true weight to the beauty of HERO.  This, no doubt, will be the focus of countless critiques of HERO.  But what enhances the visual beauty is the complex nature of the story.  The taboo of American screenwriting, flashbacks within flashbacks are used liberally.  The idea of the unreliable narrator takes you on an ""thinking"" trip.  As the stories weave in and out of each other and different scenarios are presented to you, your mind is working while at the same time you are inundated with the visual ""look"" of what is on screen.  I will close my critique in linking this Chinese film to the great Japanese filmmaker Kurosawa,  With that said anyone who reads this will, if they have an inkling of the greatness of Kurosawa, rush to see this epic of honor, nobility and passion.

A sumptuous visual feast with a multi-layered story,"Zhang Yimou's ""Hero"" is set in ancient China's during the Warring States period. After presenting evidence of having slain a trio of deadly assassins, a nameless prefect is granted an audience with the King of Qin. As he recounts the story of his deeds it soon becomes apparent that the situation is more complicated than either of them realized.Within this framework, Zhang gradually unveils a multi-layered story that examines the true nature of heroism. While the film has faced some criticism regarding the politics of its purported message, I feel that the theme is universal enough that detractors are merely reading more into the story than what Zhang intended.From a visual standpoint, the movie is simply stunning. Christopher Doyle's cinematography puts Zhang's direction and the meticulous production design in the best possible light. The distinctive use of colour throughout the film makes for a continually engrossing visual experience. The plentiful martial arts sequences are impressive, too, though the extensive use of wire-work probably won't suit all tastes.On the acting front, all of the principals perform admirably. Jet Li is the unquestioned star from a martial arts standpoint but he receives excellent support from renowned dramatic actors Tony Leung & Maggie Cheung.Overall, ""Hero"" displays a level of craftsmanship above and beyond that which is typical of action movies, whether foreign or domestic.

Hollywood should plug one of these movies into their plot machine and make something with a story people can follow, but with the same depth and feeling as ""Hero.""The movie is about an attempt to assassinate a King, I think.

Kung Fu EPIC,"Zhang Yimou has taken the Kung Fu action genre to new heights with his film Hero (Ying Xioung). While an action film may seem out of place in Zhang's amazing body of work, Hero is nothing short of an Epic in the Kung Fu genre. Like Shane, Gone With the Wind, or Chinatown before it, Zhang takes an existing format and brings a wider breadth to the genre and an artist's view to every aspect of film making. With an eye towards history, myth, legend, life and death, truth, and the perception of many truths; Zhang masterfully melds them all with a familiar genre and a story line that is nothing short of a creation myth for Imperial China.With amazing locations unique to China, flawlessly incorporating vast vistas with the inner vistas of the mind, Zhang takes us along on a spiritual journey in the life of the perfect assassin (Jet Li). Using a twisted flashback reminiscent of Rashomon, with the addition of the lush use of vibrant colors and imaginative sets, Zhang unfurls the enlightenment of the soul of a vengeful Nameless assassin in his single minded pursuit of his quest.This film is a revelation and an impeccably crafted masterpiece. Zhang perfectly balances the campy, physics defying, tradition of wire work Kung Fu films with a deeply philosophical story of rebirth and personal sacrifice. While some political overtones may distress some viewers, these should not stand in the way of appreciating the masterful crafting of one of the best films ever made in this genre or I dare say any other.I most strenuously recommend this film as utterly entertaining, deeply moving and surprisingly thought provoking. I hear that Miramax may have butchered the American version a bit as well as changing the interpretation of a rather important two symbol phrase that holds a key to a deeper understanding of the films subtext, but the Director's cut is already available on DVD and lets just say that I have the DVD on order now.Enjoy.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
Chinese history and legend made real in imagery and action,"I enjoyed Hero (Ying xiong) on many levels, first and foremost as a lover of cinema, for it is a work of visual and kinetic art. The cinematography, art direction, costumes, and music all set the stage beautifully for the actors to bring these legendary characters to life. Zhang Yimou's directorial touch was felt in every exquisite camera angle and saturated color. The movement of objects and people, the juxtaposition of events and viewpoints, was brilliantly done. I still see imagery and lengthy snippets of the action in my mind's eye when I least expect it and I am drawn to the imagery again and again.As a former student of Chinese language and culture who has lived in Asia, I also enjoyed seeing many things I'd only read about brought vividly to the screen. The tea house in which No Name and Sky fight their duel, the old man playing the Zheng on his lap, the music and the remembered duel in the two warriors' minds, all of that brought my time in Hong Kong and Taiwan back to me - not because modern HK and Taiwan are like that at all, but because living in a Chinese environment (if you are immersed in the language and culture) means sharing the present with the past, reality with legend, and living people with ghosts. These things are an integral and tangible part of everyday life. The calligraphy school brought back my years of studying and practicing 'grass writing' and took me to the core of the reasons behind it visually and emotionally in the scenes set there.As a student of internal martial arts, the film put into visible form the essence of their motivation. The stillness, the concentration, the philosophy melded inseparably to the act. The meditation, thought and movement as one. It was thrillingly done.As a woman, it was good to see women and men in lead roles dealing with similar levels of conflict, both internal and external. The only thing I would have done differently would have been to have one woman at least 'get' the holistic concept, one nation out of many. It seems unlikely that women would be less able to grasp the concept than the men. But, that is a small criticism.I will try to see it again on the big screen and will definitely buy it on DVD when it's available. I think it's a film which will bear repeated viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"The Hero, once again...","In the 70's, the best martial arts film was ""Shao Lin Tzu (Shao-Lin Temple).""In the 80's, the best martial arts film was ""Shao Lin Xiao Zi (Shao-Lin Kids).""In the 90's, the best martial arts film was ""Wong Fei-Hung (Once Upon a Time in China)."" Well, maybe ""Fong Sai-Yuk."" And also ""Tai Ji Zhang San Feng (Tai-Chi Master)."" As well as ""Jing Wu Ying Xiong (Fist of Legend).""In the 00's... ""Ying Xiong (Hero).""Get it?

Epic Masterpiece,"It is an epic film and a masterpiece! Very interesting military scenes that were fascinating! I would have liked to see more of that...the sword fighting was really good! Not sure about the flying around stuff but still good! I just watched another movie masterpiece, ""House of the Flying Daggers."" Both incredible pieces of film making! I would like to find more on the Chinese military history, The battle scenes were incredible! I know I am saying incredible a lot but I can't think of any other words to fit! Don't know why I waited so long to watch these, martial arts are not my favorite type films, but these were choreographed so well, almost like dancing! Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,History
No plot,"Hero is basically a pretty painting without context. The plot holes are so numerous is it impossible not to be distracted by it while watching the movie. ZhangYiMou is more concerned about making the movie look nice than developing the characters and storyline. He arbitrarily added Zhang Ziyi's character just because she is his new ""protege"" and he wants to use her to get back at his last ""protege"" Gong Li(Zhang Ziyi looks like Gong Li's younger sister) by making her more famous. The director also spent 1 million dollar painting the red scene the precise color of red he wanted and yet refused to pay his extras more than 1 dollar a day. It is probably an entertaining movie for people who just want to see some Asian kung fu. Sleep fest for anyone already familiar with the genre.",2.0,Anonymous,History
CORRECTED REVIEW: Long Live the Qin Emperor. Long Celebrate the Honor of a True Warrior,"[See the IMDb main page for ""Hero"" for cast names: only Jet Li is well-known in the U.S.]""Hero"" has been available for home viewing for several years but it needs to be seen on a big screen for maximum enjoyment of its powerful scenes, beautiful locations and impressive score. It's in theaters now.The Qin emperor long, long ago united a coterie of warring states to begin the violent, tortured process of wielding the immense land called China into a formidable nation (to give an idea of how ancient this story is, there were NO take-out restaurants when the Qin monarch launched his huge forces).In this film, directed by Zhang Yimou, Jet Li is Nameless which is his name since he wasn't given one at birth. A martial arts master, he enters into the near most crack-brained but unique conspiracy scheme in film history. From a province decimated by the Qin emperor's army, he's allied with three professional assassins, two men and a woman - all are sworn to murder the monarch.Through a series of flashbacks the conspiracy is rolled out with many fighting flourishes reflecting some rather neat martial terpsichore. Don't expect the story to make sense, especially to Western audiences. What makes ""Hero"" work is the internalized, expressed and slowly developed ethic of honor of the four assassins, especially Nameless. These people have a soul as well as a plot and it's projected very nicely. My teenage son couldn't even slightly understand Nameless's final expressive act at the end of the film, itself a comment on how different our time and our culture are from that of ancient China.The fight scenes aren't as elaborate as those in the outstanding ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" which has an elegance a bit missing here. They're good, though. But given the what and the why of the conspiracy a somewhat rawer approach makes sense. The gal-servant-with-a-sword, Moon, is beautiful and an interesting character by the way.I'm no martial arts-film fan but this movie was worth an hour and a half of my time.The score, by Tan Dun, a very important contemporary classical music composer (he won an Oscar for his score for the earlier Ang Lee kung-fu flick), is excellent. The score reflects a fusion of ancient and modern Chinese musical idioms. Tan Dun performs some of the violin solo lines but most proclaim the superb virtuosity of the greatest Sino-American fiddler, Itzhak Perlman.The CD of the soundtrack is for anyone who enjoys Tan Dun's exciting and very original compositions.For its type,8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Kung Foo + Rashamon + Cool Cinematagrahy + Beautiful Music Hero,"I've been waiting to see this movie since i first heard about it last year. i certainly was not disappointed. There are many things i like about this film. Its story, visuals, and music.  The only thing that really didnt impress me is the acting.Lets start with the good things.  The kung foo was beautifly stylized much like that in crouching tiger, hidden dragon. A bit unrealistic but it certainly makes beautiful eye candy.  The story was good, epic style, and told in a simlar fashion to the akira kurusawa movie rashamon. The story's love threads certainly make some scenes with high emotion. Music, is simply beautiful.  It lend and ear to the epic feel of this movie but also calms it down and makes it surreal.  is mostly in the background. But its brought into the chess house fighting scene.The thing that impressed me most is the visual style.  Most of the film was recolored or desaturated to fit the mood of that particlar scene. Many of the fight scenes have cg or other visual elements adding to its beauty. I love the part where the leaves change to rose petals marking the death of one of the characters.i cant say anything bad about this film.. i liked it too much..Anyway... Mirmax will be releaseing it to the big screen in the US this coming november. If you cant wait. Just look around for it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great story supported by Stunning Cinematography,"WoW!  That's all we could say after watching this.  Throughout the movie we kept stating our amazement that this was a Chinese film since the cinematography was on par with Hollywood.Beyond the stunning imagery (which I dare say comes close to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" quality), the storyline was simple, classic, and developed very well.Don't watch this if all you want is non-stop fighting.  You'll be disappointed since this movie has more depth than fighting.If you like a good story, and a historical flavor, then you will probably enjoy this gem.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
"The Emperor and the ""4"" Assassins""s""","A myriad of colours and poetry in motion, this film (presented in Kabuki/Peking Opera style employed via flashbacks) shares a basic plot with numerous folklores of ancient China where brave warriors (who can use blades of grass as swords) and assassins (who are honourable) are abundant.The movie opens with the audience being introduced to NAMELESS, an orphaned police prefect of Qin province who is going to attend an audience with Warlord QIN for having subdued one of QIN's archenemies...the assassin SKY. For this he is bestowed with land, gold and the Warlord's respect in the form of tea with QIN at 20 paces. This is highly rare as no one is allowed within 100 paces of QIN for fear of assassination.In the following scene, NAMELESS is having tea with QIN again but this time at 10 paces for having killed BROKEN SWORD and FALLING SNOW. BROKEN SWORD and FALLING SNOW are the duo that stormed QIN's palace three years earlier with intent to kill QIN, but BROKEN SWORD abandoned the mission at the last instant when his sword sliced a small section QIN's skin on the neck.What unfolds after that, I'll let the viewers watch and digest. A definite must-see with thought provoking messages embedded in the plot that is revealed to the beholder in delicious layers. 9 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Very replenishing movie,"This movie made me think about the ideas it involves. I have read some opinions on this movie, that declare this movie being made only for money, but the art and acting is great and nothing can draw it back.I recommend to everyone. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
