If Wishes Were Fishes...,"In bringing together elements from Inglourious Basterds, Ocean's Eleven and Museum Hours, George Clooney certainly had plenty of opportunity for a rich and interesting story. War heroes who appreciate fine art played by the likes of Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray and John Goodman (plus a few ""that guy""s), attempting to steal back priceless works of art from the Nazis, it sounds amazing.So what went wrong? Well, to begin with, for a movie about a team, we're given very little time with them as a group. Almost immediately they pair off on their own little adventures. Instead of using these exploits to let us know a little more about the characters as individuals, we get the usual oddball pairings and some mildly amusing, but ultimately hollow, vignettes. Even when we lose some of our team, it really feels like nothing more than just something that happened on the trip, like ""oh, and I also saw a horse."" We have hardly any sense of them as a group and far less about them as people. The only character whose motivations we can understand is the one played by Cate Blanchett, but her limited chemistry with Matt Damon dooms what little redemptive quality her character had.Also, and particularly troubling for a movie involving art, George Clooney's lens has little reverence for the work it shows. Though the film heavy-handedly ponders whether a piece of art is worth a human life, the camera never does. Even when a character lays down his life for a sculpture, it comes off less dramatic than inevitable. The film treats the works as being mostly historically significant and never finds that lover's gaze that tells the audience why.What we're left with is a bag of spare parts. It's a popcorn movie with no setpieces. A war movie with no battles. A heist movie with no scheming. An art movie with no inspiration. Were they to have found some of Inglourious Basterds' bluster, Ocean's Eleven smarts or Museum Hour's insight, they may have found a formula that works, but that's not the movie we have here. I'll be damned if George Clooney doesn't look good in a moustache, though.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Not nearly the worst film of 2014, but the most disappointing one so far.","The Monuments Men is directed by George Clooney, staring himself, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville, and Cate Blanchett. It tells of a group of soldiers tasked to locate and preserve pieces of art that have been stolen by the Nazis during World War II.It's no secret that The Monuments Men was one of everyone's most anticipated movies of 2013, and looked like a solid awards contender, until it was pushed to a February release date, purportedly due to the need for more time to be spent on the special effects.The truth is, The Monuments Men could be, and really should be much more entertaining than it is. The best part of the film, and at the same time, its major problem, is the script. There are seemingly continuous laughs coming from quick one liners and witty character interactions, which keeps the audience somewhat engaged, although with such bleak subject matter, it's debatable that a movie dealing with the eradication of an entire culture's achievements should be as lighthearted as it is. But the flaw with the script is that it seems like the first act eats up almost all of it's running time. It's as if the film is missing large portions of the actual plot to make room for massive amounts of unnecessary exposition. Secondly, the film's characters are stale and one dimensional at best. I invite anyone who sees the film to wait an hour after finishing the movie, and try to remember even three of the character's names or what their role in the mission was. There isn't a moment in the entire film where it isn't simply John Goodman or Bill Murray dressed as World War II soldiers and not fleshed out characters. Albeit all of the actors are exceedingly fun to watch, I assume that just watching all of these actors talk together at a press conference would be just about as entertaining.The Monuments Men isn't even close to the worst movie of 2014 by a long shot, even though it is only February, but it's arguably the most disappointing film of the year as of yet. I take no pleasure in saying this, but it's noble intentions fell utterly short due to awful pacing, and forgettable characters. I haven't read the book, but I have to think that it must be much better constructed and does this fantastic real life story more justice.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Telling an historical story comedically and missing a level of entertainment,"""The Monuments Men"" is a group of men (in real life around 350, and in this film 7) who are tasked with saving the historically and culturally significant monuments, fine arts and archives during World War II. They have to find and return that which the French hid and the Germans were finding and stealing and then hiding. And the film decided to tell this story comedically.The film took a really long time to get going as they wanted it to be about the men that took on this task. But they changed their names and I also couldn't tell you a single characteristic of any of them. The men were paired off so they each had their own region to investigate, but none of that was interesting. The worst part was giving James Granger (Matt Damon) and Claire Simon (Cate Blanchett, representing the real- life heroine Rose Valland) a love story. They did have a reason for such nonsense, or how about just sticking with how it actually happened.George Clooney has said the film is about 80% accurate, and that seems fair enough. But the problem isn't the historical inaccuracy; the problem is that the cheap humour diminishes the very people and story they're trying to empower. The humour was just a handful of lines wanting to kill Hitler and standing on a landmine. It just didn't make the film entertaining. The story could have done that but it didn't become interesting until they started discovering where the Germans hid the art. Coincidentally, the same point when the film started following the real story.""The Monuments Men"" very clearly wanted to help remember an important part of history and spark a debate about the cost of war on soldiers, civilians, and history and society. The debate is raging on, but the film missed the level of entertainment by not trusting its audience to be interested in exactly what happened.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Bland movie telling an important story.,"The movie deserves an A for effort but misses the mark dramatically. The question is: why? The story is evocative and the cast is excellent. Where the movie goes wrong is how it presents the story. The movie attempts to inject a whimsical element in story which is out of context. There was nothing whimsical about the plan to save priceless artwork. Also, the story moves at a slow pace and inspires little if any excitement or drama. The discoveries of the hidden artwork has little dramatic impact, nor do the interpersonal relationships between the characters which in the movie are shallow. Even the attempt at romance comes off as tepid and half-hearted, as well as implausible. The idea of a young, handsome, married American officer, alone in Paris, having dinner in the apartment of an attractive, intelligent, single French woman who made him dinner and not staying for at least another drink is a stretch. True, he is married and his faithfulness is commendable, but still .... The movie does have some strong dramatic moments, but in general the story is bland. Yet despite the movie's drawbacks, it still manages to tell a story about an historical event of great importance and significance, and for that reason alone is worth watching.",,Anonymous,History
George Clooney's The Monuments Men was a good enough period drama for me,"Before I review the movie proper, some anachronisms: While there was a song called ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" in 1944 (Judy Garland introduced it in Meet Me in St. Louis), the words Ms. Garland sang then were a little different from what we know today. Like, instead of ""Hang a shining star upon the highest bough"" which was the line introed by Frank Sinatra in his 1957 recording, the line should have been ""Until then, we'll have to muddle through sometime"" which Judy sang in that movie I mentioned. Anyway, I very much enjoyed this dramatization of some art experts attempt to save as much of other countries' art from the Nazi regime as possible during World War II. Nice characterizations from Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, John Goodman, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, among others, and George Clooney who also did a nice job directing as well. Maybe there could have been a bit more drama in characterization but I was satisfied with what I got. There were some nice humorous scenes as well. So on that note, I recommend The Monuments Men.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Good, TRUE Story","I really knew nothing about this band of rag-tag soldiers before going to this movie, and it certainly piqued my curiosity to read the book and do a little more research. So anything like this that has more of just an ""entertainment value"" is a good thing. I'll admit, I was drawn to it because of Clooney, and was not disappointed. It was also refreshing to see Goodman and Murray in dramatic roles.No, it's NOT supposed to be a comedy, nor a WW2 ""Ocean's 11."" For those who criticize that there is TOO much comedy, I disagree. The comedic relief comes primarily from one-liners, and who among us is serious all the time? Funny people often find themselves in serious situations and it would be difficult to believe that soldiers do not enjoy--and need--to laugh and be smart-alecks occasionally.And a BIG thumbs up for the lack of the f-word and other profanity. I am getting so tired of nearly all movies peppering (and usually overdosing) their scripts with profanity. Sure, these soldiers probably used colorful language, but it wouldn't have added anything to the film to include it, and really, we need to show young people that you can communicate (more) effectively without profanity.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Disappointing,"Just to Get one thing straight, i don't dislike this movie. In my Opinion it's entertaining in his own way. But i'm still disappointed by this movie, the Trailer really got me interested and i was really looking forward to see this movie. But i was probably expecting too much. The Story about a group of People, trying to Return some of the most important Pieces of Art in European History, to there rightful Owners is great. It's Characters Motivations are believable, those people weren't just some Art-Crazy Nutjobs that risked their lives to Save some Paintings they've only saw in Books, it goes deeper. I give this Movie Credit for not being an over-the-top patriotic WW II Flick. It's big Problem is, that it can't decide which kind of movie it's trying to be. Is it supposed to be a serious Drama or a Comedy with some serious Moments. And if you cast a Actor like Bill Murray, i would've expected a Comedy. So we get a mix of Dramatic Scenes, a few funny Scenes and unfunny Scenes which were supposed to be funny. On top of that, this movie is not good edited. Early in the Film the Group splits into several Groups, so the movie keeps switching between these Groups, which makes it sometimes hard to follow the Plot. Sometimes the time Gap between the cuts are crazy. In one scene we are in France during Autumn, then they cut and next they show us a scene in deepest Winter during the Battle of the Bulge. For all i can see, the acting is good, but because i watched the German-dubbed Version of this movie i can't fully Judge the acting. Now, is this movie horrible? Well, no it got some weak Moments and some strong Moments. When this movie was was over i thought to myself ""this movie was OK"". But maybe that's the Problem it's just OK.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A great story not told quite strongly enough,"I have to say that I think a 6.1 average rating is a little unkind to this film. There are a multitude of super serious, heart wrenching, melancholy dramas about WWII. And I understand that those are appropriate for one of the greatest collective horrors to ever grip mankind.That said, this movie being more jovial and about kinship amongst the men who swore to save art and culture felt like an appropriate tone. It made the film fun.Having enjoyed it, there are still flaws. Not enough focus on the actual works of art for one, and for another, a little disjointed and rushed in some spots while other scenes that have little impact on the story take up screen time. It could have been a more art-centric celebratory movie than it was, given the heart of the matter.This is not a terrible film. Maybe not what some would expect, but I had a nice time watching it, learned a lot, and even at times felt compelled about the accomplishments of humanity. That's a hard feeling to come by, so I embrace and appreciate it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Based on the true story focusing on an unlikely World War II platoon to execute an impossible mission:  retrieve  the art trapped behind enemy lines,","In 1943 during World War II, the Allies are making good progress driving back the Axis powers in Italy , but there took place the greatest art heist in history . However, Frank Stokes (George Clooney) persuades the American President Roosevelt that victory will have little meaning if the artistic treasures of Western civilization are lost in the fighting. Stokes is directed to assemble an Army unit nicknamed the ""Monuments Men"", comprising seven museum directors, curators, and art historians to both guide Allied units and search for stolen art to return it to its rightful owners . But as the Monuments Men, as they were called, found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of 1000 years of culture, they would risk their lives to protect and defend mankind's greatest achievements and especially to rescue Altarpiece of Gante and Virgin sculpture by Michael Angel .

They are the followings : Bill Murray as Richard Campbell , John Goodman as Walter Garfield , Jean Dujardin as Jean Clermont , Hugh Bonneville as Donald Jeffries , Bob Balaban .as Preston , Dimitri Leonidas and Matt Damon (Daniel Craig was cast in a role but ultimately he dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. Matt Damon replaced him).The Monuments Men is a 2014 American-German war-comedy-drama war film directed by George Clooney, written and produced by Clooney and Grant Heslov, and with all-star cast such as Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville, and Cate Blanchett. Loosely based on the non-fiction book The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History, by Robert M. Edsel. This action drama follows an Allied group, the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, tasked with finding and saving pieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by Hitler during World War II . Intentions are noble and its cast is impressive, but neither can compensate for The Monuments Men results to be stiffly nostalgic and curiously slack narrative .

Deserves more credit,"The Monuments Men is being too critically shunned. It is not what you expect from watching the previews, but comes through with heartfelt stories that are designed to show you what these men endured. Each of The Monuments Men characters come from the arts world and are driven into action by the need to save precious art works spanning across Europe. Bill Murray is a genius per usual but lacks when it comes to on screen time. I feel as though many characters like John Goodman are overshadowed by the likes of Matt Damon and George Clooney. They make themselves very prominent in the script but often take time away from those who would truly make this film shine (Murray and Goodman). Even though it is not as good as expected it shines in many scenes. I still give it a 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Pathetic and Self-Indulgent Piece of Nonsense,"Having read the original book from which ""Monuments Men"" is taken, I was very interested to see the movie. There is a really fascinating and historically important story here, and it could have made a great film. However, soon after the show begins, it all starts to fall apart. The reason? George Clooney. He directed, and he wrote the screenplay. It's amazingly obvious that in neither of these capacities does Clooney know what he is doing. The screenplay is an absolute joke, totally disjointed, disconnected, silly, trite, and incredibly amateurish for a major Hollywood star of Clooney's stature. The same goes for the directing. George Clooney is obviously a guy with a huge ego, capable of fooling himself and a lot of other people who should know better, that he knows what he is doing. Film-making schools should show this movie as a classic example of what not to do. It's fundamentally flawed in every respect. Editing, music, etc.------one is taken aback by the unbelievable ineptness. Co-stars Matt Damon and Bill Murray and John Goodman and the rest of the cast merely parrot their lines in strange, disjointed scenes that beg to be rewritten by someone with a brain in his head. On the one hand, I totally condemn this piece of Hollywood egotistical stupidity, but on the other I heartily recommend it as an example of how bad movies can get in the hands of people with enormous egos. Stick to acting, Clooney---for God's sake don't direct and write screenplays ever again.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Loved the Monuments Men,"I know this movie received mixed reviews, but I thought it was excellent. With so many disappointing movies lately I was pleasantly surprised that Monuments Men really delivered. I had never heard this story before and I was impressed at how it was presented. The actors were perfect for their roles and it left me feeling proud of what these men were able to accomplish.One thing that really struck home with me was seeing the beaches at Normandy. My uncle actually landed in the first wave, lost most of his battalion and was wounded. He never spoke about it but I know he carried the scars throughout his life.",,Anonymous,History
A Hollywood Retelling,"I think people need to relax a bit and take a deep breath. This movie is pure Hollywood. It took an event near the end of World War II and put their own spin on it. To say it's the worst war movie ever made is really cynical and mean spirited. Granted, the characters are pretty stiff and not very well developed. They reminded me of those 1940's caricatures from propaganda driven films. Still, the event it is based on is a unique one in the annals of war history. Actually, in a convoluted way, the Nazi's interest in art probably was indirectly responsible for saving it. It prevented them from launching full-blown artillery attacks on some of the world's great museums. Instead, they stole these masterpieces (another means of repressing humanity) and stored them in salt mines and other secret places. The effort to discover and recover these masterpieces is what this is all about. Of course, in reality, this was done by about 150 people, not the seven presented here. Unexplained to the audience is how after a discovery a battalion of military vehicles seems to show up immediately to secure the art. There is also the sacrifice that is pretty contrived and gratuitous. This is a sort of old-fashioned movie done in contemporary times. Go along for the ride and don't imagine you are seeing Shakespeare.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Great cast, lazy story","""If you destroy their achievements, their history, it's like they never existed.""When I heard George Clooney was going to direct a film about a World War II platoon tasked by Roosevelt to rescue art masterpieces, and that Matt Damon, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, Jean Dujardin, and John Goodman were all going to co-star with him, I was sure it was going to win all kinds of awards and was highly anticipating it. Then when the film release was changed to February my expectations for it lowered tremendously, so I wasn't expecting much from The Monuments Men by the time I went to see it. This allowed me to actually enjoy the film a bit more despite the fact that it didn't come close to reaching its potential. It's a slow building film based on a true historic and important event, and the film doesn't stop reminding us of this fact considering it keeps on stating its self importance through the main characters. The film felt forced during those scenes where we were constantly reminded why the mission was so important and worth the human sacrifice. Despite failing in its grand ambitions and never quite figuring out the tone of the film, it's still worth seeing for the great cast. There were also several scenes that stood out in this war picture that included some comedy, but overall the film felt incomplete at times missing something. The word disappointment comes to mind considering how much potential The Monuments Men had, but it was still entertaining despite some of the misfires in Clooney's film.The script was adapted by George Clooney and Grant Heslov from Robert Edsel's book about the world's greatest treasure hunt in history. Frank Stokes (George Clooney) is tasked by President Roosevelt to form a platoon with the mission of going into Germany and rescuing art masterpieces from the Nazis who had stolen them from their owners (mostly Jewish collectors) for Hitler's collection. Frank quickly forms a team of seven guys consisting of museum directors, curators, and art historians with very little experience in war. The Monuments Men, as they called themselves, was conformed by Frank, James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville), and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban). Despite their little military experience they began a race against time in order to rescue these valuable art pieces and return them to their owners before Hitler destroyed them all.There are some fun moments in The Monuments Men thanks in most part to the incredible cast, but one can't help and think about how underused they were. The characters were all very poorly developed and they only served to move along the story. I still can recall several funny scenes that were enough for me personally to watch and recommend this film. It's too bad the movie never manages to deliver the importance of the subject matter despite repeating the message constantly. I don't think it did these men justice for their contribution to humanity, but at least we got to know their story and enjoy a light hearted film about them.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Definitely better than its rating. Good movie!,"I had been waiting for the movie for quite a while following its trailer a few weeks ago. I finally got to watch it last night. The movie follows a decent line of story based in World War II. The pace is neither too slow nor too fast. The cast is a collection of brilliant actors who do justice to their roles. The background music also compliments the story. Although, it has a very stereotypical portrayal of the WW II, it does not get boring at any point. If you're looking for a war movie with a lot of guns and shooting involved, I'd recommend Lone Survivor(if you haven't watched it yet) over this, but if you're looking for a decent historical film, this is good enough. Also, it's a catch for people looking for a quick, nice entertainer for the weekend. A '34% fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes isn't a fair indicator, whereas a '6.4' on IMDb is a fair indicator of what you should expect from the movie. Based on the strength of the cast, you'd expect a better movie but all- in-all, it's actually worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not as bad as many critics would have you believe.,"I saw this on the second day of its opening weekend in the UK. The cinema screen was only about a quarter full. That surprised me. Maybe people had been put off by the lukewarm reviews by the critics. Maybe George Clooney isn't just much of a draw at the box office any more. Maybe people just don't want to see a film about ""art"". Maybe everybody else in Preston was up at Deepdale paying their respects to Sir Tom Finney. Perhaps it was a little bit of all of the above.I consider myself fairly well informed when it comes to World War 2, but I have to say that although I know that the Nazis looted loads of art from all across the continent, I never knew that the real-life 'Monument Men' existed - people who's job it was to try and locate all this missing artwork, get it back, and return it to their rightful owners. To this day of course, the search for pilfered art from WW2 is ongoing. How much of this film is true and how much is fiction is open to question. The real 'Monuments Men' were of course much more than platoon strength - in the film we are told there were just eight (led on-screen by Clooney, who also wrote and directed), in reality there were a few hundred. Some of the characters are apparently loosely based on real people, but their names have been changed. A bit like ""The Great Escape"" in that regard. For example, for Cate Blanchett's character (Claire Simone) you should Google 'Rose Valland' for information on the real person her character was based on.The film was good enough to hold my interest, but I can't say it blew me away, and I don't see it getting anywhere at next years Oscars. I will try and obtain a copy of the book on which this film is based, as I thought the actual story is quite interesting, probably much more so than the film. The way I see it, George Clooney has educated me that these people existed, now I will deliberately forget what I have just seen and read the truth instead! Worth a watch - not half as bad as the critics suggest. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History

The ornaments of civilization,"If one doubts the importance of those people called The Monuments Men in saving nothing less than the ornaments of civilization I would commend them to read some ancient history. What Adolph Hitler had was a two fold aim. A museum where he could house the stolen beauty of his conquered countries and view it for himself and his chosen elite. And to destroy the accomplishments of his conquered peoples so that only that what was deemed Nazi acceptable should survive. Remember what the Romans did to the civilization of Carthage. All we know about it is from the view of their conquerors. It's what Hitler ultimately intended.George Clooney gets a special commission from FDR after he sells the idea of a picked crew of art historians to go in and try to save as much as they could. All in all I'd say that Clooney and his team which consisted of Matt Damon, Bob Balaban, John Goodman, Dimitri Leonidas, Jean Dujardin, and Hugh Bonneville went into harm's way in their mission. They had to persuade our side to let them do their work and not interfere with the war. And the married Matt Damon manages to mix a little pleasure with business with Cate Blanchett who worked at the Louvre and told them what to look for and a general idea where to look.The Monuments Men is a wonderful film about a little known, but vital mission in World War II. Vital because these men and women were trying to preserve what our civilization is all about.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Monuments Men is light entertainment that doesn't bore, but doesn't bring anything new either","There is a good chance Saving Private Ryan ruined World War II movies for the rest of eternity because of its sheer realism and ability to not hold any of the carnage and insanity back.The Monuments Men's biggest issue is having to follow up to a masterpiece (that all war movies nowadays strive to become) with the similar credentials of covering an isolated incident that takes place in the middle of the deadliest war in modern history. Just like in Saving Private Ryan, Monuments Men is about preserving history before it gets swept up by the devastating conflict that leveled Eurasia. Private Ryan concerns pitting strangers together to save someone they don't know to prevent a family line from disappearing forever. With Monuments, it's about preserving art and culture before that gets permanently leveled by a war.World War II is never a fun subject, no matter which way you look at it. Even at its most entertaining, the usually humorously dark Tarantino kept Inglorious Basterds on check with its grim content. Having more humor than drama and suspense in the middle of such a sad time period with the threat always imminent makes for an awkward watch. Monuments Men never pretends to be a comedy, but the entire movie feels unfocused as Bill Murray (He doesn't have an Oscar yet..hmmm) throws one-liners centimeters away from death—with impending Nazi danger around the corner.And despite the stellar cast with decent performances (John Goodman and Cate Blanchett deserving some extra credit), despite the good cinematography and usual good direction from Hollywood staple George Clooney, the movie feels very by-the-numbers, paint-within-the-lines. It follows all the credentials, it checks off everything in the clichéd checklist for an inspiring historical drama. You have the likable characters, the necessary poetic deaths, and the uplifting ending in the midst of the odds being stacked against our heroes. So what else is there? The movie plays far too safe. And sometimes safe limits the impact. Saving Private Ryan leaves you numb, leaves you appreciating life, and leaves you desperately searching for good news during the two hours of intense filmmaking. Monuments Men never delivers an impactful emotional punch, even with the incredible true story that could have spawned a mini-series of some sort.Clooney is like that cool student that is smarter than he leads on, can strive for that A+. But with his latest film, he doesn't really aim for the A+, instead settling for the B grade with the PG-13 content in an environment that is anything but. And with that, the movie feels like a C. Watchable, but ultimately forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,History
One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,Started with a full theater and literally 75% walked out halfway through. This was one of the most pathetic movies I've ever seen. Awful awful awful script. No dialogue that was worth mentioning. Nothing made any sense. It was boring as hell and overall it was a cigarette commercial. They mentioned cigarettes a million times in the movie and how much they enjoyed them. This movie was awful. All the actors looked out of place as if they all phoned in the performance but that's okay because none of them had lines. Matt Damon was completely gone for most the movie then just showed up out of the blue. I can't remember any of the characters names. I could go on and on. The cinematography was poor. The movie lingered on stuff that was not entertaining then rushed like hell to get through anything with a point. None of the cast cared and neither did I.,3.0,Anonymous,History
Entertaining search for a Madonna and other great pieces.,"""This is our history. It's not to be stolen or destroyed. It's to be held up and admired."" Frank StokesConsidering the great art works recovered from the Nazis in 1944 by the Monuments Men, losing 2 lives in the operation might have been worth it. Or at least that's the struggle of the hero in the titular film inspired by the events: Frank Stokes (George Clooney), a curator at Harvard's Fogg Museum, goes back to the Army to head a small art recovery contingent (7—most out of shape and aging like John Goodman), with echoes of the Magnificent Seven and Dirty Dozen recruiting sequences, promising exceptional wit and action that doesn't materialize.Why is such a high-concept plot lost in a February opening? Possibly because it's enjoyable but not remarkable, a pastiche of brief episodes not always connected to the plot's central vision (shooting at a German sniper youth thought to be an adult?). The episodes may be meant to establish character while sliding over them to chronicle a not always interesting path to the mines and castle where the Nazis have hidden the loot. At least the studio had the good sense not to pit this modest adventure against, say, American Hustle or 12 Years a Slave in the Oscar prelims in November and December.The action picks up as they find the destinations, but along the way James Granger (Matt Damon) interacts with Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) in a low-key romance that finds great art but small love. Changing Claire from the original monument woman Rose into a love-seeking operative angers some historians. Another concern besides history and coherence is tone: Reverence for the mission clashes with the jokey camaraderie of old-fashioned WWII movies.It is a delight to hear the names of artists like Picasso and Rembrandt even though they had little influence on the film's fair-to midlin' screenplay penned by Clooney and Grant Heslov. Looking for Michelangelo's Madonna of Bruges and van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece is definitely grand, but the grandeur is not matched by the screenplay.As for directing, Clooney misses the sharpness of his Good Night and Good Luck while he helms here what seems a small story about an odd group of soldiers struggling to rise to the occasion of history's greatest art reclamation. It's an enjoyable film but not a great one.",,Anonymous,History
Probably the most lighthearted WW2 movie,"Like a lot of George Clooney's directorial efforts, The Monuments Men is a really old fashioned and well intentioned film that's surprisingly easy going for a war film. It's a true story that's interesting and honoured with plenty of warm moments and dry wit whilst still finding the time to show the darker aspects.George Clooney gives himself a charming performance but overall he shows some humility by not giving himself the spotlight. Pretty much all of the best moments go to everyone else in this stacked cast with the strongest duos being Matt Damon & Cate Blanchett and Bill Murray & Bob Balaban.George Clooney's direction can be quite disjointed and lacks the required tension in some scenes. It's hard to tell who's supposed to be the protagonist with characters disappearing for large portions; however, it really shines in the quieter moments and is generally effective in its throwback nature.Alexandre Desplat's lighthearted score almost understands the assignment too well. He knows exactly what kind of old school throwback George Clooney wants this film to be and he wholeheartedly leans into it with a score that truly feels like it belongs in the past in a nice way.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Saving Michelangelo,"Does History worth saving even at the cost of soldiers' lives? Monuments Men tries to answer by appointing a team of historians, architects who must save stolen art from Nazi thieves during the end of World War 2.Most of the part its submissive to style and star cast but passive to its premise. Hence only a 30min out of 120min looks intriguing. There were some funny moments which provides some relief.I was expecting a 'Da Vinci Code in Fuhrer's era but Mr.Clooney tried a historical action which appeals only at times. He made it as stylish as possible but failed to show the meticulous level of the saved art that was shown at the end just as a montage.Can watch it for the star cast and humour but Monuments Men disappoints if you expect a serious adventure that it had promised.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"This Should Have Been Cinematic Gold, What Happened?","Cloony, Goodman, Balaban, and Bill FRICKIN Murray, all trying to save art from the Nazis, plus Matt Damon kinda has his own story going. This should have been awesome! Instead it was ploddingly slow, badly scripted, and had very poor character development where you never feel like you get to know any character all that well. It's not a total waste, it has some moments, in particular the scene with Bill Murray and the record player, but overall lacks the weight and emotional punch that a movie like this should have. It is disappointing, but still worth seeing, but just makes me wish that it could have been so much more.3 Beards Out Of 5",6.0,Anonymous,History

And it goes, all 2 hours with no big surprise, no reliable story line, poor action and texts. Remember: Disconnect scenes. Boring WW2 propaganda. No action. No good talking.

Splendid Opportunity Gone Begging,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3/5 stars""The Monuments Men"" takes an immensely exciting subject on paper and then proceeds to toe a fine line between serving it in a deserved enthralling manner and almost ruining its brilliant concept by presenting it in deliberately dreary fashion, bordering on the verge of being pretentiously somber and unintentionally tedious. Alas, while oscillating between these two extremities, the film fortunately or unfortunately falls into a vacuum of modestly engaging storytelling, where the viewer's attention is just about held with some sporadically inspiring scenes and tense moments.Donning the Director's mantle, Clooney surprisingly misses many a trick by not delving deeper into a plot that presented numerous possibilities for an engrossing WWII mission in the vein of such classics as ""The Guns of Navarone"", ""The Dirty Dozen"", ""Where Eagles Dare"", ""Inglorious Basterds"", and ""Kelly's Heroes"" to name a few. Sadly, Clooney ends up desperately clinging to a few well-executed scenes towards the climax, to save his film from being a complete disaster. Moreover, his lackluster direction is astutely shielded by a stellar ensemble cast, who each perform admirably well in their grossly underwritten roles.Based on a truly motivational true story, ""The Monuments Men"" could have easily turned out to be a much more entertaining if not classic war movie with better planning and prudent execution. Alas, it ends up exposing us to an almost forgotten chapter of WWII heroism - one which was equally important as the war strategies and legendary battles in standing up against the fascist Nazi regime, especially since these gallant souls preserved our art and culture, the very essence of history and existence - even if it does so in a jarringly slipshod manner.",6.0,Anonymous,History
If you watch the great trailer you've seen the best of the movie.,"What a waste of money and time. Had George employed the editors making the trailer to write, direct and edit this film, it might have actually been enjoyable. This was unfortunately one of the most disjointedly scripted movies I have ever had the misfortune to watch. The story was randomly hopping this way, that way, presenting completely unrelated anecdotes from the different missions the Monuments Men were on. As another IMDb reviewer (Wilbrifar) pointed out: "" It's like watching a sequel to a movie you didn't see; the characters are acting like ""here we are, old buddies together again in Part 2"" and the audience is left totally out in the cold because there was never a Part 1. "" That is very much how the movie felt; the actors were proficient in delivering their lines as well as they could, given the nightmare of a script they had to follow - but there was no chemistry between any of them at any point, so when they were getting all joking and friendly with each other, it just looked and felt awkward; like being at a party where you're watching someone be overly friendly to someone else. I would never watch this again.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Exceptional...and not sure why it's only rated 6.1 on IMDB.,"As I watched ""The Monuments Men"", I kept finding myself wondering why the heck this film has an incredibly mediocre score of only 6.1 currently on IMDB. I am not sure why, but I can only assume most viewers simply didn't care about the work these soldiers did. But the quality of the production and fine acting SHOULD have guaranteed a score much higher even if folks didn't care so much about art.The film was obviously a work of love by George Clooney and the rest. After all, a lot of work went into making the movie...such as getting WWII era aircraft, trucks, tanks, uniforms...as well as the art (which I assume were all reproductions). This took a LOT of work! I was also surprised because many modern films about WWII show equipment that isn't quite right...such as American vehicles pretending to be German or tanks which are Korean War era. But here in ""The Monuments Men"", they really took the steps necessary to get it right.Now not everything in the film was perfect....and I assumed that this was done in order to streamline the movie. So, instead of 8 or so members of this group dedicated to saving and repatriating stolen artwork, there really were many more...perhaps a few hundred. But again, I think this was deliberately done to make the film seem more personal. Overall, a well crafted and fine film...one of the best of 2014.By the way, if you want to learn more about this, try watching the documentary ""The Rape of Europa"".",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A unique story, but a disappointing film.","George Clooney's ""The Monuments Men"" is the story of a unique platoon in World War II that was assigned to save stolen artwork that the Nazis had stolen. It has a strong cast with Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, and Bob Balaban. Clooney even wrote the script with Grant Heslov. There was a lot going for this film, but I walked out disappointed.It's a very rushed movie. You zoom through facts and what these men were doing. It captures the important moments, but doesn't string them together well. We lose character development in exchange for facts that we could easily read. I felt like Clooney went more for the jokes at times. The cast has good chemistry, but I feel like there was missing bits of information and character development.The actors are all good in it. The performance that stood out to me was Bill Murray. He always does a good job of blending humor with deep emotions. I enjoyed Clooney's style for the film. It feels like a 1940s patriotic war film in color. Alexandre Desplat's score complements this style. It works for the story, but it doesn't strike much depth about patriotism. It's a film made for the love of classic artwork and the importance of preserving the art that has defined humans. You feel that importance at times, but it becomes muddled in a rushed story that aims for jokes more often than needed.Clooney means well with ""The Monuments Men,"" but it's a flawed film that probably needed more time in order for it to be completely told. It's not necessarily a bad film, but it is disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Boring Story, Terrible Screenplay and Unconvincing Performances","In 1943, the American Professor Frank Stokes (George Clooney) convinces President Roosevelt that the art stolen by the German should be retrieved and he recruits six art experts to form the Monuments Men's unit to travel to Europe with him to search the treasures. On the arrival, they split to several cities to guide the Allies to find the arts to return them to the owners.I do not know how accurate ""The Monuments Men"" is but this movie has a boring story, terrible screenplay and unconvincing performances. The movie is neither a drama nor an action movie or comedy and has several main characters divided in subplots, some of them interesting and others pointless.

Extremely boring,"I was not expecting combat action, or a whodunit type thriller, but I was totally disappointed with the slow pace and the total lack of suspense.The dialog was not witty or even interesting. The actors are first class, but are wasted. Other reviewers have said that Kate Blanchett steals the show, but there is nothing to steal, and she hardly is in the movie, and when she does appear, we are left with a 'is that all?' feeling. Other characters play their parts as though they were visitors in the set.There were two or three instances where I was tricked into thinking that something exciting was going to happen, but the subject ended abruptly and the boring and easily anticipated theme was back.I wanted to like the movie so badly that I was successful in staying awake for about 45 minutes, but then was in and out until the last 20 minutes, where the pace picked up from snail to turtle pace.",,Anonymous,History
Historical movie quite different to what the previews suggest,"Based on the previews I expected The Monuments Men to be more comedic. It has an excellent cast whom are no strangers to comedy (John Goodman, Bill Murray, George Clooney, Matt Damon). Don't be under any illusions, though. This is a historic movie against the very real backdrop of World War 2.The movie doesn't quite know what it wants to be. It starts off with promise and reminds one a little of ""Ocean's Eleven"" as the team of Monuments Men are assembled. There is some light banter that is entertaining. The movie quickly loses this comic momentum though as the serious business of saving art starts. It never evolves fully into a movie with a true ""war"" feel as the comedic always threatens to come to the surface although it never really does. At some point you do start to wish that the movie will just finish and run to its conclusion.I suppose (upon re-reading my previous paragraph) that this ""don't know quite what to expect"" feeling of the movie very closely resounds with the real historic events surrounding the Monuments Men (or anyone going to war, for that matter.) It starts off with unknown anticipation but as the personal costs escalate one does become more grave until you set about fighting for what you believe in in a ""business-as-usual"" matter. For this reason I do believe it to be a quite good historic film.The film is not hugely entertaining, although the seasoned cast does bring enough to the table to keep the user engaged. I found the historical sites and the exploration of a part of history I was unaware of quite interesting and therefore enjoyed the film. I don't expect this film to have mass appeal though...",6.0,Anonymous,History
Classic George Clooney,"This is a somewhat typically George Clooney film, it has a very thorough and serious background story, but the actors make it seem light, great and funny because their roles have special characteristics that fits the actor and fits into the story and work well together, this blend of serious drama, action and comedy works very well and has for several of his films.This does not have as much comedy and humor as others, but it is a very entertaining and engaging film, the cast of the main characters are very well chosen and their dynamic together is making the film work, have humor and just entertain.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Important To Attention To The Monuments Men,"Too bad the movie has had such poor reviews. The story of the Monuments Men itself is interesting. I'm looking forward to a related book, The Noble Sculptor (web site by the same name), that's coming out that. It has a dovetailed WWII story of that time. That one is partly a story of one of the Monuments Men in Italy. But its really about that Monuments Man's father, a hero during WWII at the time. He put himself at risk and was credited with saving over 600 Allied troops trying to escape the Germans in Italy. That sounds like a great movie to me and I can't help but thinking about missing elements in seeing The Monuments Men.Really if, as I do, you love decent movies generally, The Monuments Men is fine. Its basic importance is that it has brought attention to previously little known (unless one read the book) men and women who did something that no one else did – and that needed to be done. It was part of saving culture and history. That makes it an important movie if for no other reason. If one goes to judge all movies by award standards, then the vast majority will fail.Although I know other stories as movies can and do end up being as good or better (i.e.: The Noble Sculptor), The Monuments Men is not as bad as some reviews have you think. It comes down to expectations and, in some cases, biases.Some will simply see the movie because they like John Goodman or George or one of the other actors. It's like seeing a John Wayne movie. If you like John Wayne, it doesn't matter what he's in. Many people will enjoy the movie just watching the cast do what it does. Relax and don't over-analyze it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"In the vein of The Longest Day and Band of Brothers, an episodic adventure from World War II","This film was a surprise to me in that it was not about six or eight adventurers and funny men, was not a World War II edition of Oceans 11, but is the several tales of art experts, acting alone or in pairs, commissioned as a group to locate and save art stolen by the Nazis.The individual actors play to form, the history was interesting, the writing was predictable and substandard.I would probably never replay this film, but, for those interested in World War II and its small stories, this is worth a few bucks to see. Certainly it is not an epic or moving war adventure in the ilk of Saving Private Ryan.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Saving the Legacy of Art,"""The Monuments Men"" gathers together such a stellar cast, it was definitely hard to ignore. George Clooney directs, writes and plays the lead role in a film that somehow echoes his Danny Ocean films. It was also about gathering a bunch of experts together for a common mission. But this time the mission was not a criminal heist, but something altogether noble and altruistic.In the heat of World War 2, Frank Stokes (George Clooney) wanted to save the precious artwork that the Nazis are spiriting away from various European cities they are attacking. When his mission was approved, he gathered a group of seven experts in the arts together to help him recover these treasures from the clutches of Hitler. These men were not mere bystanders when they went to Europe for their mission. They were actually in the middle of all the risks and dangers of war.George Clooney basically plays himself here, a charming man with a sense of humor and a noble mission in life. It is difficult to disengage him with this Danny Ocean persona, especially since Matt Damon is also on board the team here as James Granger, the curator of the Metropolitan Museum in New York. The chemistry between these two guys was undeniably effortless. The relationship of Damon's Granger with that of Cate Blanchett's Claire (who was the curator of a French museum) though, was rather awkwardly portrayed.Bill Murray plays his usual deadpan droll self as architect Richard Campbell. His mission partner was theater director Preston Savitz, played by Bob Balaban. John Goodman was his usual good guy self as sculpture expert Walter Garfield. His mission partner was French painter Jean Claude Clermont, played by Jean Dujardin. Too bad that we do not really know much more about each of their individual backgrounds and expertise. It would have made us care about them more.For a movie that deals with such an importantly serious topic, George Clooney decides to treat his material with a sense of humor. There would be plenty of funny little one-liners peppered throughout the script, many times diffusing the tension in very intense scenes. I could not help but imagine how it would have been if they had played this film in complete seriousness. This material had the potential to be another war classic and Oscar winner if treated as a drama. That said, the light comedic treatment makes the issue more accessible for younger viewers. There is still pathos that still shine through in many scenes.There were several scenes that may feel extraneous, like Goodman and Dujardin's encounter with an unseen sniper, Damon's unfortunate dilemma when he accidentally stepped on a landmine, or even Murray's scene in the shower while a recording of his daughter singing a Christmas carol was played. These were not necessarily about saving art from the war. But they do complete the picture that these people, despite being there for a special non-military mission, were really still in the thick of the war experience.The message of the film is important. Are works of art worth the cost of human life to preserve them? People who believe that the cultural achievements of humanity should be protected from the destruction of war at all cost, this film will definitely strike a positive chord. Those who believe that art is a mere triviality may think this film is much ado about nothing. I believe they are, and that is why I enjoyed this film very much despite its flaws. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Reminds me of the Train,"The plot is similar to Burt Lancaster's The Train, done in the early 70's. The major difference is that in The Train, it was French Nationals trying to save their national art collection that was being stolen by the Nazi's near the end of the war. Trains were used to transport the valuable art to Germany. The French showed ingenious tricks to fool the Germans . It was a very well done movie and Burt Lancaster showed his greatness as a true movie star. This mess Americanized the French which made it very unrealistic and dishonest. The All Star cast with poor script, and equally poor dialog, must have been a big financial incentive for the casting associate, because no one including Cate Blanchett earned there salary. It was a very disappointing performance by George Clooney. I will think twice before a see another movie with George Clooney in it.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Consensus,"It seems to me nearly all of the reviews thus far (Feb. 2014) have at least something good to say about a flawed movie. Seldom is there so much consensus across the spectrum. I viewed it on opening day with great expectations and came away thinking of it as only a curiosity, a tale with two possible aspects. First, I found it just another 1960's style WWII narrative with a slightly lighthearted American perspective to accompany its musical score. But upon further viewing more somber elements took over.Based on certain historical facts, the script compels a certain suspension of disbelief. In the event, however, the facts as presented seem not only fragmented, but interpreted across the board so as to make heroes of several very ordinary guys trying to do an impossible job: namely, dispelling horrors of war by making sure objets d'art survived intact. Political swipes at all them ""furriners"" especially Germans and Russians provided an unhappy and distasteful undertone.Occasionally great cinematic art itself cannot and probably should not survive its critics.",6.0,Anonymous,History

A decent film if you have reasonable expectations,"There seem to be a lot of critical IMDB reviews of this which I don't think are entirely fair.Perhaps it is a victim of the cast and the marketing at the time. You assume it will be some kind of blockbuster war satire. It's not.Like many of Clooney's projects, the influences are from an earlier, simpler time. This has the feel of old Hollywood, told at a gentle tempo, with a touch of humour and a hint of sentimentality.In that regard it succeeds. The cast are strong, the story is an interesting one, and it certainly pulls at the heartstrings.Granted there aren't as many laughs as you might hope for, the storytelling hesitates in the middle act, and Cate Blanchett's role sits awkwardly, but it is good quality, thoughtful entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,History

So I started watching it. But what did I saw?I saw extremely bad introduction and a chaotic scene order. I really didn't know what I was watching. The scenes were short and superficial.

Even though there are actors like Clooney, Damon, Blanchett, Bill Murray etc, I wasn't impressed by the acting at all.I must say that the whole point of the movie was a mistake. It was very unrealistic because most of the scenes were rubbish. I mean who would leave 1000 tons of gold and 16 thousand artistic pieces unguarded in an abandoned mine? How is it possible that there is no one on the streets of Bruge the night before the German withdrawal of the town? And there were many more scenes like this..The story was very chaotic.

"An understated, respectful adventure of war's hidden cost","""Monuments Men"" tries and mostly succeeds to tread a line that draws a cautionary balance between the epic loss of human life during World War II and the collateral loss and outright theft of priceless, historical artworks by the defeated Nazi's through the war's end. ""Men"" depicts the real-life mission of a group of art specialists to find and retrieve these stolen pieces.""Men"" is a war tale told outside the confines of war in what may be a too-subtle attempt to draw out the inherent irony of abstracting war in art's context. ""Men"" depicts the trailing end of World War II only in that abstract sense, and to its own detriment arguably makes the process of finding the secreted artworks easier than it could possibly have been in reality.There is an unevenness in ""Monuments Men"" that only marginally detracts from its overall quality. When Frank Stokes (George Clooney) meets up with Joseph Granger (Matt Damon) early in the planning stages of their art retrieval task, its hard not to expect at least one solid in-joke from their team-up in the famed ""Oceans"" film series - yet none comes. ""Men"" succeeds, however, in its own awareness of the danger and moral propriety in sending military men on a mission to retrieve artworks in the midst of the emerging reality of Nazi genocide.""Men"" is a good, if flawed, film, telling a difficult tale that had to be harder to accomplish in reality than was depicted on screen.

They knew that and still went ahead as they were driven not by success or money but deep belief in their cause that of preservation of art.This sense of idealism in the midst of war brutality was definitely my high for this film. It goes without saying that the combination of Clooney-Damon was a risky choice but paid off, especially with regards to the former as all he had to do is be his usual charming self.Furthermore, this film has highlighted another side of Nazi mania which was unbeknownst to myself; the idea that 'if we can't keep it, we will destroy it' and thus ended up destroying lots of significant artworks.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Obviously, looking for the cast who present to us some Oscar winners like George Clooney , Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett and Jean Dujardin, everybody expects a great movie and that's a normal wish.The movie begins in a slow pace, developing the characters and the idea that the art masterpieces are a very important piece of every civilization, that brings a lot of culture and a part of her own history, and that maybe worth sacrifice yourself to keep this works under protection (A question that George Clooney - the director and protagonist, presents in some parts of the film).Summarizing, that's a honest movie, who hasn't a deep history, and didn't present any spectacular interpretation of any of the actors, but teaches a part of the human history (that I didn't know before watch this movie) in a good and unpretentious way.If you looking for a art movie with great actors, watch the movie The Monuments Men, but don't forget to go with low expectations and don't expect that will be a wonderful film, that may change your life.A honest 6/10 to me.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Review: The Monuments Men/ www.nightfilmreviews.com,"Through his career as an actor, George Clooney has offered audiences with a well-to-do list of fine performances that bring to life vivid influential fictional and exciting non-fictional characters. There is no doubting that currently Clooney is a highly regarded, respected and powerful force within Hollywood. And thankfully his work as an actor has yet to be complete. It is in my humble opinion that Clooney, as a director, has excelled in the medium quicker than as an actor of his time. As a director, Clooney has elevated the mainstream storytelling technique as well as contributes to having a tremendous, natural execution of developing his characters, especially when it comes to telling the true stories of some of the most influential behind-the- scenes men that were born and raised in the United States. Clooney's intent in his films is to preserve culture, history, and a way of life, bringing to life as well as sharing the many amazing stories of men (and women) who make him proud to call himself an American.From Chuck Barris, creator of the Gong Show and supposed CIA agent (played perfectly by Sam Rockwell) in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind; to Edward R. Murrow, the man responsible for the censure of Joseph McCarthy and McCarthyism (played gallantly by David Straitairn) in Good Night, and Good Luck; to Dodge Connelly, a mimic of Herald 'Red' Grange, an icon of American football (played by Clooney himself) in Leatherheads; to Senator Mike Morris (Clooney) in the political-thriller The Ides of March based loosely on the 2004 Democratic primary campaign of Howard Dean, Clooney has quite the knack for bringing to life the controversial stories of some great American men and their great patriotic accomplishments and failures.With The Monuments Men, Clooney finds hints of the potential essence that surrounded his greater directorial body of work, but unfortunately, falls into a formulaic routine that solidifies the film as a quasi-informative, melodramatic and somewhat predictable clichéd piece of American cheese. Bound to make its way into library halls and fall under the categories of 'forgettable' and 'unaffecting', The Monuments Men becomes an outdated artifact of recycled ideas that would see itself in the historical section of the museum collecting dust and being completely forgotten in the years to come.With scenes as predictable and numbered as the Dewey Decimal System, The Monuments Men is still a hard film not to like. Lead by a profound group of talented actors, the film tells the true life story of a small group of men who searched high and far through the immense rubble and destruction of the Second World War for the very fabric of humanity, culture and history. Lead by Frank Stokes (Clooney) and his hand-picked team of artists; James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), Donald Jefferies (Hugh Bonneville), Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) and the young Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas), the main objective for the men is to safely find, preserve and return famous and amateur art; art that Hitler was stealing with the intention of opening up his own museum.One of the biggest reoccurring elements throughout the film is the value of human life and the value of art. Clooney, throughout his narration, continuously makes clear that no artwork, no matter how valuable, is worth a human life. Yet, this statement seems somewhat impossible and disapproved during one of the most notorious wars in the history of world, responsible for countless casualties. Although stark and heart-warmingly affective, the narration by our protagonist serves as some of the films most thought-provoking segments of the film, yet takes away from the actions depicted on screen. The narration instead serves as an almost 'in case you missed it' captioning to the often times laughable and overly-comedic action on screen.Like with any Clooney directed feature, he is always able to round out a talented and multi- faceted cast that sometimes drive the stale action and narration itself. Comedians Bill Murray, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, as well as recent Oscar winner Dujardin, deliver an abundance of unneeded comedic relief that often takes away from the heavy subject matter and serious drama the film is attempting to sculpt. Finding the humour and humanity of a war that didn't seem to have much during its occurrence, The Monuments Men is a light-hearted take on a solemn historical piece of time.Having the only female lead in the film, Cate Blanchett proves here more than anywhere, even amidst all the comedy and juvenile goofiness, that she is next in line to be our generation's Meryl Streep. Camouflaging herself in her French accent and wholly Parisian character, Blanchett is one of the film's saving graces. The other, as always, is the charm and bravado of the always impressive Matt Damon. Although mocked throughout the film for his horrendous French accent (now that was funny), Damon allows the imperfections of his depiction of a very real American solider to navigate through the progression of the story's conflict with ease. His scenes end up becoming the crucial developments for his company of men, whereas most of the other characters rely heavily on luck and good fortune.Check out the full review at www.nightfilmreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not a good movie Disjointed and Flat,"I write short and sweet reviews because I am tired of people giving high ratings to terrible movies. This movie won't have that problem. It should have been good. It had a good cast and a great historical event. BUT.... The first half of the movie was terrible, with scenes that did not flow well into one story and seemed disjointed. The end of the movie was somewhat better, tied together properly at least. The acting was mostly very flat. While I have seen both Clooney and Daemon give good performances, these performances had no nuances. It was as if they were hanging out in their every day lives. Neither played a character that seemed very different from the persona that they project as themselves. And While Cate Blanchett actually DID give her character nuances, she was so unpleasant that I didn't care to watch her. I love history, and I don't mind when a movie takes some liberties with it in order to tell present a good drama. However, I learned little about this event, and also was not entertained.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Convincing sleight-of-hand,"Actors are professional pretenders. Movies that depict real life events, or literary works,are successful if they present persuasive indications, hoping to capture the spark of reality on stage or screen.George Clooney is a sentimental man who conceals his sentimentalism well. He makes movies whenever he can about topics, people, and issues he cares about.Having read the book this film was based upon, I was looking for gestures, expressions, persuasive indications of a movement most people, including me until very recently, were not aware of.A story in today's Wall Street Journal proclaimed that the desire to save, protect, salvage and restore, and allow the present and the future to continue to enjoy art - is ongoing - even in such places as Afghanistan and Iraq. That article also dramatized General Eisenhower's efforts to ensure that American soldiers were respectful and appreciative of other countries' cultures and their artistic and other achievements.I thought that the exposition, the part of the movie that was slowest moving, where each character had to be introduced and developed, then inserted into the rather tense and nervous camaraderie, such as it was, was the weakest part of the film; but even this part had the feel of a recapturing of the mis en scene of 1944 global Armageddon in the world.I often forget that many of the Chicago group that made Saturday Night famous: John Belushi, Bill Murray and many others, were classically trained actors. Bill Murray listening to a record while in the shower is a great moment in theater, in acting, in verisimilitude, the art of making the gesture, the moment, seem so real that the audience forgets it is only a movie.The entire cast behaved as if they truly were the architects, curators, sculptors, and connoisseurs they were portraying, and I felt that the movie got stronger and stronger after the going got really tough in their mission.Kate Blanchett plays a tough French woman smoldering with an inner burning anger, and she is convincing in every scene she was in. I thought that she inspired and uplifted Matt Damon's performance.I think the quality of the writing is uneven, but that is true not only of art, but of life. Sometimes, ordinary people utter mundane statements; sometimes, we are inspired to be eloquent, elegant. I think that ""The Monuments Men"" captured that reality, too.I would love to see it again, and I urge anyone who is interested in the idea of saving precious works of art from military and other predators, to read the book by Robert M. Edsel.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Cozzy Flick,"Just knowing that Hitler had stolen so much art and to see how much he destroyed made this movie worth wild. Although with the caliber of actors in the film , well just to say some Hollywood wood here and there could of picked up the pace and the roles of some of the characters. I think Matt Damon's character was padded a little to much. It took away from the story which is the search of stolen master pieces and to be returned to its rightful place and country. The pace is steady but slow in the parts mentioned. I wished the ending had a longer story to end the story. There's nothing to spoil here. but You know to write a story based on a true story, it should end with stuff like where are they now or passing or people or interviews of people who remember them. stuff like that.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Bland mix of propaganda loosely based on real events,"I couldn't connect to the movie at all. It started like a WWII Ocean's Eleven, but the people in the ""gang"" had no chemistry and their characters were not expanded enough for the viewer to care. A lot of great actors in mediocre roles which were badly written.Then there was the script itself. A lot of ""oh, how horrible the Germans are"" and ""how civilized and caring are the Americans"", with a bunch of other nations that were so sketchy that no one really cared about them. There were a few scenes that surprised me, like the one with the German soldier who just smokes with some of the Americans, then leaves. In a such cartoonishly one sided film, I was amazed to see that even Germans were human, a courtesy that was not extended to the Russians, for example.Bottom line: a film devoid of empathy, filled with propaganda complete with heroic soundtrack. I have no idea what the real Monuments Men were like, but I highly doubt they were the walking clichés depicted in this film. I had to make an effort to watch it all. In the end, I regretted even that.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Ocean 11 during War World 2,"The main reason I enjoyed The Monuments Men is because it is a perfect combination between a true story and a humorous one. Creating an enjoyable movie experience.Centering around a group of artists, historians, and architects; Tasked with retrieving stolen arts and sculptures from Nazi Germany during World War 2. From the very beginning; the writers put a lot of emphasis on the important task to retrieve the stolen arts and return them to their owners.While the task seems impossible and at the time quite ridiculous, Leader of the platoon Frank Stokes (George Clooney) is determined to save the pieces of history of human kind. While also reminding everyone that no amount of human life is worth sacrificing for a piece of art. A moral question that comes into play throughout the story.What attracted me to the film were the dynamics between the platoon members, how they are all different from one another and yet share the same passion for art.As I mentioned earlier, this film is a great combination between a true story and a humorous one, nowadays; it seems all movies based on a true story have to be dramatic, filled with depth, show a darker tone and image of the person the audience would have chosen not to see. Take for instance the movies of Elvis (2022) and Blonde (2022).In the case of The Monuments Men; it is based on a true story. And even if not all the characters are real; they are amusing and all play a significant role. The story in itself is interesting, Combined with a bit of drama and humor and an uplifting soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat. With both elements combined - the movie becomes an enjoyable experience.I guess the best advise I could give for film creators who struggle to make a movie based on a true story. Aside of staying true to the source material, is to enjoy the experience, have the movie filled with simple moments between characters and dynamics that reveal more about the characters we as audience are supposed to empathize with.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Good story but 2 hours are not enough,"The movie's got a bunch of great actors like George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville, Cate Blanchett and more.With so many actors in the mix, the movie kinda falls short in giving each character enough depth. Some of the Monuments Men don't get much screen time or backstory, so it's hard to really get invested in their individual stories.This movie tackles something important from World War II that doesn't get a lot of attention - how art and culture were saved while everything was going haywire. It's about these brave men who went out of their way to rescue priceless stuff from getting wrecked.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Total Disaster.,"Based on real events, this film was a disaster! I'm writing this review while the film is still rolling... well it took me 4 days (everyday watching a bit of it) to get to the last half an hour of this film and I cannot bear watching one more second. If I was watching it in a movie theater I'd surely walk away.In the true story, a force of around 300 men chased a huge number of European art treasures to save them from the Nazis and rescue the heritage of the Western civilization. I guess that the number of men was enormously reduced in this film so that the viewer could relate and connect to the characters.. well probably I couldn't care less even if a bomb demolished them all. Some of the real events were altered to serve the dramatic portrayal and every time the film tried to look serious the scenes only seemed hilarious.The WAR COMEDY film was not funny and the war action scenes were so badly executed that they seemed like rehearsals.. For a moment there I thought that the main characters did not care about what they were doing.. as if some of them were forced to do it.. and this goes even for Cate Blanchett! I don't know how the movie managed to make her look so bad.I did not really expect something so serious, but at least a light movie that makes you laugh.. something like ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"". Yet, this movie failed at every level. I only gave it 3/10 because it is based on a true story that was historically quite important. Or else I consider it only slightly better than ""Battle of Los Angeles (2011)"".",3.0,Anonymous,History
very good,"In this day and age where so much emphasis is put on sex, special effects, and foul language, it was refreshing to watch a movie without any of those criteria. Although it lacked historic accuracy, it was still in my opinion a well done production. I thought the actors did an excellent job portraying the characters who the movie was based on. I also liked the fact that there was a certain amount of humor laced into a few scenes to keep it from being more of a documentary type film. On top of the humor, there was also an element of surprise, both when you were not expecting it, as well as when you were, but getting a different type of outcome. Overall, I'd say that even though Hollywood took liberties with the facts, they still made an enjoyable movie, and one they can be proud of.",,Anonymous,History
Should be way better,"This film should be far more engaging than it is. It is about six men selected to retrieve art works stolen by the Nazis, and Bill Murray is in it. That should be enough to make it a near classic. However it never really reaches the comedic or dramatic potential promised in the trailer which is in fact a better experience than the film itself. Part of the reason for this is the lack of momentum caused by the story being spread between the different stories of the cast. Things seem to meander along without a great sense of urgency and as a result the audience may be compelled to feel slightly disinterested. If any art is going to be saved can everyone involved hurry up. Considering the cast and the plot this film could have been allot more fun. The editing itself does not grip the attention. Just one good map reading scene and a couple of arguments between the characters about what they were up against would've made some difference. Instead it sort of ambles and bundles its way towards the end with Matt Damon's contribution more like an extended cameo. Ultimately this film could have been allot better.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A competent but uneven movie,"Directed by George Clooney who also starred and included Matt Damon, John Goodman, and Cate Blanchett, this movie inspired by the World War II allied effort to save invaluable art treasures that the Nazi's had stolen, has trouble with its overall tone. It has very poignant moments especially over the dramatized risk of the soldiers took in saving their valued treasures as well as a sensitive subplot between one male soldier and a French woman. Unlike The Great Escape (1963), this World War II movie doesn't seem to find its balance between comedy and drama in either its direction and musical selection.

"""It Was The Worst Movie Experience In History"" ♦ 7%","Well, that be it if I were to relate to the tag line of this ultimate propaganda film of the year. Too bad it didn't release last year; I miss so hard how this would have been ridiculed by the critics and the awards juries and would be thrown straight out of Oscar race. Any awards race, for that matter.7 people in the theater. 40 minutes later, 3 of them left. Since the beginning, not a single movie-watcher cared as I took notice in all of their faces/airs. The characters were probably given a game-bet where they should idiosyncratically enact the glorious event of the history. No script, awful screenplay, poor cinematography & a torturous background score. Just because it is a war film doesn't mean you stick trumpets into it.Lots of pretentious jokes about cigarettes and all seemed to be in-jokes because they made no sense. Not a single dialog worth quoting as is uncommon in Goerge Clooney films. No character depth, no real humor, no action sequence, as well. George Clooney walked throughout the film like he is loitering his time away. Matt Damon played a cameo. What was Bill Murray doing here? Hopeless!More, even the characters were finding it friendly to joke and tease about themselves. There was not a single shard of seriousness in any of the scene except during the chronicling of the loss, which was tremendously pompous.Just because I never get out of a movie mid-way I watched it for the whole 2 hours and left the place utterly disappointed. And then there is one speech-song that plays somewhere in the middle that pushed me to the brink of getting out. One last thing, the narration of the event in the film in the modified, deadpan voice of Clooney was the worst thing in the film.BOTTOM LINE: Do not waste your money on this. Try torrenting. No point on waiting & buying the BluRay either. Not recommended! Each of the ensemble cast disappoints; even John Goodman.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Good and Important Story,"This is based upon a true storyIn 1943 President Roosevelt ordered a team of curators, and historians to join the US Army and they became known as The Monuments Men. Their task was to find and secure art treasures in Germany and countries under German control and return them to the rightful owners. The Nazis accumulated all this treasure to fill the Hilter Museum in Hitler's hometown in Austria. Hitler used mine shafts, coffins, German officer estates and various castles to hide the treasures until his museum was ready. However, when the war was deemed lost Hitler decried that all art treasures should go to German museums. There is another theory on this: Hitler wanted all the treasures destroyed. And, we do see some of that in here.This movie seems like it's made up for entertainment purposes, but this was a real happening. This also seems somewhat disjointed but keep in mind that Frank Stokes (George Clooney) sent out several teams to distant places to look for the treasures. By doing this we don't really get to see the real nitty-gritty of the findings in any great detail because time is of the essence. So we see bits and pieces. The main item looked for was the Madonna and Child by Michelangelo, and Jan Van Eck's Ghent Alterpiece. But, the bouncing around from team to team didn't help keep us attentive except for some humor between Bill Murray as Richard Campbell and Bob Balaban as Preston Savitz. And, then we also see another comedy team of John Goodman as Walter Garfield and Jean Dujardin as Jean Claude Clermont. The humor with both of these teams was on the down-lo. And, rightly so.The only story of note is James Granger's (Matt Damon) interaction with Claire Simone (Kate Blanchett) a French woman who collaborated with the Nazis. She knew where Hilter sent all the treasures and kept records of the rightful owners, We hang with Granger as he tries to convince Claire that the US government will return the treasures to the rightful owners. She doesn't believe him and is a tough room to put it mildly.We don't see much of George Clooney in here as he also directed this movie. And, because we see George Clooney's name in lights and we run to the show. George Clooney should talk to Clint Eastwood about acting and directing in the same movie. This really needed a command post that juggled all the goings-on with the teams. Didn't happen. Yes, communication wasn't as it is today. StillThe only real drama occurs when the war is over and the Russians are seen advancing to the last place the Monuments Men are finishing up. And, here we are fighting the clock as the very last item isn't in the truck and the Russians are closing in. If the Russians get there in time, they get to keep the treasures. Those were the rules. Such excitement! I could hardly contain myself. Long story short: the Americans did leave behind something of note for the Russians. Can you guess what is was?Now, we don't know if the names that made up The Monuments Men that we see in here were real or not as there was no acknowledgment of them at the end of the movie. Or maybe that was an oversight. When the credits run, we do see black and white photos of some original Monuments Men and the treasures they secured. Neat.There is no mention of any monument to these men, who by the way, numbered close to 400. By my reasoning, there should be something set up in Washington, D.C. This is an important story that tells of these brave Monuments Men who were heroes and saved thousands of works of art and they should be recognized as such. To be honest, I never knew this happened and was glad it did and the story is finally told even if somewhat dis-jointed. Everyone should be aware of the Monuments Men and what they did for the world.If you are interested in more information go to Wikipedia. (7/10)Violence: Yes.

Wartime Ocean's Eleven,"You know how people complain that they ""don't make nice, simple movies"" anymore? Check this one out. Confidently directed by Clooney, this gorgeous film follows a group of WWII soldiers with one very complicated task: rescue and recover as many great works of art as they can from the Nazis. Sounds like an easy job, right? Nope. With the Germans losing the war, they started retreating back into their native land--and took everything they had pillaged with them. Or burned it. Clooney, Damon and Blanchett are great -- I got a distinct ""wartime Ocean's 11"" vibe from them -- but the real standouts are Bill Murray and John Goodman, investing their characters with heart. It's not the greatest movie ever made, and not even the best WWII movie ever made (that's Schindler's List, a movie I saw once and never need to see again), but it's the kind of the un-ironic, un-cynical movie Hollywood doesn't make any more.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Terrific team,"Not exactly a masterpiece but a movie worth to be seen anyway. It's the story of a team charged to rescue works of art namely masterpieces stolen by the Nazis from museums, churches and private owners (mainly Jews) at the end of World War II when their defeated army was retiring from occupied countries (France and Belgium) chased by the Allies. The story is told in a pleasant visual terms and with an excellent performing of all actors in a good vivid rhythm and in a very well rebuild sceneries and atmosphere of locals and action of that time. The rescue team acts very courageously and with great comradeship among them. The story is totally credible despite several odd and dangerous situations in which the rescue team gets involved also because sometimes they lack support from the American army for their actions. It's lively and active and it's said that it's based on true real events.

These two things might seem minimal to some, but it is the major reason this movie failed. The story could of been the most important and diverse part of this film. It was, however, just rushed and boring. Clooney's narration is just as bad, as he rambles about art being important because it is art? What is that nonsense.

"Rather disappointing war movie, mixing tragedy and comedy with too much flippancy","I usually fall asleep when I go and see movies at late show times, but I think the quality of this movie contributed to my falling asleep. A t the beginning the movie seems to promise a lot, the cast is great and you probably expects a lot from such great actors, but the movie never takes off, for different reasons. First, the contrast between the bleak theme and the comic treatment of the theme itself leaves somehow perplexed, as a result of this, every time there is a dramatic potential, it is banally resolved with some comic expedient, which is something which may works once, twice but not for the entire length of the movie. Moreover, the scenes do not seem to work together and in the end I got the impression of a chaotic scene sequence, moreover not supported by a strong script, so that the movie loses pungency in progress.

Underwhelming,"Overall, this film looks and feels just like George Clooney himself - pleasing and agreeable from any angle but thoroughly underwhelming. An obvious spin off of the Ocean 11 franchise, this romantic-meets-history-meets-attempted action mishmash is based on a fantastic true story and features more first class actors than any recent films and yet... It falls flat on its belly. Touchy-feely almost to the levels of Dr. Phil, disconnected from the reality or historical facts, this film is a prime example of great intentions going nowhere. Even though the film is set against the World War II backdrop, the war itself feels more like a spoof, something you would expect to see in Toy Story, and the goofy banter does not save the day (though it helps to distract). Sadly enough, the actors don't have enough ""shoulder room"" to play to their true potential, as their roles are rather schematic.

"A war movie with an ensemble cast that suffers from poor pacing, direction and characterization.","From CFR member George Clooney comes the cartoonish The Monuments Men, a blatant piece of Anglo-American propaganda. It's a good thing that I got to see this film for free. Director Clooney and screenwriter Grant Heslov took a real World War II story and turned it into an average film with few redeeming factors. There are abundant war movie clichés and propaganda clichés here, like the American obsession with the value of every soldier's life, the constant mention of Jews and what they allegedly went through, and stereotypical portrayals of protagonists and antagonists alike. The film may be based on a true story but it's been changed so much that it has almost nothing in common with that story. Even the names of the main characters have been changed. Some of Hollywood's biggest names participated in the film but they're mostly just playing themselves. George Clooney, for example, isn't really playing George L. Stout. He's playing George Clooney. The propaganda is constant, so you're always reminded that all Americans and their British buddies are freedom-lovers. The filmmakers also wanted to squeeze in as much comedy as possible. The American characters come off as a group of bunglers who tell jokes every chance they get. The German characters too are played for laughs as often as possible, and there's hardly any menace to them. Strangely, the only characters that are portrayed with any seriousness are the Russians, and these allies of the Americans are the only ones who seem menacing here. My question is why were the Russians even included in this film? Was it just so they could see that flag left behind by the ""freedom-loving"" Americans? Talk about strange. The only information the film offers about the Russians is that 20 million Russians were killed during the war. Yes, but it would have been more worthwhile to mention that the Germans looted or destroyed plenty of Russian art too. For example, the historic city of St. Petersburg was heavily bombed by the Germans. Most palaces, houses and monuments weren't left standing there. So a lot of what can be seen in the city now was rebuilt after the war. It's obvious that The Monuments Men was made for propaganda purposes. It was a rushed job too. The filmmakers didn't take the story seriously. Therefore, the film is a big failure. The performances by the ensemble cast are muted. John Goodman, playing Walker Hancock, and Bill Murray, playing Robert K. Posey, are the ones who suffer most in this respect. They could have been replaced by unknown actors and it wouldn't have made a difference. The only part of the story that seems developed is the relationship between James Rorimer (Matt Damon) and Rose Valland (Cate Blanchett). Everything else seems half-baked, especially the humorous conflict between Posey and Lincoln Kirstein (Bob Balaban). There were times when Clooney demonstrated that he can be a very good director. However, The Monuments Men is flawed both as a history lesson and as a men-on-a-mission movie. I don't recommend it.The filmmakers claim that the film is based on the book The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves And The Greatest Treasure Hunt In History by Robert M. Edsel. That may be true, but I think that they got the idea for making it from a Voice Of Russia interview.

Good 'ensemble' cast!,"Good/Interesting/kinda unique concept about a group of a dozen mostly non-military men who are on a mission, acting as an independent unit (ala THE DIRTY DOZEN) to recover as much as the world's GREATEST ART (paintings, sculptures, statues, of the greatest artists ever, STOLEN BY THE NAZIS, and hidden all over Germany, Austria, and of course, FRANCE!!!WWII movie features a group of 12 mostly old actors..., Matt Damon and director of the movie, George Clooney as well as this 'recovery' unit leader.Kudo performances to George Clooney, John Goodman, Bill Murray, Matt Damon, Kate Blanchett.....",7.0,Anonymous,History
Unremarkable yet Enjoyable,"The cast was pretty outstanding and the story good, the cinematography was decent and I enjoyed the music. The Monuments Men is by no means a bad film and as shown by my rating I enjoyed it, however, there was no umph factor. It was a quaint and well made film but wasn't ground-breaking or amazing either, still it's fun and light and a good movie to settle down and watch on a Sunday evening even if it is somewhat underwhelming.",7.0,Anonymous,History
egomaniac,"A monument to Clooney's ego, this film has the flavor of 12 directors who don't know each other working from a ""script"" written on 50 cocktail napkins by teenagers.It's a joke. There is absolutely no character development, no relation between scenes, improbable if not impossible events and no historical focus. It may be based on a true story, but it doesn't do that story justice.It's a waste of talent, as well. Has the sense of one of those WWII films where there's a Brit, a Frenchman, a Pole, etc. And the Frenchwoman? Only gets pulled in to end the movie...previously she's uncooperative, and we don't really see the change of heart except to assume she's attracted to the Matt Damon character. Cheesy in the extreme.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Pretty Lame really,"Moderately entertaining if somewhat unbelievable.
It's a bit hard to take seriously someone as grossly obese as John Goodman in fatigues. There's no way anyone could have got to that size on wartime rations let alone manage an assault course.
Clooney has said the film is about ""80% accurate."" Personally I find that a little generous given that the climax of the movie is ripped off a real life event completely unrelated to this story. It is actually a retelling of the US's mission to beat the Soviets to Werner Von Braun and his missile research and nothing to do with saving works of art.
But from the rest of the unengaging storyline I'm guessing there wasn't actually enough excitement in the true events to warrant an interesting screenplay.
In summary, it passes a couple of hours if you are bored. Band of Brothers - it ain't.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Besides having no script, no challenge, no evolution of character or plot, this is acted as it we, the spectators, are complete idiots. On top of this, you have numerous deliberate cigarette propaganda inserts that contribute nothing to the incomprehensibly bland story line. I have been working with television and film for the last two decades, teaching photography and video as well as watching passionately films from all around the world, including Hollywood, which I enjoy very much, but this is simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life.

It was a workmanlike effort,"Before we go any further, the use of the word ""tasked"" to describe something that one has been asked to do, did not come into popular culture until the Harvard types invented it in the '70's. Its use is as bad as ""these athletes are expected to medal"". Phew!, now that I've got that off my chest I feel better. Apart from that minor script lapse,this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't anything that would blow you away and there were really no memorable scenes but I didn't feel the need to storm out like some of the reviewers. I like George Clooney and he seems seems like a nice guy but he ain't no soldier. Matt Damon and Cate Blanchette played pretty good roles. John Goodman and Bill Murray were right on the edge of producing something fabulous but this story didn't allow them room. As for the guy who played Preston, well he is just the best , from the T.V executive on Seinfeld to just about any part I've seen him in since, Balaban has been superb.I kept getting Sam Epstein mixed up with the star of Inside Llewyn Davies so I was dissing him in my mind, but he put in a solid performance. Like so many of the movies these days this was just a good TV show without the ads. TV shows from the cable companies are much better than anything that Hollywood turns out lately. To summarize, I think that Cate is showing what a superb actress she is in every new movie she appears in and she was the bright spot in this effort. I'm very hard to please, so don't stay home because of me, it is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours. Oh one more thing before I go ..

Geeky Randy's summary,"Underrated war film directed, co-written, co-produced and starring George Clooney as Lt. Frank Stokes (loosely based on George L. Stout) who recruits six men to help him track down great works of art that Hitler has been stealing for a personal museum. With John Goodman and Bill Murray in tow, the movie easily hits most of its laughs with excellent timing, while at the same time also delivering sincerity in its message. Unfortunately, the moral of the story might be overlooked by the masses; you probably need to have a great appreciation for art or be an artist yourself to fully appreciate this movie. However, the film's greatest downfall is that the comedic moments do not segue well into dramatic moments, and vice versa. Clooney requested to have the release of this film pushed a couple of months, causing it to miss out on deserved Oscar buzz.

Well if you watch it, you can see where it goes wrong from time to time.It does work sometimes and the suave performance from most of the guys gives it a special flair.

Very disappointing movie,"The theme of the movie and the players looked very promising and was on my must see list. There have been a host of excellent films recently that have appealed and delivered but this one did no credit to the people who offered their lives to save millions of pieces of art and sculptures from destruction and loss collected by the Nazis during WW2. Sort of British ""Dads Army"" replica. The cast, which includes Matt Damon, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, and Bill Murray, seemed not to really be on the same set and appeared more like boy scouts on a summer camp and not in the middle of the battle ground in the center of WW2. Sure, the story itself is very interesting, but Clooney quite frankly did nothing to create any emotion. Cate Blanchett, played the French curator Claire Simone, is the lone bright spot here, turning in a performance that actually looked like she cared about the outcome of the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Missed Opportunity, but Still Entertaining","""The Monuments Men"" (2014), directed by George Clooney, his fifth film behind the camera, makes use of an irresistible premise: recover art works looted by the Nazis during the dying days of World War II. Not only is this a story never told before in the cinema (leading to an aura of uniqueness not often found with Hollywood studio pictures), but Clooney has assembled an enviable cast alongside himself with Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban and Cate Blancett.Yet as a war film about art, it rarely seems too concerned about the specifics of the paintings and sculptures they're trying to rescue. Jan Van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece and Michelangelo's ""Madonna and Child"" are the main focus of the film, providing a narrative thread for the script (written by Clooney and Grant Heslov), but the thousands upon thousands of other pieces of art (emphasised by frequent shots of warehouses or mines stacked with canvases) are generalised into anonymous cultural property in the need of preservation. It's frustrating, as are many parts of the film.It lacks a strong narrative drive, being, until the last third, very episodic – some are fine, like Murray's and Balaban's encounter with a young German soldier at night, but others, such as discovering barrels of gold teeth taken from Jews exterminated by the Holocaust, show the film's inadequacy dealing with the horrors of war. The pathos of members of the team dying and the mass destruction of art in impromptu bonfires lit by the German army are themes it finds hard enough to grasp and make the audience appreciate their impact. It keeps bumping into these big, important topics, the occupation of France and the role of collaborators say, pursuing them for a little while in subplots before backing away, unsure how to proceed, like over the use of child soldiers by the Germans, which is turned into almost an amusing anecdote.This dichotomy between seriousness and a lighter, caper feel, reminiscent at times of late sixties and early seventies war films (think ""Kelly's Heroes"" (1970) and their ilk, a feeling reinforced by Alexandre Desplat's bass-heavy music score) leads to an uneasily balance not solved by Clooney's at times uncertain and uneven direction. It always looks good thanks to cinematographer Phedon Papamichael's eye for framing, but the characters' speeches, justifying the importance of art even during wartime, sits awkwardly with the more cinematic moments, particularly the climactic race against time to liberate a huge storage of art.It remains entertaining and well-acted throughout, but it's clear that this is a film which could have been a more powerful exploration of its subject than it is. A missed opportunity then, enjoyable though, despite its failings.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Totally unmemorable,"It is amazing that World War Two can still throw up interesting subjects for a movie such as this one. Allied teams sent into liberated Europe to claim art stolen by the Nazis. Director George Clooney has assembled a great cast including Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Cate Blanchett and Hugh Bonnevile. The movie does not work. There is no drama, no tension or even a scene that will linger in your memory. It is a very mediocre film. Maybe its a lack of interesting characters, or the poor script or the light hearted tone.

Eye opening and heart warming,"Occasionally a film comes along, based on a true story, that really opens your eyes. That's what The Monuments Men did for me.

For a war story it has a very light touch. The story is told in small vignettes of the bigger tale. This is a little disjointed and possibly gives the idea that finding the stolen art was a fairly simple task but there are some wonderful scenes which allow me to forgive the minor flaws here. The shower scene with Bill Murray is very moving and the scale of some of the sets is breath-taking. There is some amazing scenery and the art dept must have been stretched on this one.I felt moved, entertained and educated when I came away from the cinema. Overall, a really good film.

Far from Monumental,"This film is not recommended.The Monuments Men tells the supposedly true story of a group of art lovers who fought to preserve the world's art treasures from the Nazis during World War II. Their on-going battle for acceptance from fellow Army officers and soldiers and their dangerous assignment takes them behind enemy lines and becomes the centerpiece for the film and its acting ensemble. This platoon of quirky artsy types join forces to accomplish their mission: rescue and retrieve art masterpieces and return them safely to their owners. The NEA would certainly gives its seal of approval and probably provide funding. I, on the other hand, found the film to be, shall I say, serviceable and competent.Directed, written, and starring George Clooney, The Monuments Men takes this actual event and trivializes its significance by making it a predictable World World II melodramatic film that John Wayne would wholeheartedly endorse. Clooney plays Frank Stokes, an art historian and connoisseur of the finer things in life, a role perfectly suited for the actor. Stokes assembles a squadron of talented American aesthetes skilled in their own particular field of expertise: James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman) and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban). He also adds to the mix one Briton, Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville), one Frenchman named Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), and a Parisian mademoiselle / translator / love interest, Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) to lend more international flavor and fervor to the cause. Needless to say, the names of these characters have been changed to protect the real-life heroes. The actors involved with this project should have asked for a nom de plume clause in their contract as well. All try their best to add some depth to their sketchy characters and have done better work than seen here.There are some snags along the way, both in the film's plot and its execution. The film's major flaw is its script, co-authored by Clooney and Grant Heslov. It follows a throughly conventional formula with its one-dimensional types substituted for well-drawn characters who rarely resemble their real-life counterparts. (A romance between Simone and Granger is based on pure fiction.) The film is choppy and episodic as it jumps from one encounter to the next. Too many scenes consist of endless speeches decrying the weightiness of art, its cultural legacy, and America's stoicism above all else. It's as if the filmmakers need to convince themselves and their movie-going audience the significance of these brave men and their saintly quest. The Monuments Men constantly overstates their cause and effect.But this is old-fashioned Hollywood movie-making, a patriotic crowd-pleasing throwback to a slice of American heroics of long ago. We've seen this all so many times before in better war dramas from the 60's. (Films like The Longest Day, The Guns of Navarone, The Train, The Dirty Dozen, and The Great Escape easily come to mind and are superior films worth multiple viewings. This film is not.) Production values remain strong and its period details are fine, the only exception being the usually reliable Alexandre Desplat and his intrusive and annoying film score that becomes a self-parody of war movie musical clichés.￼The Monuments Men is informative and entertaining, but it never rises to the degree of exciting or memorable. Far from monumental, The Monuments Men becomes a mere footnote in the annuals of art and cinematic history. Their valiant story deserves better.

An important aspect of WWII about our earlier history and culture.,"This movie was loosely adapted from the book of the same name which was originally based on the true story of the world war two. It was a war drama with a theme of the treasure hunt directed by our own George Clooney. The movie had multi top stars who team up for a specially assigned task. Just like the Alistair MacLean stories they lead their way to the war zone to accomplish.I don't know how much close to the original story it was, but this movie was a bit slow and drag, all the way dull. But not to forget the story intentionally serves its elements to us without surprises and twists. What we really miss was the scenes that pull us to our seat's edge. Yeah, the fast paced furious thrillers, especially in the last few minutes I was desperate for that and it did come, but did not please me. Even the deaths in the movie were not convinced or appeals strongly. Most of the time I thought it was a dark comedy, especially in the last scene of Jean Dujardin.Other than cinematically transformation fail, I really liked the story. In the real story with real people it would have been a hell of a job than in the movie, which portrays few pieces of the real incident. Heartbreaks to know that many valuables were destroyed during Hitler's invasion of Europe and also makes me happy that these men saved most of it. No doubt, it was a reasonable attempt by George Clooney. Because this story must reach widely to expose these men's bravery and it's only possible through a movie.

A Small Piece of the Story of Art Looted or Destroyed by the Nazis,"Odd that no one ever made this movie 60 years ago. ""The Monuments Men"" assembles a cast in very much the way as post-World War II films like ""Command Decision,"" which brought together Clark Gable, Walter Pidgeon, Van Johnson, Brian Donlevy, Charles Bickford, John Hodiak, and Edward Arnold in a compelling but largely forgotten study of the military vs. politics. Forgotten in much the same way ""The Monuments Men"" is likely to be forgotten in 60 years, even thought it stars George Clooney, Matt Damon, John Goodman, Bill Murrary, Jean DuJardin, Kate Blanchette, Bob Balaban, and Hugh Bonneville.You have to give director and star Clooney credit for bringing to the screen this tale, based on historical events, of a group of art experts drafted into the military to recover paintings and sculpture looted from across Europe by the invading Nazis. Their sacrifice, their harrowing mission, saved countless works of art destined for destruction by Hitler and his team of vandals, who believed that if they couldn't have them nobody else would either.I was reading ""The Clarinet Polka"" by Keith Maillard, a 2002 novel that's been waiting on my bookshelf for a dozen years. In this wickedly funny book about life in a Polish community in West Virginia, I read on page 107: ""To Mrs. Dluwiecki, everything that was good and true and beautiful was Poland before the war. She went on and on about the beautiful china and crystal and silver her family used to have, and all the oil paintings that'd been in the family for generations. She remembered all the fancy outfits she'd ever worn, and she described them to Janice down to the finest detail. She even remembered things like her white veil and her little white shoes from her first Communion that she'd saved in a special wooden box, and the little silver scissors her mother had used to cut the roses-and all that beautiful stuff was gone, lost, plundered by the Germans. She didn't even have any photographs from those days. She said she'd lost her precious heritage and all she had left was memory."" And so it was with millions of Poles-Jews and Gentiles-who lost their heritage, their homes, and six million of them their lives in the Holocaust. I put the book on the coffee table and went to see ""The Monuments Men.""Set in France and Germany, it was disappointing that ""The Monuments Men"" mentioned Poland only once in the entire film when early on George Clooney, as leader of the group, explains that the Nazis have been ""stealing art from Amsterdam, Warsaw, and Paris."" Historically, the Allies never came to Poland's rescue, and the movie shows the Americans narrowly missing the Russian army as it advanced into Germany, having already ""liberated"" (meaning taken over) Poland. Late in the film we see, but only if we are alert enough to notice, that Leonardo da Vinci's ""Lady with an Ermine"" (now hanging in the Czatoryski Museum in Krakow) is one of the paintings these brave men recovered.Historically interesting and beautiful to watch, ""The Monuments"" Men somehow falls short of generating in the audience the kind of passion for art that possessed the lead characters. How much more compelling this film would have been in the hands of Poland's great director Andrzej Wajda.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Perhaps one of the last unique looks at WWII,"Sometimes the point of a movie is to take you somewhere nobody has gone before, to thrill or chill, but there are other reasons for making a movie. This move memorializes people who were trying to salvage what it means to be human in the midst of inhuman atrocities. Our culture reflects who we are, or even makes us who we are, and this move clearly (and painfully) points this out.I really appreciate that screenwriter, producer and director George Clooney took a balanced approach, mixing painful emotion with humor without resorting to gratuitous violence. Mature, intelligent moviegoers don't need blood splatter everywhere to get it that someone was shot.People who pan this movie are missing the point. While I am sure there was at least some literary license, as far as my scant research can tell, they stayed within reasonable sight of the true story. They respected the historical events enough to avoid the temptation of catering to the violence-numbed populous. I respect George Clooney for that. He knows the business well enough to know he was making a ""dull"" movie, but the story was more important to him than making some extra $$$.The characters involved were not easy to get to know, but it seems that every actor did a good job in capturing what was known of the personalities (after being filtered through the book...?). There was a lot of talent on the set, but no detectable egos run amok - all the performances seemed professional as works of love and respect. Some could rightfully claim that these were not the best performances of these actors' careers, but I would claim they were among the most dedicated and heartfelt.I give it a nine instead of a ten because I am rather certain it would have been a better movie if Barbara Hall had not been involved. I'm sure George had his reasons for including her, and we will never really know what it may have been without her (perhaps we can thank her of the absence of the gratuitous violence!)Anyway, well done.

Art worth dying for,"I am convinced that George Clooney felt compelled to make a statement about the importance of protecting what's essential to Western Civilization.

My reaction to the film was entirely different from it's louder critics. I have never seen the Ghent Altarpiece nor the Madonna of Bruges. But I made a vow to go see them for myself asap. And I am grateful to Mr. Clooney that he nudged my priorities in the right direction. It is true enough that Clooney should have made a much better film of it all. It is odd to see men supposedly looking for hidden art in dusty cellars and blown-up mine shafts, themselves looking like aging movie stars on a costume picnic in their spotless just off the rack uniforms. On the other hand, repeated departures from any sense of realism seem to be a choice of style rather than just mistakes. I intend to give the film a second chance and just try not to be annoyed by its obvious flaws.

A noble but bland effort,"Based on the true story of art experts going into the front-line to safeguard major art-pieces at the end of World War II in Europe before the Nazis could destroy them or the Soviet seize them serves as George Clooney's latest directional . This war film has a deliberately old-fashioned feel, being more light hearted and comic approach, being an adventure for a group of unlikely of men trying to preserve many masterpieces of Western Culture. But the jokes for the most part fall flat or offer minor chuckles and smiles. Plus Clooney's direction and writing does go for very sentimental and sappy and he seems to not be able to take a tone, whether to be a romp or be more dramatic as it heavily hints towards the Holocaust. The sloppy writing is as Clooney tries to juggle the tones, skip past some dark themes like a child sniper (which was played for laughs) and has major pacing issues as at some parts the film skips through some parts of the film, such as the recruitment and training of the characters yet slow down at other times. Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett were given particularly thankless roles as they work together in Paris, disappearing as the rest of the cast fight on the front line.Despite Clooney's noble intentions and excellent cast The Monuments Men falters with his misjudged tone and Clooney has made better films as a director.",5.0,Anonymous,History
An Award Season Misfit Moved to a February Release,"In the early scenes of ""The Monuments Men,"" director George Clooney introduces his supporting cast of characters portrayed by John Goodman, Bill Murray, and Bob Balaban. Humiliatingly sending this group of elderly actors through physical fitness trainings before the film transitions into its World War II plot, the audience could confuse ""The Monuments Men"" with last November's ""Last Vegas.""'""The Monuments Men"" boasts an impressive advertisement to entice the interest of the public. The cast includes Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, and Clooney himself; three reliable actors who can usually earn their films a stamp of approval. However, ""The Monuments Men"" deceives its audience with a promise of a quality storyline that features American soldiers searching to retrieve irreplaceable art that Hitler and the Nazis have stolen from France.George Clooney may have been on the path of becoming the next Warren Beatty, a heartthrob actor turned serious director, until ""The Monuments Men."" His direction is not the film's sorest aspect, but the directing itself is substantially weaker than the skills he has shown recently with ""The Ides of March"" and ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" He attempts to run the story with a path in mind, but his attempts feel like his legs were injured while trying run on that path. The film's score adds an essence of floating patriotism, which offsets the comedic tone established by writing.The difficulty of ""The Monuments Men"" is the screenplay. In addition to acting and directing, Clooney also wrote the screenplay with co-writer Grant Heslov for ""The Monuments Men."" The dialogue tries diligently to make clever cultural references and create amusing one-liners, but most of the written word in the script flops like a poorly made piece of sushi. I wonder if Clooney was consciously writing the script or if he was actually executing effort; if that is the case, my heart goes out to his lacking ability to write competent dialogue.With those high-status actors, one would think they would be able to be the saving grace of ""The Monuments Men."" Sadly, the male actors show no signs of characterization, making their characters feel like extensions of their own personalities. The only performer who is marginally successful is Cate Blanchett. In her Oscar-winning performance in ""Blue Jasmine,"" Blanchett played a character that arguably no other actress could portray except her. In contrast, her character, Claire in ""The Monuments Men"" is a role generic enough to be played by any aspiring actress. In her first scene, Claire spits into someone's drinking glass and my response was a sympathetic one, knowing Blanchett is capable of better work.""The Monuments Men"" wants to be a serious film, but falls back on comedy, becoming a real- life treasure hunt. Clooney attempts to force sentiment on his audience, but it is unearned and unwanted.

Presumable award contender falls short in every category,"It is no surprise that The Monuments Men was one of the most anticipated titles of last year. The cast, the story, the trailers all made the movie look like an instant classic. Sadly, it's more the contrary.The story goes as follows: A group of middle-aged men is trying to stop the Nazis from dispatching famous pieces of art. The idea sounds great, doesn't it? It should have been great. The problem lies in the way the story is presented: There doesn't seem to be any continuation. It's as if the chapters were created on their own, and placed with no regard to the story whatsoever. The script is too cheesy and often feels out of place, not something you would expect from a movie like this.The cast looks promising, the characters they play don't. Clooney and Damon kind of overshadow for instance Murray and Blanchett, simply because they feel their role is to be more 'prominent' than the rest.All in all, the movie is good, but doesn't live up to its expectations in any possible way, which is a shame. This could have been so much more.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Art for Art's Sake,"Due to the initial success of the Nazi war effort in France, Poland and other European countries certain art enthusiasts get together and offer a plan to the President of the United States to build a small military unit to go to the front lines and recover all of the valuable paintings and sculptures they can before they are shipped off to Germany. Naturally, with the overall victory over Germany and Italy still in doubt there aren't many resources available to them and the task at hand is extremely dangerous as well. However, their efforts are rewarded to a certain degree when a man named ""Frank Stokes"" (George Clooney) is given the authority to assemble a squad to carry out the mission. To that effect, he gathers various art collectors and enthusiasts that he can trust and together they venture into France, Belgium and even Germany in order to acquire the treasures before the Germans can hide or destroy them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting film in large part because it was based on a true story. Having said that, however, I must admit that there were some scenes that seemed a bit contrived and unrealistic. Be that as it may, that's not to say that I necessarily disliked this film and all things considered I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Big Fun, Big Heart, Old Fashioned","""The Monument Men"" is a fun, old-fashioned, feel good movie. I walked out of the theater inspired. The movie isn't perfect but its gifts outweigh its flaws.""The Monument Men"" tells the story of a group of art experts recruited by the US armed forces during WW II to ensure that Europe's artistic heritage was not destroyed in the war.Hitler had been a painter before he became fuhrer. Joseph Goebbels was a novelist. Speer was an architect. Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl did as much to spread Nazism as many troops. Nazis didn't just mass murder human beings. They burned books and paintings. They worked very hard to destroy ""decadent"" art and to elevate and appropriate art they deemed worthy. Nazis plundered and stockpiled other countries' art. Just the other day, Feburary 6, 2014, art the Nazis stole from Poland was repatriated. In January, 2014, the World Jewish Congress demanded that Germany do a better job of returning art.There's a long tradition of World War II movies about international, all-star teams of experts uniting to achieve some goal: ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Guns of Navarone,"" ""Kelly's Heroes,"" ""Dirty Dozen,"" ""The Longest Day,"" ""A Bridge Too Far."" And of course George Clooney is a veteran of the ""Oceans"" movies.""The Monument Men"" is a little bit WW II team movie, a little bit Oceans. The team members are shown going about their day to day lives when George Clooney shows up and signs them up. The movie is based on a real project, and it plays like the best anecdotes from that project's team members. It's a series of vignettes that aren't particularly coherently connected. Some of the vignettes were not clear to me. Why was Matt Damon suddenly flying in a biplane over Paris at night? It was a pretty scene but I didn't understand how it fit into the rest of the plot. Why was the German-Jewish translator, Sam, suddenly carrying a wounded soldier into a mobile army surgical unit? Who was that soldier? Not sure.Other vignettes are really gripping, moving, suspenseful, and/or funny. The movie won me over with its depiction of a British art expert's heroic attempt to rescue a Michelangelo Madonna from Belgium. I cried. I was inspired.There is a funny, scary, sickening scene where a beefy German dentist hammers away at Bill Murray's teeth with a mallet and pliers while Bob Balaban makes provocative commentary about how he bets all the Germans were innocent – not.There's a powerful scene where Americans are invited to a German home for dinner, and discover that the paintings on the dining room walls are too good to be reproductions.The movie is flawed. Its editing is choppy. It feels rushed. I got the sense that not enough time was devoted to cast members building bonds with each other. John Goodman and Jean Dujardin are meant to be tight team members, but I saw no real chemistry between them. Not nearly enough time is devoted to fleshing out the all-star cast's characters, or to simple exposition. I'd simply like to know more about everything on screen, from the Ghent altarpiece to Hitler's Nero decree. I would like to have seen the Nero decree's destruction of art placed into the context of the mass suicides at the end of the war. Hitler's suicide isn't even mentioned in ""Monuments Men.""Sam, a GI, is recruited as a German translator. The average moviegoer might have no idea that Sam is Jewish. Sam says, ""I'm from NORTH Newark."" How many moviegoers know that North Newark was a Jewish neighborhood? Sam says that his grandfather in Germany was not allowed to enter a museum and joked about being barred because he was ""too short."" The real reason he was barred is that he was a Jew, but the movie never states that plainly.I got the impression that Clooney was making his film for people with short attention spans who want the shallowest treatment possible of the subject matter. That's too bad, because with a little more tender loving care, this could have been a great movie rather than a good one.Some popular culture and even academic retellings of WW II work to humanize, or even exculpate, Germans. ""Monuments Men"" does not. At first I thought that Sam would be the good German character – the noble ""true"" German who hated the Nazis from the get-go, resisted them, and was now helping the allies defeat them. But Sam turns out to be Jewish. ""Monuments Men"" uses the word ""German"" were a more German-friendly film would be careful to use the word ""Nazi,"" thus emphasizing that not all Germans were guilty, but merely an ideology.""Monuments Men"" is unusual among recent American films in that it unapologetically and enthusiastically celebrates Western Civilization and the Christian heritage as something that utopians – in this case Nazis – tried to destroy, and that good people – among them Americans – heroically and courageously died to preserve. This is a really remarkable message. I wonder if left-wing Clooney embraced it because he saw ""Monuments Men"" as being about Art, not about Western Civ or the Judeo-Christian heritage. The two artworks focused on the most – the Ghent altarpiece and the Michelangelo Madonna are both overtly Christian.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Who really cares about art? That's the real issue with the film,"There's no mission, no objective no real reason. It meanders along with some vague notion about saving some art. It's hardly the stuff of interest. There is no, and yet, either. It is what it is.It's hardly as bad as the negative reviews would suggest either. I had to watch this whole movie for myself because I couldn't believe it was as bad as these 1/10 reviews suggest.It's not a bad film, it's sort of entertaining but I couldn't accept that anyone actually gives a flying fig about art this much. So for me ultimately the story had nothing driving it.There is very little in the way of plot and there is no character development. You don't get the chance to know the characters. When one dies it's like sure someone died queue the waterworks but you really don't care that they died.I've given it a 7/10 because it's a great effort to create something set 70 years ago.

"Great story, not a great movie","An all-star cast. Great story. Obviously well acted. I admire George Clooney more every day. He is on my top five list of people I would love to have dinner with----though I suspect he and I would argue a lot. Kudos to George for making this story into a film. It should be admired. There was one problem. This was not a great movie.The Monuments Men is an drama about some middle aged men being drafted into a World War II platoon to save great works of art threatened by Hitler and the Nazis. Think Space Cowboys (2000) meets Stripes without as much charm and humor.My expectations were unfortunately huge for this film. It had been hyped more than Susan Rice pushed the "" Innocence of Muslims"" for causing the Benghazi massacre. The trailers have all the funny and interesting scenes. The rest is really a dramatic documentary, and for that, it has great value. TMG just walked out of the film feeling, ""okay, nice film, let's get dinner."" Don't get me wrong. The film and its story are monumental.literally. But great movies are a different thing. This just was not a great movie.I might have easily tolerated an another hour of this film, perhaps going into greater detail of the Nazi stealing machine or more behind the scenes action to save it---even the politics to make it happen. I was thinking more like Charlie Wilson's War (2007). I would have gladly traded two hours of the wasted time in The Wolf of Wall Street for more education on great works of world art.The one great moral question this film posed was the value of human life versus the value of historic works of art. Clooney, as art warrior Frank Stokes, states unequivocally near the end that saving the artwork was worth men's lives. I am not sure I am convinced. I think his statement that the men who died would have felt their effort was noble and just to fight evil like the Nazi's was worth it, ...but their lives for canvas with paint and carved marble? TMG thinks human life is more scared and valuable. Reasonable efforts? Sure. But there will be more great artists and more great works made. Saving the past is hugely important, but not at the cost of my Dad's life (who survived WWII) or that of my son or daughter. This was a point well made in this film by the Army leaders who had already seen way too many young men and women die. They were not going to risk more lives to save pictures. I think their viewpoint may have been too dismissed in the film.Go see this film. Support what it stands for. Take your children. Educate them on the meaning of guts, bravery, principals, evil, culture and goodness. Just don't expect a great movie. But thanks George. TMG does appreciate the effort.",,Anonymous,History
Clooney brings the old time war movie back to the big screen,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAs World War 2 draws to a close, and the allied forces draw in on Germany, Major Huey Lewis (George Clooney) brings his own daring mission to the forefront: retrieving stolen artworks that the Nazis have pilfered by Jewish artists, to either be destroyed or usurped by Hitler and placed in his planned Fuhrer Museum. He assembles a ragtag squadron from different units (and even different armies) and they are plunged into a desperate race against time to save the works before it's too late.The terrible antics of ISIS have been in the news lately, with their various atrocities around the world, but mention was given to the ancient monuments they smashed to pieces in the Middle Eastern countries they've invaded, representing centuries of culture. It's a tactic they've obviously taken on from fanatics of time gone past, not simply wanting to eradicate a whole race of people, but also all the items of value that their culture produced, so that they're dead in people's memories, as well as physically. George Clooney's full bodied, all star homage to gung ho, cavalier war films of times gone past, takes the traditional war film, and applies it to a different type of story.An all star cast, made up of mostly older heads, with Matt Damon probably being the youngest, adds to the old fashioned feel of it all, with John Goodman before he lost so much weight, and Bill Murray, who can wonderfully channel the same expression to convey feelings of laughter and feelings of sadness. Adding to the Sunday afternoon feel of it all is a lack of depiction in the brutal, blood drenched reality of war, just ambling along and telling the story the way it would have in the 40s and 50s. But it is Clooney's show all the way, his affection for the type of film he's copying the style of beautifully evident.It's all wrapped up quite wonderfully too, unlike a lot of war films at under the two hour mark, making for a much more condensed affair. I'm not sure why it's attracted as much scorn as it has. All in all, it's a pretty forgettable experience, with nothing to really make it stand out from other films of it's type, other than being about a mission to save paintings than people. In that sense at least, it's daring and ambitious, and while the results are pretty hit and miss, it's no more hit than miss. ***",7.0,Anonymous,History

needs a bit more Indiana Jones,"Frank Stokes (George Clooney) argues for the rescue of the art of Europe as the Germans pull back. He recruits art experts for the task.

James Granger (Matt Damon) goes to Paris and finds French art expert Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) who is leery to help him. Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville) goes to Bruges to find a Madonna sculpture.It's fine to have light comedic moments in a war movie. The problem is that there isn't much of a war in this movie. I understand this is based on a real group of people but this movie needs a bit more Indiana Jones to spice it up. Also it hurts the movie to keep splitting the group up. Matt Damon's bad french is funny. Bill Murray and Bob Balaban seems to have fun ribbing each other.

A simplistic telling of an interesting story,"I was interested in this film having recently seen a documentary about the actual events. I had no expectations so wasn't disappointed but felt that I had gone back in time - not to the war but back to the sixties when war films had lots of jolly music and there was no blood and gore. A touch of 'Where Eagles; Dare,' or Guns of Navarone. The heroes were all decent chaps and the Germans were all nasties. I enjoyed watching it, but it was like a kid's film. There was a hint of a love interest between Cate Blanchett's character and Mat Damon but it was rather ridiculous as the characters had no sexual chemistry at all. The other characters were all one dimensional and John Goodman trying to look sensitive involved him grimacing for most of the movie. I think maybe George Clooney should have left either the directing or the writing to someone else - perhaps he is trying to do too much.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Disappointing,"Don't know exactly what I was expecting, but the story just didn't hold together or flow very well for me. There were a few interesting scenes, and of course you knew the premise or storyline because it is painfully laid out to you, but it just played out to me like a bunch or somewhat related scenes, not a cohesive compelling movie. And while they told us why they need to save the art was so compelling they failed to really show it, to me at least. It seems like a common problem with ""star ensemble"" movies. You get a lot of people with a little face time, but not much story or character development. The stars did a good job of hyping the thing on the various talk shows, perhaps the build up added to the disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Clooney's Message about the Value of Art and Life,"Is a work of art, even one as irreplaceable as the Ghent Altarpiece or a Michelangelo Madonna, worth a man's life? Especially today, when extortionate museum admission charges reserve art for the privileged few. George Clooney clearly believes the answer is ""yes,"" and he hammers the message home as producer, writer, director, and star of his preachy film ""The Monuments Men."" Those dastardly Nazis strike again and loot Europe's museums and private collections with the intention of establishing a gigantic Fuehrer Museum in Germany. The stolen art works are shipped to the Fatherland, where they are hidden from advancing Allied forces, and Clooney and his team are assigned to retrieve and return the masterpieces.With slick production values, the movie resembles a big-budget war movie from the 1960's and has a simplistic old-fashioned quality. The star-studded cast is also a throwback to earlier war films, although the A-list team is largely underused and under-challenged. George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, and John Goodman play stock characters, while the charming Oscar winner Jean Dujardin is wasted in a small part. Only Cate Blanchett stands out as a member of the French resistance who has critical information about the missing art; Blanchett alone immerses herself in character, although her rapid attitude shift towards Damon may provoke whiplash in some.Clooney has borrowed liberally from other war films, and references to ""The Battle of the Bulge"" and ""The Bridge at Remagen"" only remind viewers of even more. John Frankenheimer's ""The Train"" visually posed the same life vs art question, but Frankenheimer wisely left viewers to ponder the answer for themselves; Clooney does not trust his audience, but rather answers the question for them several times over. Clooney's use of the melancholy ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" pales in comparison to the unforgettable images that accompanied that song in John Foreman's grim and gritty film, ""The Victors."" Even the Spielbergian sentiment of the final scene evokes ""Saving Private Ryan."" Clooney's team faces hostility from their own troops, who are intent on victory, despite the cost to cultural treasures. Time also pressures them as the Russians move into German territory where the stolen works have been hidden; those nasty Russians intend to keep the purloined art for their own museums as war reparations. However, despite the pressures, the often naive team make time to pat each other on the back and smile smugly, hang American flags to taunt adversaries, stand in awe like schoolboys on a museum outing, and seemingly wander off sightseeing in enemy-held territory. While Clooney does a competent job under all four of his caps, ""The Monuments Men"" is a message picture wrapped in glossy trimmings. The film is not bad and retains viewer attention, but some may resent the preachings of a wealthy handsome Hollywood star and prefer to make up their own minds about the value of art vs human life.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Clooney performs as a Clark Gable clone,"George Clooney directed this old-fashioned movie and starred in it looking like Clark Gable. Despite the negative reviews, there is nothing basically wrong with the movie. It tells a straight story, based on facts. It has a short introduction, where we get to meet all the main characters; a development, where we follow the different characters in their adventures and an end that wraps up the whole film.Granted, today's audience, used to fast editing, special effects, gore and over the top scripts may find it difficult to appreciate what is really old school story-telling. However, some of the reviews I read here do not make any sense: somebody complained about ""lack of character development"", but they should know that in movies with a large cast, character development is hardly a priority.Somebody else mentioned that it is ""absurd"" to leave gold and art in cave. Well, that actually happened for real, as the retiring Nazis could not carry all that stuff with them. Just check the historical records Other complained about ""yet another movie about WWII"". Perhaps they should check in advance which movies they are going to see, if they do not care about WWII movies.I agree about the fact that given the premises it could have been a better movie, but I still found it entertaining. Murray, Damon and Clooney were good as usual and even Blanchett, in a small role, managed a decent performance.Definitely not a masterpiece but an enjoyable movie to watch, especially if you like classic movies moving at a slower pace.",7.0,Anonymous,History
a good historical lesson,"I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. It got so much advertisement forever and then I think the release date was pushed back, which is usually not a good sign. Most people I know who had seen it said it was a good historical lesson, but not very entertaining. Although, I was a little more entertained than I thought I would be, I do have to agree. It's more interesting than it is entertaining per-say. What I think I like best about it is the cast. Bill Murray, John Goodman, Matt Damon, George Clooney, Jean Dujardin etc. all worked together so well. They are just these old artist type guys who formed a company to go out into occupied Europe to recover the art that the Nazi's stole. Pretty simple plot and the movie are actually pretty simple, but there is a lot more to what actually happened. There is a show on The Military Channel called Secrets of WW2. They had a segment on The Monuments Men, which fleshed out a lot of the details of what happened. If you are a WW2 buff, I think you will enjoy this.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Monuments Men Stands Still,"The movie opens with Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Frank Stokes (Clooney) pleading with President Roosevelt to protect Europe's cultural heritage by forming the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Program, nicknamed the Monuments Men. After he receives the go-ahead he recruits a gaggle of art professionals including art historians (Matt Damon, Hugh Bonneville), architects (Bill Murray), sculptors (John Goodman) and other artists (Jean Dujardin & Bob Balaban). Their mission: to find caches of stolen art and rescue them from the pilfering Nazis.Costarring Cate Blanchett as art curator for the occupied Paris Museum, Monuments Men tries to be a mixture of Guns of Navarone (1961), Topkapi (1964) and National Treasure (2004) but fails on all counts. From the get go the film plods through the plot like it has no particular place to go. The principle cast is given little opportunity to flesh out their characters with only Damon given the opportunity to really let loose. Yet even his wings are clipped by an uninteresting courtship with Blanchett's character which seems tagged on because, you know, without Blanchett it'd be a sausage-fest.Part of the fault lies with George Clooney who in addition to starring also directed. His direction is adequate but far from commanding keeping everything mid-range, eye-level, and simply blocked. His style has never seemed to grow since Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002) and while his by-the-books camera-work might work for Good Night, and Good Luck (2005) it simply can't for a retread of The Train (1964). Word of advice, if you're trying to recreate the grandeur of old Hollywood in your films, don't use the same techniques, put your own stamp on it.Of course the film is not all bad. Art students might enjoy playing a game of find the Vermeer instead of paying attention to Clooney's pronouncements of importance. There are a handful of funny moments for those who haven't seen the trailers. There's a running gag with people continually complaining about Damon's bad French which is amusing. Also Murray and Balaban's characters do make a good team in a Bob Hope, Bing Crosby kind of way. If the movie consisted of just them and Blanchett's capable yet under-appreciated Parisian dame, I might be okay with that.If Monuments Men were placed in a WWII four pack with Red Tails (2012), Enemy at the Gates (2001) and Defiance (2008) I might buy it (though the draw would be Enemy at the Gates). The film succeeds in telling the story of the MFAA without being too cloying or discourteous. But after the credits roll and the house lights come up you might be wishing the film was more interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Pass the Popcorn! review,"George Clooney is usually considered a good actor and an even better director. Although he directed only a few movies, almost all of them were good, especially The Ides of March and Good Night and Good Luck. So it was natural to expect much from The Monuments Men, particularly since, even before its release (and its postponement), it was considered an Oscar contender. Add to all this the cast of good and talented actors, and the interesting true story (I'd never heard of the monuments men before), and you'll get something that's probably too good to be true. But The Monuments Men isn't good: it's a very confusing movie that is either extremely comedic or extremely dramatic, and it doesn't work.The Monuments Men are a group of art historians and museum directors and curators, led by Frank Stokes (George Clooney), who are sent to Europe during World War II in order to try and prevent the Nazis from stealing and destroying art pieces, and to find the art that has been stolen so they can return it to the rightful owners. They start off as a group, but are then sent, as couples, each in a different town, throughout France and Germany. The story is simple, but it's very difficult to follow what's happening, since there are characters who look similar (Hugh Bonneville is like a combination of Bill Murray and John Goodman) and only Matt Damon and George Clooney's characters are properly introduced, from the beginning. All the others eventually gain some personality towards the end of the movie.It could be said that there's no villain in this movie. Of course, the Nazis are the bad guys, but it's not easy to feel the tension of war and fighting if you don't have a physical character that represents the bad guys. There are some shots of Hitler and various generals/officers, but all of them are just generically sleazy and irritating, like there hasn't been put any effort in making them quality villains, because we already know Nazis were bad people. Another big problem with the movie is that, for a lot of its duration, it seems like a collection of loosely connected individual stories, and when one ends and the other one begins, the most common reaction is ""oh, I forgot this guy was in the movie"". And this happened every time they showed Matt Damon on screen. Logically, you can't connect with the characters and feel for them – even when somebody dies, you couldn't care less.The soundtrack isn't objectively bad, but it's more suited for a Disney movie than The Monuments Men, and it makes even the most serious and dramatic moments look pathetic and silly. The things that redeem this movie are the good performances by the cast, some well-executed scenes and the story – because, as I've already said, I had never heard of the monuments men before, this movie taught me something. It's just sad that such an important and interesting part of history has been ignored until now, and has been ruined with this movie, that can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama, so it goes from tragic scenes of death to scenes that look like spoofs. In short, you better skip this movie.Rating: 6/10 Read more at passpopcorn.com",6.0,Anonymous,History
The Monumental disappointment,"The Monuments Men is allegedly a true story (though I suspect rather embellished) of a mission by allied art lovers to save the wealth of public and private art from being captured by Nazi Germany and/or destroyed on Hitler's death. The real life photos over the end-titles indicate that it certainly wasn't all made up.Though this premise is a little less than gripping ('scraping the bottom of the barrel' in terms of war stories comes to mind), it must have looked good on paper: George Clooney (both starring and directing), Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin (though without Uggie), John Goodman, Bill Murray, Hugh Bonneville and Cate Blanchett (hot Oscars property for Blue Velvet). ALL IN THE SAME FILM. They'll all sure look good on the side of a London bus – - and they do.However, unfortunately this is not a good film. It's not even a good war film.The whole film feels like its been stitched together from 3 minute long vignettes, without any sort of arc of a story and nothing to stop the viewer getting restless. What IS Matt Damon actually doing in Paris for all that time, other than having a nice holiday? Why does one of the lead characters lamely hide behind a wall while he (sorry, spoiler, it is a he) is being shot – is his acting so dodgy that he can't be seen on camera? Why does George Clooney – so brilliant in The Descendants – lapse into this rolling eyed twitchy performance that typified his early roles? Why is Cate Blanchett given so little to do? And why is her boss such a terrible shot? So many questions, so little time.The film does manage to muster something more solid in the last 15 minutes or so, but it is too little too late in my book.The one redeeming feature of the whole film are some of the performances. Bill Murray shows just what a good character actor he is away from his comedy roles. The scene in the shower where he hears his message from home is genuinely touching. And as a massive fan of Spielberg's Close Encounters, I have a particular soft spot for Bob (""I'm a mapmaker"") Balaban. Here he is one of the lesser known 'stars', but he gives one of the best performances in the film.And there is a jaunty score from Alexander Desplat (""The Kings Speech"") – seemingly omni-present at the moment in the scoring room. Interestingly, Desplat also acts in the film as ""Emile"": I'm not sure who this was, but it will make me want to watch the film again when it comes on the box! But – unless it's too late to warn you – don't get drawn in by the hype.

I asked him if he knew about this movie, he said no, and we watched it.Yes, this was a true story and my Dad was part of it. He is now calling himself a ""Monuments Man"". His only comments were that what he did wasn't that exciting. Since this movie honored and acknowledged what he did, it meant the whole world to him and us, his family.This movie gets a 10 out of 10 for that alone. It encouraged and put a smile on an old man's face. Thank you for that.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Needed More Screen Time Devoted to the Art,"Noble and Refreshing, this Real-Life Story Condensed from the Hundreds of Participants in the Pursuit of Recovering Historical and Priceless Art Stolen by the Nazis is Somewhat Disappointing but Always Important in its Premise. Is Any Artwork Worth the Life of Even One Human Being? If given Any Honest Contemplation the Unsettling Answer has to be Yes.That Point is Driven Home more than once in this Film and the Fact is that the US Government and the Soldiers on the Ground Ultimately Agreed. The Shortcoming of the Movie is its Almost Wasted All-Star Cast. None of Whom has much to Say or Do.If John Goodman gets any Fatter He will be, if not Already, Unwatchable On Screen, and as Bill Murray gets Older He has Lost that Seductive Smirk. The rest of the Actors Deliver what Seems to be a Professional Courtesy.One way the Movie could have been a bit Better, More Screen Time with the Art Itself. Some Long Lingering Shots of the Paintings and Sculptures to Appreciate the Splendor and Significance of the Work. Can Anyone Say that Spending Any Amount of Time with these Masterpieces would be a Waste of Film or Nothing Less than Exhilarating and Educational for the Viewers.Overall this is an Underrated and Misunderstood Movie that is Low-Key but Smooth and is Not High Entertainment or High Art for that Matter but it is Certainly Worth a Watch.Note...This Subject was approached one other time in John Frankenheimer's little remembered but Very Good, The Train (1964).",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Heartfelt Tribute to Art and History,"""The Monuments Men"" (2014), directed by George Clooney, is a compelling historical drama that tells the true story of a group of art historians and curators tasked with recovering stolen art during World War II. With a star-studded cast, including Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, and Cate Blanchett, the film explores themes of cultural preservation and the human spirit amid the chaos of war.The narrative follows Frank Stokes (Clooney) as he assembles a team of unlikely heroes to rescue priceless works of art looted by the Nazis. The film effectively balances moments of tension with lighter, character-driven humor, showcasing the camaraderie and dedication of the Monuments Men as they embark on their mission.Visually, the film captures the period well, immersing viewers in the historical context of the 1940s. The cinematography and production design effectively convey the beauty of the artworks and the devastation of war, underscoring the stakes of their mission.While the performances are solid, with standout moments from Murray and Blanchett, the film occasionally struggles with pacing and depth. Some character arcs feel underdeveloped, which may leave audiences wanting more from their backstories and motivations.In conclusion, ""The Monuments Men"" is a heartfelt tribute to the importance of art and culture in times of conflict. With its engaging premise and strong performances, I would rate it a 7/10. It's a film that honors the legacy of those who fought to save cultural treasures, making it a worthwhile watch for history buffs and art lovers alike.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Awful movie..Expected more from cast,"This was the worst movie I have seen this year. Although the cast are fabulous actors, it was a waste of great talent.The idea behind the story was interesting, but the movie itself was boring! My wife was about to fall asleep.The attendance was about 20 people for an evening showing on opening night. Wait for the DVD release as this movie would have better as a premium channel showing.There was no action or real drama contained in the movie.

great story not particularly well done,"Someone who read this book described it as riveting. This is not a term I would use for 2014's Monuments Men, despite a wonderful cast that included George Clooney, Matt Damon, John Goodman, Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville, and finally, George's father, Nick Clooney.The story concerns the real-life Monuments Men, who are assigned the job of saving as much art from the Nazis as possible. The Nazis, as has been highly publicized, stole art belonging to Jews, and pilfered valuable art, sculptures, and church icons from churches and museums.The suspense and excitement come in bits and pieces. There are some stunning scenes as the soldiers go into mines and discover huge numbers of treasures. There are also some moving scenes, particularly concerning the character of Donald (Bonneville).We really don't find out too much about the soldiers, but the script has a lot of humor and repartee in it, making it like the Oceans Eleven films Clooney stars in with Damon and others. A little of it is fine and even necessary, but there isn't enough pathos to offset it.The best scene for me took place in the home of the dentist's son.In reality, 350 soldiers made up the Monuments Men. It's only seven here.This is one of those films about a fascinating, important, and interesting subject that makes one want to learn more about it. Unfortunately, despite some good scenes, Monuments Men isn't good enough to convey the layers of this amazing story.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A lack of everything..,"Uneven, unfunny, plainly dull, poorly acted, lacking any recognisable narrative structure, completely devoid of discernible artistic/directorial style and just a big waste of everyone's time.Oh the irony that the film tells the story of saving works of art! but I'd suggest they'd have needed an act of god to save this piece of rubbish.There was nothing at all to redeem this nonsensical flick and I'm sure GP's would soon be prescribing as a cure for insomnia if the effects weren't so severe as to actually risk educing a coma.Give it a wide-birth or give it a watch the night before something important, you'll thank yourself.",4.0,Anonymous,History

No. Will it leave you with a smile on your face and a sense of satisfaction. Most definitely.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Monuments MenThe reason the Nazis stole art was so that the Führer could replace the artist's name with his own.Thankfully, the soldiers in this war movie are here to prevent Hitler's Mona Lisa from happening.Near the end of the war, Frank Stokes (George Clooney) convinces the US President that Europe's fine art needs to be reclaimed from the clutches of Nazis looters.Compiling a team of museum curators and art historians (Matt Damon, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville), he disperses teams in search of the relics.But a Nazis colonel is ensuring that no one country can claim ownership.Loosely based on real events, director George Clooney takes great liberties with the source material. Meanwhile the characters are drastically underdeveloped and the narrative is uneven.Besides, if you want a war souvenir, do like the Americans and bring home the skulls of Japanese soldiers.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,History
The NGC documentary was better.,"This movie is based on a really interesting story, but the movie itself is dull and tepid. If Clooney wanted to inspire audiences with the monuments men's heroic acts and passion for the work they were saving, he failed. The actors are generally half-hearted and the movie is completely devoid of momentum and suspense. The story unfolds like the dramatization of a textbook, with few exceptions (the scene with the Christmas carol, and the letter/operation to rescue the Bruges Madonna were pretty good). Why? In part because the script is too full of dry little quips, yet this movie is not actually funny enough to be a comedy. . Clooney tells the monuments men's story like a guy relating an epically bad backpacking trip to his bro-friend at a bar. Comedic relief is only successful if there is something dramatic enough to relieve us from (the landmine scene? seriously?).Another problem is the characters. These historical figures are absolutely fascinating and are part of what makes this story so compelling, yet in the script they aren't nearly as fleshed out or interesting as they could be. Clooney's depiction of Claire, for example is insulting. She was they key to the entire operation, but instead of depicting her strength he reduces an enigmatic woman into a desperate love interest - as though it is cinematically impossible to have a female character in a movie without using her for romantic tension. FAIL.The documentary I watched prior to seeing this film got me really excited for the movie because as an art lover, I'm eager to see a mainstream film that gets people excited about art. Instead, I'm left feeling almost betrayed.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Enjoyable Caper Movie in the Tradition of ""The Great Escape""","George Clooney's retelling of an audacious plot by a group of aging art specialists to rescue stolen art from Nazi-occupied Europe is highly entertaining, so long as viewers don't take it too seriously. With its jaunty theme music (by Alexandre Desplat), devil-may-care theme and tongue-in-cheek humor, it is a movie with its roots in classic World War II dramas such as John Sturges' THE GREAT ESCAPE (1963). Structurally speaking, THE MONUMENTS MEN is very similar - a group of representatives of assorted nations take on the full might of the Nazi army (as well as some obstructive American and British officers) and manage to achieve their goals through a combination of cunning, luck and sheer brazenness. THE MONUMENTS MEN is a little propagandist in tone; there is little need, for instance, for a shot at the end of the film showing the American flag, a ""present"" left for the advancing Russian army once the monuments men have rescued some stolen treasure. Nonetheless the film's theme is highly pertinent in view of the destruction wrought to many irreplaceable art treasures in Iraq and Syria in recent years: one hopes that similar groups will be formed so as to save some of them. The actors enjoy themselves in their roles, notably Matt Damon as James Granger, an American officer speaking incomprehensible French, and Bob Balaban and Bill Murray as a pair of perpetually warring art specialists., Cate Blanchett turns in an agreeable cameo as French spy - with a convincing accent. Definitely watchable, so long as audiences don't take the subject-matter too seriously.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Monuments Men Review,"Back behind the camera, American actor and ladies lover, G.Clooney, directs the unbelievable story of WWII platoon tasked to rescue art masterpieces from Nazi thieves and return them to their owners.It must have been hard to find a new angle, a new point of view in order to display an original and mostly unknown exciting story. It could appeared as a legacy of Frankenheimer film's The Train (1964) but it was at that time still more focused on the French Resistance. It seems to me that Monuments Men is in the same genre as famous films such as The Dirty Dozen, Kelly's Heroes, Von Ryan's Express, The Longest Day, A Bridge too Far or even The Great Escape. All those masterpieces were epic films gathering a bunch of famous Cinema figures with suspense and humour. The Ocean's saga directed by Soderbergh works quite on the same concept. Monuments Men is highlighting a part of the WWII history. However its most important strength is that this films is not an Historical/Arts lesson or a boring documentary on the period and people. It finds the appropriate ton and pace right from the beginning. A sort of comic and non- solemnly ton. Plus, each one of the characters, apart from the team is interesting. They have their own identity. This film is build around more than Arts and War, it's build around character's back stories and how each one of them affected and helped the film to grow. Finally the question behind it is: Can you risk your life for a piece of Art? The film answer is clearly YES! Personally, I don't think that I will find myself running into a house on fire in order to save a painting someday. (A family member...yes... or my dog.) Monuments men is peculiar of Clooney's way of directing, Capra's idealist heir, who systematically search hope and redemption in Human nature.Overall this film is engaging, entertaining and sentimental.",6.0,Anonymous,History
liked it enough,"Monuments Men is the kind of movie you remember a bit, then forget, but could have been better. Cate Blanchet was great as a French loyalist art curator. She meets Matt Damon, not a very believable role as an art expert. George Clooney leads the gang of old fart art guys brought into the WW2 to save art being stolen by the Nazis.The director played up the cuteness of these guys, while trying to instill some seriousness, like getting shot at, or even death. There was a little tension built up at the end, but don't expect much of that. The guys like Goodman and Murray played well. You end up respecting how much the real monument men really did to save the world's art treasures.I was thinking 6, or 7 out of 10. But I think because of Blanchet, and some strong bit acting by German characters, it is a film that you would like despite some miscasting, and not enough time spent on the talents of Goodman and Murray.

Superficial and predictable,"I went to a pre-release fund raiser screening not knowing anything about this film or it's topic. I was disappointed to say least of the superficial, uneven nature of how such a historically important topic (which I don't believe a lot of people actually know about), which I don't believe has been documented on film prior to this, was handled.There was a lack of depth in the narrative as we were taken in a particular direction only to have that suddenly interrupted to be taken off in another and not returning to original in a lot of cases. Most frustrating for viewers like myself, keen to know more about this topic. The tongue in cheek humour was the deal breaker for me - it was as if trying to appeal to the masses and win them over and like the film further taking us away from any depth or exploration of this dark time in history and and depth of the topic. It seemed like a pointed insult to the real life people working under such perilous circumstances, but you wouldn't have known that only for the fact the WWII and Nazi's were mentioned.Film can be a powerful medium in reminding the world of the true horrors of war, in particular the kind inflicted by the Nazi's. I think it's important to do this. This film has a great ensemble of actors but simply misses on a lot of levels in doing the above and it's silly humour only makes it a trite futile exercise. Simply indulgent - a gluttonous waste of talent and time.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Fails to do justice to its story,"There's something almost refreshingly old-fashioned about ""The Monuments Men,"" one of those Very Important Pictures that Hollywood used to produce with such abundance in its heyday. It's one of those World War II pictures in which a motley group of strangers is recruited by the United States Army to carry out a mission behind enemy lines. Dubbed the Monuments Men, this group of art experts was assigned the task of rescuing some of the world's greatest art masterpieces from the grasping hands of the Nazis who were busily absconding with the works with the intention of displaying them in a museum of their own after the war.Lt. Frank Stokes, who spearheaded the mission, is portrayed by George Clooney, while the men he recruits are played by Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bib Balaban, Dimitri Leonidas and Hugh Bonneville (""Downton Abbey""). Cate Blanchett co-stars as a curator who is also a Resistance fighter working for the French Underground, and who is initially suspicious of the Monuments Men's motives for rounding up the treasures.The movie is interesting enough as an unusual slice of history, I suppose, but the screenplay by Clooney and Grant Heslov, based on the book by Robert M. Edsel, never finds a way to make this true life tale come alive as drama. The characters are dull and under-developed, and, as a consequence, we find ourselves strangely uninterested in their back stories and unmoved by their fates. There is also way too much emphasis placed on the comical and the sentimental, and the movie comes replete with a gratingly frivolous score that seems woefully inappropriate to the subject at hand.Despite the all-star cast, the movie is weighed down by over-earnest acting, with Murray and Balaban seemingly on hand mainly for the comic relief they provide.Clooney has directed the film with hollow competence, and there's some discussion about whether or not lives should be risked for the sake of inanimate objects, no matter how valuable, but it's hard to make anything particularly memorable out of a story where the artwork has more personality than the players.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"A double edged sword, serious with a lighthearted side","18 February 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - The Monuments Men. Another George Clooney film, not only starring but directed and written by him. An unlikely band of men are brought together to form a platoon charged with the rescuing of art stolen by the Nazis. Not just famous and historical works of art from galleries and public buildings but all art, whomever may be the artist and whatever the subject, which belonged to ordinary people. This film although lighthearted in many parts serves well as a grim reminder of many things that went on during the war, no scene depicts this better than finding the barrels of wedding rings and gold fillings (it's OK I'm not giving anything away, that scene is in the trailer). It not only highlights the effort made by large groups of people but also the individual acts of bravery and courage that occurred through one of the darkest periods of modern history. People stuck their necks out knowing full well that they could lose their head as a result, yet did it time and time again. An interesting group of people came together to form this platoon, from George Clooney, Matt Damon and Bill Murray to Hugh Bonneville and Jon Goodman, to name a few. A more unlikely group of heroes you could hardly think of, yet this team worked and this film worked. I'd like to watch it again. It's worth staying through the beginning of the credits as there are a number of real wartime photos depicting the art being found, this brings home the fact it's a true story.",,Anonymous,History
Could Have and Should Have Been A Great Movie...But...,"This story has the potential to be a ""Great Movie"" telling the true story of the Allies efforts to recover and secure Europe's artistic treasure's. The story itself is intriguing and all that was really required was the establishment of the central character's with a bit of care and detail. This was not accomplished by Clooney's directorial leadership in the telling of this story. I suppose I should say that as an actor George Clooney is a current ""standout"" within the acting community. As a Director, George Clooney is a novice whose work lacked rhythm, pace and direction. As stated, this should have been a truly great movie based on the material that was available to the producer and the director in that it is taken from actual WWII experiences of real people during the most compelling period in modern history. This was a time in which average men and women became larger than life heroes with stories that are just waiting to be told... competently and with care.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Outshining The History,"The Monuments Men depicts one of those parts of history that sounds like some sort of a mission impossible, it's about a group of volunteers who came out to find and protect European artifacts that were taken by the Nazis during World War II. It's not much of a popular story, but it's pretty interesting. The film follows some roots from the inspired team chemistry of Oceans Eleven to the wondrous tone of Indiana Jones. While those added flavors are charming and all, the risks of the mission is unfortunately not taken seriously, which leads to something less remarkable than it should have been. However, the great cast keeps it a lot entertaining even if there is still a better meat within this story.Although it's a historical war movie, the film takes a lighter tone. There are still violence and terror happening on screen, but they are only taken as breezy bits of tension. It's disappointing because those are likely the only parts when the mission feels like it's going somewhere. Anything else are either speeches about how important the arts that they're supposed to save or a long conversation waiting to engage a random punchline. These things are not particularly bad, but the portrayal of whatever the actual people were going through still deserves a serious consideration. So now we're just watching a feel-good comedy taken place on a classical environment.Everything looks magnificent at least. Clooney as a director seems to love bringing the seventies/eighties bright tone with marvelously rich production to give lots of life to the exteriors. It instantly makes everything looks like a good fun old fashioned adventure film. Even the music score also has a sense of nostalgia. But the real deal around is the cast. George Clooney and Matt Damon are obviously the stars here, while they did what they do best, it was the supporting who gave more color to this inert gloss. Cate Blanchett gives a charming personality to her character. The presence of Bill Murray could make anyone smile for, sometimes, no reason. And there is quite a joy to be found in the scenes of Bob Balaban and Jean Dujardin.It's difficult to call The Monuments Men a bad film, it's also troubling to call it a good one either. There is an obvious heart to notice within the surfaces, the stars are awfully charismatic and they seem to be having fun doing their classic thing. I could say it's an absolutely charming film, but the story behind this seems to be more interesting than the merits. I guess this is only recommendable to the ones who seek for easy entertainment because the true tensions of World War II are hardly welcome here.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Surprising to see the paintings stolen that they recovered. And Now I can enjoy seeing them..never realising what they came thru.I have a feeling that something went wont with the filming. Sad the story deserved better. A huge misser for clooney.And people saying whats the use...this story is still relevant. Remember Al Qaeda destroying the statues in Afghanistan.

"Paused and calculated, The Monuments Men lacks a little soul","For the most part, this film is clear on what it wants to present and with the talent involved, you would think the result would be splendid. While the movie isn't terrible, it has few redeeming qualities which is a shame, since I had high hopes for it. The plot sees a group of men, spearheaded by Clooney's character, who are looking to preserve the works of art that are being threatened by Hitler's path of destruction. In a movie like this I would think there would be a linear story and strong personalities in the characters. Instead we get boring mumbling about some other stuff, with the objective of the mission being neglected at times. Being a history buff I hate to side with those who claim it to be a waste of time, but with this case I have to agree. While I did enjoy some of the guys having fun doing this movie (e.g. Bill Murray), this isn't enough to make the movie great. I believe Clooney can do more in the directing and writing department, and I hope his next project is more thought out. In the meantime, I must say that The Monuments Men failed to impress me.Rating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History

There is no plot, no action, no character development, no meaningful dialog, no pace, no progression, nothing whatsoever of any interest or significance. The cast all perform as if they would rather be elsewhere, much as I felt immediately after the opening credits. It's impossible to believe that anyone involved with this mess did not realize that they were creating a debacle of epic proportions.

Not worth in order to peek,"Three fair scenes. Such as the shooting at church door and the dental action. There is also the shooting at the forest edge. Flat characters. Topography class.

Quote Wikipedia: ""On 27 June 1944 the Gestapo took the tapestry to the Louvre and on 18 August, three days before the Wehrmacht withdrew from Paris, Himmler sent a message (intercepted by Bletchley Park) ordering it to be taken to ""a place of safety"", thought to be Berlin.[15] It was only on 22 August that the SS attempted to take possession of the tapestry by which time the Louvre was again in French hands.""

History lesson,"I wanted to see this for the actors in the movie. So many good performers in a film based on truth. I especially liked Cate Blanchett's performance as the woman who eventually gave the soldiers the information they needed. She portrayed a hesitant woman in a dangerous time - she knew her life was in danger if found out and was careful about saying anything. The unlikely group, with little military knowledge were at times comical but always believable. The mission they were given was so important for the art world and the individuals the art was stolen from. If it weren't for these men we would not be able to enjoy the Madonna and Child by Michelangelo, the many paintings in the Lourve and families would not have been reunited with their paintings. At times the movie seemed a little slow, but the acting is well done and the history lesson is important for all.

"Good performances, brittle script","A couple of years ago, 2 Academy Award winners George Clooney and Grant Heslov became interested in a true story about an allied group, the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, tasked with finding and saving cultural works and items before their destruction by Nazis during World War II, and set to write and produce a movie. Due to their fame and connections, they manage to include almost a dozen of internationally known middle-aged actors and the budget of around 70 million USD...Sounds like a guaranteed way to a blockbuster? Well, the profit has been twice of the budget amount, but most of viewers and reviewers have been critical; and I can understand why. Even great actors like Clooney himself, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, etc. were unable to improve the hectic script, consisting of different places in Europe at the same time - as they spent too little time on screen and their characters were not elaborated. Funny dialogs were pertinent only at times, they were mostly meant to make dull search for creations more ""interesting"" and smooth... Human connections/relations remained incomplete, and the movie is, in fact, a chronological and arid presentation of events not commonly known from WW II.Luckily, this 2-hour-movie does not become dull or annoying, but it is still a good example that important awards' winners and nominees do not automatically ensure a catchy and influential story.

"""Art for art's sake"" in this mild war film about a crack unit of artists.","Around this St Valentine's Day is the usual slew of romance-based films, but also rather surprisingly, a bunch of war-films too. This film caught my interest, seeming to deliver a nice balance in entertainment, without making the subject-matter too heavy, and so it turned out.Film is by 20th Century Fox and Columbia. It stars George Clooney, who also directed and produced it, as well as wrote the screenplay. Thus this is very much George Clooney's baby. Last year he merely played second fiddle to Sandra Bullock in the critically acclaimed 'Gravity'. If that film showcased Miss Bullock, then this one does the same, in spades, for Mr Clooney. Like 'The Descendants' of two years previously, once again we have a film that captures a mix of emotions.This is a war film so it tends to follow a well trod format. Like, for example, 'The Dirty Dozen' (1967), it starts with a military objective being set out. Then the unit is recruited and trained, before finally going into action. However apart from this being set in WWII, just as was 'TDD', in most other aspects this film is very different.Firstly, it is important to state, as the film itself does, that this film is based on a true story. George Clooney plays the part of an artistic type, who knowing the threat to the art world posed by the war, is tasked to assemble a group of educated and like-minded individuals, to go and protect and rescue art-works threatened with destruction or theft.Film opens with the art-saving scenario and quickly moves on to the recruitment and basic-training of the unit. Before much time has elapsed the unit has been sent across the Channel to France where war is raging. Like 'TDD', this film too, has an all-star cast. Matt Damon rightly deserves his second billing with his very entertaining character. He is required to speak French, and I could not get enough of this. His French is subtitled, so that we can enjoy the full richness of his dialogue. So do mind the French.The French joie de vivre, is displayed perfectly by Cate Blanchett. The scenes between Miss Blanchett and Mr Damon, seem to capture perfectly the essence of the time. Mr Clooney seems to capture this well too in a Christmas scene. This one, like others in the film, captures the good and the bad. In war there is laughter as well as tears, joy and sadness. The fact of the very fragility of life, in war, is shown in the mix of emotions. Everything is intensified, from comradeship to mafioso horse.In style then, this film, if anything, is shot in the same style as 'The Great Escape' (1963). That film too was based on a true story. Like this one, it was populated with interesting characters, had funny scenes, and sad scenes. So yes, like 'TGE', 'TMM' is a sort of boys own adventure story, a romp, and a ripping good yarn. However it is still a war story, and several scenes have been inserted that reflect the worst of times that were WWII. So, be prepared to be entertained, but be prepared also for a lump in the throat, and the tears to well up too.Before WWII, Winston Churchill warned of the rise of the Nazis, and when the war had started, he was rightly the man needed to step into the breach. He viewed the struggle as one between Civilisation and a new Dark Age. As the Huns, Goths, and Vandals, destroyed The Roman Empire, so too the art-destroying, book-burning, Hunnish Nazis, even as they retreated, as they faced defeat, seemed determined to plunge Europe into a new Dark Age. This film shines a light on a story, that helped prevent the darkness descending, and helped us to emerge, (one scene in particular very explicitly shows this in a metaphorical way), emerge from the darkness, and into the light.For many years, 'The Great Escape', was traditional Christmas fayre (at least for the British anyway). Now Mr Clooney has made a modern film that can compete with that one. Like that one, this film is populated by ordinary people, trying to do extraordinary things. The film captures well the breadth of the war; unlike some Hollywood productions that show only the Americans winning the war, this film seems to make an effort to show accurately the Allied effort. So we encounter Limeys as well as Yanks on the Western Front. The French Resistance is also mentioned. The Eastern Front is not entirely neglected, so watch out for the Russkies too, they were players too, in this story too!As said, this film, in tone, is very much like 'The Great Escape'. So enjoy it, and cheer along, as our heroes battle against the evil Nazis. Film is a romp suitable for nearly all of the family except those whose more delicate dispositions are easily upset.Based on a true story, this is an entertaining, good, and uplifting, film. A war story with some comedic moments, and some sad ones too. 10/10.C'mon the artists!",,Anonymous,History
Great deal of fun,"The Monuments Men is what we call an ensemble cast film where you get as many prolific actors you can pull in and then build the movie around their acting capabilities. And usually the end result is at least halfway decent, just because it's so much fun to see these people working together. Likewise here. Pretty much all of the actors are A-list and it shows. From George Clooney and Matt Damon to Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett and John Goodman, they all shine and have great conversations and scenes together.Not to say that it isn't otherwise a good movie. The setting is very intriguing, being based on a real life World War II unit of the same name, which mission was to find and protect the pieces of history, art and culture the Nazis had stolen or were trying to steal. The film feels passionately about the importance of art as a basis of culture and as a proof we have existed. Yet it's one thing to claim that art is important and quite another to ask good men and women to potentially sacrifice their lives for it. And the movie doesn't shy away from that problem. It makes its point and allows you to draw your own conclusions.As for the technical side of things, some people have claimed that the film feels a touch boring and scrambled because we follow so many small groups simultaneously, without ever really focusing on one. And I can see their point. It requires you to pay attention, to remember what is going on with each group and to not mind the pauses in the story lines. I personally didn't have problems with the storytelling and I found the whole experience a great deal of fun. It takes place in war times and acknowledges the human horror going on, but at its heart it's a treasure hunt and thus feels warmhearted and charming.If you're looking for a bit lighter war movie with great actors, excellent setup and beautiful production values, look no further.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Raiders of the Lost Art,"Though it's painfully thin, poorly structured and full of clichés, George Clooney's 'The Monuments Men' is a fun movie that shines a light, however dim, on a mostly forgotten or ignored part of World War II.Taking its cues from films like 'The Dirty Dozen', 'The Monuments Men' struggles to keep a balance between its lighthearted tone and the very serious events it portrays. It's a tricky thing to do, and it's not always successful. But thanks to its talented cast, jaunty manner and gorgeous production values, 'The Monuments Men' manages to overcome its flaws and deliver a fairly entertaining--if ultimately inconsequential--film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Hollywood needs more movies about heroes,"The Monuments Men is a 2014 American-German film directed by George Clooney, written and produced by Clooney and Grant Heslov, and starring Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville, and Cate Blanchett. Based on the non-fiction book, a 500 or so page tome entitled The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History by Robert M. Edsel, the film relates the true story of a motley group of aging art experts tasked with finding and saving pieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by Hitler and the Nazis during the waning days of World War II.Originally scheduled to be released in December of 2013, the film appeared on American screens in early February 2014 several weeks before the Oscars were handed out for excellence in Hollywood movie making for the preceding year. The selection of films and performances presented for consideration from 2013 had few heroes. We had stories about a bunch of Somali pirates, a corrupt Wall Street swindler, a dysfunctional family in Oklahoma, a Texas hustler who profited from importing AIDS medications, another sad tale of slavery, and a spinster trying to sell her tales to Walt Disney.George Clooney is to be praised for bringing the story of a few aging ""art warriors"" to the big screen. The Monuments Men tried to preserve Europe's cultural history by volunteering to find about five million pieces of artwork stolen by the Nazis from wealthy Jews, museums, universities and churches before they were destroyed. It's a heroic adventure, the largest treasure hunt ever conceived. And a true story about some of the men and women from 13 countries who gave their time, talent, and effort for this worthwhile cause. Over 6,500 paintings were found at the salt mines in Altaussee, Austria. Gold bullion and 400 paintings from Berlin vaults were found in the copper mines in Merkers, Germany. Entire valuable private collections of wealthy Frenchmen were found at Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany. Important works such as the ""Madonna of Bruges"" by Michelangelo and Van Eyck's medieval Ghent altarpiece were salvaged.Interestingly, The Monuments Men is not a war movie: it's Saving Mr. Rembrandt not Saving Private Ryan. And it's not really a humor-in-the-time-of-war film like Mash nor a comedic-drama like Oceans Eleven although Clooney plays a Harvard art restorer who gathers his ""buds"" for the adventure and some fun. It's a profound bit of historical and biographical drama. And it's about heroes.Hollywood needs more movies about heroes.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Like watching very expensive paint dry.,"I must not forget to trust the February dumping ground. Be warned, The Monuments Men is a film to be endured, not enjoyed. I remember about a year ago we all thought this was a surefire frontrunner at the Oscars to head American Hustle and The Wolf of Wall Street. While the other two secured nominations but probably not awards, I'm glad this one didn't make the cut. Who could blame us? George Clooney was on top of the world having just one an Oscar and he's got two more spots on his mantle to fill, maybe another for Screenplay. Unfortunately his writing talents just don't cut the mustard. It's a total mess. It can't juggle its characters, but it doesn't give them anything to play with. It spends its time trying to justify itself, repeating monologues about why art is important to mankind that we heard in the trailers and they kinda work. They're the only engaging part of the movie really, saying why they did what did. It's just that how they did what they did isn't the least bit interesting. Once the characters are inexplicably on a dangerous path without much objection they face aimless inconsequential obstacles that don't really develop character or display their resourcefulness.Every moment just feels terribly contrived. Forced scenes of conflict resolution such as Bill Murray smoking with a man until he leaves or Jean Dujardin finding that a sniper is a child. It feels like such an afterthought. I feel bad for the great talent in the cast because they mostly just irritated me every time they opened their mouths. Cate Blanchett does make the most of her character which is good to see considering she had the one at biggest risk of being ridiculous. If the film isn't dragging (I went to the bathroom when I didn't even have to go and I never usually leave a screening unless it's an emergency) then it's pure sentimental saccharine out of nowhere just to try and pull a reaction from the audience. I hoped the film could get by on charm, but its mean-spirited sense of humour just left a sour taste in my mouth. Although the production design is commendable, given its theme of art, it's disappointing to say that the cinematography is incredibly unimaginative. I hope one day Clooney can deliver something with the integrity of Good Night, and Good Luck. It's not terribly incompetent, it's just misguided and lifeless. At the end, the film asks ""was it worth it?"" Was The Monuments Men worth the price of admission? God no.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,History

"Interesting and original idea, poorly developed and executed","1944. With the tide of WW2 turning against Germany, the Allies set up a team to find and retrieve hordes of priceless art, stolen by the Germans during their occupation of Europe. Due to the fear that the Germans will destroy the artworks, the team need to be as close to the frontlines as possible, putting them in great danger.An interesting and novel concept, as the search and recovery of the artwork the Nazis stole actually happened, and was a tremendous feat, yet the story is hardly known nor told. So the movie had the potential to show the search in a gritty and edifying manner.Unfortunately, in going from concept to script, The Monuments Men goes from good to mediocre and just gets worse when filmed. Written by George Clooney and Grant Hersov and directed by Clooney, the finished product is sloppily written and amateurishly directed. Cheesy, sanctimonious and not historically or militarily correct, the movie starts badly and never recovers.Instead of being an edifying drama, Clooney tries to throw in humour, lowering the tone, and then the humour is very weak and unoriginal. Even the comedy skills of Bill Murray and John Goodman aren't a match for a poor script.It feels like an Oceans movie: assemble heaps of friends and other big-name stars, give them back-slapping dialogue and make it feel like one huge in-joke.",4.0,Anonymous,History

"Great story, but too slow","At 118 minutes this could have, and should have, been pared down to 90 minutes. The editing was not the best in that there were too many spots where the story seemed to be mired in melancholy over itself. We get it - Great art was stolen and it is the foundation of modern society! I understand that the men charged with retrieving the priceless works were not full-on soldiers, but I am sure there was more drama that could have been explored instead of making an attempt at a ""statement piece."" I appreciate the story for its historical worthiness, but it was too slow and had far too many dead spots in it. If the goal was to make the story last the entire 118 minutes, then why not work more on the epilogue? 20 minutes of a recap on where a piece of art was rescued from and where it lives today would have been extremely informative and added more of a connection to the history of these events. Seeing artwork in a museum and understanding the rescue from destruction that took place in order for us to see it is something that makes the events more tangible and real for those who can only read about these events.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Notable story but with a boring pace,"Great idea, great cast, a thrilling real-life story behind it all but The Monuments Men isn't more than this. This was the kind of film that, six months ago, you wouldn't have looked foolish staking on it as an Oscar winner. So where'd it all go wrong? It sticks to the facts perfectly but it bores as we spend too much time watching Stokes put his team together and that's too long. Cast is simply impressive but it's not enough to make a really good story out of it, because actors don't match one another that much, with Goodman and Dujardin being a funny double act and with Matt Damon's terrible French.

Sophomoric and Didactic,"Pretty sure that this film was made only because George Clooney commands respect in Hollywood. If the script had been forced to undergo the usual review process, it would have been swiftly rejected for its juvenile dialogue, its transparent and unnecessary preachiness (who thinks the Nazis were good and should not have stolen people´s possessions?), its lame attempts at humor, and its derogatory depiction (dare I say ¨sexist¨?) of the woman apparently responsible for the recovery of thousands of artworks which would otherwise have been lost forever.For aspiring screenwriters and directors, The Monuments Men serves as a cautionary tale: do not presume that because you do one thing well, you are a master at everything else. Screenwriting and film direction are difficult, complex crafts best left to professionals, not actors flying by the seat of their pants. Yes, with work and diligence you can become a professional film maker, but producing an excellent film takes much more than having friends in high places, or even knowing a group of actors willing to star in your vanity project to earn some quick cash.",5.0,Anonymous,History
the price of the life of a soldier,"The story in 'The Monuments Men' directed by George Clooney and released on screens in 2014 is worth telling. In the last year of World War II, a small group of Allied soldiers, most of them experts in the arts, were given the task of discovering the fate of the art treasures plundered by Nazi Germany in the countries under its control and saving as much as possible from destruction by the defeated Germans or from falling into the hands of the Russians as 'war booty'. The not so well-known story is based on real facts. A book has been written about it, documentaries or television series were or may have been made. 'The Monuments Men', the fiction movie - as it came out - fails to make a good service to the story, despite investing a considerable amount of talent, especially in acting. By trying to make a film like and in the style of the war films of the '60s, George Clooney almost completely misses the target due to the lack of a common narrative thread interesting enough to capture attention. In the 2010s, the collection of celebrity stars is no longer enough for public success or emotional impact.Frank Stokes (George Clooney), the art expert who manages to persuade President Roosevelt to form a team of soldiers - less than half a platoon - to save Europe's cultural treasures at war from destruction in the situation of answering, several times in this film, the question 'is it worth sacrificing the life of a soldier to save a painting, a statue, or the tower of a medieval church?' The problem is that the question and the answers are formulated through explicit spoken words rather than through convincing cinematic narration. The formation of the group of experts, most of them well past the age of carrying weapons, the training, the landing after the landing in Normandy, and their adventures in Europe in ruins still in the middle of a destructive war are approached in Hollywood style, with a dose of humor that cannot harm, but also with the schematism specific to film productions in the decades after the war, especially when it comes to negative characters (specifically the German officers). The film flows smoothly and pleasantly, the dialogues are nice and intelligent, but the lack of dramatic tension reduces the impact of the film. 'The Monuments Men' contains too much fiction for a docudrama and is too unassuming to be a memorable war film.The cinematography is good and generously provides us with images of the continent in ruins in the final year of World War II, as well as short snapshots of famous works of art that are reconstructed and filmed with authenticity. The list of actors with famous names is impressive. Of all, only Cate Blanchett has enough material that allows her to create a substantial role. It is of course a pleasure to see Bill Murray, Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin and George Clooney himself at any time, but as a viewer I can only regret that their roles in this film are too schematic to allow me to remember their acting here as I have done so many other times. 'The Monuments Men' is a film with an interesting theme and an important message ('culture matters even in the heat of the fiercest battles'), a pleasant film due mainly to the presence of actors that viewers can not get tired of seeing, but the result is less than the sum of talents and efforts put together.",6.0,Anonymous,History

An Oscar grabber that misses the mark,"If there was ever a movie that screamed Oscars, critical fawning and audience love, surely it would be The Monuments Men? You can only imagine the pitch to frothing studio execs, World War 2 – check, adventure – check, an all-star cast lead and directed by George Clooney – check, art – check, hijinks – check. The whole package was there for Monuments Men to be the awards baiting, audience feel good hit of the year but somewhere, somehow the film become a meandering mediocre effort that while enjoyable is less the sum of its very interesting parts.One of the most tonally uneven films you're likely to see this year, Monuments has an awkward and unsubstantial beginning that sadly never eventuates into anything more than a slight care or interest thanks to a haphazard displaying of the events at its disposal. Clooney has over a period of years now showcased himself as a fine director but much like his flop Leatherheads, Monuments shows him at his most vulnerable, a director unsure of how to use his cast and transform his story to screen. What should've been one of this year's most endearing team ups of actors is somehow allowed to grow apart into a rag tag everyman for himself like gang with not enough screen time granted to anyone in particular to make a real mark. Murray and Bob Balaban make the most of their artistry types and Goodman has his moments but even these fine character actors struggle to really come to grips with their players in a story that deserved so much more.Telling an oft forgotten and incredibly interesting side to the World War 2 story in the form of Hitler's fascination with collecting art and in many instances destroying it and the lengths brave men went to to save these parts of human history is a tale well worth the big screen treatment. While Clooney and his team at times convey this sense of purpose it would be wrong to suggest they make the most of it. Clooney seems content in going for easy emotional wrenching scenes (a scene set during Xmas example of this) but does so without really earning it. For a film like this to succeed, audiences need to be fully invested in the plight and the characters, something Monuments just does not draw out of us despite it's easy to like attitude and breezy men on a mission structure.A huge disappointment yet still a movie far better than your average jaunt, The Monuments Men may be perfect for a night in with a movie yet you can't help but shake the feeling this one should have been oh so much more than it is, you can bet your bottom dollar that the studio executives felt the same.

Fake Art,"Problems right off the bat: 1. Certain types of movies, especially docudramas, should not be cast with well known, famous names. Their personalities detract from what were common, everyday down-to- earth people. The actors seemed more like caricatures of themselves. 2. If there was a war going on you would never know it. Seemed more like a tour of famous art collections in Hollywood. 3. The dialogue not only seemed misplaced but had that Hollywood writer speak to it; overeducated, over articulated Beverly Hills cleanliness. 4. Speaking of cleanliness did you seen any dents, scratches on the vehicles let along dust? Even the uniforms had that freshly manicured look. Why is that important? Attention to detail is one indicator of authenticity. 5. Most importantly I couldn't get any emotional attachment to anything including that most important goal of saving works of art.

Highly recommend everybody avoid this tedious and annoying movie.,"Warning: this movie is very poorly written, very poorly directed and very poorly edited. It's feeble attempt at mixing comedy with what was a truly tragic situation is done in an ineffective way rendering it inappropriate. Whereas humor can be used effectively to make specific poignant points relating to the tragedy of war, i.e.: ""Good Morning Vietnam"", the attempt made in ""Monuments Men"" was not effective and was technically flawed. I highly recommend that everybody avoid this tedious and annoying movie. I see that George Clooney co-wrote and directed this farce. He should stick with acting in the future and leave the writing and directing to those who know how. The dialog was contrived. The flow of action was erratic. The character development was absent.

I Was Expecting Better,"""The Monuments Men"" has a very solid cast. You see George Clooney, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, John Goodman and Bill Murray and you're expecting something special. And the story seemed as if it should lend itself to something special. It's based on the true story of an Allied team put together during World War II whose mission is to locate and recover art treasures stolen by the Nazis. It was a significant mission - to save the cultural heritage of Europe. Between the cast and the story you expect something better. By the time it's over, you find yourself thinking that you were expecting something better. In the end, ""The Monuments Men"" disappoints.Clooney was Stokes, who convinced President Roosevelt to form the team, and Damon is Granger, who in many ways the movie revolves around. Both were fine. But, in the end, the movie just wasn't very interesting. It sputtered along. At times there were attempts at humour, and there were even sombre moments with reflections on the Holocaust scattered throughout. The most powerful scene for me revolved not around the discovery of stolen art, but rather of a barrel full of gold fillings. There's also a portrayal of early American-Soviet rivalry. Both want to find the art, but both have different plans for it. The Americans want to return it to its rightful owners, while the Soviets plan to keep it.There was enough material to work with to have made a pretty good and exciting movie. But somehow, ""The Monuments Men"" missed the mark, and turned out to be disappointing more than anything. (5/10)",5.0,Anonymous,History
disappointing!,"It is a bummer when 20th Century Fox rescheduled Clooney's fifth director endeavor THE MONUMENTS MEN into a lukewarm February release, bodes ill for its craftsmanship which may not up to Oscar's caliber. But gaging from its stellar cast, a more probable upshot could be a fun-loving teamwork like OCEAN 11-13 fanfare, yet, it does't even achieve this lesser goal.The film is hit or miss in coagulate its plain script with an aimlessly disorganized narrative, even during its climax it feels lagging and insipid. Obviously the execution is at a loss to define the picture's overall temperament, a war drama, or a lightweight comedy, or an ensemble piece of entertainment, it seems that Clooney wants to blend them altogether, but it boomerangs badly, it eventuates to be an ungainly nondescript, only if art cognoscenti can generate some faint buzz over the looted art treasures and groan what a trespass conducted by the execrable Nazis.In the mid-1940s, a USA task force constituted by art experts and led by Clooney enters behind the enemy line to aim to retrieve millions of pillaged art pieces from the retreating German troops as many as possible, some of which are historic and significant. Yet, the story unfolds heedlessly, and even it is near the end of WWII, casualties are still indispensable, lives can be dispatched all in a sudden, but overall one tends not to care too much since the brains behind the film don't allow anyone to invest a deluge of emotional turbulence in it as a consequence of its wooden presentation of the historical matter and whimsically evasive editing choices.Nothing too much can be commented on the cast although Blanchett can be perpetually singled out in any films she is in, among the Monuments Men, Murray and Balaban are borderline enjoyable, Goodman, Dujardin and Bonneville are half-heartedly dutiful, Damon and Clooney are just playing house in the war zone.It is an 118-minute paean to the importance of preserving art, we get it, just a reminder, stopping bombarding is a nice precaution to this purpose, take that, all the radical militarists!",4.0,Anonymous,History

It has all the right pieces, and is a serviceable piece of drama; but is a tad underwhelming (not in a bad way).In spite of that, this is very much up Clooney's alley as a filmmaker, and has him not just reuniting with Damon and Blanchett ('The good German'), but also bring along the reclusive Bill Murray, the Coens' Special John Goodman, and the extremely under-used Bob Balaban for the ride, along with Jean Dujardin (given short shrift here) and Hugh Bonneville.Clooney is not going for WWII epic (Damon should have some déjà vu watching the Normandy sequence, though we're never shown him land either in 'Saving..' or in this one) evidenced by his setting the tone multiple times during the flick, with no grandstanding or bravado diverting the mission-at-hand, though the clunky voice- over by his character feels shoehorned, and we could have done without it.Do I wish it had been more rousing, as more critics seemed to be expecting. Actually, no. Low-key is Clooney's style, and he's picked that up from Soderbergh, Corbjin and the like; and is his strength. There have been too many movies that go the epic route, and this is a welcome pace even for the genre itself, so that it doesn't feel tired and wear itself out (IMHO).All in all, a good time at the movies, but only for those who synchronize their expectations accordingly. And yes, on the big screen - the production design merits that.",,Anonymous,History

"Perhaps it's not quite monumental, but it's certainly far better than you might have been led to believe.","Everyone was expecting great things from The Monuments Men. Practically every member of its astounding cast could carry his or her own film, and George Clooney has gained a reputation in recent years for crafting solid, intelligent, powerful films that are easy favourites on the awards circuit. Then, the first sign of trouble appeared on the horizon: the film's release date was changed from a Christmas 2013 slot (prime positioning for the Oscars) to February this year (effectively eliminating it from the competition). The delay was ostensibly because the film's visual effects were more complicated than anticipated. But the speculation began nonetheless: Clooney had somehow managed to muck it up.That's perhaps why critics have generally reacted so negatively to the film since its release: if Clooney is waving a white flag of surrender, what right has The Monuments Men to be much good? Sky-high expectations were immediately transmuted into long-suffering derision: Clooney's film, it's been argued, is poorly structured, annoyingly episodic, and tonally inconsistent, hopping between comedy and tragedy without achieving much success on either front. If most critics are to be believed, Clooney has completely wasted this golden opportunity - not to mention the cast of a lifetime.What's comforting about watching the actual film is discovering that The Monuments Men is, on the whole, a great deal better than the extremes of expectation and opinion would suggest. It's not a full-on classic by any stretch of the imagination, but neither is it a monumental disappointment. For what it has chosen to be, it's very good: a look at the quieter side of war, at a battle fought for the soul of humanity - as captured in its artistic achievements - that is full of hope, but also grieves for the losses the world suffered as a result of World War II.Inspired by true events, the film opens on Lt. Frank Stokes (Clooney), a Harvard professor trying desperately hard to convince President Roosevelt of the need to thwart Adolf Hitler on a non-military front. Invaluable works of art across Europe are being systematically stolen by the Nazis as part of Hitler's plan to build a Führer Museum of his very own. Stokes gets the go-ahead to form the Monuments Men: a rag-tag group of museum directors, curators and art historians, whose sworn mission is to uncover Hitler's smuggling operation and recover the stolen artworks before they disappear forever - or are destroyed come the end of the war.Once assembled, the Monuments Men fan out across Europe. Lt. James Granger (Matt Damon) heads to Paris to get the help of Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett), a rebellious, devoted curator keeping watch as the Nazis blithely pilfer art in occupied Paris. Sgt. Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) and Private Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) go on the hunt for Hubert van Eyck's multi-panelled Ghent Altarpiece, while Sgt. Walter Garfield (John Goodman) and Lt. Jean-Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin) get caught in the crossfire of battle while hunting down leads.There's certainly quite a bit of truth in saying that The Monuments Men suffers somewhat from patchy, episodic plotting. The film occasionally drifts from moment to moment, some of its logic unravelling the longer you think about it. (After Granger is rebuffed by Claire a few times, what does he actually do in Paris?) There's a climactic scene in which Lt. Donald Jeffries (Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville) fights to keep Michelangelo's exquisite Madonna and Child statue out of Nazi hands - but it's so choppily edited together that audiences might find themselves puzzled about what exactly happened.But The Monuments Men is also a real delight: a movie about war that brims over with hope and humanity, while never losing sight of the very real horrors and consequences of heading into battle. The film's many moments of sweet, gentle levity - Granger's clumsy attempts to speak French (wonderfully subtitled on screen), Campbell and Savitz bickering but also coming to understand each other - are balanced out by the heartache and sacrifices of these Monuments Men. These are men - and one woman - who could easily have sat out the war, most of them too old to be enlisted. And yet, here they are, in the trenches of a very specific fight that not many will understand, but which everybody will eventually come to appreciate.This is where Clooney's starry cast shines the brightest. They help him carry the film, turning their tiny pockets of screen-time into something more, something deeper. Murray nails all his comedy bits, of course, particularly when he's strapped into a dentist's chair - but he will break your heart when he listens to a phonograph from home, one which also serves to literally underscore the darkest, saddest sacrifice the war requires of young, able-bodied men. Clooney himself manages to sell a few overly stirring, inspirational speeches about the hallowed mission of these Monuments Men. Damon and Blanchett, too, make magic out of their scenes together - her Claire, in particular, is a marvel of strength and determination, unflinching around Nazi scum and in the face of direct gunfire, only slightly undone by the awkward hint of romance that sneaks into the script.To be honest, it's easy to pick apart The Monuments Men - it's not as tightly woven or as well-paced as it could be, its characters often relying more on their actors than the script for a little depth and complexity. It's heavy-handed and light-hearted, all at once. But that's also part of the film's considerable charm: it credibly pushes a message of unyielding optimism in the face of crushing odds and Nazi efficiency, one that's threaded through with a bittersweet, rich vein of humour. For all its flaws, The Monuments Men clearly demonstrates how the greatest of exigencies can produce as much hope as they can horror.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Half cliché comedy half bad historical war drama - all NOT good,"George Clooney writes, directs, produces, executive produces and stars in his brain child The Monuments Men.The Monuments Men is a historical narrative about the World War II platoon charged with recapturing and conserving art masterpieces in Europe and based on a true story authored in the titular novel by Robert M. Edsel.A scholar named Frank Stokes, played by George Clooney, rallies for the chance to save famous artwork dating back to the Renaissance in the midst of a Nazi war zone. He enlists and entrusts the most qualified curators, played by: Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville and Bob Balaban. Along the way the monuments men get assistance from a French member of the resistance played by Cate Blanchett and German speaking American soldier played by Dimitri Leonidas.The premise of this film is promising and an original perspective on WWII cinema. Art is society's most prized cultural possession, a lineage of our history through hundreds and thousands of years. Its preservation over such a time is an achievement unto itself. The cast of actors elevates the potential of The Monuments Men to boundless heights yet it falls abysmally flat.I was incredibly excited for this movie when the trailer was released – but then the film faded away almost immediately after its debut. I now know why: while not bad, The Monuments Men is certainly not good. Everything about this movie is wrong, from the casting, tone, directing, screenplay and music.There is no plot structure within the dialogue laid out in the screenplay. Seven main characters and no structure is a recipe for disaster and The Monuments Men is confusing and fragmented. The film tries to anchor its plot to locating and securing Michalangelo's Madonna and child and Van Eyck's Ghent altarpiece. Unfortunately that is not enough when the lead characters break off into teams of two after thirty minutes and the plot scatters accordingly.Clooney's direction shows a lack of vision and inability to maintain a consistent tone throughout the film. At first it The Monuments Men a pseudo-MASH/Ocean's Eleven ragtag comedy. Fifteen minutes into the film and the tone flops to a somber historical drama. With the music concurrently changing from cheesy patriotic brass propaganda to overly melancholic instrumentals.The cast is sublime on their own, but with this poor script and direction only exacerbates the confusion and lack of clarity. If this film had committed completely to being a comedic interpretation of the novel then The Monuments Men may have succeeded. Clooney instead just produces a film that is historically flimsy, disjointed, disengaging.More reviews at our website.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Art Histroy Entertainment with WWII as the Backdrop,"I heard mixed reviews of this film though my lady and I thought ""let's go"" seeing the interesting cast assemblance. What I braced myself for was another World War II gore-ridden film with an art history perspective. Though the story did start a bit slow, it was a good run with the looted art as the primary focus. The slap stick humor shed light in the increasingly deeper and darker tone as the story unfolded and the Monuments Men delved deeper into the war zone. Some scene transitions were a bit jerky but overall a good story line with some great background shoots.A much appreciated aspect is the portrayal of strength of the characters and integrity portrayed during a tumultuous time in world history. The disparity among the characters made for some interesting lines. It was made evident the value of art as a remembrance of where we have come from, a semblance of western values held deep. And the unfolding of the relationships was definitely more akin to the respectful culture of the day more than now. I found it pleasing that when James (Matt Damon) is invited to spend the evening with Claire (Cate Blanchett), James exits her flat with grace sans sex scene not necessary for the focus of this film.Overall well worth seeing, including with the family.",,Anonymous,History

Why did Clooney have to change the story?,"In this case I read the book after seeing the movie. Clearly the movie is ""loosely"" based on the book (which of course describes the actual history). Why did Clooney feel compelled to change the names of the people involved in this story, it is history isn't it? My guess would be that about 50% of this screenplay is based upon actual events. Many events in the movie such as Matt Damon's character stepping on a mine, John Goodman and Jean DuJardin having a gun battle with a Hitler youth, Bill Murray and Bob Balaban's confrontation with a German soldier, and the 'romantic' interlude between Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett's characters are complete fiction. I agree with many of the other reviewers that the overall atmosphere of the movie was not in keeping with the serious nature of the subject matter.

Better than the harsh reviews seen,"The Monuments Men is torn apart by and ridiculed by critics and common people alike and I fail to see why. It's a great story about the little things that drive us in life and remind us who we are and where we came from. It seems that most people find this movie to be boring and drawn out. I can see that point. I felt like if art, history, or true stories don't appeal to you then stay away from this movie. If any of those three interest you then go see it. It was boring in a few spots but most movies do have their dry spells. The only reason this movie is torn apart is because it wasn't an action packed war movie. That is the reason why people aren't happy. So ignore the people who are hating on this movie for what it isn't and go enjoy this story about saving the past while fighting for the present and future, and don't expect a Saving Private or a Platoon you'll just end up in the majority that is disappointed in this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Would MUCH rather have watched a documentary on the same events,"Well, the summary pretty much says it all; I would much rather have watched a documentary on the same events, as this movie adaptation falls WAY short of being either sufficiently serious to lure out any empathy or sufficiently funny for it to provide comic relief in what was no doubt meant to portrait the brutal and cynical actions and events during the end of WWII. No attempts were successful - and I can say this without having any idea of the purpose of the movie, because it holds absolutely nothing of value, except a cast who's attendance will have cost something in the vicinity of the art presented in the film. A fine wast of time for a cast of fine actors, who should no doubt have spent their time better on other projects. A documentary would have told the story better and with less confusion as to how the director wanted to present the events. Hollywood textbook mess-up.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"Interesting subject, confused screenplay!",This is a good story based on the WW2 theft of art treasures by the Nazis but it lacks continuity and meaningful direction and screenplay. Various characters are presented but you wonder where they all fit in and what happens to them.There are goofs in the historical sequence of events. With the exception of Matt Damon you wonder if the elderly group of Monuments Men would realistically survive on the Western Front in 1944. Why did Cate Blanchett and Hugh Bonneville want to be in this movie? Cate gives a good performance as a French art gallery curator. Hugh is more uncomfortable in his role as the token British contribution to the mission. He is quite a contrast to his more familiar role as the Earl of Grantham in Downton Abbey.The story is good but the production should have been better. There are a series of vignettes but not tied together well. The subject has not been treated with enough depth.,5.0,Anonymous,History

"A unique film, an amazing story, a brilliant cast.","The Monuments Men stars George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman and Hugh Bonneville. The basic premise is that in WWII a group of men, all with a passion for different types of art, must travel around Europe stealing back the stolen art from the Nazis. I have to say before watching this I loved the trailer and was quite excited until seeing some reviews which said it was no where near as good as they expected but nevertheless I went and saw it and I came away understanding where people criticized it but all-in-all I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's fun seeing all these brilliant actors in one film, the comedy is good, the story has a nice moral and all together I liked it. I've hear people say it's boring but I wasn't bored at all, the pacing inst fast, and there aren't particularly any 'action scenes' but it's by no means boring. The way the film is put together I thought was a little strange, the first half felt like a series of sketches mixed with a very dramatic story of World War horror; about half way through it got much better but you did get the odd scene which added nothing to the story but gave you a good laugh, which I did. So in the end The Monuments Men was a gentle film with some very funny moments and some quite sad moments and worth a watch if you want a break from the fast-paced CGI destruction of modern cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Just does not work as a film,"This movie was a waste of time. It tried to construct a narrative around the mission of the 'Monument Men' and it failed. Films have a beginning, middle and end, or at least they have a 'story' which is greater than their plot. This has neither. The characters in it seem to be larping at war, which would have been a strange attitude for people alive to have. One other thing that was off-putting was the principle message of the film, that this was the fight to save civilization from the dark forces of Nazidom. This elevates material culture to the position of being the only thing that represent civilization, and ignores the fact that the Nazis didn't take these things because they wanted to destroy them, in fact they fell into the same trap as seeing material objects as the only representation of civilization. Also, Americans in the film talk about the priceless works of European art as ""our culture"" it seems a bit Nazi thinking to me.

Well apparently Danny Ocean owns a DeLorean.,"Although this film was brimming with its own self admiration, and advertising itself like there was no tomorrow, i had this sinking feeling that it was going to be...well...monumentally disappointing. And with the likes of Bill Murray, John Goodman, Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett, I should have no reason whatsoever to feel pessimistic about its release, but it wasn't their names that filled me with dread. It was George Clooney; Mr Auto-Pilot himself. When i seen the trailer i was immediately expecting a Casino to appear. The whole recruiting thing i had seen before, the same soul-less (oh look at me i'm cool) character. So lethargic, nothing new. And i have no qualms with him stepping behind the camera, he has a substantial amount of experience, why not? But when he decides to insert himself directly as the Leader of The Monuments Men, well then a film with potential has just took a severe blow to the gut...with a sledgehammer.The film felt empty the entire time, the acting, the scenarios that so desperately tried to suck sympathy from you or lure a cheap laugh from you. Yes the story is fascinating, and it should be launched into the limelight and given a film that makes you appreciate what people risked for, now, historical pieces of art or sculptures. It is an incredible canvas to create a masterpiece of a film, but George Clooney doesn't do incredible, he is placid in his acting and uninspiring as a director. Each film he has directed he has starred in. Why isn't (at this point in his career) being behind the camera enough? Why does he have to inject his lackluster persona into the film and leave it docile? Now I am not completely down on Clooney, i enjoyed the Oceans Trilogy, Descendants, Up in the Air and most of all From Dusk Till Dawn, but despite that he just can't help but play the same person and the film has to hold your attention in order for you to disregard his routine performance and enjoy the film as a whole. Unfortunately for this film, he is all over it, i would be hard pressed to recall 5 minutes in the film where Clooney isn't there.The rest of the cast try to shine, but every time they do....here's Clooney.... and he eclipses them. Try to show emotion, but...wait...there's Clooney again. If he where a musician he would be a one man band. Wants to do it all himself. Cate Blanchett played her part really well and bounced off Matt Damon. Murray and Bob Balaban try their best with the material given, but it quite frankly isn't funny and even if there was something that garnered some chuckles (like Damon's ""French"") then they do it again, and again and again. One thing that bothered me was that the entire film has a small sub-plot that seemed completely unjustified. Unworthy of the eventual climax. I'll leave it at that.This could have been a great film, but the sea of potential evaporated and was replaced with an Ocean of Clooney.",5.0,Anonymous,History
War had many different facets,"Everyone who pans this movie as not an exciting war movie is completely missing the point. Not all battles were about guns, bombs and physical heroics. There were many people slugging away to protect art and people just as depicted here. Many small steps that made big differences in the end. Not with raging battles or having romances with the local women, but doing the job they were assigned. This is a good depiction of events that took years. The real people this story is about we're young and old, men and women who cared about art in addition to liberty and justice.

The Magnificent Seven rides (figuratively) again.in a languid way,"The main event truly starts about 20 minutes into the movie, after the establishing scenes that include a sequence not unlike the recruiting of the ""Magnificent Seven"". The time is July 1944 and the stage is Normandy, one month after D-day, Operation Overlord. Whether it's Sword, Juno, Omaha, Gold or Utah doesn't really matter, as you see our protagonists going ashore from a landing craft. While the venue reminds you of scenes you have seen from ""The longest day"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" or and half dozen other movies, the mood is entirely different. Although it is just one month after the gut-spilling (literally, graphically, if you still remember Mr. Spielberg's haunting rendition) struggle for a toe-hold on the beachhead, we now see our protagonist sauntering along the almost deserted beach as if they were on a Sunday outing in the park.The mission of the artists and men of various other talents is to rescue a staggering number (from hindsight) of artwork that the Nazis, and Hitler in particular, tried to steal (or rob, whatever you call it) for their own collection. The process, however, is not what the trailers might have you believe. This is not ""Dirty Dozen"" by any stretch of imagination. As intimated in my summary line, our heroes go about their noble task, sometimes singly, sometimes collectively, sometimes in pair, in a manner that can almost be styled as ""languid"". All over Europe, they ask questions, they follow leads, and yes, they engage in some combats which are often casually narrated. It can almost pass for an archaeological team going on various digs.Those who have more than they bargained for in the action department from Hollywood will like the often pensive mood of this movie. There are also lighter moments although in that score the script does not rise above the standard one-liners and customary stabs. The cast assembled impresses but could be put to even better use. Still, the likes of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman and Cate Blanchett rarely disappoint even if they are not at their most brilliant moments.",,Anonymous,History

A barrel of gold teeth is the (only) telling moment,"This is a movie which it's easy to watch but harder to approve of. Particular emphasis is placed on a medieval altarpiece and a Michelangelo sculpture of the Madonna, both looted from two churches in Belgium; other works were taken from national collections, but the film also acknowledges that the vast majority were taken from the private homes of wealthy Jews.In one of the salt-mine hideaways Clooney's team open a barrel filled with gold teeth, a chilling reminder that the Jews were robbed of a lot more than their paintings when they were dragged from their homes and transported to the Eastern death camps. The film needed more moments like this. The overall feel of THE MONUMENTS MEN is of a 'caper' or heist story along the lines of THE DIRTY DOZEN or WHERE EAGLES DARE. 1995's THREE KINGS did a better job of combining a thrilling treasure hunt with a harrowing vision of terrorisers citizens.George Clooney's character, in defensive mode, more than once argues that the theft of great art is the theft of a nation's cultural heritage. This is true, but the real cost of war (look at Syria and Libya today) is the cost of lives and livelihoods. Yes, this mission saved thousands of precious paintings and sculptures, but the Holocaust and the destruction of entire countries needs to be remembered as more than a background detail.",,Anonymous,History

A Monumental Waste of Time,"College drop-out George Clooney manages to direct another pretentious waste of time. This movie is not sure if it is supposed to be a mockumentary, a bumbling comedy or a serious drama. As a comedy it is not funny, yet the musical score gives the ambiance of a campy WWII TV-show so it is hard to take it seriously either. That leaves the film as a some form of a bad mockumentary but I don't believe Clooney intended this, yet this is what he achieved.The acting comes off as lame caricatures, with the dialogue falling flat. Who wants to watch a bunch of idiots bumble their way around Europe, while some get killed because of their stupidity? The casting is also horrible as neither Clooney, Damon or Goodman can act. Bill Murray is decent but he cannot save this mess.The most insulting part is how pretentious Clooney makes the Monuments Men out to be. They are geniuses saving ""art"" while all those dumb hicks and war-mongers want to blow it to pieces for fun. It is not that saving art is not important, it is that life is more important but Clooney literally gives pretentious speeches implying otherwise. No one cares Clooney, really no one cares.Then Clooney manages to inject 21st century anti-smoking propaganda into the film by mocking the cigarette smoking of the time. Over and over and over again, smoking cigarettes is used as a bad comedy device that only intelligent progressives will understand.

"Boring, slow...move along, nothing to see here","Well, I suppose the sets were nice. I didn't go in expecting an action flick, but the characters had no depth, the story plods along and delivers NO really interesting moments. All the talent in this movie obviously couldn't save it from an extraordinarily dry script. The History Channel documentary the other night was far more interesting than this film. Half way through the film I decided to get a snack and when I asked my wife what I missed, she confirmed, nothing. I suppose this film will have a measure of interest from really fanatical WW2 buffs, but for the average movie goer, who likes historical films, nope. There just had to be a better way to tell this story than this film. Perhaps this would have been a watchable HBO film, but in the Cineplex?

One Hurdle that's on the Viewer,"This is an interesting story, well told.The history is engaging and the script does it justice.Editing and directing are high quality, too.Why then does it have low imdb scores?Perhaps it's a hurdle I faced, then relegated to the side where it belonged. It was ""me"" issue.I had trouble seeing Bill Murray and Bob Balaban in their roles. To a lesser extent John Goodman, too.All performed admirably, I hasten to note. I'm just used to associating their faces more with comedy even after they've had diverse careers.So for me, the combination of cast sometimes intruded on my viewing.Besides them, the rest of the cast also performed admirably. George Clooney leads with his usual dry, thoughtful charm. Should out to his father's cameo.Hugh Bonneville is superb and I wish he could have had more screen time. Cate Blanchett walks the line in a very complicated character--enjoyed her scenes with Matt Damon a lot.Overall, story and actors all do a splendid job.It's just on viewers to see them for what they actually do on the screen, rather than for our images of ""who they are.""",9.0,Anonymous,History

The Monuments Men should've been interesting...it wasn't.,"Films set in World War Two are incredibly popular and the genre has become saturated. There is no room for mediocrity anymore. In comes George Clooney and his famous Hollywood friends to add to the exclusive list of excellent war movies...Ha! Based on the true story of a group of historians going into Europe to recover artistic masterpieces that the Nazi's stole. The film does not do those historians justice, at all. Quite simply this was a mess, narratively speaking. I was hopeful at the start as Clooney and Damon hire the assistance of other historians. Then the movie kicks into second gear and the group are disbanded to various cities across Europe. The narrative consistently shifts between five (...yes five!) different parties of the same unit. This constant switching was ridiculously jarring and I couldn't maintain focus on what the heck was going on. It wasn't a cohesive narrative, it was like watching five separate stories in one film. Not to mention that nothing here was engaging or compelling. Character development was minimal, editing was rushed...this could've, and should've, been executed better. Even the acting felt bland, hardly any acting at all! Only Blanchett and Dujardin felt immersed in the story. Everyone else was just themselves but in costume. Clooney clearly focussed on his directorial efforts and it showed. I honestly think his directing style is great. It's clean, sharp and he isn't afraid to let the actors do their job. I appreciate the light hearted atmosphere, rare these days in a war film but it felt like Dad's Army instead of Saving Private Ryan. There were glimpses of humour, particularly with the land mine scene where our characters actually interacted. But ultimately it was too little too late to save this. Mediocre at best.",5.0,Anonymous,History
100 years since World War I,"We just passed the 100th anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which led to the first global war. Since that war - now known as World War I - created the conditions and caused World War II, that makes ""The Monuments Men"" all the more important. Hitler's rise to power and subsequent occupation of Europe could never have come to pass without the crippling reparations imposed on Germany at the Versailles negotiations. That in addition to the fact that at the negotiations, the racist crook Woodrow Wilson refused to listen to a young Ho Chi Minh, setting the stage for the Vietnam War, and the carving up of the former Ottoman Empire by the British and French set the stage for the current horror in the Middle East. Basically, the so-called War to End All Wars set the stage for all future wars. Gavrilo Princip was simply resisting the occupation of his land and he inadvertently changed the course of history.The movie itself isn't a masterpiece but is still worth seeing. It's a funny collection of characters, especially Bill Murray's character. And of course it's neat to see Neuschwanstein Castle (which also appeared in the 1962 movie ""The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm""); I once put together a 6,000-piece jigsaw puzzle showing that castle.Nonetheless, movies need to get made about the conditions that drove Gavrilo Princip to assassinate Franz Ferdinand and about the Versailles negotiations. Whether it's the Israel-Palestine conflict (caused by the Sykes-Picot Agreement), the horror that the former Yugoslavia witnessed in the 1990s (caused by the artificial creation of the Yugoslav kingdom), or the Russia-Georgia War (rooted in the Armenian Genocide), it seems that almost every part of the planet remains f***ed up because of World War I.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The Monuments Men - Receive a Rather Smal Monument,"I'm sure Mr Clooney had some good intentions for making this work but did he really have to set his hand to writing and directing? These tasks he has done rather poorly and drags much of his good intentions down to the level of a typical Dirty Dozen meets Oceans 11 type - this story needed more respect. It's also getting to be overly obvious that George 'casts' his cigarettes as closely as his co stars - everything he does features smoking as a major influence to the story (looks ominously like payola unfortunately?) His big cast are also pretty much your Hollywood HBO TV variety and their characters are underdeveloped to the point of creating little empathy. Pity, as the initial-based-on-fact story is worth a far stronger treatment. A good documentary could have covered this more convincingly. I'd recommend taking another look at Frankenheimer's ""The Train"" to get a better understanding of the significance of this whole Nazi 'Art theft' business. George was fortunate to get his big budget back but, I suspect many might have been somewhat disappointed with the end product considering such a costly input.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Weird Combination of Humor and WW2,"The casting choices the producer made make a strange presentation of light-hearted humor and death in the backdrop of WW2 that doesn't work, like mixing tuna and chocolate.

Fuhrer Museum? Nein!,"Greetings again from the darkness. Movies based on real life are often some of my favorites, but that doesn't let them off the hook in needing to be well made. The real life story of the Monuments Men provides both pride and heartbreak. This Allied group tracked down and rescued so much Nazi-stolen artwork, while at the same time being so short-staffed that they resorted to picking and choosing what parts of history and culture to save.For much of 2013, this movie was mentioned as a possible Oscar contender. When the release date was delayed and Clooney admitted he was struggling with the film's tone - a balance of comedic and dramatic and historic elements - all the warning flags shot up. The final version would certainly have benefited from script improvement, though the cast is so strong and the mission so true, that the film is still enjoyable enough. Director George Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov have adapted the source material from Robert M Edsel, but Clooney can't resist stamping the movie with his smirk appeal.The actual Monument Men spend very little time together, so it's tough to call this an ensemble piece. Bill Murray and Bob Balaban have their own subtle comedy routine going, while John Goodman and Jean Dujardin enjoy a jeep ride. Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett add a dose of gratuitous love interest where it's not needed, and Hugh Bonneville strikes the heroic pose of redemption. Director Clooney ensures that actor Clooney and his buddy Damon get the most screen time and close-ups, detracting from what the real story should be ... the men who saved art and culture.Michelangelo's Madonna of Bruges and Hubert van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece are supposedly the centerpieces of this group's mission, but the film really is just an amalgam of individual scenes that leave the viewer working frantically to tie all the pieces together. Shouldn't that be the filmmaker's job? The question gets asked a couple of times, ""Is art worth a human life?"". That critical theme could have been the core of a far superior movie ... one not in desperate need of suspense rather than more punchlines.Very few war projects have successfully blended comedy and drama. A few that come to mind are Kelly's Heroes, The Dirty Dozen and TV's ""Hogan's Heroes"". It's a tricky line to walk, even with a great cast. So while this one has sufficient entertainment value for a February release, I would rather recommend two others that deal with this same subject matter: The Rape of Europa (2007, documentary) and The Train (1964, directed by John Frankenheimer, starring Burt Lancaster).",4.0,Anonymous,History

Being both entertaining and at times amusing this was also educational. While stories have been told of the kind of theft we saw here, going on, the amount of it was staggering! If you start to think what would have happened if this rescue hadn't occurred then you would realise that most of it would have been destroyed by the fleeing Germans or ended up in the hands of the Russians. The scene (spoiler alert) where stacks of paintings are literally blow torched is hard to watch.The film itself has the feel of 'war movies' of earlier years (including the music) but that's what was intended.

Truly awful film,"I usually just go and watch movies - I rarely review them but I had to write something this time. This movie is unbelievably bad, as well as condescending and frankly just badly acted (I almost felt that the likes of Damon and Blanchett were struggling to keep a straight face at times: has no-one the guts to actually say no to gorgeous George ?) What annoyed me most is that this had the potential to be a great movie but started looking bad within the first five minutes and frankly never ever recovered. Apart from treating the audience like ignorant idiots, there was no attempt at creating any empathy with any of the characters - I frankly could not care less what happened to any of them.There was no real work on any of the characters as if this was done in a great hurry. The soundtrack used was incredibly inappropriate too: was this supposed to be a not very funny comedy ? It reminded me of a Cary Grant movie with bad acting, non-existent storyline and a vision of war that is so remote from reality that it beggared belief. I found the 3-second 'sombre' shots on the likes of white crosses being assembled and vats of gold teeth particularly bad: box-ticking at its worst. I saw this in a small theatre and virtually all fellow moviegoers were just horrified at how inane and superficial this movie was. Maybe it works with the US teenage market but I think even they would find this a waste of time and money. My advice ?

Tonally and structurally fragmented,"It is easy to give marketing departments a hard time – for giving away too much in the credits or for showing the good bits or just for making a terrible film look good. In regard to this film, the marketing seems to be in the same boat as the viewer because it is really hard to know how to sell Monuments Men when the film itself seems not to know what it wants to do or be. The story is a true one, of an action to save works of art from being lost or destroyed as the Nazi's begin their retreat across Europe. As such there must be a good story in here somewhere but it is not really to be found here.The story it tells is all well and good but for some reason it is not particularly well structured as it has characters and actions split up without ever really making a good connection between them until later in the film and by then it is too little too late. The uneven story telling is one thing, but it is the uneven tone that is the bigger problem. At times it is somber, other times it wants to Ocean's WWII, then it is serious again, then it is comedic – it is not impossible to mix the content like this but it is hard to do and this film just feels like they were spinning a ""what type of film is this"" wheel before shooting each scene.As the film doesn't work it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the starry cast are wasted – because frankly they are. Some of them don't know what film they are in, while some of them are playing it 100% certain what film they are in – it just happens to be a different one from other people. I'm not sure what went wrong with it, but it does flap around all over the place with Clooney seeming to be unable to get control of it. It doesn't help that it runs to almost 2 hours, because that is way too long for a film that doesn't work.There are moments in here and perhaps for some the interest in the real story may be enough to keep the interest, but for me I found it too consistently uneven in terms of its tone and its structure.",,Anonymous,History

"Could have been better, should have been better.","*********************DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS***************************** If you're expecting to read a professional review, you're in the wrong area. I saw this today and wanted to share my views.I was invited to watch this film with some friends. I'd seen the trailer, and hadn't planned to see it, but with this all-star cast, I expected much more.Maybe audiences have truly become too aware and film-makers just need to try much harder. For this film, it seems all the focus was on appearances, and less on structure.I found myself wondering why some scenes were in the movie. The young German soldier smoking in the woods at night with Halaban and Murray. It was painful to watch, and I asked myself what possible relevance it could have. It was strained and boring, no drama at all. As good as the shower/record player scene was by Murray, I think Clooney could have used those 7 or 8 minutes on character development earlier on and they would have been better spent. The dialogue was bland and uninteresting. The villains were...well, villains, but they didn't ""scare"" me. For SS officers, they weren't diabolical enough, evil enough. For me, anyway. Some have described the interaction between Blanchett and Damon as a romance. When? Where? After studying WWI, ""Kultur"", and the systematic destruction of Belgium's and Northern France's Medieval churches and Cloth Halls by the Hohenzollern Prussian dynasty, I did relate to the premise of the movie, The Monument Men.

Decent Enough,"Cate Blanchett and Matt Damon gave very solid performances as was be expected, and the rest of the cast was good as well, but rather wasted in these roles.I could have done without George Clooney in the lead role. I don't think he fit the part at all and never seemed to take his role very seriously, especially when he had toys to play with such as the German vehicle or the radio. He acted like a little kid with a stupid grin on his face as if to say, ""Look what I get to drive, Mommy! Look at me! Lookie lookie!"" He should stick to producing and not acting. In my opinion, the drawn out scenes with him driving his toys didn't even belong in the film . He should have had his play time off camera.There were some good scenes, but not enough to give it anything higher than 5 stars. It only gets a 5 because of Cate and Matt, with Bob Balaban and Bill Murry not far behind. John Goodman was totally wasted in this as he is capable of so much more.Bottom line -- it seemed as if old George could not decide whether to make it a comedy or a drama, and it even failed as a dramedy because it was just to poorly balanced to be either one.

Could have been better! 5/10,"Review: This movie has a great concept and some top class actors, but it does seem to drag in parts. I know that George Clooney, the writer and director, wanted to stay to the story so he couldn't make a comedy or a full out action movie, but for entertainment it seemed to lack a sense of wit. I did find the storyline interesting and all of the actors put in great performances, I was expecting a bit more from from Clooney. I don't think that it will go down as a all time classic, but it's a watchable movie that portrays an important time in history. Watchable!Round-Up: I could tell that Bill Murray was holding back in this film, which is a shame because it could have done was some of his humour. Matt Damon and George Clooney always have great chemistry on screen, and John Goodman hasn't always been able to hold his own, regardless of the project, which is why I was expecting something amazing in this movie. On the plus side, you can't help but fell emotional when they find some of the art pieces and Clooney did make the film look and feel believable to that period. I'm sure that there was loads of material left out of the storyline, so I would like to see this movie made again with an in depth look into what really happened with the Monuments Men.Budget: $70million Worldwide Gross: $155millionI recommend this movie to people who are into the World War II movies about a group of men trying to retrieve artwork from the Nazis. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
Surprisingly good,"Was looking on YouTube for something to watch and this popped up several times in the past week. Decent cast, why not at least start it? I found myself totally engrossed in this film. The story makes me want to learn more about the real folks and I felt a bit sick when I realized what Neuschwanstein was used for as I had visited there in 1990. I don't understand all the folks who have trashed this film, but I suspect it has more to do with George Clooney's politics rather than his art. Regardless, if he doesn't offend you this is a decent movie with a good historical story. Plus, how flipping talented is Cate Blanchett?",8.0,Anonymous,History
At Least Ben Affleck Isn't In It,"Every jump cut is preceded by a bad joke that seems to beg the viewer to set the DVD on fire. If you peel apart the self-indulgent surface layers, it is possible to imagine a decent B-movie from the premise, but that only adds to the disappointment. It left me wondering whether Goodman and Murray owed George a favor of some sort, but then I remembered some of the other script choices in their past and it almost made sense. Connor Linnerooth sure looked good behind that statue though; I think he's finally found his talent-- hiding his face from any and all cameras. And hey, Matt Damon wasn't the worst part of a film for once. I just have one question: Isn't George Clooney a little old to be this pretentious? 2/10 F",3.0,Anonymous,History
The lowest possible outcome for such a great cast.,"I didn't think it was possible to create a movie so bad with so many great stars. Trust me, this movie is just terrible. Never have I seen such lifeless performances from literally every person in a film. I have to blame the director as we know what Clooney and Blanchett and the others can do. The story has the potential for a great movie but it isn't brought to life in Monuments. At no point did I feel connected to the characters or the story. Why cast Bill Murray only to prevent him from delivering Murray antics in a film that could really use some life? It makes no sense. Clooney seemed asleep; I kept waiting for something to wake this film up; that never happened. Boring is the best way to describe it. Flat. I also had issue with the camera work. Many scenes seemed hurried having that home movie look. I wish they could remake the movie and tell it with some life and give us a reason to care. I'm sure the actual story is quite cool and worthy of telling.",2.0,Anonymous,History
One of the biggest disappointments of recent years,"It's rather difficult to spot a George Clooney-directed movie. He's riffed on the Coen Brothers, Billy Wilder and Alan J. Pakula, without ever settling on a style of his own. Of course, there's nothing wrong with taking inspiration from masters of their craft, but there's something undeniably empty about Clooney's output (the excellent Good Night, and Good Luck (2005) excluded). His latest, a light-hearted, men- on-a-mission World War II romp, is quite possibly his worst yet. It wants to be a war movie of old - a breezy, patriotic adventure best enjoyed on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but ends up being awkward, saddled with an awful script penned by Clooney himself and frequent collaborator Grant Heslov.After successfully convincing the U.S. President to assist in maintaining the cultural heritages of the countries ravaged the war, Frank Stokes (Clooney) is given the go-ahead to round up a crack team and enter Europe to save the art looted by the Nazis. Stokes and his friend James Granger (Matt Damon) quickly gather the team - which consists of Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin) and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban). Granger heads to occupied France and hooks up with spy Claire Simon (Cate Blanchett), who believes the team are out to steal the art for themselves, while the rest of the group split up with various objectives.Artistic licence has obviously been taken here, and there is no problem with that for the sake of both entertainment, and bringing the valiant efforts of those involved in the real Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Program, to people's attention. The undeniable greed of the Nazis (they hoped to open the Fuhrer Museum to home their loot) and the merciless destruction of any work produced by Jews, shouldn't be hard to convey to an audience. Yet, somehow Clooney struggles to make us care. Perhaps it's the cheery casualness of it all, or the fact that the film is nothing more than a few scenes lacking context where the cast mess around without letting us in on the joke.This is Clooney as Steven Soderbergh, clearly channelling his experiences on Ocean's Eleven (2001), but lacking the ability to control an ensemble or pen a script that helps establish each character. On paper, the cast is of the highest quality, but in the film, they are all basically the same person. Everyone is 'the funny guy', yet no-one is funny. Without any feeling of a consistent threat throughout the film, it's hard to care, so Clooney lumps in an 'I think I've stepped on a mine' scene near the climax which cries of desperation. If this had been made 50 years ago with, say, Henry Fonda, this would probably be a classic. But this is 2014, and The Monuments Men is one of the biggest disappointments of recent years.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",4.0,Anonymous,History

What if the very foundation of modern society is destroyed?,"This movie directed by and starring George Clooney is about protecting art objects from being pilfered or destroyed by the NSDAP towards the end of WWII.The presentation has a good selection of actors to play the various characters needed to tell the story. The pacing is a bit strange; I would not call it slow as much detail was needed to keep the story from looking like a cardboard documentary. Speaking of the selection of actors, Cate Blanchett was great as Claire Simone, the spitting French art protector.Shades of Ayn Rand George Clooney makes one or two of those nice long rallying speeches about the virtues of protecting art at any cost. Then he vacillates about the cost after a participant or two has been dispatched.This is one of those movies that has lots of clues and inferences mixed into the story so you will need to watch the film a second time to pick up on the nuances that you missed while you were thinking about the ones that you saw.Overall, this movie is everything that you would expect. It is not exceptional, but I doubt it could have ever been any better and I cannot think of a better director for this presentation than George Clooney.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Simply disappointing,"Although the foundation for it is a fascinating story of a group of men that aimed to rescue famous artwork from the Nazis during the Second World War, The Monuments Men fails to place its remarkable narrative in the forefront, and is rather dominated by poor writing, poor direction and overall lack of momentum. The film seems to be approached entirely in the wrong way, as its tone is often far too casual and humorous, despite it recounting a war story of great significance and interest. The audience is constantly exposed to awkward shifts between comedic and emotionally intense scenes, and due to the unflattering execution, the film is ultimately not particularly amusing nor dramatic. Perhaps its greatest appeal is an impressively star-studded cast, but as it often happens in such cases no one is able to truly shine, which results in a film that offers no outstanding performances. Overall, The Monuments Men is a film with incredibly noble intentions that lacks quality in execution, and despite its intriguing story undoubtedly deserving better, the outcome is ultimately very disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Ideal movie for art buffs,"I don't know why this movie was so badly reviewed. I suppose there were those who saw the movie with the expectation of seeing something akin to the Tomb Raider, with bullets and gores flying all over the place?? The movie played out more like a documentary with splashes of drama here and there. I personally enjoyed it. I am one of those people who would prefer visiting art museums over a balmy beach. Therefore, it was a complete enjoyment to see all the masterpieces in the movie, and see how brave and valiant the characters were. The story began with a group of men who were the 'geeks' of the art world, and no one expected to die at all, because they were tasked to retrieve artifacts, not at the front line. But then the movie showed these men actually experienced what a soldier experienced: death, danger, fear, homesickness etc. I sympathized with the characters when they were down, and I felt their exhilaration/awe when they found the art pieces. I didn't know the monuments men existed until this movie, and to have a glimpse of what they did to save the pieces, and what were lost in the process, made this movie both an enjoyable drama and educational movie for me.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Unfocused and ultimately droll, and Clooney knew it (**)","One of the more memorable scenes in film is the last moment from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", where the camera slowly pans up to reveal an entire warehouse of artifacts. Granted, this was a place of 'secret things', not necessarily artwork. However, that film did cover the fact that the World War II-era Nazis hoarded thousands of cultural artifacts from across the Eastern Hemisphere. They wanted it all for themselves- for if you rob a people of its' culture, you rob them of their spirit, as the theory was. These are big ideas, ripe for extrapolation on-screen, either as a dead-serious drama, or as quasi-adventure film, a la Indiana Jones. ""The Monuments Men"", however, never settles for one idea, and thus doesn't have an identity. The result is a muddled, aimless enterprise of a film that combines a fantastic cast, then doesn't do much with them.I'll declare myself a big fan of George Clooney, but his directorial efforts have brought about decidedly mixed results despite stellar casts before. ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is a very good film with a specific focus. ""The Ides of March"" seemed to exist simply to tell us what we already knew- politics are corrupt. The Chuck Barris biopic ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" was also an unspectacular, yet star-studded shoulder-shrugger of a film. In other words, it's hard to really get a grasp on how creatively talented Clooney is behind the camera. The only common thread I gather is that his films start with an inspired idea, and he simply presents it to us on-screen. Some just keep our attention longer than others.""The Monuments Men"" cannot keep its' own attention for long, not even to enrich the main characters (real people, for which real facts exist to extrapolate on). The film wastes no time in gathering this apparently motley crew, in a sequence so rushed it reeks of a montage. We do know this to be true, however; there were, in fact, a group of middle-aged men that joined the Army in World War II in hopes of recovering stolen art. They were, as the film shows us, an unlikely group. They were indeed brave by definition for heading into war zones. They did, in fact, recover thousands upon thousands of pieces of art across Europe.What else were they, however? Other than brief, obligatory mention of families back home, the film doesn't provide much nuance or inspiration to any of these characters. That's a crying shame when you consider the massive talents in the cast. Clooney? The affable 'really cool guy'. Damon? Eminently likable. Murray? Capable of showcasing a broad range of abilities. Goodman? Everyone's favorite 'dad' figure. Dujardin? Limited exposure to American audiences, but already an Oscar winner. The film asks us to care deeply about these men and what happens to them, but it clearly overestimates our zest for the actors themselves. So little time is spent with them as a group and exploring what made them tick, and it just doesn't work. On top of that, what exactly did this magnificent conglomeration of actors bring to their roles? For all the fanfare about their grouping, it doesn't seem to have brought the best work out of any of them.An exception to that would be (big surprise) Cate Blanchett as a French woman forced to catalog the art Nazis were stealing from her own community. Not only is she important to the mission (and the film's resolution), but her character's longing to feel anything other than hatred for Nazi action lends this film a steely emotional grab it so desperately needed. I envisioned there could have been a different film centered around this Claire Simone- a woman forced to betray her beliefs, then forced to watch, then forced to catalogue all of her culture's artistic heritage, then forced to smile about it.As straightforward as it is, the story of ""The Monuments Men"" may have worked better in documentary form. That would've afforded whatever filmmaker took on the project a chance to show the individuals involved with the 'Monuments Men' mission- without associating our notions of these actors with them. There are multiple ideas with which to work in this film, but no strong, emotional connection is created with any of them. We're not sure whether Clooney wants us to laugh at the myriad of personalities thrown together for a decidedly non-traditional mission, or be moved by the wretchedness of war and Nazi malfeasance. Even the most poignant moment in the film, taking place in an Allied camp at Christmas time, seems out-of-place and awkward in its' silence. I wasn't sure whether I should be laughing or crying. It's precisely the type of confused reaction you might expect when you watch a film that has no idea what it wants to be.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Mission failed,"The Monuments Men had a good cast assembled which gave this movie a lot of potential. George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, and John Goodman. Plus George Clooney was the director and a writer along with Grant Heslov based on a novel. Although the movie meant well, unfortunately the end result was a dour disappointment with a very slow pace which left many audiences unsatisfied. The Monuments Men certainly could have been a lot better.Based on a true story from the novel by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter, The Monuments Men tells the tale of an unlikely World War II platoon made up of museum directors, curators, and art historians recruited by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to be sent to Nazi Germany on an impossible mission behind enemy lines to rescue art masterpieces stolen by Nazi thieves and return them to their rightful owners before 1000 years worth of art is destroyed.There are many reasons as to what went wrong with this movie. The movie is very disappointing, slow and non-eventful. The Monuments Men tries to emulate such classics as The Great Escape, The Dirty Dozen, or Kelly's Heroes, but falls way short of reaching that potential. This is certainly going to be a black mark against George Clooney as an actor and director. Consider this mission a failure.3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,History
It's a popcorn movie. Don't expect too much except a pleasant afternoon,"There are a lot of negative reviews about this movie because it doesn't achieve all that it might. A tremendous topic, the Nazi theft of as much European art as the Reich could carry, the destruction of much of the rest, and the discovery and recovery of that art by a small group of men dedicated to the task. This is all based on true events. If you want to see a documentary about the Reich's heist, watch the excellent ""The Rape of Europa"" and you'll get all you want. If you want to spend a pleasant afternoon watching the dramatized George Clooney version, better called ""Ocean's 11 Saves Private Art,"" then see this movie.There's a powerhouse team of actors including Clooney, Matt Damon, John Goodman, Bill Murray, Hugh Balaban, Cate Blanchett, and Hugh Beaumont that's not even slightly stretched in this movie. Yes, the script could have done far more with these talented actors. It doesn't, so there's a lost opportunity. Too bad. Instead, what we have is a cheesy white-hat/black-hat, ""The Good War,"" World War II movie where the good guys win and the bad guys lose. You know, the kind of movie we used to watch before all those ambiguous wars messed with our moral compasses and made us less than certain of just who we are.For me, the movie was worth it just to watch the 5-minute scene where George Clooney's erudite character explains to a captured and smug German officer why he's not anti-semitic. The German officer was reported to have run ""one of those camps."" The officer told Clooney that he had run one of those camps, and that Clooney should be thankful to the German for helping to clean up ""the problem."" Clooney pulls out a cigarette even though he doesn't smoke, lights it up, and replies that the cigarette will help him to remember this conversation after the war while he's enjoying a New York Times review and a bagel at his favorite Jewish deli in New York City. He will remember the cigarette and the conversation but the German officer will be utterly forgettable. In this, Clooney portrays the morally progressive and unambiguous American we wish we were.Perhaps movie audiences are no longer able to sit through clear, morally unambiguous fare like ""The Monuments Men."" I, however, felt it was an afternoon well spent.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Hard to pigeonhole this movie,"'The Monuments Men.' Maybe I should have found out more about this film before I watched it. I thought I had a round idea... we're told from the promotional material that a group of 'misfits' hunts important pieces of art during the end of the Second World War and prevents them from falling into Nazi hands.And, to be fair, that is what it's about. However, I don't know what I was expecting, but it never seemed to fit into any particular genre. It's not really a war film. Yes, it's set in the middle of a war and – almost – every scene depicts a war-torn Europe. However, there's hardly a shot fired throughout the entire film. The 'misfits' label makes it sound like some sort of 'Dirty Dozen' film where a bunch of screwballs triumph over adversity (falling down quite a few times along the way). Again, the characters are a bunch of misfits, yet they're certainly not funny enough to be particularly entertaining. Yes, I know this is a serious subject (i.e. Nazis stealing – and sometimes destroying – precious art during the war), so I wasn't expecting the central characters to behave like clowns, but I thought their interactions may be a little more enjoyable.Unfortunately, none of the characters are really fleshed-out enough for us to care that much about them. Despite the cast being full of excellent talent, all seem to be a little underused. The story is simply the main characters sitting in one war-ravaged location after the next, discussing where they're going to look next for a painting, or sculpture.There was some attempt to interject a 'baddie' element. Early on in the film we meet a Nazi who's also hunting all the priceless pieces of artwork. However, that story is kind of snubbed out halfway through and feels a little disappointing.What we're left with is an important story (as it is based on true events) that find themselves told in the blandest way possible. The cast do their best, but the script just isn't that enjoyable. Maybe the film-makers were trying to accurately capture the 'depressing' feel of the era. If that was their intention then they succeeded. I felt gloomy waiting for it to end, too.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",5.0,Anonymous,History

The Monuments Men,"Overall, I am quite surprised at the weak ratings that The Monuments Men, is getting from both critics and audiences. I personally really liked it a lot. No, the film is not action packed with a lot of violence, or explosions, or things like that, and I for one was glad that it wasn't like that. The film wasn't action packed, but I did not find that it had a slow pace, or was boring whatsoever. Instead, I found the film which was based on real people and a true story and events to be respectful and thoughtful about these people, their mission and the subject in general. We get to know the characters a little bit and get to like them and the actors who play them all do a really good job here. The film also looks great and it's attention to detail for that time period is also very impressive. I found the film interesting on a number of different levels. The second world war aspect of the film was interesting enough, but I also found the story of these men who went in and tried to uncover these various pieces of stolen art masterpieces to be equally as interesting and that is more or less where the film places it's focus. I think because I love art and respect it, that the whole art recovery and search part of the film intrigued me and just seeing these masterpieces stolen and later being searched for was intriguing to me. I also liked how the film kept everything low key and did not overly elaborate, or embellish things making it feel more realistic and less like a major Hollywood film. If this had been filled with action, explosions and a lot of violence, I do not feel that it personally would have worked. Instead we have a much quieter and gentler film which is more sensitive to both the subject of the war and also has it's appreciation of art and these men deeply embedded in it's appreciation in this film. I personally cared for the characters in this film and the mission they were on and I really did want them to uncover and find all this stolen art. Whether they do or not, I will not give away for those who have not seen the film. Overall, I was very impressed with the film's look, tone and quiet and yet respectful treatment of the subject. Some may find it slower moving and may be a bit disappointed with it, but I found there more to take in and appreciate with the film being that way. I hope more people give The Monuments Men, a chance because I personally found it to be great and I know that there is an audience out there who will think the same as I did.",,Anonymous,History

"'Monuments Men"" Makes Point Powerfully Yet with Restraint","""Monuments Men"" (1hr 50min - Rated PG-13) has somehow, inexplicably and inaccurately, been tagged as part comedy, a charge that carries with it a wink-wink ""acknowledgement"" that it is somehow the A-Team with big stars. And with that comes the subliminal warning that the story is broad, the action overdone and the performances corny. Well, the part about big stars is accurate: George Clooney (who also directs), Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Hugh Bonnevile _ and others (including Nick Clooney, George's father, in a neat cameo). Forget the rest. Comedic? No, never. Witty, yes, at times very. Based on the true story of ""the greatest treasure hunt in history,"" the film is an action-drama focusing on an unlikely World War II platoon ordered by President Franklin Roosevelt to go into Germany to recover artistic masterpieces stolen by the Nazis and return them to their rightful owners. The most striking thing about the film is its tautness, both in how it's acted and edited. There is palpable tension because the fate of the characters is always in doubt, and the awfulness of warfare is handled deftly without hitting the audience over the head. Above all, director Clooney does a wonderful thing: he gives the audience credit for being intelligent. It's a good bet that at an early-rehearsal table read of the film's script, he urged the cast to play their roles in an understated, realistic way. And they do, across the board. Clooney the director handles Clooney the actor beautifully. In the film's linchpin scene, Clooney confronts a Nazi officer and with very few words, says what he needs to _ what we would all like to _ in very stark terms, using everyday metaphors to bring home what World War II, the Nazis and the need to protect civilization really meant to this, the greatest generation.

Nauseating,"Clooney, aka Mr Pretentious is bad enough at the best of times, but this ""vehicle"" had me wanting to pull his teeth out.The whole premise of this movie is flawed and it is a very skewed representation of the ""true story"" on which it is based; I'll stop a little short of saying that it is an outright lie.For the uninitiated: a group of soldiers are tasked with re-capturing famous works of art, stolen by the Nazis.My largest problem with this is the assertion made a number of times throughout the movie that in some way, artwork is more important than human lives because ""a bunch of people might be killed, but this is our culture"". Spoken like a true Hollywood luvvie and colossal pillock. Culture is CREATED by human lives EVERY DAY and any given life taken by war is one that could potentially produce the next masterpiece.The fact that Clooney sunk his teeth into this cringeworthy, pretentious twaddle says a lot about the man. Not to mention the fact that some extremely talented artists serving on the monuments men squad lost their lives, thereby depriving the world of any artistic contributions they may have made had they survived.The acting - with the exception of clooney (who seems to only have one character no matter what movie he is in) is exceptional; I can't fault it at all. It's just such a shame that this same ensemble wasn't used for a better movie.It is RIGHT that goods were recovered from the Nazis, but to suggest that this endeavour was in any way more important than human lives makes this a dark period in human understanding and not in any way entertaining to watch.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Flat script; flat acting with flashes of brilliance,"Though we appeared to dedicate more attention to captured art in 1943 than we did to the known plight of imprisoned Jews about to be slaughtered, I still wanted to see this film done well.

I respect George Clooney's goals here.But wasn't the problem George Clooney? I'll start with his podium readings to Roosevelt and Truman. Flat, so flat that a passer-by could have been just as effective. Wouldn't that segment have been better used by having the presentation just as a voice-over, with visible content consisting of Jews being rousted from their homes, their belongings inventoried and stole, throughout Europe? Why should Clooney have monopolized the scenes? He simply was dramatically empty, even with his powerful message.Because he was the director, that's why. If he wants the spotlight, he as director can shine it. And that, here, was a significant failure. No one said (or was able to say) perhaps that's not the best intro, George. A little too much of you, George.Too much George! The movie did turn in some acting tour de forces. Cate Blanchett was a revelation. Bob Balaban too. And as to Jean Dujardin, I'm glad to see he's found a niche in talkies.",,Anonymous,History
boring!!!!!,"it was as slow as a bloody monument,what waste of talent.It doesn't know if to be a comedy or a drama,i mean make their minds up.Clooney has been in some right clunkers lately.I've always looked forward to him after he was in from dusk till dawn,but no hes gone down Hill.pity the last good movie hes been in was oceans 11things usually happen ,say like in ocean's 13 the more actors the worst the movie is, and it just felt like it was missing something all along, the plot , where was it?? and some waste of time like with the soldier smoking with Bill Murrray, what was the point in that?? very poor script,and why keep having Matt Damon trying to talk french when all he was getting was insulted by it?, it was terrible from begging and sorry to say i didn't finish it to say endof course kate Blanchet was great...like always... but also looked like she didn't know what the hell the script was about you could see it on her face,",1.0,Anonymous,History

I've seen worse films than this and watched through to the end. But this time I bailed out just over halfway through.To sum it up... the film is slow. It's a war film with not much war.

"The Half-""Dirty Dozen"" Of The Art World","Among the many horrific things about Adolf Hitler and his nightmarish visions of a Third Reich, which began with destroying everything Jewish (including the Jewish people themselves, of course), was the fact that the German army, under his orders, was stealing every piece of art from every museum in Europe, intending to display them all in his so-called ""Fuhrer Museum"" in his hometown of Linz, Austria or, in case of his country falling to the Allies or him being found dead, to burn and destroy all of that art, thus eliminating one thousand years of human history and creativity from the books. Into this fray stepped a half-dozen Americans with backgrounds in art. They are the subject of what is one of the best World War II-era films of recent vintage, THE MONUMENTS MEN, based on the book of the same name by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter.George Clooney, who co-wrote and co-produced the film as well as directed it, is the man leading the charge to save as much of this priceless art as is humanly possible before Hitler and his goons send it to the flames. Matt Damon, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray, Hugh Bonneville and Jean Dujardin are the art experts that go along with him on this mission, a mission that began within a month of the D-Day landings that commenced the liberation of Europe. In short order, they manage to recover many great works of art stolen from the great art museums in Amsterdam and Paris, with some of the information coming from the contact that Damon makes with a French art curator and resistance member (Cate Blanchett). But they soon learn that huge quantities of art are being stored in various mine shafts in the interior of Germany, making their task even more pressing, and especially given that Hitler's defeat is nigh. In getting into the heart of Germany, going along with convoys of U.S. and Allied forces, the team must engage in firefights with German soldiers they had hoped to avoid. Finally, they get to the mine complex where the biggest and most important works of art in human history have been stored and hidden by the Nazi regime. And they don't have very long to get it.Clooney and his co-writer/co-producer Grant Heslov would be forgiven if they had designed this as a combination of World War II ""impossible mission"" films like STALAG 17, THE GREAT ESCAPE, and THE DIRTY DOZEN with various ""heist"" movies; but since this is a true story that few people in the world had ever heard about prior to the publication of the book the film is based on, it adds realism to the piece. Instead of being tough-nosed hard cases like we've seen in many classic World War II movies, the men involved, even Clooney, are closer to the ""Everyman"" archetype that most audiences can readily identify with the best. The film is not without its moments of humor, of course, given that solid seriocomic actors like Goodman and Murray are involved; but Clooney doesn't avoid some of the slightly grimmer aspects of the story either, such as the discover of a whole satchel full of gold fillings, knocked out of the teeth of Jews in the concentration camps. Some of the laconic dialogue among the guys is reminiscent of what we got in THE GREAT ESCAPE; and even the score by Alexandre Desplait has a main title theme that has the jauntiness of Elmer Bernstein's score for that classic 1963 film.All the cast performs admirably in the film, especially Clooney, given the fact that he is doing double duty being both in front of and behind the camera. Although the horrors of war are largely de-emphasized, the scenes of the bombed-out and burned-out French and German towns do have the feel of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Clooney and Heslov also give the Germans a more nuanced but no less frightening portrait of venality and greed in the manner of what we saw in SCHINDLER'S LIST or CROSS OF IRON; they are not all the stereotypical goose-stepping goons. And while it is never easy to talk about too much of what went on during World War II as being ""good"" in the standard sense, THE MONUMENTS MEN is a film that proved that it's possible. Given that its subject is about saving the greatest works of art of the entire human race from the madness of one man's dreams of global empire and destruction, that is indeed saying a lot about us as a race that can only be described as ""good.""",10.0,Anonymous,History
If You Think You Won't Like It - Then You Won't.,"I had mixed feelings about watching 'The Monument's Men"". To be honest - My initial feelings to the trailer were that I wouldn't like the movie. I was right...I'm not a George Clooney fan... His acting is something similar to plaster drying. So to read that George had such huge influence in this movie had me concerned. I was expecting bland and it delivered just that.The cast also had me worried. Whilst some of the names were great in their own genre. Putting them together in a wartime drama also had me worried that the chemistry just wouldn't be right. It wasn't. Bill Murray seemed handicapped and Matt Damon equally so. Neither has the scripting or direction to shine.Add to all this a story twisted to be a pro USA propaganda piece about how they once again saved our civilization from destruction and you have this movie.It's not pretty watching actors struggle through a movie... It's even more difficult when the story could have been so much better. Knowing what could have been...Don't bother watching The Monument Men.

Sure the movie had some great and impeccable dialogues and moments but it seemed to be inconsistent (the movie was lost somewhere in the middle).I mean the whole star cast gave us movies like Gravity, The Bourne Series, Groundhog Day, Notting Hill, Moonrise Kingdom and the list goes on. But this didn't looked like them. Mr. Goodman though did a good job. The movie had some of parts which really showed the horrors of WWII which were moving and there was a bit of light comedy.

Very pedestrian,"I think in a way The Monuments Men was always doomed to fail. The story and events it is based on are fascinating, and were clearly very important to the preservation of so much of Europe's cultural heritage. However, I can't help but think these events would be more comfortable as part of a documentary rather than a feature film.There just wasn't any of the jeopardy or tension needed to give this film the fire it so desperately needed. We essentially were just watching the group drive around picking up art from areas which had already been reclaimed by the allies or deserted by the Germans. Any attempt to inject tension felt very artificial and out of place.I also struggled to bond with any of the characters. The attempts to build camaraderie between them with japes and banter just didn't work. None of the relationships were believable and all fell quite flat.The film also felt very messy. At times it seemed to just be a collection of disparate scenes which weren't even remotely connected. There was no real drive in terms of the plot, it simply meandered for its runtime with very little purpose.I also can't forgive this film for the criminal under/mis-use of Cate Blanchett. In fact, none of the superb cast really had a chance to shine. The screenplay was stacked against them, so don't let the dazzling A-listers fool you - the performances are well below par for all of them.A swing and a miss.",4.0,Anonymous,History
A group of unlikely men get around the Nazis trying to recover historical art.,"I didn't even realize this was still in theaters until I saw it today.

Damon, Goodman, Murray, Clooney, and whoever the hell else is in this movie interact with each other very well, better that any cast I've seen in years. It's not really an action movie per say, but more of a historical drama set in WW2. It truly is a fine movie, I don't know what all the complaining is about. I recommend it.

"will spend next 2-3 days reading all movie reviews, both positive & negative","I would like to say that I am fair before I proceed to eviscerate someone. But I will throw this out there for anyone to respond.

Anyone who has seen Frankenheimer's 60's flick dealing w/ the very same subject matter,a quietly thrilling war of wits between French resistance(?)fighter(Burt Lancaster) & incredibly determined(sociopathic?)Nazi general(Paul Muni),will have to agree w/ me that ""Monuments Men""(whatever) is like an annual Girl Scout, sales girl of the year jamboree retreat in the Catskills. Obviously, I forgot to spend $12 on a ticket,so this is unfair. BUt burt lancaster, who probably doesn't utter more than 50-60 words in the entire movie,gives the impression, that at any minute, he will get his head blown off, there are so many Germans on patrol coming out of the bushes in this movie, desperate to move their ""cargo"" to Berlin.

Sometimes Our Achievements Are Worth Dying For,"This is a dramatic film, with some humorous moments, that shows the importance of human achievement and I loved every minute of it. The story is based on true events that center on the ending of World War II, when Nazi troops hid artwork from around Europe for Chancellor Hitler. President Roosevelt lets Lt. Frank Stokes (George Clooney) gather an unlikely squad of museum directors, curators and art historians to enter Europe and save, not only art, but people's history.What makes this film strong is its story and how it shows the characters' passion for their goal. I'm not an art critic, but I recognized some of the artists and their work. But I'm not into art like these people were. However, when you see the soldiers torching the art, my heart broke and my stomach tied in knots. Watching this film reminds me that art isn't just paintings or sculptures, it's about people's accomplishments and, if that's gone, what do we have?The screenplay is beautifully written by Grant Heslov and George Clooney, who also directs this movie. This film can be humorous, but it also shows the reality of war. For example, they talk about concentration camps and that's a risky move. It refers to the inhumanity that happened, but they balance well so it's not ""Shindlers List."" This dream cast includes Bill Murray (Sgt. Richard Campbell), John Goodman (Sgt. Walter Garfield), and more memorable actors that play fantastic people. Just watching them interact is entertaining enough.My favorite character is Pvt. Preston Salvitz (Bob Balaban). I pick this character because when I see Bob play Preston he becomes a little ball of fire and I love this person's passion for art.My favorite scene involves Sgt. Campbell (Murray) receiving a recording from his daughter while he's fighting in the war. Preston plays the recording on the announcement intercom and your heart turns to mush as Bill sits by himself smiling with tears in his eyes while listening to his daughter's voice.The moral of the story is, ""Sometimes our achievements are worth dying for."" ""The Monuments Men"" love art and that's why they are picked for this team. They are willing to die to protect it.I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for 12 to 18-year-olds. There's some action, blood and language that younger kids shouldn't experience, however the film shows our human side and how we live to create achievements.Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST!

This is a great cast wasted on what is ultimately a boring docu-drama. It just confirms you should never see a movie where the star is also the director and writer, unless it's Eastwood.

Important Message But Poor History,"I was expecting so much more from this film given the great cast and the historically important true story. Unfortunately the lighthearted tone and stereotyping of anyone French and British made this feel like a Disney-rewrites-history film.This leads me on to the historical inaccuracies. Whilst very loosely based on fact the film has, like so many older WWII movies, been tailored to appeal to a more local demographic. For example, the number involved and roles they played; the origin of the group in 1942 in Libya by the British etc. This is deeply sad, because you are left viewing the whole movie as a work of fiction, which undermines those who did such important work to save great works of art, transcending the war itself.This film had an important point to make regarding the loss of great art through conflict but could have been so much better.See http://www.historyextra.com/feature/historian-movies- monuments-men-reviewed",1.0,Anonymous,History
Monuments Men - Go See It!,"This is an outstanding bit of movie entertainment! I just saw it and was mightily impressed by it.The story is compelling, the scripting is top-notch, the dialog is a gem, the acting is superb, the casting is excellent, the production values are lush, and the attention to detail is superb.Originally due out late last year, the folks at Columbia & Fox realized they had something more than a ""Clooney / Damon caper movie"" on their hands and pushed it to this year. It was a wise decision on their part.Based on the real story of the Allied effort to retrieve and return the artworks looted by the Nazis, ""Monuments Men"" does an excellent job of turning that tale into an engaging, compelling, exciting, saddening, and uplifting tale that is well worth seeing.I expected something a bit more ""adult"" than the original ""Clooney / Damon caper movie"" it was first depicted as - but was surprised and pleased at what the movie actually is. Yup, there's plenty of snappy dialog and humorous situations. Yes, Clooney and Damon are in fine form together. So too however, are Goodman, Murray, Balaban, Dujardin, Blanchett and all others involved. As an example, Blanchett's ""Claire Simone"" character is a very well rendered Parisian one when it comes to the proper use of French.The tale could've easily become a farce with these actors / characters depicted as some sort of historian / art expert action heroes winning the war all on their own. Thankfully, the movie and tale is nothing like that. It does show them as being at the front lines and suffering the consequences for that. But it wisely depicts them as exactly who they are - art experts who happen to be in uniform and not combat troops ordered to be art experts. The movie does an excellent job of depicting the difficulties of that situation and its results.And the production values of the film make it a joy to behold. Location shots abound. Any CGI used to enhance those settings is done seamlessly and thus enhances the story first and foremost. One thing which particularly impressed me was the movie's use of period equipment in exacting detail and specificity.When there's a scene involving a British Army unit moving out - they're using Bedford QLDs to do so. When there's a scene of a Red Army unit driving 'round - they're doing so in their GAZ-67 ""jeeps"" and their Zil trucks. This, when it would also have been perfectly appropriate to have depicted them driving 'round in American built vehicles as we supplied plenty of them to them via Lend-Lease. Nope, that just wouldn't do here! And that sort of attention to detail abounds throughout the film.Paying attention to what's going on on screen is also highly rewarding here. There are plenty of details presented in a realistically understated manner that are all the more compelling for it.This is an excellent two hours worth of movie entertainment and well worth watching.",,Anonymous,History

Movies like The Monuments Men that don't even try to capture the spirit of war, but instead rely on a ""good-old-boys"" cast and quips that real soldiers would never say don't stand a chance at capturing my attention.I only sat through it because my parents wanted to see it, and who was I to bust up movie night? My advice is to watch the preview. If you get a chuckle or two out of it and like seeing Matt Damon's smirk and George Clooney's head tilt as they (don't) pretend they're in the 1940s and could, in theory, be killed at any moment, go ahead and rent it. You'll probably like it, and that's great. There's nothing wrong with light entertainment. I just prefer my war movies to be a little more realistic and substantial. A story about a platoon charged with guarding priceless art instead of being sent to the front could have been interesting - with real characters.

Self-indulgent vanity project,"When we saw a preview for this movie at the theatre back in the day, I showed some interest, maybe b/c Bill Murray is in the cast. My wife turned to me and said, ''you know it's going to be horrible, right?""
Turns out, she over-rated this movie by quite a large margin.
I can almost imagine Clooney calling up his buddies and asking, ''Who's up for a paid European vacation? We don't have a shooting script, so we'll just makeup as we go along. I read the book. It'll be fine. Trust me.""
It's earnest and dull on a level rarely seen these days. The way they're always staring at the paintings when they discover them. Check out Clooney when he finally comes across a key piece. Whoa. What's he doing with his hand there?
The narration somehow makes it even worse, driving it to a point of pathos that I haven't seen since the days of the NBC Very Special After School Special.

"A good message, a good and lazy cast, a good story without anything special. A warm film, in short.","This film tells me a lot. I am a historian, I understand the importance of art, the historical and artistic heritage, and I am well aware of the irreparable loss that all wars cause in the cultural heritage of nations. Portugal, my country, has always kept distance from European conflicts, a situation conditioned by geography, but which has allowed my country to pass through raindrops and to be spared in many times of difficulty. Even so, we know what a large-scale war is: we were invaded by Napoleon Bonaparte, with great devastation and loss of life and property, and many pieces of art (mainly sacred art, furniture and jewelery) were stolen and taken to France at that time. So, watching this film and seeing the efforts of a handful of men to save pieces of European culture is something that has meaning for me because it is something that, in such a dramatic war, I would also be able to offer to do. Yes, without a doubt ... it is worth risking to save pieces of art and culture that are truly irreplaceable and allow them to return to their rightful owners.George Clooney is a multifaceted man. Director, screenwriter, one of the main actors ... he certainly embraced this project with commitment, and the cast is full of stars like Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Hugh Bonneville and Bill Murray, great actors who have, in the past, given proof of talent beyond any doubt. The problem is that there are so many good actors that I felt that they never reached the potential they deserved, limiting themselves to a warm and sometimes lazy performance. So much money and good human capital involved and Clooney doesn't know how to take advantage of all this and make an incredible movie with these stars?The script is good and the story told is very interesting. In fact, the film entertains and captures the audience but it is a little boring to feel that, in some parts, it tries to be dramatic and, minutes later, it is desperately trying to make us laugh. The length of the film is also a bit exaggerated, given the story told. At a technical level, the film has good production values: a photograph that is pleasing to the eye, good sound, visual and CGI effects, good costumes and scenery, but something that really surprises us is missing. It is a very average film in everything. And the most tiring is the soundtrack ... composed by Alexandre Desplat, it constantly sounds adventure with touches of comedy and announces a light and fun film, with some sense of grandeur. Actually, the film has funny parts but it lacks that sense of adventure and has nothing grand or epic about it, which makes the soundtrack a little too presumptuous.I liked this film for its message about the importance of heritage, culture and preservation. I liked the story told and felt that the film is worth it but there is nothing fantastic or special about it.

More Than Just Ocean's 11 During World War II: An Important Episode in the War Against the Nazis,"The first scene of the film is set in a church in Ghent, Belgium. Clerics are busily taking down a large paneled altarpiece which appears to be late medieval/early renaissance in its style. It's the Ghent Altarpiece, one of the most famous artworks ever forged in Europe. The panels are hastily taken down and put into a truck. Word is the Nazis are on their way to confiscate the work, possibly ordered by Adolph Hitler himself.We often think of Nazi-Germany in terms of what they did in battle and/or to certain religious and ethnic groups in Hitler's ""Final Solution"". However, the Nazis didn't limit themselves only to the gunfire on the battlefields and the horrors of the concentration camps. Another aspect of Nazi-Germany's rape of Europe was the destruction of cultural heritage and legacy, particularly by plundering Europe's artwork from public museums and private collections. In nearly every country the Nazis overrun, they plundered museums and large private collections. It wasn't enough that they subjugated large populations to their totalitarian regime; they also stole their identities. The Monuments Men were a real-life group of ""soldiers"" assigned the daunting task of retrieving the art confiscated by the Nazis towards the end of the war. This film is about their story.George Clooney plays Frank Stokes who outlines the importance of retrieving the lost art: ""You can wipe out an entire generation, you can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still find their way back. But if you destroy their history, you destroy their achievements and it's as if they never existed. That's what Hitler wants and that's exactly what we are fighting for."" An evil power can subjugate France, but if it destroys the Louvre or Versailles, France itself becomes nearly destroyed. Save the Louvre and Versailles, France lives on.After the Ghent Altarpiece scene and Stokes' speech, ""the Monuments Men"" rings a bit like ""Ocean's 11"", with Clooney soliciting art historians, scholars, and restorers from different parts of the United States. He puts together a small band of misfits who are either too old or too ill-equipped to be involved in the war on the front-lines. This is their way of being involved in the conflict in a significant way. Their mission: to find and retrieve the lost artwork either from public museums or private collections. The cast is a Who's Who of famous name talent in addition to Clooney: Matt Damon, Hugh Booneville, John Goodman, Bill Murray, and Bob Balaban, just to name a few.The band breaks off into smaller groups and each has their own story. One of the most interesting is that of real-life figure Rose Valland, although they changed her name to Claire Simone in the story. She has been spying on the Nazis while they've been abducting many great artworks in Paris. In real life, she became a heroine in the cause of stopping the Nazis from their plundering. In the film, she meets James Granger (Matt Damon), who needs her help in finding the art. At first she is reticent, believing he only wants to bring the art back to US museums. In another group, there's Richard Campbell and Preston Savitz (Murray and Balaban) who are following leads into the European countryside, hoping to find some of the lost treasures. Other members go by themselves seeking to save art not yet pilfered by the Nazis, such as Donald Jeffries who goes to the church housing a Madonna and Child by Michelangelo. Eventually the groups will converge and they hit the jack-pot in a way that would make auction houses Southeby's and Christie's salivate.Although much of the story is a bit exaggerated and doesn't always ring of true history, this is still a very enjoyable film about a subject which has had much less screen-time devoted to it than other subjects of World War II, at least in the United States. (Europe has been all too aware of the devastation of its art at the hands of the Nazis.) Aspects of ""the Monuments Men"" recall the rather idealized films of the late 1950's and early 1960's, such as ""the Great Escape"" and ""the Longest Day"". (The music soundtrack seems inspired by such films with one passage using a whistle and piccolo to intone its patriotic melody, similar to the Great Escape). Not quite a great film, but a good one.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Worst message ever,"This is the worst message I ever received from a movie.I've myself not seen any ""great"" art in Venice, Rome, Paris, wherever.I've seen some art that I deemed magnificent and beautiful.I would gladly not have seen any of that, if it would have made a single young (wo)man (wherever in the world) live a happy life.Maybe I should see Paris, but I have some doubts....

A Decidedly Late Review,"I saw this movie in theaters; that was now a decade ago. While I have forgotten virtually all aspects of this movie, I do remember that my poor recollection is due mostly to the yearning I felt for a good night's sleep. This is one of the most tedious viewing experiences of my life. I was lured by the ensemble, but lord, did they have nothing to do! Someone in Hollywood felt that the story deserved a bid on the big screen, and maybe that's true. But no one with a vision was involved in its production, and if the movie made a statement, it left no impact. I will watch this movie again if I ever develop insomnia.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Monumental Disappointment,"What a waste of talent, great potential of a story that should be told, with great actors, but lousy composition, script and directing. Certainly one of George Clooney's big flops. This needs to be re-made better. While it's based on true events, it really is a bit like the typical American/John Wayne movies, they are the good guys, out to 'save the world' and it's art from the Germans as well as the Russians (But lets not worry about the Thieving British and the Parthenon Marbles still in the British Museum). Great idea, but the storyline as depicted in the movie is rather disjoint and ridiculous: and very likely an embellished Hollywood account of actual events. A team of 8 scholars and museum curators, get some basic military training (and lets not worry about passing the army medical, or if some were close to retirement age) and are sent into enemy territory to track-down, identify and retrieve great works of art. Now if they were all given the rank of Major or above, they may have had better luck and support from their own forces, or better still assigned with a dozen 'real' soldiers to assist and protect them when they do encounter the enemy. As a movie it's all over the place, nothing really holds it together, just repetitive melodrama spread across about half a dozen missions. But it does make you think about the value of a life vs art, especially the difference between that of a German vs American soldier's life.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Terrible,"For a movie with such good actors, this was surely a big disappointment! What a huge waste of talent! What a waste of time watching it! I expected much more from a film with such big names. I think the basis of the film, the book,would have been such a rich source of data for the book. Somehow this did not translate when the film was made. To me, it seemed that a group of good actor - buddies got together and decided they could make a movie starting themselves . It was self promoting and shallow. I'm sure there was much more to this story than what was shown in the film. Certainly far from being their best work!",,Anonymous,History

562nd Review - Tells a tale but not as film,"Fascinating tale, great cast. Seriously one of the most interesting stories of WWII. And yet TMM is instantly forgettable. Why? Well, having spent some time thinking about its merits and faults I would say it points the camera and shoots in a way that disengages rather than involves and it doesn't really allow its actors to be more than predictable and above all the script is frankly, dull - it focuses when the viewer wants more scale, and diminishes the small stuff - it is frankly not good enough.This combination of a very straight camera style, and lack of cinematography - lighting in particularly is very straightforward - with no sense of vision for the acting makes for a very decent, even noble, but dull film. It's fault is, honestly, it is mainly bland: bland camera, bland acting, and above all, bland script.Only Cate Blanchett seems to bring some depth - everyone else has turned up and given their all but it doesn't translate. What we get is moderately exciting or interesting - and given the amazing story it really should be more.One wished this film could have been as good as the plot deserves - it is certainly watchable - but it's not the film it could have been. As you can probably tell this viewer had been really looking forward to this one, and was monumentally disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,History

It puts most modern action films to shame.Good ensemble cast, good story and I thought a decent script. Certainly not the catastrophe many others here say. Give it a go, it's worth watching.Reading the reviews, I can only think other people were seeking the boys' own heroics of Kelly's Heroes or The Guns of Navarone.

The Monuments Men falls short,"Frank Stokes (George Clooney) puts together a rag tag group to try to save precious art from from being destroyed by the Nazi's.The Monuments Men is George Clooney's sixth try at directing. Clooney wrote, produced, directed and stared in Monuments Men. To say the least, this movie is his baby. The cast is great for any movie, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, Kate Blanchett, John Goodman, just to name a few. A real powerhouse cast. Sadly to say this doesn't help the movie in any way. The acting is very dry and almost every scene is lined up for a one line punch line in the end that just falls short. I kept hoping for the action to pick up in some way but it just never does. It's a very slow movie. There are some funny moments and the locations are great. George Clooney couldn't direct himself in this movie and that is why his performance is the only one that doesn't come across as dry.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Starting from the silly music that made me feel like watching a Police Academy movie to the stupid situations taking place in the destroyed Europe at the end of the World War II...really?

The Monumental Failure,"The Monuments Men, was arguably the most anticipated movie of 2013, and this was no surprise due to the star studded cast of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville, and Cate Blanchett. With George Clooney also directing and having part of writing the film, built up a lot of hype. However with it being the most anticipated film of 2013, I also believe it to be the most disappointing film of 2014... the script is hugely flawed, whilst it does somewhat keep the audience engaged with a few one-liners and witty character interactions, it leaves the characters to become hugely one dimensional. After leaving the cinema, I struggled to remember any of the character names and most of the characters themselves were easily forgotten. After watching the movie, wait an hour and you will see my point.It seemed as though George Clooney had watched hours upon hours of World War 2 movies prior to directing this film for ideas to incorporate into Monuments Men, it's as though he saw cigarettes to be the biggest generic convention and packed Monuments Men absolutely full of smoking, turning it into a 2 hour cigarette advertisement. It is clear to me that George Clooney is not cut out for writing or directing. The film glorifies America's 'dominance' of the war with the only non Americans in the team dying not so far in. The two of whom were incredibly clichéd, with Jean Dujardin wearing a beret and scarf throughout.As the team ventured across Europe, over various front lines, they experienced the most minimal of obstacles almost completely taking away the action aspect of the film which is so vital to a War genre film. Due to this, it became possibly the most simplest of heists ever portrayed, they even knew exactly where to look. This completely lost it's focus on the true story which became far from how it was portrayed by Clooney.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Entertaining account of a mostly forgotten part of World War II,"I don't get why so many people are trashing this movie. I found it to be an entertaining (if not completely factual) account of a mostly forgotten part of World War II. I actually got teary eyed several times during this movie because I felt for the characters and the situations they found themselves in. I feel that the actors brought authenticity to this film about ""normal"" people faced with the extraordinary task of preserving the art and culture of most of Europe. I was appalled by the fact that so much artwork was destroyed by the Nazi's and as someone who feels relatively well-informed I was surprised to find out that I knew very little about this aspect of the war.

A real let-down.,"I really looked forward to seeing this Film, and regret to say that it was a large disappointment. The story (purported to be true, but clearly over the top!) was poorly scripted, with far too much relying on clever quips, the actors tried to make this believable, but when saddled with some outrageous scenes like the one with the horse, reality went out the window. The best acting came from Cate Blanchett and Hugh Bonneville (so far from Downton Abbey), while Matt Damonseemed to be missing in 75% of the story. It also appeared as if the Cigarette companies sponsored the Movie. There is no question that it will make money, due solely to the names of the Stars, but it certainly misses out in true entertainment and interest.",5.0,Anonymous,History
The Not-So-Monumental Men,"Originally, The Monuments Men was supposed to come out during December so it would be in prime position for Awards Season, unfortunately there was something wrong with the special effects and it was pushed back to February, after the deadline for the Oscars and in the midst of ""dump month."" It was greeted with not so good reviews, most of them got it pretty right, but it wasn't all that bad.The Monuments Men is not the best movie of the year, far from it. George Clooney, who wrote, directed, produced, and starred in it does a decent enough job at adapting the 512 page book into a movie that is less than 2 hours. The acting is good, nobody really stands out among the star studded cast that includes Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, and Cate Blanchett, because well, there isn't a whole lot for them to do. The comedy works well at times, with Matt Damon rattling off some of the movies funniest quips, while Bill Murray does his usual thing as well.For those of you who don't know what this movie is about; it is the story of a group of artists, architects, and other people involved in the art community who set off for Europe to recover the art that Germany has stolen and is likely to either destroy or display in Hitler's dream museum once he wins the war. It is a race against time, for while the Allies are heading east, inadvertently destroying buildings and artworks in their path, the Germans are hiding away and destroying the art on purpose. Yet the movies biggest problem is it never feels like there's anything to really be concerned about, it never feels like the race against time the trailers and even the actors in the movie say it is. Most of the film focuses on our characters sitting around and talking about home, or Matt Damon flirting with Cate Blanchett, or in one scene Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, and some random German soldier just sit on the ground and smoke a cigarette. There is no sense of urgency, no real concern about what they are actually there for.But for as many times as George Clooney can talk about ""saving the culture"" or whatever his line is that he spews at least half a dozen times, we do not see a whole lot of art saving until the last third of the film. We are beat over the head with this message about trying to race against time to save where we come from, but for the most part, it's just a whole lot of sitting around waiting for something to happen.Now, I have read the book that is the basis for this movie, and I feel it would have stood far stronger as a miniseries. The book is even set into 5 different parts that could have each served as an episode. But, George Clooney tried so hard to pack everything into one short movie that we feel we are missing out on some of the action.The movie is very entertaining for the most part, but it would not be correct to say that it is a nail-biting race to the end in order to save these ""monuments."" It does have its moments that remind us what these people were fighting for, but it also leaves us wanting more. Hopefully this story can be revisited in the future and given the proper attention that this grand and epic story deserves, for what we get is a watered down and condensed version of what is and could be a truly great tale.For more of my reviews, check out ragingfilm.com",,Anonymous,History
How did this happen?!,"What went wrong? Good story. Great cast. Good director. Good title. It should be monumental right? Everyone was anticipating it highly. Everyone was expecting it to be a big Oscar contender. However, it's safe to say the Oscars will stay far away from it. It may even get a few razzie nominations. A great cast try to save important art from the Nazis. It's based on a very interesting true story, and George Clooney's previous films as a director were well received. Some things in the movie world just can't be explained. This isn't a completely unforgivable movie. Cate Blanchett does a good job, and the actors aren't necessarily awful. It's a good story, so there's a certain level of interest to be had while watching it. There are some good looking bits and it gets a little better as it progresses once things actually start to happen. However, I cannot be expected to wait 70 minutes for the first act to end. The truth is, The Monuments Men is like waiting for a bus which never shows up for 118 minutes.Despite it's great cast and good story TMM ruthlessly and cruelly wastes its potential with a movie so boring it feels like a parody of boring movies. It trudges along with a snail's pace and makes The Tree Of Life look like a John Woo action epic. The script is as bland as they come, and barely anything happens. The jokes feel stiff and awkward, the attempts at excitement provoke no kind of reaction and the storyline just drags on. There's almost nothing interesting about this movie at all. I didn't care about anything and the fact that much of it was juggling 4 different sets of events in 4 different places, my attention was lost early on. It's got a good soundtrack but that's about it. The trailers looked promising and they were good because despite the lack of exciting stuff in the trailers at least we didn't know everything that happens. That's because nothing much really happens and there wasn't a lot to show.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,History
an important story rendered without emotion or angst,"Sometimes you can assemble the best actors for a movie, and it just won't work. In this case it seems like the only thing that keeps you engaged at all is the fact that such talented actors are involved. But the performances are without any drama or convincing emotional weight. It's like everyone is completely immune to getting excited about anything at all. Sad scenes don't convey sadness, happy scenes likewise do not convey happy emotions really, and all of the characters are one dimensional. The only exception is the performance of Kate Blanchett, who is subtly convincing as a french art scholar with insider info on what the Nazis did with the stolen art. Even still though, she seems unmoved by imminent possibility of death when an officer fires repeatedly at her and it just doesn't seem reasonable. Everyone's just too damned even tempered, patient and considerate about everything. No dramatic tension is created in the ensuing plot really, but one knows the story is real and huge in its full meaning. We all wanted to hear the story of these heroes of ""culture preservation"", and indeed the story is remarkable, but the presentation of it in this flick leaves a great deal to be desired.",4.0,Anonymous,History

From a movie filming perspective I thought the action scenes were filmed well, and there wasn't any shoddy animation which is duly appreciated. There aren't any sexual scenes, which is highly appreciated, nor unnecessarily bloody scenes either.

No Masterpiece,"Have you ever had that feeling that something is terribly wrong, but you cannot put your finger on it? You analyze it, try to find the reason, and end up like a marble statue of indecision. That's how I felt with The Monuments Men.As far as the storyline, I had no idea that Hitler amassed such a monumental collection of the world's masterpieces while conquering Europe. When I initially saw the trailer for the movie, I thought it would be an interesting flick of war intrigue. To my horror, about half way through I kept fiddling with the stop button on my TV wanting to escape.I cannot put my finger on any one thing as to why this movie doesn't work. Since George Clooney and Matt Damon star in the film, maybe I was hoping for a WWII version of Oceans 11 where the gang steals back valuable artwork from the bad guys. There are great actors, but mediocre performances. Even George Clooney had little spark, like the landmine that barely blows in one scene.The film lacks conflict and intrigue. The only thing that did ruffle my feathers were the Germans stealing, stashing,and destroying the masterpieces from great artists. As the war is ending, The Monuments Men take on the task of finding, salvaging, and returning the stolen treasures.Of course, there are undertones of more being destroyed than art. There is the terrible confiscation of Jewish property, even down to barrels full of gold fillings taken from the mouths of victims. It is a sobering reminder that more than art had been lost during the war, and perhaps we should care about human lives rather than a Rembrandt.Nevertheless, it is true that our greatest achievements as human beings should be preserved. Hitler wanted to conquer more than land and human beings, he wanted to conquer and own all of the art created by master artists of centuries past. Two men gave up their lives to preserve and reclaim the artwork. The only question left for the audience to ponder, is whether the price of a human life is worth the preservation of a Rembrandt.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Not Quite So Monumental,"As if you didn't have enough ammunition to despise Adolf Hitler, The Monuments Men exposes the Nazis' additional goals to eradicate the precious artworks of the world, essentially erasing the history and legacies of many. In this fictionalized recount, Frank Stokes (played by George Clooney) assembles an inexperienced crew of cohorts to take back these most prized paintings, sculptures, and whatnot from the Nazis and return them to their rightful owners. What basically teases a remarkable cast- comprising your favorite actors/comedians- only reveals itself to be a broken promise. What it is is the year's first major disappointment since I could honestly find very few redeeming qualities in its content, if any at all.Most of the cast (from the likes of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Cate Blanchett, and more) are just playing themselves, and even then, a lot of them are severely underrepresented and aren't given the proper amount of time to shine. Specifically, I have no idea who chose to cast Cate Blanchett as a Frenchwoman- wildly unconvincing, especially considering her inconsistent accent. This might feel somewhat like a digression, but I am immensely irritated by Hollywood's overt reliance on either British or American actors. Was it too difficult to find a French actress to play that role? We've got Marion Cotillard, Juliette Binoche, Julie Delpy, Bérénice Bejo- case in point: an abundance of highly talented French actresses you could've effortlessly fit into that role, but nope, apparently, Hollywood requires for every other European nationality- from Russians to the French- to be portrayed by British or American actors because they're ""Oscar winners and they can probably play anything,"" right?Anyways, back to the film itself, we could've easily had a plethora of memorable interactions, comedic or dramatic, but too much time is wasted on flat jokes and unnecessary, insipid dialogue- too much dwelling on the characters' personal lives and pasts that unfortunately adds nothing to their complexity (there is none). Most importantly, the film loses quite a bit of intrigue and appeal with every passing minute; it's definitely not as engaging and entertaining as it had the potential to be. Simply put, it's terribly dragged out and the ending is fairly anti-climactic. A considerable portion of the film is largely uneventful. I mean, what are they even exactly doing for the first hour and a half? During this catastrophic and traumatizing period, the characters have an amusing time walking around and chatting, but there's absolutely no hint of progress until the very last quarter of the narrative. It's a whole lot of exposition that leads to an embarrassingly unsatisfying climax.As I was saying, the picture is pervaded by humor but to an excessive and unrestrained extent, which only lends itself to failure since the majority of the jokes fall flat (a few effectively deliver, and even those are eventually played out). There were a few scenes that finally unraveled with the right emotional or thematic impact, but those were very, very few and far between. The premise had my attention but again the movie slaughtered its potential even if it put in some effort. All in all, The Monuments Men was George Clooney's first directorial (transparent) dud that's acutely forgettable and surprisingly void of any entertainment. I would've much rather settled for a documentary to delineate this fascinating historical event.",,Anonymous,History
"Promising start, poor execution","The trailers are the main reason I decided to watch this movie. For roughly the first 40 minutes have great build up and nice witty humor which is to be expected with this cast. I love how we got to see multiple stories and emotions through each character's routes in the mission, but that didn't really help with how insanely boring it got later on. There's this charm to the movie (probably the cast), that made me want to finish the movie no matter what, but I couldn't just focus on the movie itself. You don't even need to watch the movie most of the time, you could probably just listen to the whole movie dialogue and not miss anything important. I don't care about it being historically accurate or not, just poor execution ESPECIALLY when you have all of these gems at your disposal.",5.0,Anonymous,History

George Clooney directed this movie and there's obviously tons of opportunity there for a great story and film even without the amazing abundance of great acting talent at his disposal, including not just himself but Matt Damon, Bill Murray and John Goodman and several others. The story is built around them attempting to steal back priceless works of art from the Nazis, it sounds amazing and should have been but sadly it just comes off as a pretty average movie.

Try hard attempt at a true story.,"If only the monuments men could get past telling us what it was trying to be, it might have had a chance to tell us a good story.
the reality of the premise behind the monuments men is that this would have been an easy tale for anyone to tell, and one that most would have enjoyed. A bunch of senior art experts go after art stolen by the axis forces during WWII. Dare I say it the film could have followed anyone of the individual stories of any of the members of the MFAA and been much better for it, but pulling in a big cast, and following all the 7 members, monuments men finds itself to spread out to find the time to tell a good story, as a viewer I couldn't tell what period in history I was sat in nor what location, so building up my own mental picture wasn't possible. Toward the end the cast do come together (well all the Americans anyway) but at this point I was frustrated and disenfranchised. I would have given the film a lower mark but the cinematography and the sheer scale of locations and sets used, means that, someone at least, worked really hard.
Those looking for historical accuracy might find that in the title ad the general overview, but little more, names are changed locations on maps aren't really real, even the history behind some aspects of the film have been modified for the audience, when in reality they just needed to tell the truth, and it would have been a better film.
Next time someone in Hollywood is looking for a good story, they might like to consult the biography of one Albrecht Gaiswinkler. Who spent most of his pre war years as opposed to the Nazis in Austria. Deserted the Wehrmacht during the war and then was airdropped back into Austria by the allies to protect the art hidden within the altaussee salt mine, for 5 months and with help from 300 locals, he protected the valuable art from being destroyed by the Germans whilst maintaining and active resistance within the town and villages surrounding the area.

Interesting war drama of little known MFAA,"""The Monuments Men"" is based on real events of a special unit during World War II, and the men who served in the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives (MFAA) section. The characters are fictitious. But George Clooney and Grant Heslov did a fine job of making the characters composites from several of the real men who served in the MFAA. Two books by Robert M. Edsel served as the main source for the screenplay. The first was ""Rescuing Da Vinci: Hitler and the Nazis Stole Europe's Great Art – America and Her Allies Recovered It,"" in 2006. The second was a 2010 book, ""The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History.""All aspects of this movie are excellent. Some reviewers don't think the humor fits. Others think the movie is slow or boring. But for most movie buffs who have broad interests and curiosity, this film is a winner. The casting was very good, and I think the humor fits nicely. It compliments the seriousness and dangers of the mission, the obvious respect and love for art of the main characters, their willingness to risk their lives to save precious art works, and their awe at finding specific pieces and caches of great works.For a non-combat unit, the MFAA team has a good amount of action, suspense and intrigue. The reproductions of art pieces are excellent. Surely, some shots must have been of the actual works. Two of the 345 men of the MFAA were killed during the war – an Englishman and a Frenchman. In the film, two such fictitious characters are killed. The first MFAA unit broke down into pairs to scout various suspected or reported art caches. The movie also shows this. All told, the MFAA sought out and searched more than 1,000 treasure trove sites that contained more than 5 million pieces of stolen art.One of the MFAA characters in the movie comes close to a real WW II member. James Granger, played by Matt Damon, closely resembles Capt. James Rorimer, a curator of the NY Metropolitan Museum of Art. In the movie, he is recruited directly from his civilian position. In reality, Rorimer had signed up as an American infantryman in 1943, and was sought out and given a commission to be one of the original members of the MFAA. He met Rose Valland, whose character in the film resembles that of Claire Simone, played by Cate Blanchett. Rorimer later was promoted to chief of the MFAA section of the Seventh Army, and was in charge of seizing the art collections of both Herman Göring and Josef Goebbels. After the war, he returned to the Met where he later served as director for 11 years until his death in 1966.On the official Web site of the Monuments Men (www.monumentsmen.com), I found several other members who identified in part with the characters in the film. One was Capt. Deane Keller, a 5th U.S. Army MFAA officer from 1944 to 1946 in Italy. He served for 40 years as a Yale art professor after the war. The bios of different members place them at some of the major treasure trove sites in the film.The movie has a scene at Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, where more than 6,000 works of art were recovered. Another is at Berchtesgaden, Germany – site of Hitler's ""Eagle's Nest."" The 101st Airborne Division first reached there and found more than 1,000 paintings and sculptures stolen by Göring. Other scenes are in salt mines and caves where huge caches of art works were hidden. Merkers, Germany, and Altaussee, Austria, were among these. The latter had 6,500 paintings alone. It also had the two major works from Belgium that were covered at length in the movie. Michelangelo's sculpture, the Madonna of Bruges was found there, as was Jan van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece that was stolen from Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent.From the time the MFAA was established in 1944 under the Civil Affairs and Military Government section of the U.S. Army, a total of 345 men served in the section. They came from 13 nations. The U.S. had 216, England had 58, France had 23, 20 were from Austria, and 11 were from The Netherlands. The rest were from other countries including Belgium, Poland, New Zealand, Spain and Russia.Not all who served in the MFAA were curators, museum staffers, artists, teachers or architects – as are the characters in the film. Many were men who were just interested in the assignment, and who were transferred from other positions of active duty in Europe at the time. This was in the waning months of the war and the year after the war's end. But, the earliest members – those who did much of the searching and recovery efforts during hostilities, included some men who were recruited from civilian life and who had art and cultural backgrounds.The MFAA was disbanded in 1946, but a small group of about 60 art detectives continued to search for stolen art works for another six years. For all the great works and many millions of individual art pieces recovered by the MFAA, a sizable number of great works remains missing. Most are assumed to have been destroyed by the Germans. The movie has a scene with Germans burning a huge cache of paintings, including Raphael's Portrait of a Young Man. It was stolen by the Nazis from Poland, and is considered by many to be the most valuable of all art works yet lost from the war. A report in 2012 that it had resurfaced was a hoax.The MFAA wasn't just a sudden brainchild of someone during the war. Its roots go back to two lay organizations before the war. Anyone interested in more of the fascinating history of this program will find it on various sites on the Web.",9.0,Anonymous,History
What a pathetic sellout of an important book,"How very sad I am after finally watching this highly anticipated movie. I recently read the book, and while the story is a bit dry it's simultaneously huge in stature, an overlooked historical chapter of WWII, and a moving philosophical insight that has permanently changed my perspective on the importance of art to humanity.George Clooney, for shame. This movie is a complete bastardization of the true story, what did you do, just read the cliff notes and wing it? Most of what was portrayed in the movie didn't happen. This is not a comedy. You changed everyone's names so you could make their characters more interesting? So you could give them a drinking problem? Add a bit of sex scandal? Outrageous.This movie is an embarrassment to history, to the men who personify this story, and to the book it claims to be based on. I will only commend the making of this film in the attempt to bring the story to a wider audience, to that I say ""bravo"", but I am very sad at the resulting product.",4.0,Anonymous,History

'It was the greatest art heist in history',"Something went wrong in transforming history onto the big screen. Based on a book by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter and adapted for the screen by director George Clooney and Grant Heslov, this true story gets all Hallmarky despite the theme and a fine cast. The problem is that the mystery has been removed and in its place are series of actor shots paying homage to the real monuments men of history. As a result we really don't get to know about any of them and the mission becomes a game, a dangerous and courageous at times game, but a game nevertheless.Based on the premise of Clooney's character Frank Stokes, 'You can wipe out an entire generation, you can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still find their way back. But if you destroy their history, you destroy their achievements and it's as if they never existed. That's what Hitler wants and that's exactly what we are fighting for' the film concerns the gathering of a groups of arts oriented men to rescue art masterpieces from Nazi thieves following WW II and return them to their owners. It is based a true story The Monuments Men is 'an action drama focusing on an unlikely World War II platoon, tasked by FDR with going into Germany to rescue artistic masterpieces from Nazi thieves and returning them to their rightful owners. It would be an impossible mission: with the art trapped behind enemy lines, and with the German army under orders to destroy everything as the Reich fell, how could these guys - seven museum directors, curators, and art historians, all more familiar with Michelangelo than the M-1 - possibly hope to succeed? But as the Monuments Men, as they were called, found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of 1000 years of culture, they would risk their lives to protect and defend mankind's greatest achievements.' The hoopla from Sony so states.The cast includes George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban and Hugh Bonneville as the disparate rescue squad. The best performance in the film is Cate Blanchett's well considered role as Clara Simone, the only one who seems to have an original idea in her mind. Dimitri Leonidas impresses in a small but significant role of a Jew who stays in company with the Monuments Men. It could have been written better and acted with more commitment, but as a movie it is good entertainment.",5.0,Anonymous,History

This year already had The book thief to 'beat the dead horse' (so to speak), and I for one was delighted that Hollywood took the time to tell a different story of the war (that didn't involve a Marvel character)!Art, Architecture, Literature- these are the things that define not only people but era's, these are the things that outlive 'victors of war'. Appreciate the movie for what it is- a delightful introduction for a book today's generation that may never even have considered picking up to read in the first place!",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Monument's Men is not monumental,"""The Monument's Men"" feels almost like a heist movie set during WWII. A group of ""art collectors"" are recruited to steal back valuable art pieces that the Nazis have absconded from invaded countries. These individuals are called ""The Monument's Men"" hence the title. A-list actors play these men: John Goodman, Matt Damon, George Clooney, Jean Dujardin, Bill Murray, Bill Balaban, and Hugh Bonneville. Based on a true story, this film seems like a fun one to watch. The trailers played it out as a comedy thriller with spurts of action. However, in watching it, the film is anything but that.Also in the director and writer's chair, Clooney takes the approach of seriousness, dates, and a timeline of facts. The focus is more on how the art pieces are found rather than the individuals who achieved these actions. In this regard, the movie wanders from one event to another, without giving the audience enough flamboyant characters. I relish that Clooney has made a WWII picture, but it is dull. I love all the actors in this film, but they don't do a thing here in entertainment. Clooney and Damon are bland. Goodman and Dujardin are incredibly limited. Murray tries to act serious, but just looks sleepy. Balaban has the only energy present as the mousy private. A misleading trailer and cast simply going through the motions kills it. In an attempt to add an emotional impact, there is a scene where a Christmas song plays at a military base where soldiers are wounded and dying. What could have been an engaging moment delivers as a failed method of moving the audience.Alexandre Desplat's score is meant to be moving but feels shallow and hokey. The rest of the movie runs into this problem. I want to take it seriously, but I can't. How the monument's men searched and found the art pieces is the only thing that keep this movie going. This was enough for me to sit through it. I really wanted to like the movie. The Monument's Men is not monumentalit is average. Nick Clooney gets a good cameo at the end by the way.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Dreadfully slow and very forgettable,"Good actors, but it's not clear why they need them in this movie. I'm typing this as I watch the movie, at this point about half way through I have no faith that it will get any better. I really had high hopes for this movie. My son saw it with some friends when it came out and I asked him what he thought, he paused and then mustered an it was OK, but I think that was more so as to convince himself he did not waste his money or time with his friends as they were so eagerly awaiting it. I've spent more time working on my computer than focusing on this movie because it's that boring. I'm debating just shutting it off, but I hate not completing a movie once started. There is a scene were they are playing have a merry little Christmas and different people are focused on, their faces are intense as they listen, the scene is suppose to invoke some deeper feeling, some deeper meaning, but it's just so lost that at that point more than any so far I was tempted to just turn it off. I really wanted to like this movie, but it's a mess, lacking focus, lacking passion, great actors wasting their time and not having to really try much. Too bad.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Underrated. I think some people missed the point.,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. After the not-so-great reception it got I was expecting a failure. I think most people expected a war movie of the traditional kind.However... I couldn't really pin-down a failure anywhere. Let me explain why.Like other successful war movies The Monuments Men does a good job of painting war-torn Europe as a cold and dreary place where people are trying to hang on to any tiny thread of sanity and normalcy they can grasp before it all goes to hell. It makes you think about war and why mankind does what it does.The thing that struck me the most about this movie was the polarizing nature of War vs. Culture. The subtlety behind the screenplay is rather unique, imo.This war in particular was about many things. Hitler not only attempted to annihilate a people... but he also attempted to steal every shred of precious art he could get his hands on. The MM were tasked with stopping that. How could anyone who read a synopsis or watched a trailer for this movie think it was supposed to be anything different?I'm a better person for having watched this movie. I never knew about these guys and that was the point. I hope Clooney continues to make screenplays and movies that revolve around such selfless people as the MM... and never stops trying to inspire us with stories of such import.This isn't Saving Private Ryan... or Band of Brothers... it's not about Soldiers. It's about a group of ordinary art lovers who task themselves with rescuing history and in doing so BECOME soldiers.I loved this movie. I thought some more could have gone into the recruitment process... and maybe a little bit more could have gone into Cate Blanchett's part... but overall I enjoyed all of it.8 of 10 for me...",8.0,Anonymous,History
if you wish to waste some of your precious time,"If is very unusual for me to give up on a film before the end, even though afterwards I might feel that I have wasted my time. But this film is exceptional. I have never experienced such a waste of opportunities. A good - true - story, good caste of experienced actors, and the potential for some action, as well as some photogenic scenes, should have led to a reasonable film. It fails because it is badly written and badly directed. It is also poorly conceived - a comedy drama on such topic!On a side note, there is a lot of confusion about Nazi art, in this film and more generally. The Germans both bought and stole art, from Jew and non-Jew. The treatment of artworks at the end of the war didn't always clearly distinguish between these different categories. There was a notorious incident in which the real Monuments Men resisted orders from their military superiors to send several hundred works of art to the USA, as war spoils. Unfortunately, although the western Allies, generally behaved responsibly, the Soviets stole what they wanted. Even today, many of those people who lost art to the Germans and then to the Soviets are still waiting for the return of their property. I won't touch on the theft of land and houses by the Communists after the war.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball called, they want the music from Yours, Mine, and Ours back. With that being said, it held my attention and wasn't the complete borefest others have attested to.

Its about people trying to make good in a war, or better; people trying to reverse some of the bad that war brings.Its not your standard American film going from plotpoint to plotpoint but more of an European film going from scene to scene, and the actors are great.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Mischaracterized characters,"Reviewers refer to the team of art rescuers in ""The Monuments Men"" as ""charmingly quirky crew,"" and ""misfits."" Such descriptions may well describe the characters in the film version of this operation; but they misrepresent the authentic assemblage of talented men whose job it was to rescue the stolen art treasures of Europe by the Nazis, and to prevent further pillaging. George Clooney tried matching his directorial talents to his artistic ego, and failed. Perhaps Clooney gets an A for effort and for his heart being in the right place. And perhaps ""The Monuments Men"" is an enjoyable movie for some or for many; but it is a poor portrayal of serious persons as entertaining pantomimes. A problem shared by many that exist in the insularity of Hollywood is a breakdown along the lines that separate reality from entertainment. Moviegoers tend to be less-and-less patient with reading and less-and-less finical about authenticity. Even the wading through title of Robert M. Edsel's non-fiction work, ""The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History and Saving Italy: The Race to Rescue a Nation's Treasures from the Nazis,"" they would find exhausting. By this, Clooney's undertaking will survive; but not nearly as well as the treasures at the center of this story.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"great premise, lackluster treatment","A galaxy of stars in George Clooney, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, John Goodman, and Jean Dujardin. A theme that is epic- war. A villain that a world hates in Hitler. A director known to regularly punch above his weight in Clooney. Seems nothing can go wrong with The Monuments Men. A surefire sleeper hit, and a strong awards contender, is it? Not really. The movie is a prime example of the fact that great ingredients do not necessarily make a great movie.""You can wipe out an entire generation, you can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still find their way back. But if you destroy their history, you destroy their achievements and it's as if they never existed. That's what Hitler wants and that's exactly what we are fighting for""The premise is great, the impact lackluster. Based on a true story, about the greatest treasure hunt in the history of mankind. We remember the Nazis for the holocaust and other war crimes, but something even more sinister was their attempt to steal, and later on as the Reich crumbles, try to destroy over 5 million pieces of art. A rag tag group of art historians and museum curators are asked to save over 1000 years of culture and heritage. Working in war-zones alongside combat units with imminent danger to their lives , this unlikely yet dedicated band of brothers chase down the thieves with an attitude bordering on flippancy.Therein lies The Monuments Men's major weakness. For something based on WW2, the tone of the movie is too casual, and the humor is too liberally spread. Seasoned actors go about their jobs breezily wisecracking in every inch of the film. And there is an attempt at a love angle between Blanchett and Damon. Why not- she is playing a French after all, she has to flirt. But most of the characters remain unfleshed out, and as a result, the movie lacks emotion, even when key character deaths occur or even when the Monalisa is found. To its credit though, the film is technically brilliant.Hitler had grand plans for the booty. He had planned a Fuhrermuseum that would stock all the art of the world. In case this scenario did not unfold, he had ordered the complete destruction of all that the Nazis had stolen. This was known as the Nero Decree. Being a lover of history and art, I cannot but be thankful to those who actually saved it all. But as far as movie goes, the similar themed 1964 Burt Lancaster starrer The Train is the miles better watch- 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
Uninspired,"Though the historical fact, this « Monuments Men » group, is interesting and certainly deserved to be tackled, what Clooney made of it is completely flat and bland. The movie boils down to a succession of totally disjointed, anecdotal short scenes, where protagonists are under developed and coherence nowhere to be found, indeed most of the story lines don't fit together at all and flow in disorderly fashion.

"Far less inspiring than it could have been, the good cast and intention are bogged down by poor screenplay.","It has nice aspiration and strong cast, but the script just isn't up to par. A bit resembling Ocean franchise, George Clooney assembles a squad of intelligent men, not to steal valuable goods, but to preserve artworks from being destroyed at World War II. Contrary to usual war theme movie, The Monuments Men takes a lighter, more humorous view of the brotherhood and their cause. It works moderately in its own way with the interesting concept, although uneven pace, shallow screenplay and feeble dialogue confine the movie in mediocrity.The story takes place in dusk of World War II, just as German was about to be defeated by Allied forces. Since the Nazi has confiscated a large amount of art from its occupation time, not to mention the war's toll on many other unprotected objects, Franks Stoke (George Clooney) inspires to save as many historic legacies as he can. The unit he established consists of museum curators, architects and historians, a very unorthodox squad by any means. In the casualty heavy struggle, their cause may seem trivial, and the movie tries to present this angle even though it may not rise in its fullest.Cast is composed of famous line up, such as Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin, Cate Blanchett and more. Each contributes in their own way as one only has a couple of fervid scenes. Cate Blanchett delivers the most somber role of the somewhat light-hearted movie, she displays a cynical unyielding will and probably would fit in more intense direction. Bill Murray and John Goodman as veterans give a comedic side as they're aware they might not be soldier material, but they offer vivid reaction when faced with mortality. Jean Dujardin in the few scenes he's in manages to be suave and persistently spirited.The most unfortunate thing is the screenplay doesn't allow the talented cast to reach their best potential. Dialogues sound tedious, stiff and frankly inauthentic. Pacing is monotonous, the unit splits into different teams and it's meant as an effort across the war torn Europe, but it never manages to create an intertwined flow. The pace feels fragmented as there's barely any consistency to string everything together. Its dramatic moments mostly seem dull and humor is unsuccessful at times.There are some good scenes here, although they are brief and numbered in only a few stretched across the two hours movie. Ironically, the above average length can't form a compellingly structured plot because the content is sparsely divided the many characters. More than half of the movie is spent on comedy, sadly the jokes are stale, and they don't amount to much laughter or enjoyment. Aside from these short-lived moments of fascination, the movie is mundane.The Monuments Men is based on cultural achievement, a good intention by George Clooney and it's presented in easily accessible fashion. However, the pace, direction and screenplay are subpar, making the movie muddled and far less inspiring than it could have been.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Monumental Snooze Fest,"I was really looking forward to this film, as it's based on actual events that seemed interesting and appealing. What a disappointment!This flick is so hopelessly slow and boring that we only made it through the first 45 minutes or so. By then, we were all falling asleep ... at 2:00 in the afternoon. Fortunately, we rented the movie for only $1.28 and didn't suffer a major financial loss.It must take exceptional talent to combine such an intriguing story with a killer cast and end up with a total waste of film. The acting is so low key that Clooney and Damon both seem to be hooked on Valium. Plus, if there's a war going on, it's hard to tell. The cast spends most of their time sitting amidst rubble but rarely do you hear gunshots.If you spend more than $1.28 to see this boring mess, then you are being foolish.

You can't make us care Clooney.,"George Clooney took (from what brief research I did on the events)an important story and something by the sounds of it is really worth telling and essentially just made OCEANS ELEVEN.

Biggest Disappointment of the year!!!!,"The Monuments Men 2/10- Everything about this movie makes you think that it will be a hit. It has got George Clooney as the director and star, Matt Damon as the other lead, Bill Murray, Jean Dujardin, Cate Blanchett, I mean that cast alone screams this movie will be awesome. Plus, the source material that this movie is based off of is very interesting and definitely deserves to be told. What could go wrong? Everything. Everything went wrong. I do not know how all of these great factors leads to such a terrible movie. The Monuments Men is one of those movies that after twenty minutes of watching, you feel like you have been there for an hour.I will begin with the score. A score is the entire music made for a particular movie. In almost all of the movies I have seen, the music only enhances the viewing experience and adds something special to each individual scene. Then there are these handful of movies I have seen where the music makes each scene worse, the monuments men is unfortunately one of those few. During this movie, there will be this poorly written inspirational speech or emotional scene and someone during this the music will start playing.Even if this speech was the greatest movie speech ever written, the music made for the Monuments Men would have ruined it and would have made you hate speech. To be honest, I have never disliked any music for a particular movie more than this one.Now for the plot. The Monuments Men has a particular interesting plot at first because it cultivates a patriotic World War II theme whilst still maintaining an intellectual background with the artists and sculptors being on the front line. The Trailer makes it look very clear cut, they all go in together and find the art throughout Europe and bring it back to its rightful owners. Everyone that I know was excited for this film just because of the trailer, but sadly that's the only good thing about this movie, the trailer. We saw the only good parts of the plot in the trailer. When the actually movie begins, the audience suddenly realizes right away that is very poorly written movie and the rest of the movie they hope that at least is will get a little better. Nope, somehow it gets progressively worse throughout the entire movie. I do not want to give away any particular details about The Monuments Men if for some reason you want to see this movie after reading this review.Last and definitely least the acting. How can a cast that has one more than five Oscars not deliver an outstanding performance? I have no clue. What did they do differently this time? Why were they so terrible in this film? It is honestly a mystery, but the main suspect is George Clooney who did not show any solid directing skills from this work. I am not going to point out any particular person for bad acting in this film because all of them were just as bad as the next and for some of them it was the worst performances of their career.To sum it all up, bad music, bad plot, and bad acting. This is the first movie that I strongly recommend you do not even see when it comes out on DVD.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",2.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting Movie!,"The Monuments Men is a very interesting movie based off a little-known section of the U.S Army during the Second World War and that is the Monuments Men who were charged with saving valuable pieces of artwork in war-torn Europe. The movie itself wasn't bad, but it had much higher potential. The story and the cast are excellent, but the way the story presented itself was an issue. The screenplay tries to inject comedy into the film, but the this film would have worked better as a serious drama. That being said, I did enjoy the film and it was a highly- involving film based on an important historical study.George Clooney's film is about how a man named Frank Stokes is charged with putting together a team of officers to go to Europe and track down stolen art from the Nazis and return them to their rightful owners.The film has a very stacked cast and each one of their moment to shine. George Clooney of course is great as Frank Stokes, and the same can be said about Matt Damon as Clooney's right-hand man, James Granger. Bill Murray and John Goodman add a little humor to the film. I also liked the casting of Bob Balaban and Cate Blanchett, although I could have used some more scenes involving Cate.Overall, The Monuments Men is the not the greatest war film ever made but it's an important film telling a story about the men who risked their lives to preserve our culture and our history and in that regard, they did a very good job in doing so. The movie works, but its main issue is the loosely-structured screenplay as the film is all over the place. But the acting and production values are top-notch. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great story.  Well made.  Great cast.  Bad script.,"This is a great story. This is also a terrible screenplay. It runs like a filmed first draft. There's no sense of pacing, character and it's completely tone deaf. It's one disconnected scene after another. Some are comical in tone, others are somber, some are sentimental -- this one is a real head scratcher. It's a very well made film, with some great visuals and attention to period detail, but with such a discombobulated script it's a frustrating experience to sit through. Damon and Blanchett randomly meeting each other at an abandoned Jewish home, where he is returning a stolen painting is a contrivance the size of Europe. There are some deaths in the film that barely register as anything more than a reference by other characters - they are so sloppily done and dramatically inert.

Historical event....flushed away by the film,It was a historic event that george cloony set to present in this film but unfortunately this became a poor attempt.The dialogues or writing of interactions were so artificial and mundane that it felt as if there isn't much to watch. It was like all they just want to do is to tell you that this thing happened and then to avoid you getting bored they added unnecessary comedy which again was artificial. No doubt it has beautiful cinematography is a nice attempt but nothing was original.Art is essential and will be historic but one must always remember that its just an object. It will get washed up soon. More important if one enjoys art rather then getting attached to it.

Monuments Men...Very Good Presentation,"The Monuments Men is based on the true story of a great treasure hunt. An unlikely crew of art historians tasked by FDR with going into Germany on a mission to recover artistic masterpieces from Nazi thieves. These men and women were trying to preserve what our civilization is all about and what it means to be human in the midst of horrible atrocities. Appears there was little knowledge of this dedicated group of men and this film is an educational,learning experience that memorializes people who were trying to preserve our culture but more importantly to prevent Hitler from gloating over his evil accomplishments and conquered countries that would only contribute to the inevitable survival of the Nazis.The male actors George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin and Hugh Bonneville did a fine job. Cate Blanchett was a curator at the Lourve,she was equally as impressive. Matt Damon befriended her and she provided them with a general idea of where to look including special identifying markings. They found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of 1000 years of culture,risking their lives to protect and defend mankind's greatest achievements.In one particular scene they find a cave not only brimming with treasures but chilling reminders of the millions of persecuted Jews Hitler had murdered. Their gold teeth, rings and shoes packed in barrels or thrown on the ground. This discovery created a dead silence amongst the men.It makes no sense that this movie was criticized so much. What was really expected from this film? Surely not an action flick, thriller or war movie. Just not enough bloody violence,which seems to be a draw these days.Did Hollywood alter the exact truth,what else is new? An important story that needed to be told about a group of men who risked their lives and deserve our respect.Note: Research states that Millions of art was recovered but much is still outstanding.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Don't Bother,"I was very disappointed with this film. You could pretty much predict most of what happens. Some of it was difficult to follow jumping around in time and location without explanation. I guess a lot footage was left on the cutting room floor. The dialog wasn't very interesting and the plotting sometimes inexplicable -- were the real monuments men as stupid as in some scenes? Even the music was pedestrian. All in all a lousy film. I suppose it could have been worse, but not much.If you want to see a film about saving art in WWII and based to some extent on real events I highly, HIGHLY recommend John Frankenheimer's ""The Train"" starring Burt Lancaster. This is an excellent film that will have you on the edge of your seat or holding your breath all the way through.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Badly Misplaced Humor,"First off, these are the types of movies I love, stories about the unusual events that happened in World War II, especially if they are based on true events. This could have been a great movie about a group of men and one woman who did the extraordinary is saving countess works of art, public and private from ending up in the Fuerher Museum or worse yet being destroyed. This subject matter is serious stuff and is of tremendous interest to those who know art and culture and have an appreciation of it. For some reason, George Clooney decided this should be a quasi-comedy which is dangerous turf when dealing with Nazi themed subject matter, even in the best of hands. Clearly Mr. Clooney might want to stick to acting. Others have already stated the flaws in this movie and I reluctantly have to agree with them. My wife and son felt the same. This was an eagerly awaited movie that proved to be a big disappointment",5.0,Anonymous,History
The Undeveloped Men,"At first sight, everything seems to be going for this film: the concept, the cast, the director, the writers -- even the trailer makes it seem worthwhile. So what went wrong? The writing went wrong.The film does a good job of showing that no matter how great other aspects may be, without good writing you have nothing. With perhaps the exception of Clooney's character, there is little development for many of the other characters. This becomes apparent when certain scenes arise requiring an emotional response, but since we're yet to really get to know them, we feel nothing.If you are wanting to see this film based upon being a fan of one of the featured actors, then you will be disappointed. Bill Murray and John Goodman in particular seem very underused and an overall missed opportunity. There is also very little humour, considering its concept and cast (I understand it's set in Nazi Germany, but that's no excuse).Save the cost of an expensive theater ticket and wait for the rental.",5.0,Anonymous,History

A real let down,This is not a movie I would watch again. After reading the book this is a very disappointment. I believe if this movie was done by the British it would have turned out better and with more realistic acting. Clooney was too stiff in this movie.When compared to the book this movie did not flow well. It seemed to be slow moving and not at all interesting as I was led to believe it would be. Here was a chance to reproduce a bit of history that many people were and are unaware of in an interesting way but it did not turn out as good as it could have.The movie just did not hold my interest well.

"An inspiring true story, but a bit lacklustre in the telling","I always like to see movies based on facts, but this film didn't grip me in the way I thought it would. I found it jumped from location to location and time to time in a confusing way, not helped by lots of khaki (not a feast for the eyes). The characters weren't as engaging as they might have been, but maybe I dozed off when they were being built. I found it rather a sad, dreary, film. The art, central to the whole film, seemed on the periphery. Instead of feeling passionately about the treasures lost (and recovered) and completely championing the project, I found myself wondering if this would ever have commanded the budget in today's military.

"An Uplifting, Historically Informative Movie","Before viewing this film, I hadn't thought much about the endeavor to rescue art works and other treasures stolen by the Nazis.

The tone is mostly upbeat, but it does confront tragedy.Although the setting of the movie is amidst war, the war itself is mostly a backdrop. In this respect, it's comparable to Life is Beautiful (1997), though The Monuments Men is somewhat grittier, and based on real history.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Good for reasons other than drama and plot,"I love history. Not the most dramatic of all films, but very important in its subject matter and in what it teaches us about the history of that time.The United States, despite the cost of WWII, returned the Art and made things right at it's own cost, never asking for reparations. We, the USA, spilled our own blood to save life and history and art. We did it without asking for anything in return. We simply did the right thing.For those who see America as the focus of evil in the modern world, you can all rot in you know where for your support of abject Evil, because siding with those who are against the good is to side with evil.And as for France.

Untold story of WWII,"As a WWII history buff I have seen a heck of a lot of movies of that genre. But this is an intriguing story that to my knowledge has never been told on the big screen. Maybe that's why I could easily overlook some of its flaws and found it thoroughly enjoyable. The horrible reviews kept me from seeing it in the theater, but I think a number of the critics didn't ""get"" what the movie was about. Yes, it's a retro vehicle, but it had a number of clever lines and genuinely tense moments. War is like that — there's humor right alongside death and tragedy.

"An Interesting, Courageous True Story,","The Monuments Men is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a very impressive cast. It's a well acted and dramatic film that also has a lot of nice comedy, it's a really interesting true story about a group of men who put their lives on the line to return artwork to their respective owners. The film also has a lot of heart which I really liked, there's a beautiful scene of Bill Murray listening to a Christmas song that had me in tears, and any scene between Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett develops a very sweet, personal relationship. One thing I thought the movie was lacking was some genuinely intense scenes, for a war film there really aren't any moments that will genuinely have you at the edge of your seat, the plot is certainly slow moving and some well executed scenes that convey the true conflict of this drama would have helped. The film has an outstanding cast that all deliver, Matt Damon shines in what I would consider to be the lead role, George Clooney manages to bring an impressive performance, as well as directing, Cate Blanchett channels Claire Simone perfectly and Bill Murray gives some of his most effective acting in years. Though it may be lacking in intensity, The Monuments Men is a very enjoyable film that is inspired because Clooney clearly wanted this story to be known, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama.A group of soldiers set out to retrieve paintings stolen from the Nazis and return them to their correct location.Best Performance: Cate Blanchett",8.0,Anonymous,History

Again, I think it's just expectations being too high in advance - people are not viewing the movie as it is but ""as it could have been"" which is no way to view anything.

No super heroes here.,"I was dragged kicking and scream to watch this by my girlfriend.I used to like WW2 films, ""Cross of Iron"" and ""A bridge too Far"" were firm favourites growing up.But modern WW2 movies seem dedicated on making really bad versions of ""The Magnificent Seven"". From ""Saving Private Ryan"" to ""Fury"" to ""Red Tails"" it all boils down to our band of heroes having to defend some ridiculous objective against a horde of incompetent, suicidal Nazis.Monument Men is not like that. It tells the story of Allied special agents sent to recover, protect and return works of art.The characters are likable and interesting, and very human. There have been at least a few flourishes of artistic licence (for instance who would go to the effort to design a land mine that explodes when you step off it?)I don't know the true story but this seems believable enough to me and I was gripped right up to the very end.It goes without saying the affects and production are very high quality.

Delightful,"I love movies! I was dismayed to read a less than stellar review of this title as I was looking forward to seeing it.

The script was serious when it had to be and tongue in cheek where it was wanted.......the cast and the acting were marvelous! Now it wasn't a Gandhi or Amadeus......but so what! Thank you Mr Clooney! I just found out I need to write 10 line minimum......why??? Anyway...some of my family were 'heavys' in fine art, antiques, music.......and I can tell you all for a fact....that 'humour' was a great part of the souls of them all.

I suppose each of us if faced with that decision, comes to our own conclusion....but Clooneys contention that ART was/is a 'worthy' undertaking......I concur!

Great War Drama Movie,"Despite the anticipated bloody battles of the WW II, The Monuments Men depicts a rather unexpected soft side of the war. In spite of the inevitable grief and loss that accompany the war, the main characters subtly bring out many humors that enliven this movie. It is understandable that many expected this movie to have more actions, bigger movements, and a faster pace. Yet, this movie seizes my attention until the very end. I find this movie to be oddly gripping, realistic, melancholy, and truthful. The main characters live up to their beliefs and stay unwavered even in menacing environment. Moreover, the camaraderie is brilliantly portrayed and is a sound theme that is ceaselessly reinforced alongside with light humor coming from cute pairings of the characters.",9.0,Anonymous,History

A splended historical effort,"Unlike many of the mainstream critics, I found this movie to be totally entertaining and informative -- a pleasure to view in a big screen theater. The editing and video segues are slick and easy to follow. And the interaction among the cast members makes this a totally enjoyable experience. George Clooney is said to have been despondent about the lack of this film's box office success, even though it turned out fine globally. I can say without equivocation that some films just need to be made, no matter what box office receipts turn out to be. This was one of them.
As the rise of despotism worldwide churns our stomachs, it is imperative that we're never allowed to forget what's at the end of that road. This movie displays it without varnish to try to keep the public focus on vigilance. Clooney, Matt Damon, John Goodman and Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett headline a cast that delivers at every turn.

"True story told as if it's not serious or important, Great cast","Certainly, the story told by The Monuments Men is worth telling and it's easy to see why a luminary like Clooney would be sufficiently attracted to want to direct it. Unfortunately, this treatment, written by Clooney and long-time collaborator Grant Heslov, isn't the best fit. One gets the sense that The Monuments Men might work better as a longer form project. There's simply too much going on to cram into two hours and the end result is a feeling that pieces of the tale are being skipped while others are rushed through. The movie does a good job of illustrating why protecting art from the Nazi scourge was important but it's far less effective fleshing out the personalities of the people who did the protecting.Watch full movie copy and paste http://bit.ly/1glWNUmI loved the premise of this movie, the idea of saving history and art.

It is a shame that most viewers will not know the identity of the heroes (and heroine) that lived this historical drama. I realize that some individuals might have been morphed together into fictional ones to make the story more compact and coherent, and that some details were probably better left out, but to fictionalize people like George Stout, Walter Hancock and Rose Valland was a disservice to the story and the audience.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Take Off The Shroud To Be Enlightened,"As a young ""Army-brat"", I was taken to the Acropolis of Athens in Greece, where I mindlessly viewed the site as a playground full of rubble for the tossing. Some years later, as a freshman needing credits in college, I enrolled in a History of Architecture class and with jaw agape I found myself thoroughly exploring what the Acropolis of Athens epitomized to humankind. Thus, I was enlightened.So, on a recent rainy afternoon, The Monuments Men unfolded on my smaller screen. As I read the movie's logline, it had never occurred to me just how much the world of art may well have lost during World War II. Once again, I was enlightened.The Monuments Men garnered my attention from opening credits, but the more story unfolded it was as if I too were uncovering a fantastic work of art. Yes, Monuments Men is not your typical WWII battlefield endeavor, but with an open mind you can still unearth the dramatic irony in aging art aficionados weaving their way through resistive warzone commands, while trying to get their collective assignments accomplished. Assignments that transitioned into affairs of the courageous heart, all the while leaving the audience with heart-wrenching passages of tragedy.Coming full circle, those same people who suffered through my childish antics on the Acropolis, would have been treated to similar escapades if they had also taken me to see a parched genre akin to The Monuments Men. However, I later realized the reasoning behind why my parents forced me to attend those protracted movies and to visit those tedious ancient sites, as such. Now, I thank my lucky stars they instilled that cultural foundation within me to nurture and I do so every day.To that end, give The Monuments Men its due. The storyline has appeared as a misfire to some, but the acting ensemble, the heroics portrayed, and the curatorial triumphs of perpetuation are very entertaining, let's just say, to those of us with a hint of cultural exposure.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Would Recommend: An Interesting History Lesson,"The Monuments Men brought together a great story with a great cast, but lacked anything else. I believe the only reason someone would watch it is because of either the cast or the story (that is the reason I watched it). Interesting enough to keep my attention throughout the whole movie, but that is only carried by the story which I feel was a pretty safe story not to mess up. Even this adequate portrayal of what happened during this WWII art mission flick was enough to keep me on my seat. I would recommend it to people, but only because, I believe other people would be interested in what happened and possibly to see a stellar cast make you chuckle a bit.I was very impressed with Cate Blanchett's portrayal of a french art curator. I thought her accent was impeccable and her sass and attitude of her character (Claire Simone) was a joy to watch. I felt the other actors performed like characters they had played before, very predictable but I wouldn't say boring. They as were expected, which, for actors of their stature is not bad.Overall this film felt like an interesting history lesson with an unnecessarily overqualified cast. I felt it missed a few of the marks in some of the more emotional scenes and maybe could have upped the stakes a bit in regards to having a more stand out villain. But the story was amazing and even a few days after I have watched it, I still think about it. So I would recommend it, not because it is a great movie, but because it is a great story.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Bill Murray + John Goodman = Success!,"Monuments Men (2014) was a film I had been looking forward to since I saw the trailer earlier this year. I had high hopes for it and, as a whole, I think it delivered.The film is based on the true story of a group of art historians, museum directors and curators who, during World War 2, were tasked to locate, preserve and recover the countless pieces of art stolen by the Nazis. It leads to the most extravagant and dangerous treasure hunt in history as we follow these unlikely heroes as they travel all over the continent retrieving and preserving the culture of war-torn Europe.The first thing that drew me to this film was the cast, and the great array of talent they managed to get in this picture. My favourite comical actor, Bill Murray, gave a 'classic Murray' performance riddled with dry wit and humorous jabs aimed at his comrades. Another favourite comedy actor of mine, John Goodman, played a great role too, delivering some quality lines which had me laughing out loud (literally lol).Everyone else did a great job, especially Cate Blanchett who played her character to perfection, keeping that convincing French accent up throughout is no mean feat and she did it wonderfully. George Clooney and Matt Damon brought their usual talent to the film delivering the high quality performance that we have come to expect from these two.What a lot of critics have picked up on was the direction of the film, they didn't know what it was trying to be. Is it a war film? Drama? Caper? Well I saw it as a film tackling a serious subject in a sometimes comical, sometimes serious way. Whereas this has been a drawback for a lot of critics, I found this to be one of the things I liked about the film.Why must we set out the genre of film in black and white? Why must we say 'this is a war film so it cannot contain any moments of joy, any laughs?' I think what director George Clooney did was brave and I think he pulled it off. It was serious when it needed to be, emotional in parts and funny in others. Solider trying to make light of their situation is something we have seen in films, but with the talents of Murray and Goodman, they managed to pull it off wonderfully.I think what Clooney cleverly did was, knowing he wanted to create some funny moments in a serious story and retain the respect owed to the soldiers who did this, choose his cast carefully. He needed some funny actors, ones that could genuinely make the audience laugh, but he needed it to be subtle, so choosing Murray and Goodman was a stroke of genius. If he would have gone the other route and recruited mainstream comical actors such as Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler or anyone of the like then we would have had another film completely and one which would have failed miserably.So all in all, I think this was a great film. It told a story I had not heard before and showed us World War 2 from a different point of view while raising some very interesting points. You can destroy a population, kill everyone and they will live on in their culture, their art. Allow that to be destroyed and you lose the people.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Someone really has taken the time and effort scouting for the areas to make this film look as true as possible to the 1940s The only issue i could find to this film was the pacing.

A War Movie with Culture !,"Although this is a strange War movie , let me say a number of pro's in favour of George Clooney being a great Director . He has always reminded me of Clark Gable , a great actor from 1925-59 , but he never seemed to reach that potential . So he has filled that niche of screen playboy for the last 25 years . Yet , he has finally shown us that all his movie experience was worthwhile in this superbly directed movie . And I hope to see many more of his directions in the future . Well I personally compared the Monuments Men , with Argo by Ben Affleck who is another actor with excellent directional skills , and seems to be in the same boat here . Now about the movie.. it is an involving story , based on fact , but the real Monuments Men were actually younger than the actors , or certainly seemed to be . George has packed the movie with well known American performers such as his old movie buddy , Matt Damon , along with John Goodman (also in Argo) and Bill Murray . Popular British actor , Hugh Bonneville , and popular French actor , Jean Dujardin , are also in the movie . Cate Blanchett provides an outstanding performance as Claire Simone , the former spy -French Liaison with the Allies . Dimitri Leonidis was also a standout in the movie as Private Epstein , the former German-Jew helping the Monuments team . Other notable appearances were Zahary Baharov as the competitive Russian Commander Elya . Justus von Dohnanyi as the shifty SS Commander , Victor Stahl .

Sounds more like the premise for an documentary, but this turned out to be a rather entertaining flick. This is specially made for people who don't like documentaries, so not for me, but I still liked it a lot.Only downside that it should have gone more inside to the characters and specify even more those actual treasures of art that were saved from Hitler and Stalin. On the other hand then it probably would have turned out more like an documentary which isn't the case with this cast.Why there isn't more of these kind of films? Motion picture is an art form itself, but when even people who live out of movies (critics) don't value it how can you trust their opinions and in this case their reviews? Are their views political or are they just a product of our ignorant time?",9.0,Anonymous,History
Good Movie,I don't know why this movie is so much negatively rated. People should understand that this is not a typical war movie where there is full of blood and action. This is definitely not it. But what it has is the emotions and the importance of other factors which are as much important as killing Enemies.Shows how important the artifacts are. And shows the hard work of men who fought to save them.It has a strong cast who makes the film such a beautiful one.George Cloony and Matt Damon are fantastic. Bill Murray is awesome. Don't trust the negative reviews.I really enjoyed the movie. . Highly recommended if you love a war film with emotional drama.,8.0,Anonymous,History
Basic message without being overly preachy,"The message here, of course, is the value of culture and art as opposed to human lives, but that's putting it simply.Clooney and company make it clear they aren't justifying murder for art's sake, or justifying the deaths of the many people who built the wall of China.A group of middle aged men, experts mostly in art, volunteer during World War II to salvage art stolen by the Nazis, some of it meant to be destroyed, much of it meant initially to be reissued as ""Nazi propaganda"" with the extermination of everyone who would say otherwise, and when the war is nearly lost, obviously meant for use as a fortune stock pile for Nazis to buy their lives with.The volunteers aren't vital to any other effort of the war, and this is what they want to do. They are determined to risk only their own lives, and that is an important cog of this story.The film has poor sound quality, and you need closed captioning, so it's hard to give a high score to, but it is otherwise well directed and written, with the liberties of the facts taken not too extensive. It isn't like the crazy OK Corral stories we have gotten from Hollywood.""Culture"" is not only overrated, as the characters here overrate it, but it is in fact responsible for almost all atrocities. Pol Pot even felt his sadistic Khmer Rouge was his own ""culture"" and ""art"". Should that be salvaged? If Hitler won the war, and exterminated all who questioned him, the very art that was the culture for other people would be the ""art"" and ""culture"" of his Reich, of his Satanic cult of Nazis, virtually the hand picked most demonic of the German people. It would then be heralded as their work, and be their ""culture"". Don't think it couldn't happen.The good news is that the film doesn't preach the point to us, but only states that ""culture"" and ""art"" is that important to the ""monument men"" who risk their lives. This is important to remember.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Great cast...not so much for the plot, but still very smart!","I was kind of expecting lots of action, or a kind of huge/epic type thriller, but I was kind of disappointed with the slow speed and the total lack of suspenseful shots.Great cast, lot's of dialog and was not that witty or even interesting. Like I said the actors are first rate. but are really not used very well. Other people have said that Blanchett gets the show, but there is nothing to really steal from this, however I will say that the fact that Art was part of the plot was very smart.There were also 3 or 4 times where I was thinking that something crazy exciting was going to happen on screen, but the subject and action ended abruptly and the boring and easily dialogue was at it again.I still recommend the experience, since its more of a smart movie with great cast, just don't get fooled by the Army costumes, not much action hence the title.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The most undermined movie of the year - Never trust a Critic with a bag of cynicism,"This is a movie about preserving art at the end of the second world war when the nihilism and anarchy was on its peek by systematically destroying the most precious treasures of mankind. This is definitely not a typical action comedy storyline and sounds more like the premise for an documentary. This is an ""Clooney Style"" flick, nevertheless it is definitely worth to watch and be entertained even more than typical action comedy. This is exactly for viewers who don't like documentaries, so not like myself, but still I enjoyed it a lot.Movie should have gone deeper to the characters and specify more the historical side and the treasures of art that were saved. On the other hand it probably would have turned out more like an documentary which weren't the intention with this cast and production.Why there aren't more of these type of films? Motion picture is an art form itself, so it would be logical that this would be a sacred story for every piece of art in the world.Those who live out of the movie business (like critics) shouldn't get much value for their thoughts. Most of the reviews are envious and cynical with unfair amount of criticism.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"My new role, champion of lame ducks","I certainly didn't ask to become the champion of lame ducks but having been exposed to such diabolical reviews of the 2013 ""Romeo and Juliet"" and now an even worse batch on ""The Monuments Men"" I suppose I shall have to accept the role. For the second time in under a year I find myself completely out of step. It is almost as if I have watched entirely different films from the multitude of pen blasters. Not that I would place these two works on the same level. Carlo Carlei's Shakespearian adaptation is for my money one of the finest cinematic takes on the Bard, a work imbued with passion, excitement and visual beauty that had me reeling to an extent I have not found anyone to share. Clooney's ""The Monuments Men"" is no more than a worthy middle-of-the-road film, what in terms of literature one might deem ""a good read."" As I tend only to submit reviews of films of outstanding quality, as a means of imparting enthusiasm for those I particularly admire, I would not have been writing this. My motive here is rather different, to lambaste injustice that I find near incomprehensible. Not only is the exciting true story of the rescue of great works of art from the Nazis during the latter parts of the war well told, the art direction capturing the devastation of the period is visually most impressive. If the film has a fault which places it on a lower level than such wartime epics as ""The Great Escape"" it is short on character development which tends to be swamped by emphasis on action. For once a better balance needs longer running time, rare to ask for from one of today's action flicks. Reports have it that George Clooney was deeply upset about the adverse reaction to what to all intents and purposes should have been a popular hit with audiences. If it is any consolation, George, I lapped it up and am probably as puzzled as you about the extent of such unjust denigration.",,Anonymous,History
"Part 'INDIANA JONES', part 'OCEAN'S ELEVEN' and part 'KELLY'S HEROES'!","'THE MONUMENTS MEN': Three Stars (Out of Five)George Clooney directed, co-wrote, co-produced and stars in this comedy-drama war flick about a group of soldiers, during World War II, who set out on a mission to retrieve stolen art masterpieces from Nazis. The film was also co-written and co-produced by Grant Heslov (a usual partner of Clooney's) and is based on the book 'The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History' by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter. It features an all-star cast which also includes Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville and Cate Blanchett. The movie is a bit of a mess, amusing at times but poorly put together by Clooney (who just can't seem to prove much talent as a director).The story is loosely based on actual historical events and revolves around a team of soldiers (during World War II) who are assigned (by FDR) to rescue famous pieces of art from Hitler's army. Frank Stokes (Clooney) leads the unit (which is nicknamed 'Monuments Men') and puts together an odd group of art historians, museum directors and curators (who all know very little about actual combat). Stokes knows that the Nazis will destroy the stolen art and he thinks it's worth risking lives in order to preserve our culture. His platoon of friends agrees with him and they embark on the adventurous journey, into Germany, together.The film raises an interesting question about whether preserving art and culture is worth the cost of lives or not. I think it's up to the person putting their life in jeopardy; people brave life-threatening dangers for all kinds of things that are important to them. So the message of the film might feel more meaningful to some viewers and more trivial (or even offensive) to others. It's funny that Matt Damon did also co-star in another World War II flick which raised the question of whether it's OK to risk multiple lives to save just one (in an attempt to relieve the grief of the soldier's mother); 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN'. I do like the idea of the movie and what Clooney was attempting to do but he has a lot to learn about making a consistently solid film. The movie has good moments and decent performances but it's too all over the place to confidently recommend it. At times it does feel like part 'INDIANA JONES', part 'OCEAN'S ELEVEN' and part 'KELLY'S HEROES'. If a movie stitched together with all those different pieces sounds like fun to you you might really enjoy it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5TT6LZ7cFI",,Anonymous,History
"Fine opportunity, great source material & an excellent cast completely wasted.","Written, directed and starring Hollywood darling, George Clooney; a cast to die for with five Oscars between them; a truth-is-stranger-than-fiction plot of audacious international thievery What could possibly go wrong with The Monuments Men?How long do you have?No, that's not fair. The Monuments Men isn't a stinker by any means. It is just a dull, confused, protracted almost film. It is almost exciting, almost clever, almost fun Based on the true story of a task force of just seven museum curators, directors and art historians, dubbed The Monuments Men, Clooney's fifth film in the director's chair stumbles through Hitler's mission to steal Europe's greatest artworks for his planned Führermuseum (Leader's Museum) and the Allied mission to steal them back and return them to their rightful homes. Battling squaddies and generals with no love for, or understanding of, art as well as the armies of the Third Reich, it was a dangerous and largely doomed mission to retrieve unimaginable art collections and prevent their certain destruction should Hitler fail to conquer the world.The source material is fantastic. What a remarkable operation! The Monuments Men should be a war romp in the vein of Kelly's Heroes or Where Eagles Dare but Clooney seems unsure whether it should be a Boy's Own adventure, a comedy knockabout or a history lesson with sensitive and sincere bon mots to make the audience reflect admiringly. It fails on every count and winds up as a WWII Ocean's Seven with a severe identity crisis.The stars that fill this two-hour somnambulistic mess coast along in the company of good friends, the knowledge of a good pay cheque and a free trip around Europe. It shows. There is no passion, urgency or fervor, just a clumsy jumble of ideas with no real conviction and little direction.It is very hard to connect the director of The Monuments Men with the man who helmed Good Night, and Good Luck and The Ides of March. And while it should be fun watching Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville, Jean Dujardin and Bob Balaban play at overweight, inept soldiers in the company of Cate Blanchett, it is just tedious.The Monuments Men is filled with opportunities for excitement and adventure but instead of a film we can lose ourselves in and a motley crew of characters we can root for, we are left disappointed and with the feeling that Clooney really should have done better.More upsettingly, a generation who have never heard of the real Monuments Men and the amazing mission they risked their lives for will brush it off as a bland fiction and forget it on the drive home.What a waste of a fine opportunity, a great plot and an excellent cast.",,Anonymous,History

A Bit Disappointing,"I thought this movie was a bit of a disappointment.

I do like a lot of the actors in this. As far as I am concerned I don't think Bill Murray could make a wrong move in any movie because he always comes across great just doing his thing, and he does the usual good job here.The movie is about a group of guys who kind of get thrown together when they form a unit to save valuable art from the Nazis. They don't want it to get destroyed or stolen so risk their lives to get it all back before the end of the war comes.",,Anonymous,History
Very much worth seeing but my expectations were just a little too high & because of that I didn't like it as much as expected,"""You can wipe out a generation of people. You can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still come back, but if you destroy their achievements and their history then it's like they never existed...that's what Hitler wants and it's the one thing we simply can't allow."" This is a true story of a group of ""soldiers"" in WWII that were tasked with recovering priceless art that the Nazi's have stolen and return them to their owners. From the beginning the mission was set up to fail but they didn't take into account the passion of the men involved. I was really looking forward to this movie because of the cast alone, but again I love movies based on true stories. Due to that I had very high expectations going in. While I can't say I was disappointed it wasn't as good as I was hoping for. The movie starts off pretty slow but picks up and by the end you are glad you watched. The fact that this is a true story really makes the story that much more powerful and gets you invested that much more into the story and the characters. Overall, this is a movie that I'm glad I saw and it was good but I think my expectations were just a little too high and because of that I didn't like it as much as I thought I would.

A Good WWII Movie For Everyone,"The Monuments Men features an all-star cast and is directed by George Cloony. I felt as if the movie portrayed a great World War II story, but I think there was too much comedy for this type of movie. I enjoy good comedy movies, but I like a good serious war movie also. On a historical basis, it is basically spot on according to things I have read on the internet regarding the true story of the Monuments Men in World War II. I would not say it is an all-time great, but it is a good movie. It would be a good movie to see if you were taking your history class on a field trip because of the historical story and the is not a lot of language throughout the movie. I would not see the movie again, but I enjoyed it in theaters and suggest it for you.",,Anonymous,History
"Good, not great","The subject of the movie is what drew me to it. Very interesting bit of history. If you're into arts, you'll certainly be doing like me throughout the movie, it's like a treasure hunt: Rembrandt here, Van Dyke or Renoir there... That part is really fun. The acting is pretty good in general. The costumes and sets are looking good and realistic. The problem is: against such a backdrop as WWII, where so many people died and such atrocities happened, I couldn't help but wonder, like one character in the movie, if it was worth it to send men to die for pieces of art, be they signed by Rodin or Picasso. This defuses the drama of the movie, although there are a couple of good scenes that will stick to you more. But it's hard to really care in depth about pieces of canvas and marble when you know there were human beings suffering unspeakable things right at the same time. I *have* to set the record straight about Matt Damon's character's awful French speaking ""abilities""...! Somehow his horrendous pronunciation is excused by the fact that he supposedly learnt French in Montreal. Excuse me! I'm Québécoise myself and I could not understand one blessed word he was saying when speaking ""French"". All it was, was really, really bad pronunciation by and English speaking tongue that revolts itself against anything remotely french-sounding. And by the way, Cate Blanchett was not convincing either as a ""French"" woman. Why not use wonderful actresses like Marion Cotillard, or Audrey Tautou, or Carole Bouquet, anybody but somebody who would've sounded convincing in French.",,Anonymous,History
"Unlike so much of the art saved, not a masterpiece","This is a war movie with a difference: instead of being about killing men, it is about saving cultural works. Set in the second half of the Second World War, it is the loosely true story of how the Allies put together a team of art specialists - in what was formally called the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives section - to don army uniform and follow hard behind combat troops as they liberated Western Europe from the Nazis. Thhe film has references at the beginning and the end to the magnificent Ghent Altarpiece which I have seen and admired - just one of millions of artefacts rescued by this operation.There were in fact around 345 such Monuments Men (and women) from up to 17 nations, but inevitably the movie has to focus on a small number - just seven - and almost all of them are played by big name American actors including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray and John Goodman. Britain is represented by Hugh Bonneville, while France has Jean Dujardin, and for good measure we have the ever-wonderful Cate Blanchett.So such an interesting story and stellar cast would seem to promise a high-class movie, but sadly it is a rather flawed work. The sweep is so extensive that we have a series of episodes involving different characters and locations with a lack of real narrative drive. Also the script is rather weak and the overall approach too comedic for such a serious subject. The responsibility for both strengths and weaknesses has to be shouldered largely by George Clooney since he is director, co-producer and co-writer as well as the lead actor. I am a huge admirer of Clooney's work but this, while well-intentioned, is not his best.In Britain, the is a particular reservation about ""The Monuments Men"" because the character portrayed by Bonneville - one of the two MPAA officers killed on duty - is fictional and there is no reference to the real-life British hero Ronald Balfour who was killed saving church artefacts in Cleves.",,Anonymous,History
"Somewhere in the top 15 non-violent, non-atrocity WWII films","You can see The Monuments Men was well shot. I liked what Clooney was doing, putting an Ocean's Eleven flavor in a World War II setting, and the Director of Photography Phedon Papamichael does quality work on films with large exterior landscapes like Nebraska (2013), The Descendants (2011) and 3:10 to Yuma (2007). Furthermore, you couldn't ask for a better cast. There was a lot of expectation for this movie to pick up Oscar and Golden Globe nods which is why it was originally scheduled for a December release (but later moved to February). In spite of its assets, however, in the end it leaves you somewhat disappointed.Three main issues that made me think this could have been a gem, if only. First is that it couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a serious historical movie. Usually a drama has some humor, and a historical comedy has drama. This one felt like a tug of war between the two, and in the end there was no clear winner.Second was the editing. They could have shed 3 or 4 scenes without sacrificing the story, and trimmed a few others to keep the movie from lagging. But then in the DVD Bonus Features you see them shoot a victory scene with large crowds; why was that cut from the theatrical version?And third, as phenomenal as Alexandre Desplat's score was, some scenes felt like they were missing music, again giving us a tug of war between a lush Hollywood production and French minimalism. Maybe it was re-edited at the last moment and some scenes were left bare.So there you have it, one of the most interesting stories of World War II that could have been an awards favorite. I put it somewhere in the Top 15 non-violent, non-atrocity WWII films. They are (not necessarily in order):1. The Bridge on the River Kwai 2. The Imitation Game 3. Casablanca 4. Sophie Scholl 5. The Sound of Music 6. Judgment at Nuremberg 7. Ike 8. The Reader 9. A League of Their Own 10. Valkyrie 11. The Book Thief 12. Five Graves to Cairo 13. South Pacific 14.

Falsified map used in the movie,"In the movie there is a map of Europe presented that is grossly and possibly willingly falsified. The borders of Romania are presented as they were after first world war without acknowledging that Northern Transylvania was part of Hungary in 1940-1944. Other territories that belonged to Hungary such as parts or Slovakia, Transcarpathia or Voivodina are also not represented correctly. They were in Hungary. However Romania contains all of Moldova which it would, correctly contain in 1943/44. Southern Dobrugea were part of Bulgaria after 1940 and ever since and are also shown as part of Romania. Either this is Romanian propaganda falsifying history and/or a gross failure of American movie makers to even check historical facts on a map.If any historian would look at that map they can confirm that it is teaching the American public and the world false information about Eastern Europe, a part of the world they have so little correct information about anyhow.",,Anonymous,History

Goes too far in its intended direction,"One review that I read before watching ""The Monuments Men"" stated that it was an old-fashioned type of movie. After seeing it, I tend to agree with that statement. It takes its subject matter very seriously for the most part, and instead of being lightening fast like most modern Hollywood movies, the pace is slow and deliberate. Nothing wrong with that in theory, but writer/director/actor George Clooney doesn't quite manage to pull it off. The movie is so solemn and serious that it almost becomes boring many times through its almost two hour running time. Some action or a few more attempts at humor would have helped. The subject matter is worthy of a movie, and the recreation of the time and place does come across as authentic, but I see that most people will probably squirm in their seats from a lack of patience with the end results.",,Anonymous,History

Monumental failure,"The film opens with the coming together of the seven monument men, it was a little akin to the start of the 'Magnificent Seven'.

I decided to watch this movie because of my fondness for the work of Murray & Kate Blanchett. Bill Murray was much under-used in this supposed comedy,and I'm very surprised that Kate Blanchett would appear in such a half-baked effort. Her accent reminded me of Yvette in 'Allo 'Allo, I was waiting for Rene to appear from ze café !! I've come to the conclusion that Jean Dujardin should stick to silent movies. This selection of ageing characters are tasked with saving precious works of art from the Nazis as they retreated through France & Belgium.
