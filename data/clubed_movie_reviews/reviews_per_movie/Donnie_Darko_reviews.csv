I didn't understand the story but I still enjoyed it.,"From the first scene this movie had me hooked till the end. There wasn't a single dull moment. The characters were interesting, had good acting and sound design.I'm rating this movie a 7 after my first viewing. The problem I have with it is the fact that I don't understand the story, I blame this on my own limited intellectual capabilities rather than being the fault of the writer/director. Last thing I would want is for movies to dumb themselves down to appeal to a wider audience. So the 7 score might be underrated to the true value of the movie but it helps me to keep track of how my perception changes in case I decide to watch it again in the future. I hope whoever reads this can understand.All that being said, I would recommend this film to any adult fan of cinema, it's well executed and entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Philosophy and quantum physics mashed into a cult classic,"I love everything about this film! It's been among my favorites for many years. The theories that could be well in depth for hours, the soundtrack, sweet camera shots, and the brilliant writing! I'm proud of the fact that this is my 300th review on here. I'd say this is my 4th favorite film ever after Fight Club, The Matrix, and True Romance. The floating wormholes is super cool to me and the soundtrack is so damn good!Thought provoking films are my favorite ever, the fact that you could float on talking about different aspects and possibilities is beyond fascinating to me! It's extremely impressive that Richard Kelly was 26 when he wrote the script and made such a profound experience!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Bizarre, but oh so great!","Donnie Darko is a truly fascinating film experience. It's not a perfect film, but it's an ambitious one, and for the most part, it fulfills its ambition.I will give no spoilers here, as the experience of watching this film for the first time is something I dare not strip away from any readers. For a small plot summary, Donnie Darko is a teen in high school who sleepwalks, and begins to experience ethereal visions from a ghostly rabbit named Frank, who informs him about a dangerous event, which plagues Donnie's life for a month.Why is this film great?: Jake Gyllenhaal gives a stellar performance as Donnie Darko. The character goes through so many emotional beats, and Gyllenhaal nails each one. The teen angst is played perfectly, and he's truly someone we can all say we've felt like, or seen at some point. His development is realized expertly by Gyllenhaal, and is truly a character who has made a change by the end of the film. It's not heavy handed though, so you might have to go on a symbolism hunt whilst watching the film. Don't worry though, because it's a fun film to find symbolism in. Remember, in this film, the secrets lie within the subtext.The script and direction from Richard Kelly are simply incredible for a first film effort. While some of Kelly's characters do have loose ends, and some aren't explained well or given enough screen time, the plot is fully realized, and mesmerizing. The twists in this film are confusing, but so ingenius once you understand the film. Kelly crafts a plot that makes sense in the end, and better yet, is not only constructed well, but has several meanings. The film is interpretable in many ways, and it uses ambiguity in the way ambiguity should be used: Sparsely, but effectively.If you don't get this film upon first viewing like me, don't assume you didn't like it, and forget about it. Watch a couple of analysis videos, and it will not only make sense, but you might be like me, and feel like a big dummy for not noticing it the first time. That's the fun of watching film though! Learning about new things, and experiencing topics and messages in new visual experimentations and arrangements. Don't feel bad if you don't get it. It's meant to be understood over time. It's just that good of a film. It's the kind of film that lingers with you after the credits roll.In conclusion, Donnie Darko suffers from some early 2000s corniness and has some faults in characters, but the plot and main character are so incredibly solid that it renders those mistakes seemingly unimportant and unnoticeable. You might not get it, but that's okay. Donnie Darko is a purposefully complicated film, and is also a purely emotional film upon first viewing. All that thinking comes after the credits roll. Not too many films these days make you think and feel directly after one another. Give this film a watch. I don't think you'll regret it if you give it a chance. It's a thought provoking film to view while in this time of quarantine!",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Captivating but ultimately frustrating,"Putting together a jigsaw puzzle can be fun. And make no mistake, Donnie Darko is a puzzle of a film which asks the viewer to put the pieces together. But in the end there is frustration as you realize you were never going to be able to put it all together. There are pieces missing. So while the film, which is certainly captivating and thought-provoking, is often fascinating it ultimately is setting you up for a bit of disappointment. It's nice to have a film which makes you think, which makes you work to understand it. It's also fine to have a film which is open to interpretation. But if in the end you don't have all the information necessary to make a reasonable interpretation that is a problem. And that is the case here. What just happened here? Hard to say. The untidy ending doesn't completely ruin the film, this is still a film well worth seeing. But there's no denying that the ending is a bit of a letdown.So who is Donnie Darko? He's a high school kid, a really smart guy. But he's got issues. Paranoid schizophrenia maybe, at least that's what his therapist thinks. He suffers from hallucinations, he sees things. And right now he's seeing a giant bunny rabbit named Frank. One night a jet engine crashes into Donnie's bedroom. But Donnie's not there because Frank has summoned him to a golf course where he tells Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days. What is Donnie meant to do with this information? Is this schizophrenic teen supposed to somehow save the world? Oh by the way, that jet engine? The one that would have killed Donnie had a giant bunny rabbit not summoned him to a golf course in the middle of the night? Nobody knows where that engine came from. No airplane lost an engine. Well that's weird. Things are only going to get weirder but then again you probably already guessed that since the plot revolves around a giant bunny rabbit.So the clock ticks down toward the bunny-prophesied doomsday. Among other events Donnie gets himself a girlfriend, rebels against life lessons taught by a ludicrous self-help guru and discusses time travel with one of his teachers. Time travel? Is that what this film is actually about? Who knows. The film never comes close to fully explaining itself. But the film certainly holds your attention. You can't help but be intrigued. You expect that all the weirdness will ultimately pay itself off with some sort of brilliant finish. Sadly that is not the case. The ending, while admittedly powerful, only adds to the confusion. There is a director's cut which makes things a little clearer but in the original version you're left to figure everything out for yourself. And you don't have near enough information to be able to do that. Donnie Darko is a very compelling film. And it is performed wonderfully. Jake Gyllenhaal hits all the right notes in his portrayal of Donnie, a character who is just as confused as we are. And the supporting cast is by and large excellent as well. Whether it be big stars like Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze, or lesser-known performers who you've never heard of, everyone fits their role very well, contributing their solid piece to the puzzle. But that puzzle never does fully come together. And that ultimately makes Donnie Darko a somewhat frustrating film. There's so much good stuff here to recommend it. But there's also that little tinge of regret, a wish that perhaps the giant bunny rabbit could have told Donnie, and us, what the heck was going on.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Weird, Creepy, Emotional, Funny, Beautiful. All at the same time.","I don't know what to type. Honestly. This is just one of those movies you have to see for yourself.Its also one of those movies that to fully get it, you have to see it more than once. Its a brilliant film, but a bit confusing.Well, the plot may sound stupid, and if it hadn't been as brilliantly executed, it probably would have been. But its brilliant. I am going to attempt to explain it. Here goes...A giant rabbit (no kidding) comes to proclaim the end of the world (no kidding) to troubled teenager Donnie Darko. Then, an aeroplane engine crashes into his bedroom while the rabbit is proclaiming the end of the world. (no kidding. Donnie then is able to see peoples 'paths', (represented as a long tube in front of the person, showing where they are going to go next) and is able to deny his own path. Confusing eh? This is a movie I can't explain any more. The rest has to be seen for yourself. Don't go in expecting a fully blown horror movie or any type of film with a straightforward, easy to understand plot.

I liked this much less than I hoped,"This movie had a really cool feeling to it that I liked a lot, and I completely understand why it's sort of a cult classic. It's very interesting and, in a way, also quite charming.Having said that, I.. did not enjoy this all that much. It just does too poorly of a job explaining its plot and instead of feeling satisfied, I felt confused and almost irritated to the point of losing almost all interest inte the film. I watched the director's cut that, at a 25 minutes longer run-time, still didn't have enough time to show the piece of exposition needed to understand what the hell was going on.Unpopular opinion maybe, but apart from some cool bits, ""Donnie Darko"" seriously let me down.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
You can't watch it only once,"I first saw this on cable tv. Thumbing through the channels I stopped just as Donnie Darko was beginning. I thought the title was weird, and readied my thumb on the remote channel selector...pointed it at the TV...and it stayed there for the rest of the movie! I couldn't stop watching! I've never seen a movie like this. The movie has a beautiful aspect (especially the end). And there are a few chuckles as well. Contrary to the more critical commentary, there is depth and complexity to the story that kind of requires you to see it more than once. I'm no genius, but what I gathered the basis of Donnie Darko to be is about our part in the deliberate DESIGN of our destiny, and I catch more each time I watch it.Regardless of anything, sincere thought and expression went in to the making of Donnie Darko. Mixed with skill and technical ability = Art.A WORK OF ART!  In the top 100 movies of all time in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not My Cup of Tea,"I know I'm in the minority here. I know that this movie is a cult classic and has gotten rave reviews; that's the reason I watched to begin with--well that and the fact I thought it was a time travel movie.""Donnie Darko"" was not my cup of tea. This is where I'm told I don't get it, it's too deep for me and then I'm called all kinds of pejoratives. This isn't the first movie that I opposed the majority on and it won't be the last.I saw a dramatic unfolding of the life of a mentally disturbed teenager. And it seemed that every character was formed through the lenses of said character. Everyone was odd. Comically odd. From Donnie Darko down to Cherita Chen. And characters like Cherita Chen seemed purposeless. If that's appealing then color me unimpressed.I know, this was a movie I didn't get and I'm fine with that.

the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had,"""Harvey"" meets ""The Mothman Prophecies,"" as a troubled teen starts hallucinating a horrific 6-foot-tall bunny rabbit that brings him dark forebodings about death and disaster in the very near future.  A streak of ""Heathers"" is mixed in as well, with trenchant satirical observations of high-school life in the late '80s (story set in Oct. 1988), involving a priggish teacher, a self-help guru (Patrick Swayze!), and a put-upon fat girl at the fringes of the herd.  Finally, a whiff of ""Back to the Future,"" in the form of a local eccentric who just may have discovered the secret of time travel, but a secret that has more to do with spirituality than technology.A lot goes on here.  There's a meditation on the possible overlap between madness and the ability to perceive the divine.  There's a demonstration of why, in the Bible, angelic messengers (if that's what ""Frank"" can be taken to be) are often so terrifying that they have to start by saying ""Fear not."" There's an enlistment of what martial artists refer to as the ""ki"" (or personal energy, emanating from a person's midsection) in the type of time travel depicted here (the term ""ki"" is never used in the flick, but the term ""path,"" another word for Tao or ""Way,"" is).  Quantum physics theory about wormholes is tied to the Fortean phenomenon of things falling unexplained from the sky, in a way that's more pivotal, and therefore more interesting, than the gratuitous rain of frogs in ""Magnolia.""Time travel paradoxes and ironies enter the picture as well.  One character (no spoiler!), whose life is saved by Donnie's ultimate trip back in time, wouldn't have died in the first place if he hadn't dragged her along to the opening of the wormhole.  Another character (again, no spoiler!), whose truly terrible secret comes to light in the wake of an arson investigation, must go unexposed as a result of that same time reversal, since the arson now won't happen.  Surely that's no oversight on the part of the screenwriter; it must be an acknowledgment of the choices and trade-offs in life, as well as of a confidence that no such terrible secret can remain hidden forever.Somehow this pastiche works, largely on the strength of good performances.  Jake Gyllenhaal is appropriately moody and, also appropriately, not always likeable in the title role.  Drew Barrymore, who executive produced, appears as a frustrated first-year teacher.  The movie's often dreamlike atmosphere is enhanced by the cinematography, the subdued but effective special effects, and the choice of the music on the soundtrack, which includes '80's pop tunes, of course, and a haunting original song (over the end credits) titled ""Mad World.""Not for all tastes, but better, stranger, and more complex than I expected.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Perhaps the most relevant social commentary on U.S society ever put on screen.,"Above all, this film has a kind of flow to it like nothing I've ever experienced in any other film before. The magic sets in from the very first moment, when we see Donnie waking up (and the song 'The Demon Moon' starts), and you just go with that flow and let yourself be drawn into that world. The story unfolds like a dream and the ambiguity (at least in the theatrical cut) as well as the fantastic songs help create an absolutely unique and strangely compelling atmosphere.Fantastic script and fantastic performances: this film has a richness in its characters that amazes me every time I watch it. Forget the director's cut - here for once the theatrical version is the masterpiece. Probably the best social commentary on American society I've ever seen but beautifully woven into an ambiguous, slightly surreal fantasy tale with a haunting soundtrack.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Stunning.,"The fact that this is the Directors first film is amazing to me. The scenes dripped with style, yet that style never seemed distracting. None of it was self congratulatory or gluttonous. The visuals were supported by a truly emotional score and its hard to find fault in the 80's pop tunes that found their way into some of the more impressive scenes.The story is very much thought provoking. Its the type that leaves you pondering the possibilities voiced by the characters. There is nothing condescending about this film. Answers arent simply handed out, rather the viewer is left to draw many conclusions instead. The acting is also top notch. If i hadnt known beforehand that Patrick Swayze was in this film I would have been shocked. His character is amusing and interesting all at the same time. A great cameo for him. Drew Barrymore is forgetable, though that in no way detracts from the film. Of course the star is Jake Gyllenhaal. There is nothing that can be said to properly praise his performance. The rest of the cast chosen fit their roles perfectly. All of these things combine to create a stunning film. One can only hope that filmgoers will give this little gem a shot and support a true wonder. This is the only film I have awarded a 10/10 on the IMDB.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Don't Be Ashamed To Say It's Not A Masterpiece,"I've heard so much about this "" Wonderful , mind blowing masterpiece "" . Interestingly enough most of the rave reviews of DONNIE DARKO came via this very website which goes against the grain of other reviewers . Roger Ebert only gave the movie two and a half stars while many other websites dedicated to film reviews claim this movie is confused and overrated . It should also be mentioned that if it's such a great , thought provoking piece of cinema then why did it miss out on so many nominations at the more prestigious film award ceremonies ? And don't say politics , an independent feature like IN THE BEDROOM didn't pick up any Oscars but that didn't stop it being nominated for severalDONNIE DARKO is by no means terrible but it is overrated . Dare I say it's a case of the emperors new clothes ? That is people are somewhat embarrassed upon seeing this film and not understanding it that they feel they must praise it in order to spare their supposed ignorance . Let me ask you this - What genre of film is this ? Everyone will give a slightly different answer I'm sure and if an audience is undecided about the genre then how can they decide what the ending is about ?And there is a quite serious plot hole involved in the story . Donnie sees a demonic rabbit called Frank throughout the movie who tells him at exactly what moment the world will end . Wormholes , time warps etc may actually exist in scientific reality as may the ending but the central plot does not since the whole movie rests on Frank or Donnie being able to see into the future and no scientist will claim there's any scientific basis for fortune telling . So you see it's not really about time travel , it's about mysticism , predestination and other superstitious mumbo jumbo which Richard Kelly is using to fool the audience . In effect this movie is one big cheat and most people have failed to notice thisHaving said that Richard Kelly does deserve some credit for making a movie that's not about car chases and explosions , this is a movie dealing with teen angst and the dark side of middle American small town values but Kelly has missed an opportunity to make the most of the potential . I know the film was released before the war on terror so there'd be little need to see news broadcasts on the fall out of the original Gulf war but from a pop culture point of view wouldn't this have been better set in the early 1990s when grunge culture was the rage instead of 1988 ? I mean what music best suits this movie's atmosphere ? Echo And The Bunnymen or Nirvana ? In fact if it had have set in the presidential elections of early 1990s this would have coincidentally tied in with what's going on in the world today with Saddam and Iraq getting a mention ! And wouldn't this movie be held up in superstitious awe now ?As it stands it's nowhere as clever as it thinks it is for the reasons outlined . Perhaps Mr Kelly started out on with two movies , one a high concept science fiction thriller and the other a low concept drama about a mentally ill teenager and decided to merge the two with not too successful results . Watching DOnnie Darko this was the gut feeling I got",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A complex story about adolescence, alternate realities, and the possibility that we are not masters of our own destiny","At first, Donnie Darko is a difficult film to understand and can seem absurd. What helps a lot to understand it and has made it a very beloved film is taking into account the concepts of parallel realities. It mentions time travel and although that is not exactly witnessed, the complexity of the film is based more on the fourth dimension. Donnie is the protagonist of a science fiction story in a parallel world, which is forced to play a role to prevent the destruction of existence itself. The mysterious Frank and many around Donnie become pawns for him to achieve his goal. The film mixes a whole series of elements, allegories, metaphors and messages that make it a quite enigmatic film. Using a book given to Donnie, he gives clues that the world Donnie stars in is not what the viewer initially thinks. The film uses Donnie and the events of the story quite a bit to raise the point that everything that happens in the world is connected and therefore the events of the world are part of a grand scheme. That would imply that all the actions and decisions that human beings take are already planned and that destiny is what really controls our lives. What would be raised would be something compared to the Loki series that raises the idea that there is no free will and that we must all fulfill a destiny that has been implanted in us to maintain a universal order. Even according to the philosophy of The Matrix, the decision is an illusion and the paradox arises as to whether we can really control our destiny or are we only tools of a great scheme forged by destiny. Donnie questions what he has to do a lot and that makes you think about what consequences there could be in the universe if someone goes off their path, breaking the scheme that maintains universal order. The Butterfly Effect theory and even other time travel films raise the question of what things would be like if such important events had not occurred. The film also gives Donnie a savior role, turning him into an allegory for Jesus Christ and other martyrs whose sacrifices were essential to a cause. The mention of the movie ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is also a key because of the plot it had. Like that film, Donnie Darko is a story about sacrifice and death as a necessary destiny for future events and for the universal scheme. In that aspect, the film has a biblical metaphor behind it. Another element that makes up this film is its allegory about adolescence and it is something that is reflected in Donnie when upon entering that stage, he asks himself many questions, reflects a lot, knows love and suffers this internal struggle about whether to fulfill his destination. Frank even becomes his guide of sorts and symbolizes the aggressive rebellion that many young people go through. It can be said that the film knows how to use Donnie to represent the psychology of young people and think about the kind of role that destiny has in store for them. It is not strange that it has some moments of cringe humor that are characteristic of teenagers. It can be concluded that Donnie Dark is another independent film with an unconventional plot that gives it a lot of resistance, although it leaves a couple of doubts to decipher. It is not a film that can be understood by those who do not take into account the aforementioned elements, but all the elements that characterize it are what make it an authentic cult film. It is not a film recommended for everyone, only for educated people and movie buffs. My final rating for this movie is an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Quirky film that's wide open to interpretation,"Upon awakening, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds that he's been asleep in the middle of a secluded mountain road. It seems that Donnie regularly wanders out at night and sleeps in strange places. The night that he ends up on the neighborhood golf course, a stray jet engine crashes through Donnie's bedroom. He's saved by his odd behavior. Shortly after, we witness him hearing voices and having visions of an odd, evil-looking, bipedal, man-sized bunny. The voice begins giving him unusual suggestions, and Donnie slowly finds himself as the key player in a grand scheme.Donnie Darko is an unusual film. It spans a number of genres and leaves itself wide open to interpretation. Quite a cult of hardcore fans has developed around it, and for those folks, the film is essentially immune to criticism and reinterpretation.The biggest surprise to me was that the bulk of Donnie Darko is a realist drama. I had long heard about how strange the film was, and heard it described as being partially sci-fi (which it is) and horror (which it isn't if you ask me). It was supposedly a ""reality-bender"". I'm much more of a ""genre"" fan, and I much prefer fantasy, surrealism and absurdism to realism. My preconceptions were throwing me off of the film initially. The realist drama stuff seemed to drag on, and it made much of the film a hard sell. I loved the touches of weirdness, but they were too little, too far between--at least until I reached my personal interpretation of the film around the halfway mark.The film is also odd in that it's so retro. At one point I double-checked the DVD box, thinking that Donnie Darko had to be a late 1980s film. Nope, 2001. Then I started thinking that writer/director Richard Kelly must have had the script in storage for 15 years. But that can't be the case, either, as his bio says he was born in 1975, and it's unlikely that he would have written Donnie Darko when he was 10 or 11. The film is mired in late 1980s pop-culture references, style and music. Realizing that Kelly was born in 1975 still makes this weird. He says on the new DVD commentary that he was following the clichéd advice to write what you know, and he knew school in the late 1980s. He wouldn't have even entered high school until 1989, so it seems odd that he would only know school in the late 1980s. The retro feel of the film was a bit artificial to me, although I enjoyed the way the pop music was integrated.There were also some questionable performances for my tastes, including Drew Barrymore's, and some bizarre (but not bizarre enough) scenarios that I never quite figured out, such as why a gym teacher was showing motivational videos to a class sitting in desks.But most fans of Donnie Darko tend to overlook the minutiae, even though it takes up most of the screen time. The hinge tends to be on the overall arc and the meaning of the film. If minutiae are dwelt on, it's usually concerning the ""Philosophy of Time Travel"" book, or some bit of dialogue that is thought to be clever, such as the Smurf discussion. The theme of the film is often said to be something like ""possibilities"", and the film is routinely interpreted as having a messianic subtext, as well as often being interpreted more literally, as a kind of sci-fi story. After I watched the film and it didn't quite pay off as I had been hoping, I was anxious to listen to the commentary and watch the documentaries. Kelly seemed to intend more of the literal, sci-fi interpretation of the film. That was disappointing, because interpreted that way, the most fascinating thing to me is that Kelly believes it even approaches coherency. The Philosophy of Time Travel material, which is a core of this interpretation, is arbitrary sounding gobbledy gook. It has nothing to do with time travel, and even less to do with philosophy. It's more a naïve attempt at something like a parallel universe, ala the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics (which tends to be nonsensical anyway).To make matters worse, there is little attempt to integrate most of this material into the actual meat of the film--the sci-fi interpretation seems very ""grafted on"". Many of the actual scenes we witness aren't there to service the eventual interpretation of the film as a sci-fi story, but are there because it's some snippet of actual life that Kelly remembers or has thought about or had conversations similar to in the past, and he thinks it's clever or character developing. For me, this material was neither.But my personal interpretation of the film made much more sense to me, and under it, I enjoyed it more. To me, Donnie Darko is just a depiction of a kid with schizophrenia (and this is even explicitly suggested, although Kelly seems to be overlooking or not mentioning the interpretation). Even the smallest details of the film make sense in this context. Schizophrenics hear voices. They can have visual, tactile and other sensory hallucinations. Some have delusions of grandeur, such as messiah/superhero complexes. They often feel alienated. Donnie mopes around, mumbling, fairly expressionless much of the time and has periodic emotional outbursts. He acts out in anti-social ways. He goes into semi-catatonic states. Even the end of the film makes more sense under this interpretation, as it can be seen as an intentional delusion that Donnie has created due to the relationship-oriented tragedy. He's fantasizing about things being different than they turned out. To me, the film has much more depth under this interpretation.If you haven't seen Donnie Darko yet, you owe it to yourself to check it out. No matter your final verdict, it's an interesting, quirky film, and one that's sure to be talked about for a long time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Worth a Second Look,"This is a film that crept up on me. It takes one time to sense the rhythms of this film and to accept the strange apparitions that dominate it. As the closing song, ""Mad World,"" typifies, the central character can only accept his demons and, in doing so, have a scintilla of joy. This is about a different kind of altruism, unstuck in time, that some of us wish we could have. Donnie is a popular guy with all kinds of possibilities. He is loving, smart, and eccentric. His family has him seeing a psychiatrist because his actions due to misunderstood visions have caused him to act violently at times. They love him and want him so badly to sort things out. He finds a soul mate, but she has her own demons and never fully understands what is going on. I can't say much because a first time viewer needs to be kept completely in the dark.

Donnie Darko is wonderfully strange,"Donnie Darko directed by Richard Kelly is a drama/fantasy/teen flick/thriller/science fiction film... and some how, its actually works. It follows Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Donnie Darko, who is tormented by hallucinations of a man dressed in a bunny suit. These visions manipulate Donnie to commit a series of crimes, as repayment for being saved from a life threatening accident. The peculiar nature of this film, truly sets it apart within the world of cinema, making it one of the most memorable movie experiences I've ever had. This film is so incredibly entertaining, mainly due to the perfect line delivery and performance by Jake Gyllenhaal. The entire cast has a level of peculiarity which just makes them so compelling to watch. I particularly love the unconventional cinematography which further emphasises the bizarre tone of the film, as well as the integration of an iconic soundtrack which sets the context and tone of the fictional world. Donnie Darko is wonderfully strange. But beneath all its weirdness, its actually really emotional. Every character is completely human and at times can be very relatable. The film has an underlying tone of sadness throughout, making it such a complex story with a lot of depth. Yes you might not get all the answers by the end of the film, but I love the fact that I can invent my own theories and explanations which allows the movie to make sense to me. Donnie Darko had me fixated on the screen for the entire runtime, and had me pondering about it for a week, so therefore I give it a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Great movie,"Donnie Darko was a great and thought provoking movie. Most people will probably not understand the movie the first time they watch it, because they don't know what to watch for, but the 2nd time you watch the movie most will consider it a great and profound movie. Another way to understand Donnie Darko is to have someone that has already seen the movie to watch it with you and tell you which parts of the movie to remember towards the end of the movie. This is not a movie to watch if one does not like to think during movies. Donnie Darko is also not a movie for the lazy movie watcher to watch.

Storytelling this dense and compelling transcends intellectual engrossment. This movie runs in the vein of films like 'The Fountain' and even shows shades of renaissance noir as in 'Memento'. Jake Gyllenhal rips this film apart as he ebbs and flows from fits of hostility to drowning in pure delusion. His performance in Darko flies under the radar as one of the best in recent memory. This is a film that deserves several repeat views, and is deserving of equal amounts of debate and analysis. It is also demanding to the nth degree, it will leave you spent as the credits begin to roll but also dreaming. If this film doesn't haunt you, I'm not sure what will.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not as impressive as the original,"*This is a review of the Directors Cut*I've already reviewed the originally released cut of 'Donnie Darko' so I am not going to review the film again. Instead, I'll comment on the differences between the two versions; unfortunately most of the differences took away from the original film, which I think is truly excellent.I traveled two hours round-trip with several friends to see the Directors Cut since it was not playing in Milwaukee at the time, and while I am glad that I saw it, I feel that the original is the superior version. There were many superfluous scenes in the new cut which did not add to the film; rather I almost felt that they made the pacing falter a bit. For example, the new scene between Donnie's parents in the café  a completely unnecessary scene which did not add anything relevant to the story. There were a handful of scenes like this, as well as some added dialogue that indeed added to the development of some characters, (Drew Barrymore's character, the teacher 'Karen' was enhanced a bit) for some it just seemed silly (One of Donnie's bus stop friends telling Cherita that he 'hopes she gets molested' turned him from just being an incidental character into being an incidental character who is a jackass.)Another major difference between the two films was the addition of several special effects to the new cut. There were a lot of dream-like sequences (the file cabinets floating among the clouds ala Rene Magritte) and all of the stuff focusing on Donnie's eyeball, computer-ish codes, etc, that just did not work in my opinion. Also, some of the most subtle changes, soundtrack for example, were disarming. The opening song was 'The Killing Moon' by Echo and the Bunnymen in the original, which provided a great backdrop in the introduction to Donnie, his environment and his family. Kelly used 'Never Tear Us Apart' by INXS in his directors cut. Certainly, a good song, but after using a perfect song originally, it is hard to get used to an inferior replacement.Which is how I sum up my feelings about Kelly's directors cut in general? Why mess with (near) perfection? 'Donnie Darko' is a fantastic film that was so thought-provoking it made some people run the other way. Only those who were interested in something beyond the ordinary stayed to ponder and theorize its meaning, and still are to this day. Kelly's new cut does not enhance the film, rather, it made it plodding and a little dumbed-down  two adjectives I never thought I would ascribe to this film. See the directors cut to play 'spot the new stuff', but stick with the original.--Shel",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Original but difficult movie.,"""Donnie Darko"" is a movie that remains difficult to understand. Everybody has his own interpretation of the ending and the story in general. That is a good thing. Everyone looks at this movie differently in his own way, which makes ""Donnie Darko"" an unique movie.It's a good first long featured movie for director Richard Kelly. Still I didn't liked it as much as everyone else seems to do. The movie has some odd moments and almost nothing is explained. Everything is left to the viewer his own interpretation and imagination, which seems like a lazy but of course also original way of movie making. The story is good but there are several missed opportunities, such as the whole time traveling element of the movie that is hardly used at all.There are some good actors in the movie. Jake Gyllenhaal is a good leading man but even better are the supporting actors played by well known actors Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle.In my opinion the movie is still overrated. Just because it's original and 'odd', doesn't make a movie brilliant. It's professionally made all and well written but not everything is making sense and the movie makes little effort in making the movie its story understandable.I can give my own interpretation of the movie and its story and try to explain everything about that but in my opinion that would be useless. Just watch this movie and form your own ideas and interpretation of the movie, since everyone will have a different opinion and interpretation of it. It certainly is a thought provoking movie that is worth watching.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Nothing more than tricks... but, god, how they work.","Sweets. They are not nourishing, but they're delicious.This is how I feel about this film. If I make a conscious attempt at explaining why I like ""Donnie Darko"", I can see no real meat in it. I got no lessons from the flick, I hardly got a story... Forget what others say about this movie as ""philosophical"", ""clever"" or ""trascendent"". It's not. But, my!, how such a young director almost manages to make you believe it is... I don't know about you, but I call that talent.Yes, the movie is empty. The story goes nowhere, there is no message, no moral, but the way it's all wrapped up keeps you salivating throughout. Don't think it's mere flashy fireworks, though. This is not a case of style over substance. It's something more complex, and that's where ""Donnie Darko"" distances from the rest. This movie is freaking special, is full of personality. I wish more films had this character. The charm of this film relies on a lot of pieces that fit like a giant puzzle:-Chosen time (1988) is strangely proper (you'll have to see this movie to understand it, sorry).-The movie is BLUE. Its photography is blue, its characters are blue, its story is blue. Everything is blue.-Music is great.-Emotions are overwhelming. They come from everywhere and at the same time. You don't know what's happening, but what might be happening actually affects you.-I can see some Lynch influences. The scene where the gym teacher talks to Donnie's mother at the doorstep is 100% Lynch.-Some scenes are, almost, scary.-This is one of the movies that present the idea of ""beyond"" in a most seductive way. You feel there's something more than this world. It never gets explained, but heck, I don't care.-Finally, and most important, the main appeal of the movie is that it throws together unrelated concepts in such a way that they feel ghostly linked. The movie is a melting pot of vague ideas, that, thanks to a great direction, get connected in the subconscious.Exactly because of this, I understand this movie has so much appeal for some people, and so little for others. If you fall in the trap, it will touch you, and this movie could mean the world to you. If you don't, it won't, and you won't see more than a bag of tricks. Whatever the category you fall in, you have to recognize the skill of Richard Kelly. The execution of ""Donnie Darko"" is more than remarkable.I like to think of ""Donnie Darko"" not as a movie, but as a niche some people feel comfortably unsafe inside, that people being 25-30 year olds with an affection for sci-fi and darkness. The more you fit in this role, the more you'll get into this.RATING: 8.3",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Somewhat Overrated,The performances are good and visually it's a nice looking movie that does an impressive job immersing the viewer into 1980s suburbia. However the pacing is slow (the director's cut VERY SLOW) with a running time that doesn't really justify a rather silly story that takes itself too seriously. I can see why it's a cult movie but it isn't that great.,6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Amazing,"Its really hard to say something else about this movie except that its just amazing.I watched it recently and just don't know what to say.It affected me so much that i can watch it over again and again and it just won't get boring or something like that.The whole idea of the movie is so philosophic and distracted from the real world and in the same time so easy to see, so easy to feel.The moment when he finally understands what he needs to do its so highly romantic and tragic(I even cried at that moment and I'm not afraid to say it), but after all its a kind of beating your own instinct for survival.But i don't know a person who,in case he had everything friends,family and love would let them fade away.The meaning of the life is in having people you love and care about and you are sure they are OK. Because at the end if your really close person has died or got hurt and only you have the chance to make it all right,would you let this chance go away....?",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I Can Understand the Cult Status,"In 2001, filmmaker Richard Kelly released his directorial debut, Donnie Darko. Despite underperforming on its original release, it did well enough on home video to gain a cult following, whilst also getting critically acclaimed at the same time. Unfortunately, Kelly has never made anything on the same level of cultural status as this film, and this remains his most popular project to date. As for what I think of it, while I do get the appeal of this film, I personally just find it to be ok.Probably the best aspect of Donnie Darko is the suspense, as it details the misadventures of a troubled teenaged boy who seeks the purpose behind these doomsday-related visions from a creepy looking bunny. As the film focuses on Donnie's struggles, we see just how emotionally distraught he becomes from the real world, yet it's not hard to see where he comes from through his imagination. In addition, the people around him who get affected by his unorthodox behavior, such as gym teacher Mrs. Farmer and motivational speaker Jim Cunningham, provide great contrasts in personalities and views on the world, giving some much needed pathos.The rest of the supporting cast are more of a mix. Some like Donnie's psychotherapist Dr. Thurman, friend Gretchen, teachers Dr. Monnitoff and Karen Pomeroy, and his own mother give much needed advice and logos to him whilst being unaware of Donnie's problems (besides Thurman). Others like Donnie's father and sisters, friends and rivals are mainly just there for the most part, though some don't play much importance until later on in the film. With all of this said, I would've preferred a little less of the additional character's time, as they come off as more like filler than anything else. Also, there are some weird edits here and there that make the film come off as a little wonky rather than visually pleasing, but that's just me.Truth be told, I actually don't know what else to say about Donnie Darko. While I admire it for its originality, concepts and creepiness, I also find it a little confusing for my tastes. That being said, I totally get why many people have gravitated towards this film, as it presents the point of view from an emotionally wrecked teenager with strange mental dilemmas that they can relate to. So while I was a tad underwhelmed by the film as a whole, I nevertheless recommend the film to teens who are in love with dark stories and macabre fantasies. Or maybe the director's cut is slightly better, who knows?",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Disturbing. Confusing. Twisted. Everything a movie should be.,"Donnie Darko is no movie. It's an experience that transcends anything you have ever felt in front of a screen. Once it's over, you won't stop thinking about it. The music will stay in your head, the ideas will keep you awake, and the characters will stay alive. This is everything a movie should movie. No one should miss this. Though there are flaws, the incredible crafting of the film will distract you from them. Go see it.Jake Gylenhall and Patrick Swayze are brilliant. Richard Kelly may have screwed himself with this. Why? Because this is probably the greatest movie he will ever make. If not, Kelly, you are my new favorite filmmaker. Love,Gerald (wink)",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Back to the Future...,"Donnie Darko is often described as a cult film. But what is it that makes a film 'cult'? Well, they usually have a hardcore fan following formed on the basis of the film having quotable dialogue, memorable characters and/or scenes, a low budget and a rather eccentric plot. Donnie Darko falls into all these categories with ease; especially the latter. It's one of those films that invite more than one viewing, maybe more than two. Or three. And if The Matrix left you asking ""what?"" and Fight Club left you asking ""how?"", then Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko will simply leave you asking ""WTF!?"" It's c-o-n-f-u-s-i-n-g and a little odd but ever since its 2001 release this sombre suburban tale has been striking countless chords amongst mid-to-late teens and sci-fi fans alike. Why? To be honest, there is no one answer. What I can tell you, though, is that Donnie Darko is black, bold and illusively cool; as fresh and provocative now as it was then. Pure independent cinema.So, what's it all about? I hear you ask (including those who've seen it). Well umm OK explaining to someone what Donnie Darko is actually about is about as easy as mastering a rubix-cube in less than 30 seconds, in the dark, underwater. Admittedly, it's a ridiculously perplex film but there's something just, well, brilliant about it. It's a melodrama-cum-sci-fi- cum-black comedy-cum-teen movie, with a truly mystifying plot that'll prompt all first time viewers to scratch their heads and question everything. And even though there are many who still don't really ""get it"" thus opting to label ""it"" as some strange form of sci-fi crap, there are many (myself included) who consider it to be one of modern-American cinema's most understated masterstrokes. OK, so, with that said, here it goes; Set in 1988, the film revolves around this grinning, groggy-eyed teen', Donald J. Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal). Not only does Donnie get into regular trouble at school, he's also prone to depression, schizophrenia, sleepwalking, waking up on golf courses, hearing voices and visualizing a giant bunny-rabbit called Frank. Donnie's one messed-up kid, then, and what-do-you-know- things get even worse when Frank tells him that the world's going to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. Oh, and there's also this book on time travel. And Gretchen. And Grandma Death. And there're these worm holes that kind of appear from people's chests. There's a tornado as well. And Patrick Swayze plays a pervert. Yep, Donnie's world, or parallel world, sure is a mad one but he tries his best to make sense of his ghostly visions; do they hold any value or truth? Is he a modern-day messiah? Or just plain bonkers? And why has a jet engine from an unidentified aircraft landed his room? The answers do become clear-ish as Donnie unravels the mystery surrounding, well, everything; discovering what he has to do to bring a halt to the madness and ease his pain. Happy ending? Sad ending? You decide.The real beauty of Richard Kelly's debut feature and perhaps one of the reasons as to why it's so popular is besides its unique blend of every genre imaginable, it's highly ambiguous; a compound prism of manifold meanings and interpretations. Some things just don't make sense and to be honest, its true quality will always be open to interpretation: you'll either love it, hate it, or hate it watch it again and love it. Me? I fall into the latter camp and would venture a guess and say I'm not alone. Which is probably why it performed so badly at the box- office, grossing more in the UK (£1.1m) than in the US ($728k). When Darko became available on DVD, though, word spread of its outlandish quality and it soon became a huge hit among sci- fi fans and teenagers. Why the latter? Again, I couldn't possibly say. It could be because it's rebellious in every sense of the word or because Jake Gyllenhaal is just so damn cool as the sinister protagonist. Or maybe even because the film itself expertly juggles high entertainment value- juvenile humour, endless intrigue, choking suspense- with a solemn tone as it chew on the themes of love and sacrifice, intolerance and depression, fate and redemption. Some of which, are subject-matters many teens know all too well.To cut a long review short, then, Donnie Darko is a pure and not-so- simple mind-boggler whose sheer weirdness does conceal its brilliance. In spite of its ever growing popularity, there are many who just won't take to it's off-the-wall temperament. Granted, it is a head- scratcher and if you're one of those who just can't bare to watch a film without having those precious answers handed to you on a silver platter, you best steer clear of this one. But, if you like your movies dark, doomy and challenging then may I suggest (if you haven't already done so) that you pick yourself up a copy just to see what all the fuss is about. But do not (and I repeat) do not expect to be spoon-fed the answers. Not all loose ends are tied-up for you and it's up to you, and you alone, to press rewind and tie them for yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"I'm writing the 1889th comment on Donnie Darko here. When it hits 1988th comment, the world will come to an end; as Frank told me.","""The dreams which I'm dying are the best I've ever had..."" Most of the authorities reviewed Donnie Darko as a psychological thriller. Though, the look of this angle straitens the true understanding of this epic movie. Donnie Darko is a sci-fi classic and is mainly a superhero movie. ""If only I could go back in time and take all those hours of pain and darkness; and replace them with something better..."" was Gretchen's wish. Donald died in his dream to prevent Gretchen getting killed in the real life. Although he believes that the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind is antiseptics(!), Donald had a vision. He gave whatever Gretchen wanted from life; and when she got all of her desired, the destiny was rewritten putting effect the fact that she has actually never met with Donald. Gretchen had been killed accidentally by Frank. In order to make Donald save Gretchen's life; a restless supernatural spirit,that wore Frank's Halloween night dress, sacrificed Donald and saved Frank's life.Donnie Darko brought out who rule the destiny of the world. The answer is neither God or humankind. It is angels(and/or daemons) that forms the fate and represents the balance of the nature. It is also clarified that only angels(and/or daemons) can travel in time.Jake Gyllenhaal performed Donald(Donnie Darko) and totally took on the tough responsibility of playing a schizophrenic superhero. Maggie Gyllenhaal, his sister both in the movie and in the real life, looked as the cutest of all her performances ever. Jena Malone was surely the right choice to perform as Gretchen, although she didn't give any extra effort to catch viewers' attention. Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze couldn't hold onto the blood-freezing atmosphere of the film. Best of all, Richard Kelly has done a great work of cinema. His style of holding the tension at the highest, and hiding clues of the storyboard all over the script were extra-ordinary. Cinematography was so brilliant and unique. Donnie Darko totally deserves to be one of the best sci-fi movies of all time for every aspect.Editing and theatrical cut was also a good job. There were deleted scenes that I got the chance to view from the DVD, just good to know. The film has been edited in a smooth and clever style. I got people all the time telling that Donnie Darko is a schizophrenic film, which is not fair. That would straiten the wide implications we can get. Those implications may include not just scientific thesis of quantum mechanics but also very important social criticisms. It is a mad world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A good film,  with a fervent cult following, but it shoots short of greatness","Without a doubt there is an audience for Donnie Darko, which is perpetuated by the cult that it had gained following its release (and re-release as a director's cut, unseen by me). I also have no doubt that Richard Kelly, first-time writer/director of this film, is talented. But after seeing the film for the first time recently with its strengths I also found parts to become a little 'much' (pretentious may not be the right word to use, some would say it though), or at the least trying to be weirder (or surreal if you would put it that way) then it needed. The story is an unusual one, as is its central character played by Jake Ghyllenhaal, however Kelly tries to cover too much ground in one sitting of less than two hours, and also loses much of his conviction in the little coherence of the story by the last ten minutes (especially the last five, although it is not elusive or misunderstood by me, that's not what I had a problem with). There is also something off about how Kelly injects his dream-like projections in the film, which I'll get to in a moment.First off, I would like to point out what I did find commendable in the film. Kelly is a very good director of actors, and out of Ghyllenhaal he does get a truly tortured soul to emerge through. Although one might find a similarly troubled character in a film like The Good Girl, he does make Darko his own. There are also good performances from Jena Malone as a sort-of love interest of Donnie's, and even by Patrick Swayze in a surprising and funny role as a motivational speaker. Also, Kelly knows how to set up certain scenes and let them work well in his 1988 setting (the introduction to Donnie's school was one, where there was an interesting collage of images against a cool 80's new-wave song), and creates some dark comedy in Donnie's rebellious nature at times (especially against the forces of authority). And in the first third/quarter of the film, Kelly sets up a story that attempts to dig into a kind of adolescent mood that follows many outsiders in high school movies.Where I did find that the film went into territory that is questionable is how Donnie's strange phenomena is explained, or not explained. The elements of time travel, paranoid-schizophrenia, the controlling power of hallucinations, the end of the world, etc, are all jumbled up at times and Kelly doesn't seem to know where to go except to make things seem 'cool', perhaps, in a dark way (maybe like a high schooler Fight Club). A problem I had though is that, unlike a controlled and smart surrealist director like Bunuel or Lynch, Kelly doesn't take the visions and ideas anywhere except to a muddled point. There are so many ideas about topics and behavior that one almost loses sight of what the story is working to, which I won't reveal but is a little too obvious.In a way, the end result reminds me of seeing a student film at a university- you appreciate and get entertained by scenes and lines and such, but you see more talent that will later emerge than actually present. In short, like with 2004's Garden State (also directed by a first-timer Zack Braff), the hype doesn't entirely suffice, at least for me. Maybe it might serve more on a repeat viewing, or of the director's cut (which are really just the deleted scenes on the theatrical DVD incorporated in redux style). For now, I give it a B grade, however I would recommend it for most high school kids looking for a 'head-trip' who are still vulnerable to masterpieces like Eraserhead and Un Chien Andalou.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
the soundtrack is beautifully curated,"I think my main problem here is that the film is not completely serious enough for me to fully engage nor frivolous for me to just sit back and enjoy. I found it pleasant enough and remembered little from watching it on theatrical release but there had to be a reason it has taken so long to look at it again and it must be that it is ultimately unsatisfying. There is an abundance of ardent extras on my disc but I just didn't feel up to giving this any more time. On the positive side Jake Gyllenhaal does well in the lead and is convincing in a very difficult role, the film looks great all the time and the soundtrack is beautifully curated with some beautiful songs sounding batter than I remembered them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An interesting little gem,"This is an intriguing film with Jake Gyllenhaal playing the title role. Is Donnie Darko slowing going mad, is the weird giant rabbit a friend or an enemy, and is there something sinister going on? The story unravels and you get drawn into the strange world of Donnie Darko and his journey which reached an inevitable, melancholy but strangely satisfying conclusion.I won't say much about the plot, but you might need to have a second look to understand exactly what is happening. Only one thing needed to be said - if you ever want to watch this film, watch the original version, avoid the Director's cut version. The director's cut added unnecessary scenes and pointless graphics which, although perhaps the director thought might think help explain the movie better, is a big mistake. The original version is mysterious and all the better for it, and if you don't understand it completely, it matters not a jot. In fact it is silly to try to make sense of the science as some tried to do because it is hardly the point of the film, and in any case Hollywood simply can't do science well in most of its films. Just enjoy an intriguing journey through the mind of a disturbed (or may be not) teenager.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"This is a far better film if you flat out ignore the director's intentions, explanation","I'm in the minority on this point and I stand against the film's director but I greatly dislike the plot of this film being explained as time travel and alternative reality. The extratextual (at least in the theatrical cut) Philosophy of Time Travel material-which explains what the director was thinking-is so silly and really a mere skeleton of a metaphysics. Instead I prefer to think of the film as just entirely within Donnie Darko's disturbed and schizophrenic point of view. I'm sure there's a shot or a line or something that ""proves"" Frank and the other phantasms are not in Donnie's head but I don't care. The plot works so much better if you think most of the film is Donnie's final delusion.The film is at its best being inexplicable and weird. The most memorable bits-Smurfette ran or the first family dinner scene-are all character driven. The film balancing the banal and the fantastic is what makes the tone work.

Overrated,"I went into this flick because a couple different reviews and reviewers pointed me in that direction. I'm not a critic, I don't waste a lot of time disecting the bad, I prefer to spend time praising the good.So I'll be brief.This movie will probably appeal to the same segment who thought Blair Witch was original and good. And like Blair Witch this movie is neither. If you've opened a sci-fi book in the last fifty years, the concepts touched on are less than revolutionary, and even the mixing of disparite genres handled far better elsewhere, one movie that comes to mind is SIGNS. Or even the films of David Fincher, this idea of pieces coming together, of everything having meaning is a capable idea, in the hands of acapable script and director.An idea that kept running through my head, triggered by certain scenes in the film, is how derivitive DONNIE DARKO is of better movies. Sometimes an ambiguous story isn't the mark of a brilliant director, and a witty script, sometimes it's just uneven filmmaking. It's just an inability to put on the stage, the ideas on the page. Many reviewers have said, well get the DVD, because the notes from the book really explain it, and I have to chuckle softly, because I realize that perhaps a movie that requires crib notes... isn't really that cohesive of a movie.People are quick to slam hollywood movies, and praise indie movies, often simply because they are labeled ""indie"" movie.Some hollywood movies are bad, some are brillant. Some Indie movies are brilliant, and some are... empty. DD is an empty movie. People argue about Tangent Universes, and Premonitional Dreams, and ultimately if a movie lacks heart, if you don't care about the characters, who cares what happens to them? Whether their world ends? And ultimately that's the failing of Donnie Darko, Drew Barrymore mentions apathy, and that descibes the failings of this flick as well as any.You don't learn to care for the characters, so why worry about their world coming to the end? While the director shows capabiity moving the camera, the glaring/cynical looks of the lead [his distuberd/homicidal look maybe?] after the fourth or fifth glare left me hoping 10 or 12 jets fell on his head.Condemn Hollywood movies if you choose, but like most prejudice, you condemn the good with the bad, because Hollywood at its best, its LAWRENCE OF ARABIAs, its LION IN WINTERS, its UNTOUCHABLES, its BRAVEHEARTS gives us works that speak to the heart, and I will take that any day over this new self-indulgent indie cinema that speaks only to the hubris[That said there are directors doing great things in the Indie Field, THE SWEET HEREAFTER popping immediately to mind, a movie that has all the heartrending emotional energy and interest, that this film lacks].Donnie Darko like Blair Witch is an exercise, a preamble to a film, that would make a decent short flick on the Indie Film circuit, but blown up to feature length, the cracks shown... and the holes become... apparent.** out of ****.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Are you ready for something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT? Donnie Darko.,"This is one of these movies that not just bend but brake virtually every rule of cinematic storytelling in a way so unique, mind-boggling and satisfying at the same time, no else can follow. Do not expect to see another movie ""inspired by"" or ""of the same sort"" as Donnie Darko. It is one of a kind and that makes it even more special. Richard Kelly set an impossible standard for himself with his very first feature, it will be extremely difficult to top this one, if ever.The story is, well, simply inexplicable! This is the selling point of the movie. It blends a number of diverse elements, 80's nostalgia, teen angst, depression, insanity, death, romance, sacrifice, comedy, tragedy... and a little bit of time traveling by the way. And did I forget to mention the giant rabbit? How could all these combine into a meaningful and coherent whole? As it turns out, under the commanding hand of the writer/director, the result is far from coherent, but flooding - literally - with meaning in all kinds of levels. The finished product is like looking at a painting. It isn't the original intend of the artist or the distinct parts of it that are the most important, but the emotional impact it causes on the viewer. There is a point about two thirds into the movie, were emotion just takes hold and doesn't let go until its incredible, chilling finale that has and will continue to fuel endless discussions. Is it easy to understand? Certainly not, at least with the usual sense of the word. Is it easy to feel? Definitely! And this is one of the reasons why DD has become such a cult phenomenon. Think of it as David Lynch but on one of his very good, lucid days.In terms of execution, the movie shines in many ways and is not hampered or handicapped by its small budget. Performances are great from both lead and supporting actors. Patrick Swayze gives his best in years and Mary McDonnell is simply devastating. But the real star here is Jake Gyllenhaal, who totally owns the film, conveying emotion and maturity with exceptional confidence. The screen couple of him and Jena Malone also has great chemistry and makes you deeply root for the characters and their dark fates. There is also a wonderful soundtrack, complete with vintage 80's tracks and a haunting score by Michael Andrews. The closing sequence with Gary Jules' ""Mad World"" playing easily qualifies as one of the most memorable pairings of music and film.One certainly needs to see this movie at least three times to start making up his mind about what actually happened. But this is beside the point. Some things are better left unexplained. Donnie Darko is above all else an experience, one that provokes the mind and the heart, an existential fairy tale and an unforgettable journey in the dark alleys of the human soul.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"""If God controlled time, then the time is pre-decided""","Donnie Darko is a film that was realised way ahead of its time!Brilliant, Intelligent, Captivating, and Enthralling are some terms I would use to describe Donnie Darko. But, even then it doesn't adequately describe how deep, and thought-provoking this film turns out to be.When I first watched Donnie Darko I was a little bemused, but also a little in awe. My mind was always racing to try to recap the story of how it all looped in a complete circle.You could go back and watch this film again to try to get a grasp on the whole in-depth storyline, and I highly recommend it. However, once is enough to open your mind even after the film has finished. It plants many ideas and possibilities in your head about living in a parallel universe.The soundtrack, and score blend into the film beautifully. Donnie Darko is so psychologically clever that it keeps you interested and enthralled at every turn wanting to know how the story will play out.Jake Gyllenhaal wasn't even the reason this film is exceptional even though he does play his role extremely well. It was the plot that was both unpredictable, and fascinating. The dark and emotional themes suited every scene perfectly. The dialogue was expertly written, eerie and inspiring.It seems the collaboration from all those involved with the production of the film was so in sync that it made the finished product a cult classic, and a timeless movie for the ages.Maggie Gyllenhaal, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Jena Malone and James Duval all make appearances in a star-studded cast.I can't recommend this movie enough, It goes down as one of my must-watch films. Go in with realistic expectations, or even better go into this film blind with no backstory whatsoever. And just prepare to be blown away by this thrilling sci-fi masterpiece.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I'm not clever enough to figure it out but........,"I'd watched this film a couple of years ago and never thought much of it. Like another IMDb user states I just thought this was a weird film just for the sake of being weird.In the last four months I have maybe watched it another 20 times, at first out of boredom and then because it dazzled me so much. I like this film so much because I don't get it. I'm not as smart as some of the users of this site so I haven't completely figured it out but I'm certainly working on it. Reading some of the FAQ's hs helped me and I'm going to look into it even more.There are some scenes that seem so powerful and I don't really know why. The scenewhere Jim Cunningham is talking to the school children and Donnie calls him the anti-Christ, the scene where the dance-troup are performing at the talent contest, the scene where donnie tells cherita that its all gonna be OK in the future etc etc.What an unbelievable and inspirational film, I can't wait to read more into it and uncover the depths that I currently don't understand.Michael",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
far away from a perfect ten,"first of all, i agree that this film is in a way highly overrated, but still is a good movie. of course, many of you who scored a ""perfect ten"" for this movie will say that i didn't understand it... oh, but i did. and it isn't too much to understand. i hate those guys who try to find a story where there is not one and try to find out the ""deep meaning"" of each and every detail (of course after they saw the movie and saw the IMDb rating and comments). i accept the fact that many of those who watched this movie really loved it, but i disagree to the fact that some of them believe that we (the ones that found this film to be not a ""genial"" one) didn't understand it and that we are in a way frustrated that this movie has a great rating. like i said before i think this is a good movie, but is far to be a great one (in my opinion the movie is saved by its end, its cast and the ""cute"" bunny). 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Good but Wildly Overrated,"I recently reviewed my DVD of ""Donnie Darko"" and was disappointed. What seemed fresh and engrossing about the film had gone stale over the couple of years that the DVD had stayed in its case.Please don't let me put you off if you haven't seen it yet. ""Donnie Darko"" is well-acted and the bonkers script just manages to avoid disappearing up its own fundament, but it's no classic.Director/writer Richard Kelly didn't waste his time at film school and ""Donnie Darko"" is his first stab at running the whole show. The film is a bold and only slightly self-conscious mix of high school drama, mental illness and metaphysics. Unfortunately it doesn't contain enough movie magic to merit further viewings.

"Obscure and pretentious sci-fi semi-thriller; the box office was bad, but a loyal cult grossly overrates it","The satire is strained and self-satisfied. The scene where the title character berates his teacher for having too simplistic a philosophy sounds like adolescent score-settling.The plotting is dreary. Just when things are about to get exciting, the pace slackens and we have to wait several minutes for things to pick up again.The realistic touches are unbearable. The dinner table banter between brother and sister? The boorish friends' conversation about Smurfs? The dialogue for these scenes is listed on IMDb's ""memorable quotes"" page. Why? We have this half-formed idea that lame insults, or over-serious debates about pop culture refuse, are somehow ""ironic."" And that anything realistic is worth inserting into a movie.Yet, by the end of ""Donnie Darko"" I was somewhat won over. I enjoyed the complicated plot twists, some of the strange images and Michael Andrews's splendid electronic score. But the small cult that champions this film grossly overrates it.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a paranoid schizophrenic named Donnie Darko, who gets along badly with his family, with his teachers and with his classmates; but he does manage to find a sympathetic friend in Gretchen (Jena Malone), who agrees to date him; and he has a compassionate psychiatrist (Katharine Ross), who discovers hypnosis is the means to unlock hidden secrets. His other companion may not be a true ally. Donnie has a friend named Frank, who is either a large purple bunny, or man in a large purple bunny costume. Either way, Donnie is the only one who can see him.Richard Kelly, who wrote, directed and created a webpage to explain everything in a tantalizingly opaque way, seems to think he's being a lot deeper than he is. This is one of those movies that inspire obsessed fans to demand that you see the film many times over, study the obsessed fans' websites about the movie, become an expert on the movie—and only then are you allowed to say you don't like it. Except, in their circular reasoning, not liking it is a sign you haven't studied it enough.This is not ""Hamlet."" Much of the opacity of this movie is the result of sloppiness and pretentiousness. Take the engine that falls off the plane and destroys Donnie's room. Kelly seems to want to leave open the possibility that much of what's happening is all in Donnie's mind and that there is a rational explanation for everything. If so, why present us with an undeniably supernatural event? The plane literally comes out of nowhere.Does the above criticism reveal that I don't get it? Nothing about the movie inspires me to delve deeper into its mystery. I was somewhat entertained, but its cult can have it.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Tries to combine two very different types of films without much success,"The biggest problem with this movie is it can't decide whether it wants to be some Lynchian sci- fi mind bender or a high school black comedy/suburban satire along the lines of Heathers or American Beauty. There are individual scenes that might work well in each, but as a whole it comes off as jumbled and tonally inconsistent. Richard Kelly seems to think there's significant thematic crossover here, but it's unclear what he thinks these themes even are. The famous ending is actually pretty easy to figure out, but the movie insists on throwing in some poorly defined and meaningless rules to appear more complex than it actually is, and then ruining this effect by literally spelling them out on the screen. It clarifies nothing, just demonstrates that the filmmakers are terrified of people not getting that there's supposed to be symbolism and time travel elements. The use of pop music to force the mood at times is distracting and dates the movie.This movie is a sort of half-hearted attempt at Maze cinema (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Mulholland Drive, or Last Year at Marienbad for example) that tries to awkwardly marry certain elements of these quite challenging films with aesthetics and archetypes we're more used to. If it was a little more straightforward it would make a good dark comedy about a mentally ill teen. If it were a lot less conventional in its choices it might make a good art film. Instead the result is entertaining and a bit fun to ponder but ends up feeling a little pretentious. A teen movie, a political satire, and a pseudo-philosophical time travel enigma are all rolled up into this promising, puzzling, but ultimately uncertain movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

It isn't often that you go to a film that you feel is something that hasn't ever been thought of before.

Film Fact. At the films first public showing of the film at the Sundance Film Festival, one of the reels was thread backwards and upside down. The caused a 1 hour delay in the middle of the film.

"Good film, annoying reviewers","i find it unbelievable that someone can come to this site, look at a film that has an average rating of 8.3 (from over 32000 votes) and have the audacity to comment that ""there's no accounting for taste"" when they think the film is rubbish. i'm not saying we're right and you're wrong, but you don't even provide a decent argument as to why you don't like it, you just call it a confused mess. clearly you didn't even understand the film or take the time to try and figure it out. there's a reason why this film is loved by so many people and you've just outright refused to figure out why that is, and, in your inability to try and understand the film, you've become frustrated like a child and decided that we all lack taste i don't think this film is Shakespeare. i'm not even sure if it all adds up without loopholes. but i do know that i thoroughly enjoyed it, even more so when i looked into it. ultimately a film is a piece of art. art is supposed to have emotional impact, and this film did, with over 32000 people. i'm sure you're list of favourite films includes the godfather, apocalypse now... lots of really highbrow films with epic and wonderful tales. because this film is a little different, is written and directed by a new face, stars a young cast, featured patrick swayze, didn't feature al pacino, wasn't directed by martin scorcese, and wasn't scored by the London philarmonic orchestra (or something similar) you write it off. i hate you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A masterpiece,"Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled teenager living in suburbia. He is on medication for psychological illnesses and he sleepwalks a lot. The film opens with him waking up in the countryside after another night of it. But the sleepwalking will save his life. In a freak accident, the engine from the wing of an airline jet falls from the sky and crashes through the roof of his bedroom. Following this incident, things begin to get a bit unhinged for Donnie. He starts to see a mysterious man in a rabbit costume, who tells him that the world is going to end in 28 days. This starts a series of events that involve Donnie with time travel, worm holes and other dimensions, all while he struggles with his mental health and all the other standard trials and tribulations of coming-of-age.""Donnie Darko"" is a masterpiece of a film made on a shoe-string budget that faded into obscurity upon it's release in 2001, but has deservedly attracted a cult following and garnered much critical appraise. With that assembled cast, it is a wonder it went unnoticed. Holmes Osbourne is superb as Donnie's ""super cool"" dad and his mother is well played by Mary McDonnell, while Patrick Swayze has no trouble slotting in here as a mysterious confidence-speaker, a great performance from the late heavyweight. Drew Barrymore is another notable performance as an English teacher. Jake Gyllenhaal has since made a name for himself as one of the finest actors in Hollywood. He was 20 years-old filming this, and what a start to a career that would lead on to leading roles in ""Jarhead"", ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Southpaw"". His sister, Maggie, stars aswell in an early performance.Richard Kelly was a young man directing this, but what passion he displayed. An original and daring film, he would've known that he was doomed to commerical failure. I've only ever viewed the Director's Cut of the film, but I don't believe there is too much difference. A great soundtrack accompanies many dream-like and brilliantly staged scenes - the opening itself is beautiful, and how about the sweeping camera work of the school courtyard accompanied by the song ""Head Over Heels"" by Tears for Fears. ""Donnie Darko"" is an all round winner. The acting, music, directing, cinematography and, most of all, the writing. The cinema scene with ""The Evil Dead"" and Frank stands out in my mind as one of the best scenes in film history - ""Why do you wear that stupid man suit?"" It is a sort of climax to all the mystery, and again it is helped by a powerful performance by a young, casual and brooding Gyllenhaal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Mindbendingly good fun,"Definitely worth watching, it has some extremely dark moments (pun intended) along with highly humorous situations. I especially loved the character of the so-called motivational speaker, along with his middle-aged religious nutball crazy housewife believers.Donnie himself is played very well. He's a highly intelligent kid who gets thrown into a very weird situation involving a temporal anomaly ... what happens for the next month just doesn't make any sense to him but he manages to glue all the parts together towards the end.Actually explaining anything about this movie before you see it could really spoil it. For me, it came on the Super Channel here in Tokyo and I had never seen it before - I was pleasantly surprised.I guess the comparison to make would be with 12 Monkeys - if you didn't understand or enjoy the time-jumping shenanigans in that film, you won't like it in Donnie Darko.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"""It's meant to be ironic...""","Certainly the plot is up to conjecture--and personal taste will have to determine how successful it ultimately is--but ""Donnie Darko"" is an intriguing mind-puzzle, oft-times disguised as a desensitized youth movie but one with constant layers of subtext. It is sad that a youth movie today hasn't much to reward us with except depression, destruction and death, yet it's refreshing to see something so challenging, weaving its story carefully and with a stylish spell. I haven't much cared for Jake Gyllenhaal's work in most movies, but here his heavy-lidded stare is used to good effect; he doesn't go full-throttle with the performance, but he does reach in and surprise us with a range of emotions. Drew Barrymore (also a producer) is just the opposite: as one of Donnie's teachers, a free spirit-type, she allows fear to suppress her natural instincts as an actress (how's that for irony?), and nearly every reaction shot of her rings false because she's playing to the camera. The supporting performances seem dead-on, and the picture manages a fine walk between darkly comic and deranged. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"The director lost the plot, literally.","Jake Gyllenhaal has played a few oddballs, but he may have pulled off his most convincing weirdo in teenager Donnie Darko, complete with a beautifully eerie smile. The film, which starts with a mysterious jet engine falling from the sky, keeps you intrigued to what exactly is going in the suburbs of Middlesex.But at the end, you'll be left scratching your head. Donnie Darko is unique in that it's impossible to understand the plot from the film alone. The complete ambiguity to what actually happens in the film has driven film-goers mad and a glut of fan theories to fill this void have helped make it a cult classic.By 'complete ambiguity', I'm not referring to a cliff-hanger or two alternative explanations playing out side by side. Key elements that explain the plot of the film were omitted from the theatrical release and it's only with the release of the director's cut, and other post-release tidbits, that we can actually decipher what the hell Donnie Darko was actually about.Perhaps Donnie Darko shows that the journey is just as important as the destination, for though we are left stumped where we've arrived after 2 hours in the strange Donnie Darko universe, we're cognisant that we've mostly enjoyed the ride.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A waste of time, film and effort","Although I do not recommend this film, neither do I recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie.  Though I have not given away the ending, or most of the plot twists, this movie would be best viewed without any prior information. It's hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film Donnie Darko, as there are many to deal with.  Richard Kelly, in his first feature film, seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage, late-night stoner diatribes, self-righteous justifications and inoffensive, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teen-angst dramas; then mashed them into a single two hour package with a sci-fi twist.  The result is deeply distressing-- for all the wrong reasons.  The film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning, to make them sympathize with one-dimensional characters, and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of unreconciled loose ends, by hiding it under a veneer of CGI effects and neo-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man, committed to therapy, misunderstood by his friends, and rendered hostile and disaffected by his suburban life.  We are meant to feel that he is more intelligent than his schoolmates, although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make. For example, when one of his friends comes up with an absurd theory about the Smurfs, and Donnie counters with a theory of his own, his friend complains about Donnie acting ""all smart.""  Donnie's speech, however, is no smarter than that of his friend-- just angrier.  The only clear evidence of his intelligence is his principal's description of his standardized test scores as `intimidating;' but given the director's slant against simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), this is a poor substitute for character development. Donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems, which are not addressed directly in this film.  In fact, the entire issue of the drugs is understated, and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost.  The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all of this may be a product of his imagination, is pushed into the background, making the film 100 percent science fiction. This would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the ""science"" behind the ""fiction"" is very shaky.  The explanations of time travel are weak, at best sounding like detached, uninformed rambling.  We get the idea that the film's writer once read a book about time travel or a few chapters, and can't quite remember how it worked, but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film.  The scientific portion, as a result, depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved (at one point, a teacher discussing time travel states that if he continues to speak on the subject, he'd be fired.  Apparently no further explanation is needed). Donnie's dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions.  The justification for these actions is a tricky business. He damages his school, but it's okay, because his school doesn't treat him like a person.  His punishment of a creepy self-esteem advocate (somewhat similar to Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia) results in the man's public humiliation.  But should the audience believe that Donnie is some sort of avenging angel, striking out against ignorance and debauchery?  He himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact. Aside from these flaws, the film is riddled with flat, uninteresting generalizations of humanity.  The story is set in 1988, just before the Bush/Dukakis election, and the director touches on this point during the film.  The focus, however, extends exactly this far: Donnie's gruff, blue collar father is voting for Bush, while his free-spirited, rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis.  There is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement here; simply a statement of the obvious. The former are not necessary to make a good film, but the latter should be left out.  Likewise, Donnie's heartfelt speech about not being able to lump all human emotions into the bland categories of ""fear and ""love;"" this doesn't ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding. Everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions, and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless. Mr. Kelly gives homage to several symbols of 80's pop culture in his film: E.T., Stephen King, the Smurfs, Back to the Future.  At it's heart, this film feels like the director's homage to himself, a collection of his own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, affirmations and disenchantments, roughly stitched together by untrained hands.  Entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions, seemingly because the director likes the songs.  Characters who have little to no bearing on the plot (including the archetypal bully, fat girl, and right-wing idiot teacher) are given unnecessary focus, because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow.  The awkward mess that is Donnie Darko leaves us wondering if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas left in his head to make another film, or if he has wasted all his creativity in one pointless, cluttered, meandering effort.My rating: 1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A Thought-Provoking Modern Masterpiece,"(Note: Review is based on the Director's Cut version)This film is one of those films you truly have to see to both believe and understand. To be perfectly honest I wasn't quite sure what to make of this film the first time I saw it due to its, for lack of a better term, strangeness but upon repeated viewings the film begins to make sense and you'll begin to appreciate the intricate plotting of Richard Kelly's script, the fine acting of the cast, and the overall excellence of the film Donnie Darko.Jake Gyllenhaal is the one who carries the film and his performance is nothing short of hypnotic to watch. Gyllenhaal is perfect in the role as the weird, troubled, and confused title character. Gyllenhaal never steps out of character and it is his performance that keeps you glued to the screen even during some of the film's weirdest and confusing moments. In short, the talent that he has that would appear during the years that followed this film's release is seen here in an inkling.The rest of the cast is not very far behind Gyllenhaal in terms of their performances. Jena Malone gives a surprising performance as Donnie's girlfriend and she is in many ways the emotional anchor of the film. She is also the source of sanity for Donnie throughout the film as it goes along and even she is drawn into whatever is effecting Donnie. Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell play Donnie's parents who seem not to be sure of what to make of their son's unusual hallucinations. Added to the family is Donnie's sisters played by the seemingly innocent Daveigh Chase and with, a nice sense of sibling rivalry, by Gyllenhall's sister Maggie. Add to these appearances by Katharine Ross, Drew Barrymore & Noah Wyle as the authority figures of Donnie's life plus Patrick Swayze as some self-motivator and the highly unusual appearance of Frank (played by James Duval) and you get a spectacular cast.And now onto the script. Richard Kelly has managed to create a script that is both gripping, well-textured, and confusing as hell upon the first viewing (or two). The script is layer upon layer of story, character development, and a plot involving parallel universes and time travel (I think). The script explores issues of acceptance, existence, and everything short of and including the meaning of life. Not east stuff to get the first time around but as I wrote above, repeated viewings makes it easier to understand (plus the fact that Richard Kelly himself has said the film is open to one's own interpretation). In short, the most confusing film script since 2001: A Space Odyssey is the only way I can really describe Donnie Darko.Beyond the script lies a film masterpiece. The film is beautifully photographed from start to finish, starting with the sweeping opening shot of Donnie and ending with the waving between characters at the end of the film. The music score for the film is an interesting combination of well-chosen pop songs (including the opening song ""Never Tear Us Apart"" by INXS and the hypnotic ""Mad World"") and a well done score by Michael Andrews to create a hypnotic soundtrack to an hypnotic film. Add to this some weird special effects to Donnie's visions and it is a journey intowell something (as I said this is one of those ""you figure out what it means"" films).Overall, Donnie Darko is a masterpiece of modern film-making. With an exceptional performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, fine performances from the rest of the cast, an intricately layered script, beautiful photographed, well scored, and being truly hypnotic, Donnie Darko is a must see for anyone who wants to take a though-provoking two plus hours and go into the unknown. See this as soon as possible. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This movie changed me,"I actually feel quite sick when I think back at the times before I had seen this movie and I also feel sick at the fact that I had not seen this earlier.

I had no idea what it was about, no idea what I was getting into, I simply wrote down a list of moves I had to see and this one happened to be first on the list. I was expecting your simple modern day drama about an upset teen with a love interest. Little did I know what I was about to embark on. This movie has it all. Hallucinations, Time Travel, Comedy, Horror, Romance you name it. The characters are so deep and interesting, it makes me sad that I will never see a better movie. Richard Kelly (director) obviously reviewed every scene thoroughly and did not make one loophole, mistake or anything for the audience to complain about. I watched the directors cut first and I would stress others do so also, but I don't think the ending effect of the movie differs between editions. 6 months onwards from seeing this movie, I must have watched it 12 times, I am constantly quoting this movie subconsciously and thinking about making other similar movies.

Not as clever as it pretends to be,"Jake Gyllenhall stars in this mix of sci-fi, horror and mystery. And he does well, creating the memorable character of a troubled teen. Where the film falls down is the the way the plot mixes in pseudo science and pseudo religion. It is OK to do that if the pace of a movie is fast enough so that the viewer is not bothered but this is not the case here - it is a slow movie with a disappointing climax. If you are going to use this kind psychobabble you should at least make sure your plot holes are covered and again this is not the case. The director follows the standard method of a countdown to give the film some forward motion, a sense of increasing tension. The principle character is informed that the world will end in 28 days. The problem is that after a while, this countdown seems interminably slow - When the screen said there were 12 days to go I was disappointed, I was hoping it was at least within a week of the climax. There were other disappointments, the man in the scary bunny suit was certainly scary-looking but there were no moments of real terror, which is what I was expecting.

time travel incidental,"i've seen donnie darko several times and i think the time travel questions in the movie are incidental. i think the entire movie is basically donnie realizing he's going to die and him fighting his fate. he is shown, through the characters in the movie, what could happen if he chooses not to die. i also think there's his fear of dying alone without wrapping up the loose ends of his life that has made him create the distraction of time travel to try and explain the unexplainable. i think the characters in the alternate universe are symbolic of his fears and questions about life and he's trying to resolve those fears and questions before he actually dies. that's why i think he laughs at the end....b/c he was able to resolve the loose ends and die without regret.my simple theory does not answer several questions though.......part of it is we have no idea what donnie's life was like before the jet engine crashed through his room. so all of the people in the alternate universe are probably people he had some sort of relationship with previous to the start of the movie and that's how they play certain roles in the alternate universe. i don't think there was any literal time travel happening. i think the time travel story line was just donnie trying to explain the unexplainable; i.e. the mystery of death. i think the time travel storyline was created by donnie. i think frank was symbolic to donnie of his fate. i also think the portals that came from several characters during the movie are symbolic of that person's soul or their path through life. oh yeah, and i also think that donnie shoots frank at the end of the movie b/c he realizes that the universe was not real but all in donnie's head just before he's to die.i loved the symbolism throughout the entire movie and wonder about some of them: when the two teachers are in the lounge and the male teacher says ""donnie darko?"" and drew barrymore's character says ""i know"". i have no idea what that scene means in the movie.also, the jogger in the orange suit is staring at donne and his girlfriend when he wants to kiss her and then that same jogger is standing out front of donnie's house during the halloween party. he also flashes his flashlight into the camera, similar imagery that frank's glowing eye had throughout the alternate universe story.also, the scene after donnie and gretchen walk down the stairs at the party and donnie follows the portal to the kitchen where there's a note that says ""frank was here, went to get beer"".....there was a strange cut after that and then suddenly gretchen was standing there and it seemed like some time had passed so what happened during that span of time?i don't know....just some thoughts. my simple explanation doesn't explain lots of other things in the movie",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

An impressive coming of age story,"In my opinion there are two types of writing. Controlled Writing where the superego controls the pen. The other is where the imagination (the id) takes over. This was id writing. Uncontrolled, wild and chaotic.In many instances this type of writing doesn't work - its energetic and vibrant, but without focus it just winds up a mess.This film makes it work however for the following reasons.This is the tale of a young man, a 'coming of age' story, and the story of most young men are tinged with wildness and chaos. Thus the premise and themes fit perfectly with the wildly imaginative way in which the story was told.It speaks to young men in the way a good 'coming of age' story is meant to. Its rare, I can only think of a few films that do it well: Good will hunting, fight club, star wars and now donnie darko. I'm in my mid 20s and looking back, the fear, distress and sheer confusion of teenage life is always a brilliantly painful experience. But this distress (the movie fight club refers to it as the ""great depression"") is incredibly heightened in this film due to the sense of impending doom that Donnie feels throughout. Thus i ask you :Is this not the way all of us were feeling post 9/11 ?Its timing was perfect. A simple message powerfully expressed to me is the height of great writing. Everyone understands a simple point and everyone (no matter their education/literacy) can be moved by it.Now here are the Cons:OK so he stole the rabbit from alice in wonderland/the matrix and the time travel discussion is pretty juvenile, but then what talk amongst teenagers isn't? If they spoke like college professorsa) the characters don't seem like realistic teensb) you lose your target audienceThe director's cut honestly sucked major ass. It showed that the director is a little clueless about effective ways of film-making. they took out some of the great songs that made the original really gel and replaced them with a classical score in parts that clearly didn't work. Also some weird kiddy kaleidoscope images were thrown in that were a fake ass attempt to look like the closing images of 2001 a space odyssey. The directors cut was a travesty that should not have been allowed. An obvious attempt to make some quick cash based on this film being a huge hit at the video rentals arena (it didn't do any business on the screen 1st time around). I think the directors cut version should be burned.But hes still young and allowed to make mistakes. As are we all. I'm looking forward to his future work. This film may be a ""one hit wonder"", or it might not. But no pun intended - only time will tell.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A complex and surprising horror thriller with a surreal psychological twist,"Stylish , thrilling debut by writer/director Richard Kelly that like ¨Mulholland drive¨ or ¨The Ice Storm¨ leaves much unexplained as dark doings occur in an idyllic suburb . A high-concept, supernatural/thriller, it is set circa 1988 , and the title character is a moody adolescent in small town America . Stars an eccentric family formed by Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), his parents : Eddie (Holmes Osborne) , Rose (Mary McDonnel) and sisters Elizabeth (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Samantha (Daveigh Chase) . After a near fatal incident in which a jet engine falls on his house , Donnie Darko suffers schizopherenic hallucinations of a spooky figure warning of imminent apocalypse . Donnie saves his life when a jet engine falls from a plane , landing squarely in the teen's bedroom . Even more mysteriously, no plane has reported a missing engine , which turns out to be just one of the many fantastic events that may be real or imagined . Along the way , he's adviced by his psychiatrist (Katharine Ross) who finds out his bizarre and strange behaviour . Life is one long insane trip !. Some people just have better directions !. You can never go too far !. What would you do if you knew the future?. Be Afraid of the Dark ! Why are you wearing that stupid man suit? Dark. Darker. Darko.Aptly called Darko family is plenty of complex roles , including the gifted but schizophrenic Donnie well played by Jake Gyllenhaal, a teenager able to see the future with aid of a life-size , doomsday-spewing rabbit named Frank . MacDonnelL and Osborne are both nice as Donnie's upper-middle class Republican parents. And Katharine Ross is Donnie's psychiatrist who discovers he's sleepwalking on Frank's orders . Along with other notorious secondary actors , such as : Noah Wyle, Beth Grant, Jena Malone , Drew Barrymore , Seth Rogen , Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze . Donnie's Richard Kelly's storyline is an over-ambitious mess, dragging in time travel , high school politics , premonition and the presidential chances of Michael Dukakis , but his assured filmmaking compensates . Like Harvey on anti-psychotic meds, this challenging and twisted movie is worth the effort . The tone alternates nimbly between horror and comedy and two early sequences sequences combines music (Echo and the Bunnymen's Killing Moon and Tears for Fears) image to splendid effect .This flawed but promising debut was competently written/directed by Richard Kelly who received only $9,000 to write and direct this Donnie Darko (2001) with a budget of 4.5 million dollars. A successful cult phenomenon film that returned in summer 2004 with a director's cut re-release. Kelly also produced 3 films : Rogues Gallery (2010) , World's Greatest Dad (2009) , I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell (2009) ) and directed a decent third feature length film The box (2009). And writing Domino (2005) a True Romance-style action/crime film for Tony Scott. Donnie Darko rating : 6.5/10. Well worth watching , above average . The flick will appeal cult movies fans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"A weirdo, narcissistic collage of failure","""Donnie Darko"" is the end result of 47 Weekly World News headlines strewn together in random order.  Over one hour and 45 minutes, it rams together time travel, a 6-foot imaginary rabbit, a Tony Robbins-esque motivational speaker with a secret (Patrick Swayze?!?), hypnotism, an elementary school dance troupe and a stray jet engine.What does it all mean?  Not much.  Ham-fisted, nail-on-the-head symbolism practically smashes you in the face.  A creepy fat girl dressed as an angel. A statue with a dog's head and a human body.  An old woman nicknamed ""Grandma Death"" who keeps checking her mailbox.  An eye wound.  The creepy fat girl's earmuffs.  Heck, one of the ending shots is an M.C. Escher drawing.The filmmakers would also like you to marvel at their camera techniques. Look, it's tilted!  Now it's going fast.  Now, slow.  Wait, now it's turning upside down!  Aren't we creative?And be sure to spot the zillion story lines, characters and scenes ripped from other (read: better) films.  The courageous English teacher (""Dead Poets Society"").  The watery tentacles (""The Abyss"").  An imaginary rabbit (""Harvey"").  The lead character, wearing a gray, hooded sweatshirt, and his Halloween-costumed friends riding bikes (""E.T."").  Meditation on the sex lives of cartoon characters (""Mallrats"").So basically, you're left with a sullen Jake Gyllenhaal moping his way through someone's bad LSD-trip.

A murky masterpiece that turns your world upside down,"The title of the movie indeed suggests either some superhero flick or a fantasy mixed with eerie components and incidentally there is a partial truth in this statement.This is one of the earliest works for Jake Gyllenhaal, when he was trying to pick up his style that up to this moment is varying and tempestuous like an ocean in the storm. The shtick of this performance was a stupefied look preceding a wicked smile before the trouble. In fact, it is tailored so good that the emotions slip onto the viewers face creating a sense of a mischief coming alive.Up to this point I have seen a lot of plot twists and mind-bending stories but this deserves a place in the front row of a puzzling movie family photo. The rug of event is being weaved so skillfully only to show that in the end it is not what you have expected and you get a cool sweater instead of the floor covering item.Waking up from this dream I still cannot believe what I saw: convoluted dark thoughts of the writer crawled on the screen and shocked the audience leaving a heavy Imprint in the memory.

Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?,"Writer / director Richard Kelly has created here what can only be described as an instant cult favourite type of film, one that may drive some viewers crazy, while endlessly fascinating others. What it's like is a puzzle, a puzzle made of quirky, offbeat pieces, some of them with a very high degree of unreality. This viewer is not quite sure WHAT to make of it, but believes that, no doubt, it will be the kind of film that will prove to be continuously mesmerizing on repeat viewings, with elements that he may not have picked up on the first time. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the title character, a moody, troubled high school student who starts experiencing hallucinations. Chief among them is a demonic ""rabbit"" named Frank (James Duval) who informs Donnie that the world will be coming to an end within a month. Taking place in 1988, with the Dukakis / Bush presidency race serving as a backdrop, this goes to great lengths to contrast the many aspects of Donnies' life. What is real? What's illusion? Certainly some viewers will have an incredible time examining all of the details and clues. Hell, even when this film is over, it's not necessarily providing a cut and dried explanation for everything. Kelly utilizes every filmmaking trick at his disposal, and does very well at keeping things suitably enigmatic. He also gets strong performances out of his interestingly chosen cast: Jena Malone as Donnies' new girlfriend, Drew Barrymore (also the executive producer), Beth Grant, and Noah Wyle as teachers, Daveigh Chase and Gyllenhaals' real-life sister Maggie as Donnies' siblings, Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell as his parents, Katharine Ross as his psychiatrist, Patrick Swayze as a self-help guru, and Seth Rogen (in his film debut) as a thuggish schoolmate. The use of soundtrack music is eclectic, and the visual effects are a collective knockout. As a horror fan this viewer had to also enjoy a viewing of ""The Evil Dead"" within the film as a story detail. All of this is nothing if not ambitious, slowly and steadily working its way towards its conclusion, incorporating ideas such as time travel into its provocative mix. It may not be for all tastes, but it's bound to get people talking, which of course isn't exactly a bad thing. All in all, it's well worth a look for adventurous film lovers.

A Surreal Symphony of Sadness,"At first glance, you might dismiss Donnie Darko as just another teen drama, but oh, how wrong you would be. Set in the late '80s, this film is a dark, melancholic journey into the mind of a troubled teenager named Donnie Darko, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who just so happens to be grappling with existential dread, visions of a menacing bunny named Frank, and the impending end of the world. You know, the usual teenage stuff. Director Richard Kelly's narrative skillfully blurs the lines between reality and hallucination, leaving you questioning what's real and what's a product of Donnie's troubled psyche.Gyllenhaal's performance as Donnie is nothing short of mesmerizing. He's not your typical teenage protagonist. He's a complex character drowning in a sea of existential questions and inner turmoil. He sees things, hears things, and questions everything. He captures the essence of a young man teetering on the edge of sanity with a mix of vulnerability and intensity. You can't help but empathize with his struggle to make sense of a world that often feels absurd and meaningless. The supporting cast, including Jena Malone, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Drew Barrymore, adds depth to the film's eccentric ensemble of characters. The film skillfully draws parallels between their surreal experiences and the dissonance of the world around them. It's a commentary on the fragility of our existence and the arbitrary nature of fate.The film's soundtrack, with its haunting melodies and '80s hits, complements the surreal atmosphere perfectly, especially the beautiful rendition of Mad World. As you watch Donnie's surreal odyssey unfold, the melancholy notes of this song seep into your soul, creating a seamless blend of visual and auditory melancholia. It's as if the music becomes an integral part of the narrative, guiding you through the labyrinth of Donnie's troubled mind.Donnie Darko is a film that refuses to spoon-feed its audience. It revels in ambiguity and invites interpretation. It's a puzzle waiting to be solved, a labyrinth of teenage angst, time travel, and cosmic uncertainty. It's a mad, mad world out there, and this film captures that essence with haunting precision.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Just another humble opinion...,"This was a brilliant film.  The plot wasn't confusing, as some have said. If you have a brain that is capable of processing thought, and doesn't require a movie to completely spell out itself in simple terms, you will understand.  You get out of it what you want.  You can go many places with the interpretations of this movie, and that MAY require you looking beyond the surface a little.  With movies like Vanilla Sky that make pathetic attempts at being a surreal feeling movie, its good to see something like Donnie Darko show how it is done (WITHOUT Cameron and Tommy).Josh",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Confusingly Brilliant,"Donnie Darko is a very thought provoking movie. It starts off just odd with your typical socially awkward teenager and a family that seems very stereotypical and standard for any Hollywood movie. It isn't until Donnies first ""dream"" with Frank that the movie takes a very serious turn from your typical Hollywood cinema. These ""dreams"" that Donnie experiences are very eerie and put the audience in a sense of unease and unknowing as to what is going on. I wont go into a lot of detail to avoid spoilers but this is very much purposeful for later in the movie. The idea of having this ""imaginary friend"" from a teenager helps explain that while adults an try and find ways to help, they will never truly know what is going on in a teenagers head.This is a theme throughout the entire film. The mind of a teenager cannot fully be understood unless you're in their shoes and experiencing everything they are. This and the theory of time travel that gets brought up throughout the film add to even more confusion. While the directors cut helps explain all this confusion, the theatrical cut really makes the audience think more. Trying to understand the teenage mind is tough enough to understand, but adding a more complex topic as well makes for a very confusing movie but is very effective at making the audience think. This movie combines these elements expertly in a way that is absolutely confusing but once you take the time to think about what you are seeing, it all starts to slowly make sense. Donnie Darko is definitely a movie that needs to be seen more than once in order to understand all the elements at play.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Boy named Donnie gets a mysterious message from a creepy bunny and tries to figure out what it all means.,"I would call Donnie Darko more of an ""experience"" than a movie. What I mean is, I don't think it was made for the casual movie watcher and I also think that if you just watch it once without any sort of effort put into mentally engaging with it afterward, I don't think it's much more than a confusing movie. After first watching it, I felt quite a bit confused and overloaded with information (and feelings), not really understanding much of what I had just seen.I let it sit for a day and then chewed on it and came up with my own theory and narrative of what i thought happened. Then I watched it a second time and my theory was not DISproven. Then I watched the Director's Cut and I'm grateful I did that because it had scenes that were cut out of the first version and also excerpts from the book referenced in the movie. The director's cut showed a different narrative to the one I theorized, but I actually liked both narratives. I'm glad I came up with my own and I'm also glad I watched the director's cut.All in all, it was a fun experience and I would recommend it for people who like to engage with movies and who like to both try and figure things out and who enjoy discovering new things along the way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

If you try to reduce it to something solid, without the layers of requirements to resolve the tangent universe, it comes down to some book written by Roberta Sparrow.I agree with the other guy. Why would this film be in the top 100? It's a long winded explanation of what takes most English teachers 10 minutes to spit out. Deus ex machina. But not exactly. It's more like creating a PROBLEM rather than a solution.Why would this problem exist? Who is Roberta Sparrow? How did she come to write this book? These are the real questions. They're left unanswered of course. And I guess the puzzles are intriguing enough to carry the film. The puzzles were distractions to me, nonsense games that are never quite resolved.I like the movie well enough. I like it better the more I see it. But it's still just an okay film. Twelve Monkeys is a close relative, much superior. Even The Jacket is better.This movie cannot possibly stand on its own, which is another problem. Explanations and questions are all over the net, which is both really fascinating and absurd at the same time.

One of the worst movies I have seen.,"I have no doubt in my mind that the director of this film is an idiot.Absolute garbage: the whole film. Drew Barrymore's performance was nothing short of the worst thing I'd seen. I finished watching the film with horror. It was that awful.Let me be frank, I think it's totally the director's fault. The film's premise is interesting and the plot twists had the potential to be fun, but the entire endeavor was marred by an inherent lack of intelligence.The director, I have no doubt, saw Donnie Darko as a superheroic, Christ-like figure who was doomed to sacrifice himself for the good of humanity. The film attempts to use magical realism to make its point. Your thinking: Never Ending Story, Star Wars, Willow... If only. I didn't like those films much either, but at least they weren't trying as hard as Donnie Darko to be internally consistent. Donnie Darko is very American, very Christian, and entirely too self-righteous in its portrayal of ""truth"". What's worse, it's plot has holes large enough to pass elephants through, so the filmmakers don't even have a right to act that way. In a nutshell, the plot has NO LOGICAL CONSISTENCY. The characters are undeveloped and the acting is reminiscent of a high school play. Not to mention the whole premise of the movie centers around an acceptance of ""time travel"" that is entirely pedestrian. Yes, modern physics speaks about time travel. No, it looks NOTHING LIKE what is presented in Donnie Darko. I wouldn't care, but they are attempting to actually present it like they are saying something along those lines. Like a B-Movie Science Fiction Flick from the 50s, the movie throws scientific and deductive ideas around without actually having researched them or patiently thinking about the consequences. I don't in principle mind when people get things wrong, but this movie comes across as a self-righteous attempt to be right. When you're trying to be right and the stuff you include can immediately be identified as eyerollingly incorrect, that's when I begin to get stomach aches. Wolfgang Pauli summed up their premise well, ""That's not right. That's not even wrong."" Instead the filmmaker has spent research on figuring out what the smurfs were all about. Excuse me for rolling my eyes.The director could have gone with struggling with Darko's mental instability. No, instead he tries to paint a hero in a world that's full of idiots who can't save themselves.It's a painful movie to watch. On more than one occasion I simply wanted to throttle everyone involved in the production. If you want to be annoyed, then watch this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

this movie is a great experience,"Both by the plot and the amazing production, it has an great cast, lines with outstanding phrases, a nostalgic photography and the soundtrack is just perfect so much that it matches the story which is exciting and you'll probably want to watch it again because of the complex script and many theories about the ending and meaning, also it's fun and delightful to watch at the same time it's kinda scary, I love the critical content tho",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Enchanting and entertaining but a bit convoluted,"I, like many other people, was very confused about what exactly took place in the storyline of this movie all the way up until the end. I highly recommend finding the full passages from ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" online and reading it. It gives a good explanation of what exactly took place in this film and once I understood it I was able to fully appreciate it. But even before I did so, it was still the type of film that kept you watching and entertained even though you didn't really know what the hell was going on. That may have been part of the its allure though, the not knowing but really wanting to figure it out. Either way, it's fun to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Addicting Film,"Donnie Darko directed by Richard Kelly is a fast-paced Fantasy that centers around the experiences of the main character Donald Darko. This movie brings forward a vast expanse of elements that makes it very enjoyable to watch. Although not a horror movie, many scenes in the film are highly suspenseful and leave the viewer shaking in their seat. The very well written story line is complemented nicely by big name actors. Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Donnie really does an excellent job at expressing the internal issues the character is having. I personally enjoyed the story and for sure need to watch it many times over to catch all of the subtle hints leading to the climax of the film.
Throughout the film, many cinematic elements leaped out of the screen at me. The cinematography was beautifully executed. Many scenes in the movie were filmed in a way that exposed a different side of the protagonist. These scenes seemed to highlight a struggle that Donnie was facing. The lighting also played a huge part in the aid of the telling of the story. Many traditionally ""bright"" moments were left dark. This darkness gave the viewer a huge insight for what was being felt and what was to come.
In short, I recommend this movie to anyone. With an addicting story line, beautiful camera work, and amazing acting, Donnie Darko will be added to my list of all time great movies. This film twisted the traditional form of film making, and will stick in my head for a long time!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Turning Point in Film History,"I have no doubt that, like Velvet Underground's first record, this film will be more or less ignored on release and then, ten years from now, cited by most major filmmakers as a primary influence.Richard Kelly appears to have poured so much of his own heart and soul onto the screen, filtered through some type of madness, that the occasional rough spot and awkward silence only ads to the impact of your film experience -- you sort of cling to every tiny moment of mundane he gives you just the way that a person experiencing the type of madness poor Donnie Darko would do and then, bam, you realize you've been sucked in!And please ignore the reviews out there that say this film is about (a) a bunny rabbit, (b) time travel, (c) the end of the world.  That is sort of like saying ""Blue Velvet"" is about a murder....  This movie is about being young, being confused, and being aware suddenly that you've got to put down that self-help book and find a way to actually connect to people (before you die).And, yech, I know this review isn't really doing the film justice -- I just hope I've intrigued you enough to go out and take a look at it.Okay, best wishes, Sondra",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Garbage, Junk Movie","A film about an 'axe wielding' kid and a 'demonic bunny' is not conventional stuff. But outside the box is good. However 10,000 miles outside the box, is garbage! The problem with this film is all of its 'rubbish' and 'garbage'.It begins with 'the jet engine' which you have no clue about until it finishes so that's garbage. But even when you account for that there's still all that other stuff that has lengthy explanations but no real meaning so that's all 'garbage' too.The writer/director of this 'garbage' has crafted it in such a way that one asks if it's really garbage and not in fact misunderstood 'art', obviously everyone who 'worships' this 'gobbledygook' some how understands it's every aspect because it speaks to them. But that's rubbish because even the 'creator' of this 'junk' doesn't know what he's talking about.It's clear as crystal this film is just an 'orgy' of every thought Richard Kelly ever had. That's why there's half a million half baked ideas 'scattered' and 'interwoven' in to the stories already too multifaceted ""basic"" premise. That thing your English teacher tells you not to do ""was it all a dream?"" is one of two front running conclusions this film leaves you pondering too. To make this movie even worse I actually believe the later. Because how else can you explain the fact that was his mother's flight! Unless of course you just accept it on a whim like everything else from this film.Conversely this garbage has 'extremely' funny mini stories throughout. The kiddie porn ring is hilarious! Sparkle motion is outrageous! The fear/love line discussion is interesting. The Smurf speech! Katharine Ross as Donnie's placebo prescribing physiatrist is a welcomed sight. But these are all just 'great moments. Good television commercials are great moments. It doesn't save this garbage from itself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"One of my favorite movies, based on experience","Recently had wadched this masterpiece for the first time and was very impressed. So, it is basically about time travel, but unlike Back to future, or Interstellar, this one focusing on psychological aspect of characters. Characters feels real, Donnies is relatable, the only thing is the donnies gf is kinda worse written than Donnie, or Lit. Teacher. First part of movie can be slow and boring for some people, but for me atmosphere save that. Some also can complaint about overall darkness and dark unpleasant palette, it is obviously ment to be, but yeah, sometimes i would prefer picture to be a little bit more visible. But why is this 10/10? Because of a conclusion, conclusion of Donnie Darko gave me Se7en type of vibe, it is very complexive, every thing that u have heared, or seen in the movie was indeed important, i was impressed, like i already said in the begining.

"Not for me, but willing to say try it.","I heard a lot of hype before I saw this film but literally no details so when I eventually did watch it I was a pretty blank canvas.Upon finishing it I told my friend I wasn't crazy about it to which he immediately asked me if I got what it's about. I gave him the gist and he agreed I had it right, it just didn't speak to me. The friend in mention is of genuine taste, a VERY tell it like it is type and would NEVER say something was good to go along with a crowd so I believe him when he feels it's a masterpiece.My conclusion is he's got a darker personality, while I can be the same, and often am, I'm a peaceful look on the bright side type. In the end, my friend could identify with it while I couldn't nearly as authentically. The payoff to me was underpowered but like a sad-song making you feel happy because lyrics give you a sense you're not alone, I think this movie is capable of resonating with many out there really well so I give it a few extra points - 7 stars.

Donnie Darko? Should have been called Donnie Dumbo,"I rented this movie on the strength of the ratings and glowing reviews at this site. ""Brilliant"", they said. ""Dark and beautiful"", they wrote. 8.4 stars. Well, all I can say is, these people must have been on some serious drugs when saw this totally inane movie. The cinematography has the look of a student film. The plot (and I use the term for lack of a better word) is disjointed and meandering, not really sure where it wants to go, and that leaves the viewer not really caring. The ending, I suppose, is meant to be a twist, but ends up making little sense and falling flat. Donnie Darko, by the way, is actually his real name (ie, the Darko family), not an intriguing nickname. I give this movie 1 black hole.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Such a great movie,"Don't know if this is exactly a horror film or not but it's close. It's scary for sure, especially when Frank the rabbit appears in a scene.
The mystery and the sense of not really understanding what's going on doesn't take away from the utter enjoyment of watching whats happening. And then somehow everything ties together a makes some sort of sense!
Jake Gyllenhaal is of course brilliant as a sullen Donnie. He's moody and skulks around like a ghost but we care about him and want him to find a way out of the maze this film becomes. Patrick Swayze is brilliant too in his small but important role. But the real star is Richard Kelly the director. He brings everything together and creates a film that feels perfectly balanced - visuals, music, acting, editing, everything just works like a perfectly oiled machine.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A great movie that will blow your mind,"Donnie Darko by far was one of the best movies of the year.  For some reason I always love these films that are good mostly because of these insane things that continue to happen throughout and we are all unaware of what to expect or what not to.  In Donnie Darko, through the whole movie, I had this wonderful feeling during the entire movie because I knew anything could happen.  Also during the scenes when the movie wasn't being to dark or unnatural it was filled with great dialogue and excellent acting from the entire cast.  I only wish that this movie would have been able to reach a bigger audience so everyone could have some type of opinion on this movie. I think it could be viewed in so many different ways.  To me, it was one awesome example of the things that go through the mind of a strange teenage boy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Confusing, dark, difficult and confusing but very enjoyable and worth the work","In the small American of Middlesex lives Donnie, a disturbed teenager, in psychoanalysis and on a programme of medication.  One night a large figure in a rabbit suit (Frank) appears to Donnie and takes him out of his home in order to tell him that in just over 28 days the world will come to an end. While out Donnie house is struck by an aeroplane engine that crushes his room and would have surely killed him.  Donnie follows Frank's instruction as they grow increasingly violent as he tries to prevent the world ending and turn time back.I, like many others, came to this on the back of rave reviews but I knew that this film is a CULT movie.  That means that not everyone will get it or enjoy it.  I fell within the first category but not within the second.  The plot is a strange mix of high school movie cliché and a weird hallucination (?) that is Donnie's world.  The two sit well together and both work separately.  The high school stuff finds Donnie in a boat many of us have been in  that of a teenager disaffected and misunderstood by everything around him.  On top of this alienation Donnie must cope with the darker world of Frank  a darkness that is brought out really well and is genuinely creepy.This side of the story is the difficult bit.  There are big question marks that surround what is actually going on with Frank and, even after the film has finished it remains unclear and you'll be left wondering `what the heck was that?'  However it is a fantastic ride and you'll be totally sucked into the world of Donnie.  It's not a classic film because of this  too dark for many and maybe too frustrating in it's ambiguous nature for others, but it is one hell of a movie that'll amuse, chill and entertain long after you finish it.The direction is faultless.  Shadowy stairwells cast beautiful shadows and blue skies and picket fences give way to dark visions and destruction.  The use of music is also good  80's soundtracks may not be a fresh idea but here it is used sparingly and to great effect.  Some is over familiar but in fairness most is well known but gains value from how it is used with the action onscreen.Gyllenhaal is a great lead and brings an immense depth to the film, his laid back approach mixed with the dark haunted looks he can draw upon add to the feelings of both menace and reality.  The rest of the cast are all great and throw up a few faces I wasn't expecting  including Mary McDonnell, Swayze, Barrymore and Noah Wyle from ER.  These aren't distracting and don't take away or add to the film's value simply by their star power.Overall this is well worth a watch.  You won't get it first time but you'll have fun thinking about it and running over the meaning in your mind.  I'm coming to grips with the whole time travel thing but am still questioning my own answers.  Please remember than this is a cult movie that is wearing a multiplex outfit (just like Frank).  Many will find it confusing, challenging and just too plain weird but most will enjoy it even if the meaning is confused and difficult.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
slightly overrated,"Truly a good movie. This movie is interesting to watch throughout all of it. Interesting plot, very good pace and great actors. Specially Jake Gyllenhaal that makes a very convincing performance of his not so easy character. Plus the support of some more known actors like Mary Mcdonnell, that plays awesome, Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze in good performances.The main idea of the movie is maybe not an original one, but it's execution is definitely different from anything that is done before.The main disadvantage of this movie is that it comes in a period of lots of other movies like it: Sixth Sense, Memento, Frequency, Butterfly Effect, Mulholland Drive, Identity, Heaven(1998) and probably some more. All these have non-standard storytelling and most of them have twist in the end. Which makes all of them better than average ( maybe except Identity) but naturally not equal among themselves.Donnie Darko also has shortcomings in inconsistency of the plot. No major holes, and nothing noticeably disturbing but after the end twist some question arise, and some remain unanswered.My personal subjective opinion places Donnie Darko below Frequency, which is far more breathtaking and compelling, Sixth Sense, whose twist is far more shocking and the plot is much more consistent and Mulholland Drive, that has superb storytelling, wonderful soundtrack and a down to earth realistic story. Not impressive as those three but better than most like it and far better than any average movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Doesn't deserve the raves. Doesn't deserve the slams.,"After all the hype and ""must-see"" 's, and the praise in IMDb, I decided to have a go at watching Donnie Darko, even though I'd skipped it in the past, because it smelled of hype.Nonetheless, it was actually a pretty decent movie.The portrayal of the age of late 80's was achieved in a manner that literally pulled the watcher back in time. Like another reviewer I double-checked the release date, after watching, thinking it was a late 80's movie.I found the rest of the film easy to digest, and fun to watch. It was full of 80s stereotypes, which were spot on. The story flowed well enough, with every piece of it explained at the right moment, and the hints to the finale left bit by bitSure, the science of the film was poor. It was not explained well enough, and it probably isn't even acceptable. However, to the bigger picture, that's just irrelevant. Donnie Darko doesn't really use science to suspend your disbelief and make you wonder ""Hey... What if something weird's going on and Donnie isn't just crazy..."". And no matter the science, the film maintains its eerie atmosphere and engaging plot, on its own.Genre isn't really of importance if the move was successful at what it tried to do, and I think it was.That is also why I am dumbstruck by the raves. As much as Donnie Darko doesn't deserve the slams, it also does not pretend to take itself too seriously...My rating: ***½ of *****",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Is Donnie Darko Pretentious or a Mind-Bending Masterpiece?,"Donnie Darko is a thought-provoking, haunting and mesmerizing film that leaves viewers pondering its deeper meanings long after the credits have rolled. The movie, which was directed by Richard Kelly and stars Jake Gyllenhaal in the titular role, blends science fiction, psychological thriller, and drama elements to create a truly unique and captivating viewing experience.The story follows Donnie, a troubled teenager who starts to experience strange visions of a giant rabbit who tells him the world will end in 28 days. As Donnie tries to unravel the mysteries behind his visions, he finds himself caught in a complex web of time travel, alternate realities, and existential questions.One of the most striking aspects of Donnie Darko is its excellent cinematography and music score. The film's stunning visuals and haunting soundtrack perfectly capture the eerie and surreal atmosphere of the story. The acting is also top-notch, with Gyllenhaal delivering a standout performance as Donnie.However, some viewers may find the film to be overly pretentious or confusing, as it delves into complex and abstract concepts such as time travel, parallel universes, and fate. The narrative is intentionally ambiguous and requires careful attention from the audience to fully understand.Despite these challenges, Donnie Darko remains a cult classic and a must-see for fans of cerebral, thought-provoking cinema. Its blend of genres and complex themes make it a film that rewards repeated viewings, as each viewing reveals new layers of meaning and interpretation.Overall, Donnie Darko is a masterful piece of cinema that balances its many elements to create a uniquely captivating and haunting experience. While it may not be for everyone, those who are willing to dive into its complex narrative and themes will be rewarded with a truly memorable film.In conclusion, the question remains: Is Donnie Darko pretentious or good? The answer is not a simple one, as it depends on the viewer's willingness to engage with its complex themes and embrace its ambiguity. For those who do, Donnie Darko is a fascinating and unforgettable journey that will leave a lasting impression.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Food for thought.,"I was reading the message boards and i was surprised that no one took a religious view to it. I think there may be something in this interpretation of the film.I you set Donnie as being the savior and frank being the devil perhaps you can draw a few parallels. It really sunk home when i saw the other movie was the Last Temptation of Christ. It could be seen that Donnie was tempted by Frank three main times. First would of been to get out of bed, second to flood the school, and third to set fire to the house. Each affected peoples lives in a negative fashion. Each temptation further drew Donnie away from being a savior at all.The pops up the question of why would Frank want to Donnie to go back in time to save everyone. Well the therapist said that if the world ends that its will just be Donnie and frank alone. In the bible Satan is defeated. This would be the reason that Frank would not want the world to end for it would be the end of him too, hence Donnie kills Frank.I and a few guys thought then who else might symbolize people from the Bible. Well the kiddy porn guy could easily be seen as the false prophet, he of course had his following-the teacher obsessed with him. Gretchin could be seen as Donnie's follower, therefore Donnie sacrifices himself to save her life and to give every one a second chance. The therapist could be a messenger of God for she is always there to help Donnie with his troubles. At the end everyone seems to be affected by Donnies death which would explain the second chance for every one. Also a side we though that maybe that the Asian girl could perhaps be a symbol for Mary Magdalen as she is always following Donnie and has a crush on him and is rejected by all. He seems to be the only one to defend her. He also tells her things will be better for her.These are our thoughts and ideas on the movie, throw this idea around and have fun with it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

If it doesn't smell right in 20, it's gone.I watched this film to the end, which normally means I feel it has merit. This film has merit for one reason only - the lead actor. Most of the actors did just fine, although Drew Barrymore has as much acting talent as the band KISS were musicians. Apart from Donnie, everyone is just a stage prop.All sub-plots added no value to the film, not even the psychiatric sessions. Even Donnie's love interest added nothing, like MSG on basmati rice. The relationship between Donnie and the ""Rabbit"" carry the movie; all else offers nothing.Here's how one reviewer finished his review with a 10 star rating:

Unforgettable!,"The way in which Richard Kelly has crafted the piece to be humorous, entertaining, tragic, dark, and above all, deep at the same time is a credit to him. Whilst most movies aim for to evoke one emotion from the viewer, by being purely comical, or purely dramatic etc., Donnie Darko evokes a whole spectrum of emotion... and in the end it amounts to an overwhelmingly great experience...The many layers of the plot relay truths about the destructive society in which we live... Jim Cunningham being worshiped despite his flawed character; the man who needs the most help advising the rest... the school system failing those who need the most help... the delusional parents who push their premature children into the adult world.. the joke that is psychiatry and the almost uniform methods of treating mental health problems... teenage angst and conformity... This movie really makes you think.The acting is superb. Donnie's character is likable yet disturbing at times, and slightly cynical. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting confirms that he is one of the few young actors that will outlast manufactured actors such as Josh Hartnett. He holds the movie on his own, and even when he is not speaking at all, he commands the scene.You have to see this movie. Not just once, but many many times. The intellect seems hard to fathom at first, but it really isn't the basis of the film. I think this film is a comment on society, but it is an extremely entertaining and fulfilling experience in the same. The humor lightens the heavy nature of the film and adds to the enjoyment.Anyone who doubts the integrity of this movie or the directors intentions is pretentious. The effect of this movie can't be under-credited; it is stimulating, left of center and completely unforgettable. After reading many comments which tag this movie as being an unstructured mess, I have to say that you need to get a grip. If YOU didn't UNDERSTAND the movie, don't discredit it and pick at it merely to redeem yourself in your own egotistic eyes.Great soundtrack too.

Darko Indeed!,"One of my all time favorte films, Donnie Darko is a film that I think most people will either love or hate. It's a genre bending head trip. No film has ever envoked so many emotions in me. A lot has been made over the movies plot. What does it all mean? I have my own ideas and they might or might not be right. But for me the plot really is secondary. The films real strenght is its ability to play with my emotions.Jake Gylenhall is outstanding as Donnie Darko. He has the whole teen angst thing down. It reminded me of a lot of emotions I felt at that age and sometimes still do. Mary McDowell and Holmes Osbourne do a great job of portraying parents who desperately want to help their son , but can't really comprehend what's going on. Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Maggie Gylenhall, and Kathrine Ross have small roles but make a big impact.Its hard to bealive this is Richard Kellys first film in the directors chair. The mood he is able to create is haunting. He envokes darkness, an eerie tone, and a sense of surrealism. The 1980's seems to be weird era for this sort of film but somehow it works. Kelly does a remarkably superb job at uses the right soundtrack and score to make a scene memorable.This is without a doubt near the top of my list of favortes and I recommend it to anyone who dosn't mind a plot thats requires a little work to follow",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Nicely foreshadowed and atmospheric mystery story  but when FAQs, forums and DVD bonus materials are needed just to 'grasp' the film, then it is probably flawed","Just starting to write this, I realize ""Donnie Darko"" will be a very difficult film to review. It is also a very difficult film to grasp the scope, timeline and message of  but now that I have just finished reading a long ""Donnie Darko: FAQ"", I feel as though I could give it a decent try without the most semi-coherent, rambling observations.Plotwise, titular character Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is on the surface a normal American 16-year-old, but scratch this surface and you find a deeply, deeply disturbed and dark teenager who is tormented by hallucinations of a demonic bunny rabbit, obsessive thoughts and a world of darkness that even his psychiatrist cannot quite grasp. The film has Donnie do a series of crimes and deeds in his fluffy suburban neighbourhood that at first appear to be petty and pointless, but eventually link up and culminate in an eerie revelation.This ""eerie revelation"" is best left alone and unspoiled (the ending was spoiled for me before I saw it, grr!), but I will say this: even with a long-ass FAQ and DVD bonus material, it doesn't really make sense. It does occasionally, and when the pieces of the puzzle DO manage to fall in the right place, it's brilliant. As most of the time they jumble about in a great big existentialist mess, this puzzle feels incomplete and often too crazy for its own good. A few more solid facts would have been welcomed to ground this film a bit.While they say that the ending usually makes the film, ""Donnie Darko"" has other good factors that redeem the hazy payoff. This is stuff like an hilarious Patrick Swayze as the local guru-fraud, the sensationally layered acting from Mary McDonnell as Donnie's concerned mother and a great soundtrack. Gyllenhaal undoubtedly captures the inner turmoil of his character quite well, like the bathroom hallucinations. This is clear-eyed and assured acting, which is more than you can say for the direction.Remember the style of Dirty Dancing? That is a film from the 1980s that it supposed to be set in the 1950s, but fails miserably because it's just so blatantly 80's coloured and influenced  from the catchphrases, the hair, the outfits and music to the actors, it just oozes ""1987"". Well, the same applies to ""Donnie Darko"" (2001). It is set in 1988, for the sole reason that the director Richard Kelly felt more at home as a teenager in the 80s. But curiously, all the people look and act like 21th century characters or late 90s kids. It's wildly distracting.This is far from a perfect film; it should have been sewn together more clearly. But this aside, it really is a very entertaining fare that would easily get an A+ for effort and an A for acting.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"""It's A Wonderful Life"" All Over Again","I have never been a huge fan of ""Donnie Darko"" as a science fiction story, which is how it was intended by writer/director Richard Kelly. The vague storytelling masks the gaps in logic and the budgetary constraints that did not allow them to show things more convincingly (also Kelly needed more experience before he tackled a project of this scope). However, fans have embraced this failing as the film's strength and have used the open-ended structure to mold the thing into something that fits their own individual agendas.By now most everyone knows that early in the film the world diverges into a tangent universe, a situation that must be remedied in 28 days or the normal universe will end. Donnie has been selected by some undisclosed guardian to bring the tangent and primary universes back into alignment. He is given some superhuman powers for this task but only a few clues about what must be done. Searching for answers (mostly about time travel) during the day and performing sleepwalking pranks by night (an inefficient way to bring about certain vaguely tangential events), he semi-cluelessly moves forward toward the deadline. At last he figures out that he must send an ""artifact"" (a jet engine) back from the tangent universe to the normal universe. He seemingly knows that doing so will result in his death in the normal universe but he selflessly performs the task and restores things to a stable balance.This is not as silly and contrived as it sounds but it does have some major issues that must be ignored if one is to really embrace the film. It also lacks useful philosophical depth and is just a teen movie with some intriguing thoughts about time travel.But ""Donnie Darko"" becomes extraordinary when viewed instead as an allegorical story about free will versus destiny. It is basically a twisted remake of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"", with Donnie a 1988 version of George Bailey and Frank his guardian angel. Instead of being given a chance to see what the world would be like if he had not been born, Donnie is given the chance to see how his continued existence would alter events. For George Bailey the experience was full of positive revelations, for Donnie it is the opposite.To go with this unintended interpretation you just dismiss the whole thing about tangent universes. Instead Donnie dies at the beginning of the story by a random event (a jet engine falls off a plane passing over his house)over which he has no control. Since he is not essential to the event, he is given a chance to experience an additional 28 days of life to see the effects of his remaining alive and then choose between the two alternate futures. But he is also given the ability to actually see the force fields that draw everyone toward their destinies and finds himself powerless to resist such manipulation. Ultimately he makes his first ""free choice"" and elects his original death.""Heathers"" was a major influence on Kelly and ""Donnie Darko"" has that same sedated tone, with characters generally under-reacting to absurdly extreme developments. As in that film parents are not the problem, rather it is kids being incredibly (but believably) cruel to each other.The cast is solid although avoiding Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze is normally a good idea. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent and it is nice that his actual sister Maggie plays his film sister. Unfortunately both Maggie and Jena Malone are wasted in unchallenging roles with minimal screen time.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
reprehensible,"this is one of the most overrated films i've ever seen in my life and that is not hyperbole. when i express this opinion it is often met with responses like, ""man, you just didn't get it"" or ""what are you talking about? this is maybe the best movie ever made."" trying to show restraint i switch topics most of the time, but seeing as IMDb has been rated #94 on the list of greatest films ever made i just felt like i needed to say something.this movie is awful. it is pretentious, convoluted, and sophomoric. it's art film for people who don't like art film but like to think they do. it clunks along slowly in a world of frivolous angst; for heaven's sake, donnie is being led on by a big apocalyptic stuffed animal... how is that not laughable? each performance is overdone, the special effects are offensively bad, the pacing is miserable, the cinematography overly showy, and worst of all the ending is... i am not even going to touch that with a forty foot pole for the sake of you ""darko"" obsessives who are probably foaming at the mouth after reading this much.simply put, ""donnie darko"" (the film or the character) is unbearably self-important.if this is number #94, ron howard's ""willow"" should be #78, lucas's ""howard the duck"" should be #64, costner's ""the postman"" #25, and ""shrek 2"" the greatest film of all-time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One heck of an intelligent film!!,"I had watched this for the first time recently and it was amazing, with all the cast putting in great performances, and often a good use of mise en scene (for example clues to other characters etc throughout the film) this was amazing and can easily be watched numerous times.The issues it explores are immense and gripping. Without sounding cliché it does keep you guessing, the characters are all believable although not to the point that you feel you can reach out and grab them because that would just be trippin', but yeah it is amazing to watch, it doesn't just pass over you, but struts past you picking you up along the way.Its one dope film, although stopping it perfection are the smallest in things (the V.V. rare lack in pace) and if i could would give this film a 9.8 Easily one of Jake Gyllenhaals greatest performances, Tis awesome.J.T -take another hit-",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest cinematic achievements,"Donnie Darko tells the story of a delusional teenager who begins to see visions of a a man in a blue bunny suit, who orders him to do certain tasks through suggestive clues and voices, to which he insists he MUST do, or the world will end.Now, really, this is a movie you must see to get the plot, if I were to give the full, detailed, complex plot it would take far too long (And will probably you leave you more stumped) to which reveals the majestic brilliance of Donnie Darko; which is that their are endless amounts of theories and interpretations, making it one of the most thought-provoking fantasy of recent years.The acting is superb (Maggie Ghyllenhal, Jake Ghyllenhal and Drew Barrymore to name a few), the music is perfect, subtle and atmospheric and the fantastic direction, coupled with a roller-coaster ride of a storyline will leave you of utmost interest and intrigue like no other movie. Not only that, but you will find yourself watching it more than a few times, as it will stick in your mind until you reveal your own personal interpretation (To which you may experience a Donnie Darko 'phase' which I did, warning: It WILL take up a sizable chunk of your life).But adding to the already deep and complex storyline, there are also a vast amount of underlying themes, most noticeable the character Patrick Swayze plays, in which it represents a false 'superior', referring clearly to religion.Donnie Darko is truly a classic, one of my favorite films and I recommend it to anyone. Incredible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
***fantastic - great film***,"Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a normal everyday teenager; well, he was until a jet engine crashed into Donnie's house and triggers a parallel world, which will end in 28 days. Frank, a 6 ft tall rabbit is sent to warn Donnie of the end of the world and help guide Donnie into a position where he will send the engine back through time, which will close the parallel time frame and save the world. Donnie meets a girl called Gretchen (Jena Malone), who has moved into the neighbourhood and has been put in the same class as Donnie; Donnie takes an immediate like to her. Frank manipulates Donnie into burning down a man's house which, means that Donnie's mum has to take his sister to a dancing competition. To get to the location of the competition they must go by plane, which leaves the plane in the correct position to deposit its engine into the black hole. As the climax begins to unfold Donnie unwittingly gets Gretchen killed, and realises his mother and sister will also die if he doesn't close up the black hole. At the end of the film Donnie kills Frank. Closing the black hole means that Donnie will sacrifice his own life, saves Gretchen from being killed, he doesn't burn down Cunningham's (Patrick swayze) house so that means that his mother and sister aren't on the plane (the other mother has taken them). He also doesn't kill Frank and everybody wakes up on what would have been the 1st of October (the beginning of the film) to news that Donnie has been killed by the jet engine that landed in his room.Although the film has a very complex plot, it has you gripped from beginning to end. ""Donnie Darko"" is not a film that you can categorise into just one type of genre, its thrilling, it's full of fantasy, the whole film is a mystery, its got drama within it and also sci-fi. The film has a very interesting ending; it goes round in a circular motion, the more the film moves on the closer you get back to the beginning, so by the end of the film you are back to where you started, in this case back at Donnie's house when the engine crashes in to Donnie's bedroom. All the answers to the ending to of film are there you have just got to look hard to find them. This is not a film I would recommend to anyone who likes to lay back and just watch a film without having to do much thinking.The film was made in America which suggests that it's going to be a happy ending and everything will work out fine. This to some extent is true but however it's not for Donnie who dies. The movie was set in 1988 and take place over a period of 28 days. ""Donnie Darko"" proved popular with the teenage audience. This is because the film is about teenagers and their life at secondary school, which a teenage audience can relate to. Many people stereotype teenage films into that they are all sex, or ""lovey-dovey"" but when the release of ""Donnie Darko"" came about this all changed. ""Donnie Darko"" is a film which is similar to ""back to the future"" and if people give the film a chance would appeal to an older audience as well. This movie is beautifully made, considering the budget was a mere $4.5 million. Richard Kelly the writer and director of this film were only 26 when this film hit the theatres in October 2001.Throughout the film there are many interesting use of special effects. The one that stands out to me the most is when Donnie is in the bathroom taking his medication and Frank appears, as Donnie reaches out his hand is stopped by a rippling sheet of 'glass'. Frank repeats this process and the same happens to him. This stands out to me the most because its something you don't expect to happen and I like things to surprise me. Donnie also starts to see ""wormholes"" coming out of people's chests, seeming to psychically illuminate where they are going in the immediate future. It's an eye-opener for Donnie and it leads him into the field of time travel. These ""wormholes"" look like tubes of water and they are located in the stomach of the people he looks at, they move also the air and ""take"" the person to where they want to go.""Donnie Darko"" has a questionable climax (all the answers are in the film but many people choose not to look for clues) but I think it is in keeping with the movie's theme of how unexplained events can change a person, if not a whole family, even a small town. Donnie Darko is on to something - he is searching for meaning in life and in the universe (he has an interest in time travel). His girlfriend, Gretchen is searching for peace and beauty in the world. It is rare in movies today to see young people engaged in such rational thoughts. That is part of what makes ""Donnie Darko"" so refreshing.With all these concepts taken into account I would say that ""Donnie Darko"" is one of the best films I have ever seen and I would certainly recommend it to others if they haven't already seen this masterpiece, especially since it was quite a low budget film and it has still managed to have an impact on the audience with the special effects, which you would not usually expect from a film of this amount.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Astounding!!,"The fact that this is the Directors first film is amazing to me. The scenes dripped with style, yet that style never seemed distracting. None of it was self congratulatory or gluttonous. The visuals were supported by a truly emotional score and its hard to find fault in the 80's pop tunes that found their way into some of the more impressive scenes.The story is very much thought provoking. Its the type that leaves you pondering the possibilities voiced by the characters. There is nothing condescending about this film. Answers aren't simply handed out, rather the viewer is left to draw many conclusions instead. The acting is also top notch. If i hadn't known beforehand that Patrick Swayze was in this film I would have been shocked. His character is amusing and interesting all at the same time. A great cameo for him. Drew Barrymore is forgettable, though that in no way detracts from the film. Of course the star is Jake Gyllenhaal. There is nothing that can be said to properly praise his performance,he gives a great performance in what i find to be his best movie yet.This movie is great in every way and leaves you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Brief...,"After coming across 'Donnie Darko' several times while it was airing on cable, or something, I pretty much believed that it was something stupid since I always caught the scenes where all the kids are waiting at the bus stop and they always seemed to be teasing some girl, and I ultimately never stuck with it. But then, after coming across it at my local video store, I was surprised to see that it featured Drew Barrymore...and Patrick Swayze! Hmm. Odd. Where has he been? Anyway, I've read almost all of the reviews on this sight and I personally would find it exhausting and pointless to summarize the plot of this title...so I won't. What I will say is that 'Donnie Darko' is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I believe that no one should miss it. Seriously. DON'T miss this one.10/10 is my vote. Have fun with it. It's definitely on my top ten list for 'best films of all time'. Open your mind a little before you watch it, though. ;)",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good movie,"I became interested in this movie after seeing a clip on YouTube. I rented the Director's Cut DVD. I thought it was a good movie, but it didn't have the impact on me that others have said it had on them. It's a good concept, though.The movie starts with Donnie lying on a mountain road, with his bike off to one side. He wakes up as if from a good night's sleep, and bikes home. One is left to ponder right away, ""What an odd thing."" A while later, while sleeping in his room, Donnie hears a command by an ethereal voice to ""Wake up."" He wanders outside, and meets a man in a macabre bunny suit, named Frank. He is told that the world will end in 28 days. While this is going on, a jet engine falls from the sky and crashes into his bedroom. His life is spared. His sister tells him later, ""They don't know where it came from.""A girl named Gretchen wanders into his English class. She and Donnie hit it off. They both have tragedy in their lives (hers from a broken home), and this becomes a bond between them. They ""go with"" each other. She acts as a comforting and stabilizing force in his life. As their relationship grows, he becomes that for her. They are both self- aware, and share a value of honesty.A theme of the movie is that destruction can be creative. Donnie is commanded by Frank to go and destroy certain things associated with his high school. What I saw in the story is that these incidents Donnie creates cause divergence, events that would otherwise not happen. There's nothing that is absolute, or fits within the neat confines of the limited mind, though the adults, and many of his fellow students typically see things in that limited way.I got this sense as the movie progressed that maybe there was a reason the world was going to come to an end that one could see in the character of the people in Donnie's school; that there was a falseness, shallowness to it all that would collapse under its own weight. There's a sense that this mundanity is oppressive to the few who are self- aware, because they are a threat to it. They exist outside of it, and so easily penetrate it. Whereas to everyone else, the mundane is all they know, and it is their only comfort zone. Jim Cunningham, an inspirational speaker, exploits this comfort zone for his own gain. What people like about him is he doesn't upset the applecart. He validates it. He seems benign, but his influence in the school leads to a subtle corruption, which infects everything, pushing out anything of substance.The one good teacher Donnie has is his English teacher. She seems to buck the trend in the school, presenting a full and heartfelt sense of her subject, and she communicates the value of it to her students. Donnie's destiny is strongly tied to the narratives that come out of his English class. His teacher is struck by the lack of perception in the staff and students at the school, as Donnie is a lot of the time. Even though Donnie is supposed to be the crazy one, the one who is always in a confused stupor, I was often surprised by his unwillingness to go along to get along in the mediocrity, and his tenacity in speaking his mind with such clarity, to confront the people around him. It was refreshing to see.One of the things that struck me is how the movie was set in the 1980s, even though it came out in 2001. Everything was very true to the time. Of course there was 80s music throughout. The musical scenes were really enjoyable. They lent a dreamlike quality to the movie, yet the music felt relevant to what the movie was about.It's a movie one is left to interpret. It is somewhat cerebral, though not technical. You have to think about what you are seeing. It doesn't have an obvious point to it, and that may disappoint viewers. Each viewer can take away something different. As I watched it, I saw that there was something disturbed about Donnie. One could chalk this up to schizophrenia, but as the movie kept going, an aspect of time travel was becoming more obvious, and I began to wonder if Donnie wasn't hallucinating, but rather was experiencing a very real alternate reality. In this way it was like the movie ""The Devil's Advocate"". It had the same theme of events and destinies happening in different timelines (and making one wonder whether the main character's wife is more vividly experiencing a real alternate reality, or is just hallucinating because of schizophrenia), though while ""Devil's Advocate"" made these realities hinge on choice, ""Darko"" seems to make it hinge on fate. The ending makes you wonder again, though, was time travel even involved, or was it all something else? The movie becomes clearer if you watch it more than once.The take-away I got from it is that we each interpret our experience. We come up with our own models for it. None of the models we form to interpret our experience is necessarily more correct than any other, though depending on which we form and choose for ourselves, it has a profound impact on how we see ourselves in that experience, and how we react to it. I saw some commentary on the extras disc that provided some clarity to the intent of the movie, but I feel like I'd spoil it if I divulged that here. Just a note to those who end up feeling mystified by the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
likable surrealism,"I'm not sure what I'm supposed to come away from Donnie Darko with, I would say that this is a very clever film, or a very clueless one.( I Think) When it begins everything that follows for the next hundred minutes has happened already. That's one way to look at it. Another way would be to see it as pure surrealism like John Carpenter's In The Mouth of Madness or David Lynch's Mullholland Dr. Such films are conundrums, but the question is whether or not you are capable of watching a movie that leaves you frustrated intentionally. If surrealism is your thing, you will probably have luck with Donnie Darko. It is a good one for a movie goer.Up until the climax, we are led to believe that this is a film about a young suburban middle- class boy (Donnie) who has schizophrenia and one night envisions a large satanic looking rabbit (the anti-Harvey) to tells him to do some pretty bad things if he wants to survive the end of the world in 28 days, something hours and something seconds.The people in this film are weird, though not as much so as Mulholland Dr. (In part because the acting here is more toned down, usually) One could argue though that there are too many characters. Some of the screen time that is dedicated to the supporting cast could have gone to Donnies story, which is more important. His conversations with Frank (the rabbit) are intriguing but they are too short and too few.The climax is one that takes Donnie Darko and turns it inside out. There is no literal resolution to the thriller side of Donnie Darko, only what the viewer chooses to make of it. Is it a great movie? no, but its partial originality and evocative direction are enough to make it worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
My favorite film,"Even if this isn't technically the best film I've ever seen, it easily remains my favorite movie of all time. Every thing about it just feels right - from Jake Gyllenhaal and Mary McDonnel's terrific understated performances, to Kelly's twisted vision of ""Back to the Future,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Harvey"" and Clive Barker.Most everyone has commented on the score but I will say it's the most well-chosen soundtrack I've ever heard (on the original version, not the director's cut) with most of the lyrics, i.e. The Church, Echo and the Bunnymen and the brilliant re-interpretation of Tears For Fears' ""Mad World,"" fitting in with the plot and script.I would recommend the original cut of this film in general, as it leaves the answers up to your interpretations. There's something harrowing and beautiful about how open-ended yet connected everything feels in the mind-boggling climax.In the very least, Donnie Darko is worth admiration for what it attempts to achieve. This film is a must-see for anyone who thinks they've seen it all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Whats all the shouting about?,"I doubt this is going to help anyone make up their mind about this film. To be honest this isn't really a review but more a commentary on a film that several friends have insisted is one of the great movies of all time. I've tried to come up with something to say about the film, other than its not very good, but have had trouble since I saw it in doing so. To that end I've decided to write about that, about not being able to find the words and why.I finally sat down to watch this film after several years of people grabbing me and insisting I see this film. Some wanted to share the dark ""wondrous"" experience others wanted me to take a crack at explaining the film to them. Some where along the way I picked up the directors cut and put it away until recently when I popped it and gave it ago.Its been a week or so since I've seen this film and I'm still wondering what it was I saw. To be certain its a unique vision of strangeness concerning the odd visions of a young man who is haunted by person in a twisted bunny suit urging him to do things in order to save the world. But outside of the strangeness I don't see this as the be all and end all or even the very good movie that some people seem to think the film is. For me this is way way way too long film thats weird for the sake of weird. For me its an angsty young kid trying to deal with change by creating a ""fantasy world"" of doom and gloom. What so different about that from real life? Forgive me I just don't care for the film. Its not that I don't get it, but the two plus hour march to the downbeat conclusion was almost too much for me to take. I kept wanting to scream at the film ""get on with it"" until I'd realize that I had the DVD controller next to me and I'd scan to the next scene.What is it about this film that draws people in? I can't say. Perhaps I'm the wrong audience for this film, having been raised on the films of David Lynch, Jodorowsky and Bunuel where strange is a way of life not a means of getting your film noticed. Even the ending, which has echoes of other films didn't strike me as anything special.Perhaps if I had stumbled upon this unaware I might have liked it, but mostly I'm left wondering if thats all there is.",3.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Directors cut provides a guide to the artistic accomplishment that is Donnie Darco,"These two different films have two different consequences. The original film is completely bewildering, but in such a way that as the credits roll through, you squint your eyes and gaze off in the distance, but your mouth slowly curls into a silly open mouthed smile. There is somehow a sense of satisfaction in the confusion this movie creates. With the original, you need to explore the book pages on the DVD extras and the website may be helpful. The directors cut is a little different. The philosophical statements come across a little more clearly. The pace of the directors cut was enjoyable to me. Somehow I felt as though the questions i had were able to develop more and really simmer as the movie progressed, whereas there is so much momentum in the original cut that it felt a little rushed. So here is my comparison of the two: Original Cut is a great artsy confusing conversation piece that can entertain your thoughts for days. The Directors Cut is a little more straightforward, less questions are left unanswered. I recommend watching both, but at least a week apart",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Harvey Skybanger,"Definitely obscure interesting and offbeat, a cross between 'Harvey', David Lynch material, and a mind-blowing cocktail, 'DD' is worth the effort, but is not quite the ride it's made out to be by other reviewers. It is 7 out of 10; very good, but does lose its way a little, after a good start and before an intriguing, even haunting, conclusion. I must confess I didn't fully understand what it was all about, but the fact that it makes you think about the possibilities of time travel, and the facts of death and schizophrenia, make it thought-provoking enough to stay with you for a long time. The 80s music, although not my favourite era, was perfectly toned for the events taking place, and the finale of 'Mad World'as the film reached its conclusion was one of the most memorable moments in recent cinema. On the plus side, I thought most of the acting was credible. On the minus side, there's Patrick Swayze. Although well-cast, he is sickeningly revolting! A film worth seeing twice, but not in the same league as 'Mulholland Drive' for sheer weirdness...",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Interesting but empty,"I like this one. The direction is very good, giving the film this eerie and surreal atmosphere. The spectator sees it as through a reality defying lens, questioning whether what he's seeing is actually happening or just a result of the imagination of the protagonist, or maybe Donnie's ignoring what he feels should be ignored, etc. As a consequence, there's different interpretations about what happens in the story, but arguably none of them fully satisfactory, giving the little substance the movie has (compared with its execution at least), even though the mere suggestion of deeper themes can be enough depending on who you ask, making oneself think is not a disposable experience. There's multiple storylines, as if were, maybe too much in fact, and all of them interconnect and juxtapose at one moment. I didn't like that very much, is just confusing for the lols and doesn't add a lot. Also, despite the ambience and mood being the most remarkable thing here, it kind of feels harmless, a little constrain even, like a Lynch movie that doesn't fully commit, or an early Poe short story. I also like rabbits, and I like the inclusion of one rabbit man, so that's extra points.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Sheer Brilliance,"This movie is fantastic. I saw it last year for the first time, and it changed the way i look at film. Every time I see it, it gets better and better.Richard Kelly chose probably the best collection of actors and actresses that he could have. Each one completely takes their role in, so that you feel like you are not watching a movie, but watching real life happen through a window. The best, in my opinion, were Jake Gyllenhaal, and Jena Malone, who played Gretchen. Their chemistry was brilliant. the sibling rivalry between Donnie and Elizabeth Darko was incredible, Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal were phenomenal. The actors seem like they were created for that part.The story line presented is at first a little confusing. Universes and rabbits can make things confusing in a story like this, but it is not meant for mere entertainment, but to think on. I would write more, but I do not want to give anything away.Richard Kelly did such an amazing job directing.

Way over-hyped emo trash movie,"In short, this film had very few good points. The music was one of them, but even then I despair because the best piece is a cover.Plot summary: Kid becomes a superhero of sorts by being able to manipulate events in a 'tangent universe', a sort of 'what-if' world that may have been if a certain crisis would have been avoided. In the end, the angsty-wannabe-superhero realizes that, like, the world totally would have like, been better off and stuff if he would totally just have like died. So, he does. Which, in turn, makes the angsty teenage population of the US think that they can, like, wow, totally relate and stuff because sometimes they totally feel like the world could be a better place without them and that they should die, too.I wish that were the message of the film, but there really wasn't a message at all.

What a Bust!,"Let me say up front...do NOT waste your time or money seeing this film. It was extremely disappointing and very non-interesting. Donnie Darko is a teenager who is struggling with mental problems. He is heavily medicated, however his mental illness is getting the best of him. So, he begins performing acts of violence and vandalism.The main character, Donnie, is then surrounded by a subplot based on time travel. The subplot makes almost no sense and totally confuses the movie. The movie ends up be very odd, extremely boring and generally incohesive. I suspect the ending of the movie is supposed to explain the other boring 2 hours, but to me it just made the film even more painful to bear. Could it be possible that Donnie Psycho can actually travel back in time and alter the past? Give me a break! And to the film makers...how about less cheesy special effects and better quality sound editing.4/10 at best. Donnie Darko was a total disappointment at almost all levels.

A Very Deep and Well-Crafted Film that Needs to be Viewed More Than Once,"Saw it for the first time last night and I have to say I was impressed. Richard Kelley does an astonishing job for his first film, I look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future. 'Donnie Darko' is a film filled to the brim with such intriguing ideas, original plot turns, extraordinary visuals and riveting acting. Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding in the lead, and the ensemble cast consisting of a humorous Patrick Swayze, a surprisingly solid Drew Barrymore and an always remarkable Jena Malone is first-rate. The only part that confused me was the ending. I'm not saying it was bad, it was just very unclear. I've been told if I watch the movie again a couple of times I'll have a better understanding of it.

The screenplay is straightforward enough to make the story completely believable. This direction is tight and focused. There's no ambiguity of purpose in how Donnie's story is told. While I was appropriately impressed with Jake's Gyllenhaal's performance in ""Brokeback Mountain"" - and it was mighty stunning - it's ""Donnie Darko"" which has made a me a Jake Gyllenhaal fan. This man is no pretty-faced flash in the pan, though it has to be admitted that he's a handsome dude. We will be seeing more of him in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Overrated film waste of 2 hours.,"While I'm a big fan of movies that question things, this movie was a waste of time. Some people might classify this as an ""intelligent movie"" but I Loathe the day I read and trusted the internet reviews on IMDb.com for this ""intelligent movie"".Ill give it one point for good acting and for the fact that I liked the music choices, but it goes down hill from there. The music was just played on top of the scenes as if it wasn't actually a part of the movie, hardly any fade in/fade out.The whole time in the movie I was thinking please don't end at the beginning and boom I had to watch the whole movie to find out what? Nothing, I should just have done a fast forward to the end to see the truth and not wasted my time with all the in between nonsense that in the end proved doublespeak.Don't bother seeing it if you don't like movies with no ending, or futile endings.This movie certainly doesn't belong in the top 250 I rate it 1in10 other movies deserve this top spot.

"""i'll tell you what he said. he asked me to forcebly insert the life-line activity into my anus!""","every few years you get a movie that doesn't do very well yet far surpasses everything that people and critics, and Donnie Darko is one of them. this is probably my new favorite movie, and it's certainly one of the best movies in the last 10 years. Donnie Darko combines three elements, dram comedy and science fiction. now usually movies like this suck horribly, but instead of trying to force all three types to work at the same time, but this movie gives you the intense drama, some breathing room with some really funny parts, and than gives you some scientific bits that are really interesting.jake gyllenhaal was perfect for the roll of Donnie Darko. he is truly one of the best actors of this generation. jena malone also does a great job as Donnie's love interest who has her own set of problems (seems like most of her characters do). this is also a very clever movie. it gives you a lot to think about, and it is one of those endings where you could argue with some one about possible outcomes for a long time. one thing that i really liked was the humor. it is really unique, because the funny parts generally come in a serious setting (like the line above was delivered by Donnie's spastic gym teacher who is upset by the fact that donnie told her to shove a book up her ass).every person i have watched this with has loved it. i think it's just one of those movies that most people like, yet not many know of it. i guess if this movie had been over promoted that it wouldn't have that sort of independent feel to it. i usually hate 80's music, but the song 'mad world' worked very well at the end. an all around great movie. i recommend it to everyone. 10/10",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

'I'm afraid that you'll tell me that this is not a work of fiction',"It is without doubt a thought-provoking, moving and beautiful film within the confines of its surreal obscurity. I think I'm quite certain of the impossibility of understanding it or being satisfied with one viewing, it deliberately doesn't point to the clues which help you piece it together, and only once you know how it pieces together can you go back to search for the clues- a skillfully carved puzzle that leaves you unsure whether it can all be pieced together at all.The film almost serves as an extra-worldly experience for the introspective viewer; it will raise deep questions about the reality you live in with its potent cinematography, music and screen writing. It does all this whilst simultaneously entertaining you with a humorous political and social satire of the Reagan era.Donnie is the classical epic hero placed in a modern setting, displaying his heroism in a highly unconventional scenario, which makes the film all the more noble and tragic, as not only will no one ever know what he does and what sacrifices he makes, but he will forever be remembered, officially, as a merely troubled, psychotic teenage vandal.This heroic aspect of Donnie's character is summarised by a poem Donnie reads out in class one day, which analogises his heroic persona with that of a more traditional hero who ""will deliver the children back to their doorsteps / And send the monsters back to the underground / I'll send them back to a place where no-one else can see them / Except for me / Because I am Donnie Darko"" Incorporating ideas of parallel universes, time travel (in the Stephen Hawking sense) and manifest individual destinies, the story singles out Donnie by following his visible and pre-written destiny as he plays his role in preserving the universe. Branded a paranoid schizophrenic by the outside world, we the viewers know his so-called hallucinations are more than just the mind games of mind altering neuro-chemicals. And in this way, as well as many other ways, the film softens conventionally solid boundaries of the universe and our understanding of it in more than a grossly fantastical Stephen King fashion. A far cry from the light-hearted Hollywood comedy and cheery 'chick flick', this is not viewing for the faint-hearted.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"head scratching, thought provoking, sweat inducing experience","Have you ever tried Sudoku, Brain Training on the Nintendo DS and watching Countdown all at the same time? Sounds like a difficult task right? Well that's exactly the level of head scratching, thought provoking, sweat inducing experience I had while watching Donnie Darko. I have literally watched the film three times and I still don't understand one iota of the mind bending Rubik cubeness of this film. What does it all mean? Because I literally don't have a clue! Donnie Darko is one of those few films that I have found completely impossible to distinguish whether it is so far out the box that it is actually the box itself type of master piece, like Stanley Kubrick's 2001 Space Odyssey or Shane Carruth's Primer or is merely utter rubbish masquerading itself as an intelligent and unique film, such as Minority Report and Oblivion – Ummm I wonder what both films have in common?From what I can decipher from Richard Kelly's (director/writer) story line, is it is based around this character Donnie Darko – sound like a superhero right? Well that character is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, which I'm pretty sure every mother, daughter and girlfriend already knows who he is. The guy has been know to have demonstrated time and time again that he posses a lot of range as an actor, appearing in films such as Zodiac and Brokeback Mountain. But in this particular film he once again plays against all heartthrob type casting by playing a genius teenager who knows everything there is to know about the Smurfs – make him President right? But at the same time he is a very troubled young man, one of these troubles manifests itself in a 6ft tall bunny named Frank who tells him that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and twelve seconds. So for the rest of the film he tries to unravel the mystery around the strange occurrences plaguing his life. Along the way the bunny that only he can see, keeps popping out of now and telling him to do stuff such a flooding the school and setting someone's house on fire. But don't worry it's not all doom and gloom, there is some really cool science stuff revolving around time travel and all its possibilities for you SCI-FI enthusiasts and there is also a love interest in the form of Gretchen and beautiful girl whose life is riddled with misery for all you romantic types. The film is also riddled with a abundance of acting stars, such as local author Patrick Swayze, cool and mysterious teacher Drew Barrymore and high achieving older sister Maggie Gyllenhaal – and yes they are related in real life.Okay now we got that out of the way, what works in the film? Well the acting performance are all subtle, no one is playing to outperform anyone else's, instead the main cast all remain true to their idiosyncratic odd ball characters which makes them all so endearing and likable. My favourite performance was Jena Malone's, who was able to build a character that at the drop of the hat can be strong and fierce one moment, then sweet and fragile the next, which was why it was always a delight to see her come on screen. Another aspect of the film that I loved, was the way the film never wants limited itself to just the one genre, instead it was constantly evolving and changing; one minute its wacky and funny shown best in the family meal scenes, the next its sci-fi awesomeness in the scenes between Donnie and the sciences teacher and it suddenly becomes sweet and lovely, illustrated best anytime Gretchen and Donne are together. but what I didn't like in the film was the way they had such captivating and interesting characters, mainly being Drew Barrymore's teacher character who I felt could have added so much to the narrative yet was given such a passive inconsequential role. I also felt that Richard Kelly should have added a lot more in depth meaning to the piece, because it seemed all to shallow and lacking in any real direction and strong ideals to convey.Okay sure I still don't know if I loved or hated it, so all I can say for certain was that I enjoyed watching the film and would strongly recommended anyone who is in the mood for something unique and off beat and with plenty of amazing acting gold.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An Underrated Masterpiece That Helped Me Through Life's Difficulties,"Donnie Darko is a movie that has had a profound impact on me. This underrated masterpiece is one of those rare films that stays with you long after the credits have rolled. It's a movie that I turn to whenever I need to escape from the world and get lost in something that speaks to me on a deeper level.The story of Donnie Darko is a complex and thought-provoking one, and it helped me through some of the most difficult parts of my life. The character of Donnie, played brilliantly by Jake Gyllenhaal, is a troubled teen who struggles with mental illness, family issues, and a feeling of isolation from the world around him. His journey of self-discovery and the surreal events that unfold around him are both haunting and beautiful.One of the things I love most about this movie is its ability to evoke a range of emotions. There are moments of humor, sadness, and sheer terror that all blend together seamlessly. The soundtrack is also fantastic, with songs that perfectly capture the mood of each scene.In a world where so many films rely on cheap thrills and predictable plots, Donnie Darko is a breath of fresh air. It's a movie that challenges you to think and feel deeply, and it rewards you for doing so. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend giving it a chance.

Overall a good watch.,"On the surface, the movie is about a troubled teenager ""Donnie"" who encounters an imaginary friend named ""Frank"", and is told that the world will end in 28 days.

For some, you will understand most of what is happening throughout the movie - some however, will likely be lost and won't unravel what the movie was really about until watching it over again.In my opinion, the greatest asset the movie has is the complexity of the story, so if that isn't your sort of thing - you probably won't enjoy this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Weird and Creepy, But oh so GOOD!!","""Donnie Darko,"" directed by Richard Kelly and released in 2001, is a cult classic that merges psychological thriller and science fiction in a way that captivates and confounds its audience. Set in the 1980s, the film follows the troubled teenager Donnie, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who grapples with his mental health while encountering surreal and unsettling events that blur the lines between reality and imagination.The film begins with Donnie narrowly escaping a bizarre accident when a jet engine crashes into his bedroom, an incident that leads him to question the nature of time, fate, and his own sanity. As he navigates the complexities of adolescence, including relationships with family, friends, and his own psyche, Donnie encounters a mysterious figure in a rabbit costume named Frank, who guides him on a path filled with cryptic messages and existential dilemmas.The strength of ""Donnie Darko"" lies in its rich thematic content and atmospheric storytelling. The narrative delves into concepts like time travel, mental illness, and the impact of choices, inviting viewers to engage in deep philosophical reflection. As the plot unfolds, the film keeps you guessing, offering layers of meaning that can be interpreted in various ways, making it a perfect subject for discussion and analysis.Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a standout performance, capturing the vulnerability and intensity of Donnie's character with nuance and depth. The supporting cast, including Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, contributes to a well-rounded ensemble that enhances the film's emotional resonance.Visually and sonically, ""Donnie Darko"" is striking.

One of the best movies ever made. I said it.,"I've been watching this movie for over twenty years since it first came out and it never gets old. I would argue it's timeless and one of the best soundtracks to a film ever made. I personally think the best movie marathon I ever had was watching Dogma, then Donnie Darko, followed by Memento. If you watch them all back to back and still can't figure out what this movie is about or the point of it or how special, physical, smart and witty it is...you just don't get it and should stick to your superhero movies.This movie is as much a hilarious comedy as it is sci fi, drama and indie. It's just so well written and you don't get dialogue or characters like this in today's teen movies. It's moody but not pretentious, crazy yet realistic. If you've ever done mushrooms or any other psychedelic, it's even easier to relate to.I don't want to spoil anything if you're confused by the plot or haven't seen it somehow, but I'll say most of the central characters have a 'role' at play here.

I'm still on the fence about some of the writing, some of which was a tad too clever for its own good (e.g., the Graham Green references and the contrived climax involving the school thugs -- and no I didn't just give away the ending, not by a long shot!).But overall I still enjoyed this, esp. since the ending is open to multipleinterpretations and I couldn't tell where the story was going (very effective use of a time lock).Funny, quirky, and a bit dark.

"Donnie Darko is an interesting film,but still has it's problems","First off I think this was one of the better films I have seen in my life(and I have seen some bad ones). What I really liked about the movie was Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. Jake really nails his performance by not being too subtle, but not chewing the scenery at the same time. Patrick Swayze also did a good job as the very lame Jim Cunninghan(who is made real because there are really people who put on bad shows like that). Frank(James Duval),the bunny, was a very weird ,mysterious, and creepy character. Always when Frank left I anticipated his return. The rest of the cast was good.There are still some problems with the film. One is there are too many 'symbols' and 'meanings' to keep track off. Richard Kelly just puts in a lot of people and events to try and make the movie more philosophical but just ends creating problems with the flow of the story. Like having it being about an alienated teen, time travel, and having faith in God. Jolene Purdy's character(Cherita Chen) was almost completely pointless and if she was taken out of the movie out it would not have made a difference(I think Jolene Purdy is a capable actress, just underused). It just makes the story overblown with ideas that Richard Kelly should save for another movie. Another is that some scenes just end too quickly. Yes, I know it is used to create suspense,but it just ends up being pointless. Also the ending didn't make much sense. So it is a flawed but good film.Recommended films that make you think:VertigoCitizen Cane2001: A Space Odyssey(my personal favorite ever)Apocalypse Now",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Philosophical Snake Oil,"Why is it that as a society, the high brow amongst us become giddy with excitement when they discover something they don't understand, but believe that meaning within that something must exist.Donnie Darko is a film that throws out metaphors, symbolism, iconography, and semiotics like a garage sale. Everything is just thrown onto trestle tables for the neighborhood to pick over,take what they want, and discard the rest.The major flaw is that the film was written and directed by the same individual. It strikes me that Richard Kelly should have handed the reigns to the adults. Everything had an off kilter cartoony element to it, not quite of our world. It reminded me a little of a Steinbeck novel. Where all the characters are stereotypical constructs of an author who has limited practical knowledge of the world and its base elements. The film seems to be a pastiche of ""The seventh sign"", ""The sixth Sense"", and ""American Beauty"".What is most galling about films like ""Donnie Darko"" is that the audience are so dizzy, disoriented, and torqued up that they are frightened witless to admit that they didn't follow many plot points at all. And they are then too unsure of themselves to blame a poor script, or 'happenstance' plot elements for their confusion. The pathetic witless fools try even harder to find 'hidden' meaning and hide behind the mantra ""the author has left the film open to individual interpretation"". Well I can interpret it for you, it goes something like this ""Waffle, waffle, waffle, baffle, red herring, happenstance, twist, waffle, bible, baffle, amateur psychology, half baked scientific claptrap read at doctors waiting room from a dog-earred copy of the American Science Monitor, break in the films time continuum, waffle, more bible, simplistic cultural elements like smurfs, lifestyle gurus, the end"".What if Jackson Pollocks ""Blue Poles"" was simply a case of an unskilled man flicking drops of paint on a canvas and then attaching method and meaning. What if Bjork really is just an eccentric, borderline manic depressive who has no technical skill and hides behind weirdness and intrigue.

"Genre-Splicing, and Ambiguity Makes for A Masterpiece","""Donnie Darko"" defies genre classification. At once it could be subsumed under the categories of Sci-Fi, Horror, Coming of Age, or even Tragi-Comedy.Donnie Darko is a complex character, transcending the clichéd ""trouble teen"" syndrome that has littered the movie landscape for so long. Is he a person with a mental disorder? Is he a genius? Madly creative? Or is young Darko some sort of Superhero? (I have my own view on which it is, but that would necessitate spoilers which I'm loathe to do here).Darko initially avoids catastrophe (an airline turbo-jet crashing down on his room) by being directed by a man in a rabbit costume (we're not talking Velveteen rabbit here - the costume is quite sinister looking). The man in the rabbit costume, Fred, is an enigma. Throughout the movie the audience must decide if he is a figment of Darko's imagination, or if his existence is ""real"" in the film's universe.Is Fred evil? He speaks that way, and compels Donnie to do some prima facie evil things. But are these ""evil"" deeds necessary to effect some greater (that is, morally ""good"") end? Like Darko himself, Fred's character is complex, and not fully resolved by the films' end. Is he a ""saviour"" executing God's will (yes, this film touches on the role of God in our lives on several occasions) or is he bent on destroying a vulnerable Schizophrenic (Darko)? For the questions I've heretofore raised it becomes apparent that one must watch this film to truly appreciate their significance. The film is so ambiguous that one must make his or her own mind up as to the film's proper interpretation. The plot leads down so many paths, that a concrete interpretation becomes a mugs game. But that is to the films credit, rather than to its detriment.That this film was shot with a budget of under 2 million dollars is miraculous. The soundtrack, and political/social references, are very evocative of its time and place - suburbia in the 1980s.Perhaps ""Donnie Darko's"" greatest contribution to cinema, is that it stands for the proposition that ambiguity in interpretation and genre splicing (to coin a phrase) are possible in American cinema.A great film. 9/10.Note: even on multiple viewings things do not become any less strange, or susceptible of less interpretations. To paraphrase literary critic Harold Bloom, a masterpiece of literature is to be recognized by its strangeness.

Except, Donnie Darko goes further, at times exploring the possibility of taking different paths. This was only part of the movie, however.

"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","When a contemporary film captures the attention of many persons willing to vote and offer comments on this site, it means usually that it is some high-budget, well-publicized piece of schlock featuring some non-actor like the Arnold or the Bruce. All glitz and technical appeal with little or no artistic merit. This one is in part an exception to that formula.To be sure, it is a very slick bit of movie-making with all the usual gimmicks involving computerized visuals and time bending, but it simultaneously offers extraordinary appeal in character development and some very good acting indeed. Just to mention the obvious: young Jake Gyllenhall, Mary McDonnell, Noah Wyle, Katharine Ross, and even Drew Barrymore (who for once plays a role with subtlety and depth).So much for the good and the bad. The ugly is of no consequence unless one buys into all the superfluous stuff that constitutes plot. That is nothing more than overwrought and pretentious drivel -- rabbit costumes and wormholes and airplane parts dropping out of the sky, etc., etc.Look instead for what is truly worthwhile social commentary, together with superb insights into the mind of a troubled but brilliant teenager.

This is not a movie that you can play while doing something else, it needs totally undivided attention. Excellent Movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Reach out, touch faith","Finally it was nice to see a movie that was welcomed by most of the viewers and had a definitive thought process. Things like this usually stay within the realm of independent movies and fortunately it got the credit it deserved. The plot wasn't really exhausted except for the portrayed verisimilitude of teen life, which they did a good job fulfilling. Everyone fit their characters, and casting Jake Gyllenhaal and Jena Malone gratified the hope of good teenage acting (which has really seemed to diminish over the last decade.) To tear apart a movie on the basis of minor plot complications demonstrates idleness. If you're going to watch this movie, do so with a brain.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Dopey.,"Lot of buzz about this one; people either seemed to think it was the coolest thing around or an example of overcleverness.There's a fine line between clever and stupid, as the saying goes, and Donnie Darko doesn't cross that line - it stays firmly on the side of stupid. Oh, it <i>thinks</i> it's clever, but it outsmarts itself, dissolving instead into a puddle of drivel.Basic story is that Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a high schooler with some awesomely awful visions; he keeps seeing an evil mutant bunny rabbit who tells him to commit acts of violence and that the world's ending in 28 days. You know, your garden variety doom-and-gloom stuff. Donnie doesn't know how to deal with these horrendous visions, so his family sends him to a psychiatrist.in a very early scene, one of Donnie's acting-out episodes (or is it sleepwalking) finds him outside the house in the middle of the night. Suddenly, a plane engine crashes into his house, landing in his bedroom. No one's hurt, but it's the first of several weird tragedies to befall him and his family. Donnie thinks it's a sign.Maggie Gyllenhaal (who, as you might surmise from her name, is Jake's sister in real life) plays his older sister here, and she's fantastic in the few scenes she's in. Mary McDonnell plays their mom. Some guy and some girl play the father and the younger sister, respectively; neither made an impression on me. Jena Malone plays Donnie's new girlfriend. Drew Barrymore has a thankfully small role as a teacher. Even Patrick Swayze shows up.Time travel, philosophy, nihilism, evil clowns, evil bunny rabbits, and funky coincidences all play roles. Absurdity upon absurdity is heaped onto the steaming pile of plot with the apparent intent to confuse and obfuscate. Weirdness does not cleverness equal, sadly. J. Gyllenhaal is miscast; he looks too pure and innocent.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Undeniably weird but not necessarily engaging,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsDonnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a dysfunctional teenager living with his mom,dad and two younger sisters in a suburban town in America.On the night of 2 October 1988,a mysterious force,which later identifies itself as a giant bunny rabbit named Frank,draws him from his house and informs him that in exactly 28 days,6 hours,42 minutes and 12 seconds....the world will end.The next day,Donnie returns to his house and finds that a plane has crashed through the roof and so meeting Frank in turn saved his life.The film then basically follows Donnie through what are destined to be his (and everyone elses) last days and the nefarious activities the rabbit comes to require of him.If ever a film had developed such a strong and unexpected cult following from such humble beginnings over the last few years,it is this one.A small,independent film only ever intended for a limited release,word of mouth must have spread to such an extent that it has now become regarded as one of the most contempory movies of our time.The premise will be regarded by people in equal measure as weird or preposterous or both.The latter is really true of me,and although I couldn't help but notice the film's slant originality in some respects,I simply didn't find it engaging in any way.Gyllenhaal carries the film fairly well and the rest of the cast turn in recommendable turns too.Most of them are no name,but the two that aren't,in the shape of Patrick Swayze (returning from oblivion) as a motivational speaker and Drew Barrymore as an unconventional poetry teacher,are thankless roles that aren't really of any necessity to the already convulted plotline.The bunny's presence has an eerie,unnerving feel (for something so ridiculous) but maybe I'm just a bit too phased for characters like him to have an effect anymore (something to do with psychopathic,demonic clowns,that kind of thing.)Overall,I'm sure the film had some kind of deep,hidden meaning and significance to it,and I'm pretty sure I got it.The film just had no real effect on me.**",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Time travel meets teenage angst,"This great film nicely tackles the old chestnut of time travel by slowly revealing details throughout the film, but it is not until you get to the end that you realise what's going on, and then you need to watch it all over again to check it out. No wonder it bombed at the box office, but took off finally in DVD format... and now is number 95 in the IDMB all time hit list. The new double DVD directors cut is the business, including an amazing art show based on the movie, and loads of extras.Richard Kelly (director/screen writer/artist) covers all the bases of teenage angst; teachers, parents, gurus, relationships, fat kids, bullies, religion (it's no surprise that the highest ratings for this film come from teenage girls). But in the end its a love story, and love conquers all.This is one of those films that demands several viewings, and much discussion. Surely it will be studied at film school (""Discuss the significance of rabbits""). Perhaps it was Richard Kelly's intention, having just left University of Southern California studying film only 3 years before shooting DD. In the director's over-dub, Richard Kelly states that once he decided on the end and beginning of the main plot, he then just filled the rest of the film with clues... and yes, they are there, waiting to be deconstructed by film buffs the world over.In HARVEY, the 1950's classic where James Stewart talks to an imaginary 6'7"" rabbit, the advantages of his company are elaborated by Stewart... ""Oh, yes! Yes. Yes - these things always work out just the way Harvey says they will. He is very, very versatile. Did I tell you he could stop clocks? Well, you've heard the expression 'His face would stop a clock'? Well, Harvey - can look at your clock and stop it. And you can go anywhere you like - with anyone you like - and stay as long as you like -- and when you get back -- not one minute will have ticked by"".... coincidence? I think not. If I understand Richard Kelly, then he will love the connection even if he didn't plan it (but a film graduate probably had to study how Stewart made acting to an imaginary character seem natural).And of course the music is fantastic. The film made Gary Jules famous for his cover of the Tears for Fears classic ""It's a mad world"" .",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Beware of the bunny,"Firstly, I have to say it's my No. 1 movie of all time.Donnie Darko has that *something* about it that makes it a truly great movie but what...A dysfunctional teenager played by Jake Gyllenhaal (Subsequently of Brokeback mountain) gets sucked into a surreal life trip, driven by a strange character in a six foot bunny outfit. Due to Donnie's psychological condition, rather than being phased, he greets the surreal with a level of matter of fact acceptance that a more balanced character would not. The Bunny informs Donnie that in 28 Days, ... the world will end. From here, the plot unfolds, introducing us to a wealth of rich characters that all interact and combine to shape the final outcome of the movie in a myriad of subtle ways.This film, from first time writer/director Richard Kelly blends a refreshing combination of non-stereotypical characters with an absorbing and intelligent storyline. While doing so however, the pace is mostly spot on with perhaps only the hotel scene really coming across as slow.The retro 80s soundtrack is well chosen, especially as it has gone on record that the choice of music was constrained by budget in some places. On top of this, the instrumental scores fit beautifully... The most notable examples come when Donnie embarks on the various tasks he ""has"" to complete. Of special note is when Donnie sits in the cinema talking to the rabbit. This is a fantastically dark scene combining atmospheric visuals with a haunting instrumental.The ""Mad World"" track, both words and score, over the final scenes of the film works so well, you could almost believe it was written for the film, were it not for Tears For Fears original version released many years before.An element of light comedic moments punctuate the darker undercurrent of the film. These however, never spoil the overall ambiance of the film as they mostly come in the form of sharp script and are executed well by the characters, never becoming overbearing.Perhaps the most enthralling aspect of this film comes on subsequent viewings. You can view the movie once, enjoy the soundtrack, the effective though not lavish visuals, the clean well defined characters and the 'superficial' story. After this viewing however, you're left hungry by the questions of what certain scenes meant, why characters did what they did and said what they said. This to me, is what makes it truly great. You go back again, and on the second viewing you understand some more, see things you never noticed the first time, and start to piece together a much deeper, more complex story. You see now, how actions and consequences inter-relate.Once you think you understand Donnie Darko, then I'd suggest looking at the forums here on IMDb, or look up one of the many fan sites for it on the internet and see how close you are to others interpretation of the story... It can be quite enlightening, and chances are... you'll want to watch it again, and again.I for one can't wait for his next project, Southland Tales.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"wake up, donnie..","**WARNING- THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**there are very few movies that really reflect the way i feel, honestly i think its the only one. there are many explanations for this film but, from my point of view all the movie is happening is those couple of moments that we see donnie laughing, he is see what is going to happen, he see the nothing that beyond the society who around him.this movie talks about how this life line is like a box that u cant go out, because what kelly trying to show that the you cant go nowhere in school u cant develop and u cant be creative, school made u like a robot. donnie see in frank the knowledge of what he needs to do, and that's the reason that he see him as something scary, because he knows what he needs to do and that is frighting him.. like frank says in the theater- why do you wearing that stupid man suit? frank explain donnie that he choose to see him as a monster.frank represents the wisdom that beyond. u can see frank also as a tear in donnie's heart donnie was so long in that box where he cant express his emotions until he ""blow's out"" you can say, and the only way to survive is break what around u break the rules. also frank say's to donnie- ""wake up"", wake up.. wake up from the box the society created for you, wake up- don't afraid to create, don't afraid to destroy. this movie show's to us how people go around them self all the time and they don't even notice, this movie give us any reason to believe in obsessions and fate, that movie show us that our fate is already setand we cant escape from it. frank already knows that he cant save donnie, he want at least that before he dies he shows what really stand's beyond all this. but what kelly show's us in the end that even if a man look that empty he can also cry and he also afraid and like donnie all the people are troubled in their own way, you cant really know somebody until u see him alone in his room. more or less this movie laugh about the American society, but still he kinda build in a American way that i find very disturbing with that movie, i think that this movie needs to show more dream like, kinda like ""mulholland dr"".but this movie shows perfectly loneliness and to be a stranger in school. and ross there plays marvelous and she is so sweet , i fall for her couple minutes after her first appearanceit is one of my 3 tops and i much prefer it from movies i would give them 10, but i gave IT nine cause it think it can be better for others who doesn't identify with the movie.for me it gets 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Donnie Darko is a great Psychological Thriller...,"The basic story of the film is about a troubled teen who is constantly visited by a six foot bunny rabbit named Frank.

A Puzzle for puzzled people.,"If you are young and dissatisfied with your family, if you do not have too many good friends, and you are having a feeling that the whole world is stupid, evil and against you, and you are wishing that someday you will have some special scientific power to destroy all evil and save the world..... Donnie Darko is the perfect movie for you.Its a fairy tale cashing in on introvert teen sentiments! Surreal is not the right word, Donnie Darko is based on science. Well at least it has a few sprinkles of unexplained scientific twists here and there to help you spend a lot of time looking for logic even after the movie is over. This is an added advantage because you spend money for a two hour movie, and then wonder and discuss about it for two years. Great deal?Well, the movie is about a boy who seems a bit retard and drowsy because of his psychotic medications. He faces his family which is not too supportive about his confusions about life. He faces friends in school who are not exactly his type. He faces other grown ups like teachers and doctors around him who do not have enough intellect to understand the depth of his mind. And everyone around him is mostly dishonest, blunt or evil to the core!Being shy and drowsy, there was not much chance that he could find a girlfriend. But one day the most beautiful girl in school chooses him as the cutest guy in class! A perfect dream come true for a troubled teenage boy! So at last it seems like his troubled life will come to an end! But not for long....! Soon he will have to play the role of a knight in shining armor to save his girlfriend's life... and by lying down on his bed.The director is smart! He was only 25 when he made this movie. He remembered his teenage days and the complexes that an average troubled teenage mind usually has about the grown up world. He totally cashed in on that. He added some new concept from hypothetical science to make a few parts of the movie a bit difficult (often impossible) to understand, so that the viewers do not feel its cliché, and get a subject to talk about it for years to come.So if you are grown up and confident about yourself, you will readily figure out what this movie is trying to do. But if you are still confused about the world, you will probably love this movie, irrespective of your age!",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

See my last line,"I spent much time on Donnie Darko for almost 3 times read-through. The group's commentary track is kind of boring so I skipped some. Just like for Shining I couldn't stop seeing it time after time. Because I have a desire to search out what exactly horrified me. I think fear is one of the most precious human feelings. When people fear that's because he sees the truth that he never saw. Only those shallow-headed would try to smile all day and shout ""I don't fear any more!"" It also has a wonderful and pure British soundtrack that features some cool New Wave/Post Punk bands. Maybe the best entertainment film one could ever make when he has only four million dollars to spend in current times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A classic allegory of the impact of belief on reality,"This is a movie with many layers, and no two people will see the same story when they watch it. That is how it was intended for even the writer and director made it clear that options exist for interpretation. For me this is an allegory which reflects upon the role of how one's perspective on life is influenced by how one views God and the gods of science and religion. Michael Andrews music is superb and adds a depth worthy of this classic. Those who watch this movie as science fiction will enjoy it, because this movie is a science fiction classic. Alternate universes, time travel and the possibility that two alternate universes can impact each other are handled with a subtle brush that leaves open many interpretations. But when the movie is watched a second time, the science fiction is replaced with the notion of a mind game with each character reflecting an aspect of the human response to a world driven by religion, science and desire. The third viewing allows the two competing (and conflicting) views to interact in a strange way that gives this movie the depth that keeps bringing people back again and again. If you own only one movie, this would be a logical choice because you can watch it repeatedly and find something new each time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Far from perfect, but not a bad film","This film is strangely polarizing. It seems that most people either loved it or loathed it, and I don't consider myself in either group. I saw this movie for the first time years ago and didn't remember most of the details, so I decided it was time to watch it again and see what all the fuss is about. The version I saw was the director's cut, so I can't speak for the original.First off, I'd like to praise the acting. Most of the actors in this film were spot on, particularly Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mother, Rose. The only performance for me that didn't quite hit the mark was Jake Gyllenhaal's, but I think that's just a matter of personal preference, not a flaw in his acting. Drew Barrymore was excellent as the English teacher and I've always been a fan of Maggie Gyllenhaal's.One thing that really stood out for me in this film is how well the relationships between the characters were written. I found them well-developed, genuine and very enjoyable to watch, particularly those of the Darko family. Obviously the sibling relationship portrayed by the Gyllenhaals was spot on, but I also very much enjoyed the interactions between not only Donnie and his parents, but between the parents themselves.The negatives in this film come largely from the supporting characters and from some of the writing. I felt that most of the characters in Donnie's school were very two-dimensional and the dialogue between the young characters felt like it was written by someone who couldn't quite remember how they spoke in their teen years and gave it their best approximation. The banter between the teenage boys was stiff and not quite believable (and there was one line in particular directed at a young female character that I found offensive and unnecessary).I did enjoy the way everything plays out and comes together in the end. Though any story that deals in time travel is bound to have plot holes, I felt the plot was fairly well-executed and didn't leave any glaring inconsistencies.All in all, I found Donnie Darko to be quite watchable and reasonably intelligent, but with room for growth in the filmmaking. I wouldn't go so far as to call it brilliant or a masterpiece as so many others have, but it's a film that makes you think, and those can be hard to come by these days.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Unique story, masterfully done","When a movie sets an off beat tone like this, the level of quality of the presentation makes it either a brilliant masterpiece or an incoherent mess. This one was expertly organized with generous doses of everything from sinister humor to philosophical and imaginative perceptions, and succeeds in becoming one of the masterpieces.This story is as rich as Fort Knox with symbolic metaphors, there's literally one at every moment of the film. You'll probably notice, in repeat viewings, new elements you hadn't noticed before. From blatant ones, such as Donnie's last name, to subtleties, such as who was on the plane when it lost its engine, they just keep on coming. The film will leave you considering its many meanings long after seeing it. Different people will take different messages from the story's many sub-plots; I suspect if you were to put 12 people in a room and have them write their interpretation of the film's meaning, you'd get 13 different responses. The well meaning motivations of Donnie and others that lead to destructive, rather than constructive, solutions is only one topic to analyze. How much of what we see is real or delusion?The acting is sensational; the entire cast become their respective roles, some of which are quirky and even bizarre. Jake Gyllenhall, is great in the title role, at times creepy, evil, heroic, psychotic, hypnotic, confused, introspective and so on. Just discussing his character alone can leave many opinions, I'll simply refer to him as an ""anti-hero."" What would seem at the outset as a film being weird just for the sake of being weird proves to be much more. This film could have been lazy and stereotyped one character to pick on, but it succeeds in rounding all its characters, their strong as well as weak points. A film well worth a viewing.

Hamletian,"Donnie Darko is a teen horror film. In addition, it's a teen romance. In addition, Donnie Darko is a Hamletian study in familial relationship. The viewer never really knows whether Donnie, a brilliant high school kid is wacko or completely sane while his adult world is nutty. I particularly liked the scenes with the lady-shrink where under hypnosis Donnie has a self-pleasuring moment. Things can go wrong in those shrink sessions for sure.There are two groups of adults here, the Democrats and the Republicans. Dukakis is smart and thoughtful. Bush 1 is stammering and smarmy. The Physical Education teacher is new-age bunko, book burning, inflexible along with her idol, Patrick Swayze, as the handsome motivational speaker with one message, there's Fear and Love. To contrast, Drew Barrymore plays the really cool young English teacher that gets canned for being too Liberal. Donnie rebels and insists there is a world of grays out there, not black and white. Okay, this is relativism which has it's own critics. I'd go along with the evil Dan Quail idea if it were more developed, but good and evil in Darko is pretty cardboard.I'm not at all sure why Kelly decided it was important to do a 1988 film in 2001. You got me on that one. There's as much political animosity and self-help gobblygook today as there was in the 80's. I can only assume that the 80's was a crucible for the director.Finally, Darko is an incredibly creative film, very interesting to watch visually as things might fall out of the sky at any moment. Donnie walks through life in movie time, effortlessly burning down buildings while his girlfriend sleeps during a movie date. My teen dates were never like that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Genre Fusing Masterpiece Of Cinema,"Lynchian? Perhaps this is the only way in which a summary of Donnie Darko can be compressed into just one word. This film is an absolute mish-mash of varying styles and genres, but has the added bonus of succeeded in its amalgamation of styles which quite frankly makes it one of the great films of not only the 21st Century but perhaps in cinematic history. Am I over-hyping this film? Perhaps not nearly enough.A surreal blend of dark humour, science fiction, teen drama and high school angst, Donnie Darko is a mind tripping, thought out journey through the life of one adolescent as he comes to terms not only with the arduous task that is puberty, parents, school and friends, but that his perceived delusions and eccentricities will make him the only one that can save the universe from complete destruction. This may sound like a garbled mess but it works wonderfully due to the way that the director, Richard Kelly, manages to tell convincingly all aspects of this story in a way where nothing feels, forced, nerdish or out of place.Guiding Donnie through the time ridden paradox that is this film is be-musingly a six foot tall bunny rabbit named Frank. While Franks identity may become somewhat clearer throughout the course of the film, his presence works on several levels (as indeed does the film). Not only is he a mental figmentation but he is also a manifestation of the teenage angst that raged (or will rage, depending) inside all of us. The need to rebel and break free of rules, moulds and confines to cope with the fear that comes with having to grow up. On top of this there are many referential notes to make with Frank, that first and foremost of ""Watership Down"", which itself is present in the film make reference to how Donnie and Frank mirror their rabbit counterparts fiver and the spectre that haunts him with tales of the worlds demise. There are more obvious analogies, the simplest of which is Alice In Wonderland and how the White Rabbit provides the means for the hero to return to where they are supposed to be. Unfortunately, it's far too difficult to go into too much detail without having to ingrain a spoiler at the top, because many of the films key notations are inward and secular, as they constantly repeat themselves in varying formats, but by the same token provide a film which can be interpreted by all viewers in different and personal ways.Donnie Darko succeeds because it gets the small things right. The made for cinema cut is slightly more Lynchian than the directors cut due to the absence of some notable moments and thereby lacking the continuity, and so I'd have to recommend the Directors Cut due to it being somewhat more coherent (although that's not essential) and providing a deeper explanation as to the events which transpire. Moments where Donnie is playing on an Arcade machine, and the importance of placebo's are key plot moments but are lost on the viewer without the Directors Cut. But whichever version the subtleties of plot and character developments keep the viewer hooked. The interesting twists and turns of the story whether it be human drama or science fiction are exceptionally well written and perfectly acted. Suffice to say this film works on more levels than one, and will leave a deeply profound affect on all those that want it to.Donnie Darko was recently credited (if all the critical acclaim and general love by all fans of cinema wasn't enough) as being in the top ten of fifty films you must see before you die, and to be honest I couldn't have phrased it better myself. There is little to say without spoiling the film for those that haven't seen it and there is little I can say which hasn't already been said about this film. It is for want of a better phrase a modern day masterpiece, an exercise in cinematic achievement highlighting an ability to tell stories which many thought was all but lost. Few films are worthy of pedestals, and while the amount by which tens are brandished around on IMDb, few films are worthy of a ten. Donnie Darko deserves it all.

Who knew a movie with a 6-foot tall demonic rabbit named Frank could be so good?,"I watched Donnie Darko with pretty high expectations. After all, look at the cast: Drew Barrymore, Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze, Jena Malone, etc. Well, this movie exceeded my expectations. This is NOT a movie for those who don't like to think during movies. Donnie Darko is about a troubled teen(Jake Gyllenhaal) who escapes a freak accident because of following a 6-foot tall demonic image of a bunny rabbit out of the house(yes, you read that correctly). Frank then tells him that in 28 days the world will end. Donnie begins to see Frank a lot and is convinced by Frank to commit a series of crimes. Important to the story is Donnie's girlfriend, Gretchen (Jena Malone). I can't tell you really anything else so I don't reveal any spoilers, except that the storyline also has to do with time travel. This is a psychological thriller that has quickly become my favorite movie. It is VERY different from the movies out there today. Being the girl I am, the ending made me cry.

This is ""Harvey"" standing on its big bunny ears - not a benign, invisible friend, but an evil-looking rabbit ordering Donnie to commit acts that cause chaos and even death.So is this is a wormhole movie, an indictment on the public school system (as the director says), or the story of a deeply disturbed young man with strange dreams? I don't know.Whatever it is, ""Donnie Darko"" is a very provocative film and well worth viewing. It also has a great soundtrack that includes the intriguing song ""Mad World"" - the Adam Lambert version of this song plays on ""General Hospital"" every time James Franco walks on camera.Gyllenhaal is ably supported by Katharine Ross, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, Mary McDonnell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jenna Malone, and Noah Wylie.See it for yourself and make your own decisions: schizophrenic, dreamer, time traveler, all three - or something else? A fascinating film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Okay, but not that great...","It seems that whenever I read about a movie, the nice people at IMDB.com recommends that I should see Donnie Darko. Well.... I already did. Many people on this page had already praised this movie, so I had to see what the fuzz was all about.I was disappointed!The movie is not bad, it is just plain boring. Nothing much seems to happen, but still the feeling and the tension makes you watch the entire movie. I did not find it as rewarding, as I had hoped. I would rather not go into details, as everybody probably knows the plot. My main problem is that people on this site seem to think that you LOVE this movie or you are pretty dumb. Well... I don't and I'm not. I just like a LITTLE action in films. There, I said it!But my biggest question is: Why do the people at IMDB think that I would enjoy this movie, if I like horror, comedy, suspense, thriller, drama, or adventure, etc. Personally I do not think that EVERYBODY who loves ANY kinds of movies like this. I have seen some movies that I really liked. I have seen some i adore. This is not one of them.Not a complete waste of time, but if you need action, don't even bother...6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A promising story tarnished,"When i sat down to watch Donnie Darko i wasn't sure what to expect. I'd heard it had a huge cult following and was about time travel but bar that i was in the dark.As the film cracked open it was clear to me why the movie's got such a cult following. It's just not really what you're used to seeing in a film. Donnie is a bright but moody teenager who also happens to be very likable, in itself an unusual thing as such potentially re-hashed characters rarely come off well. Donnie's dad is another superb character who will crack anyone up as he fails to reprimand his children after making up brilliant new swears. Actually i'd say the best thing the film has to offer is a shed load of impressively quirky and original characters.Also if you're into a bit of a mystery thriller (like myself) then Darko will have you by the short and curlys. With weird numbers and stranger people turning up left right and centre you can't help but wonder how everything will end up fitting together... sadly that's where the film falls on its ass.Maybe the promising start raised my expectations to high, but those of you hoping for an intriguing ending will be greatly disappointed. I won't go and spoil you but suffice to say things are answered in the one of the blandest and least satisfying ways possible. Another niggling problem for me is how alike the film is to Butterfly Effect (or vice versa as this was made before Butterfly). Both films look set to be time travel thrillers and end up as dark comedies revolving around a mentally unstable young man. The thing is The Butterfly Effect really gets the ending (in the directors cut anyway) right. It just works. Unfortunately Darko's ending feels unpleasant and rushed.But i think really you've got to decide for yourself whether the poor ending makes up for the otherwise brilliant performances put in by all involved.At the end of the day i had to gun for a 7/10 a cracking story spoiled by a badly formed ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Still Darklicious,"The Darkman is back! No, not another straight-to-video sequel of 'Darkman'. I am referring to the tormented juvenile schizophrenic ""Donnie Darko', who has obtained a cult following since the film's release back in 2001. This is not a sequel to 'Donnie Darko', even though that would be one dark side I would have loved to revisit. The latest cinematic release of Darko is the Director's cut of the original. Therefore, I will release my own Meezer's cut of my original film review of 'Donnie Darko'. (Meezer Cuts are in italics)Do not be afraid of the darko! Why? Because 'Donnie Darko' is one of the best and original films of 2001, and in 2004 it also made the cut. Jake Gyllenhaal is amazing as Donnie Darko. Donnie is just your average teenager who has schizophrenic visions of a demonic rabbit who tells him to flood his school and burn motivational speaker's mansions, among other things. Moreover, Frank the Rabbit (as he likes to be called) warns Donnie that the world will end in 28 days 6 hours 42 minutes 12 seconds; which is how long this revamped Meezer Cut Review will last! Just kidding! Talk about a real life rabbit test! Director Richard's Kelly debut film is, and still is, a masterpiece. Kelly is a director to watch out for in the future; even though he has not directed anything since Darko. One hit wonder anyone? I do not think that he will be left in the dark. The supporting cast of: Mary Mcdonnell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze, Jena Malone, Noah Wyle, and Drew Barrymore 'energized' the film with our bunny and Mr. Darko. So you should definitely see 'Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut ' in 1 day 1 hr 1 min 10 seconds or how long it takes you to get to your nearby store or in this case the theatre. ***** Still Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Smacks of 12 Monkeys...,"...but mostly in the /feel/ of the movie, the atmosphere and the time travel aspects. And of course, because there's a crazy guy involved, but he's no Brad Pitt.SPOILERS AHEADLooks like many other have already covered the story aspects of this film, so I'll not reiterate, but assume you, the reader, have read the descriptions and go on from there. First of all, it felt like a French film in the sense of a great big ""HUH."" at the end of the movie. It is somewhat open for interpretation, though not nearly as much so as the typical ""I want to say something big but don't know how"" French flick. Still, there is a very definite sense that the writer wanted to say something, wanted to make and/or argue a point and maybe in the screenplay he did... and when it was translated to film, it lost its eloquence. Now folks, weirdness does not a good movie make, just as big flowery words and descriptions do not a good poem make. What is makes is fluff... padding. And it's not needed. Donnie Darko is certainly interesting, I will give it that, but there's more than a few brow furrowers here.My biggest gripe, oddly enough, is with Drew Barrymore, one of the many executive producers. Whether she actually WAS a producer or was given that title as a means of coaxing her into the movie (sometimes it's a form of 'payment'), I don't know, but what DID her character have to do with anything?? We watch her get fired. Do we care? NO, because we don't know why she's even there. Well, her most poignant 2 words, ""Cellar Door"" is, I think, her only meaningful lines besides the fact that she is the evil, free-thinking teacher who introduced the book that was the cause behind the school flooding. That could have been handled differently and given to a more important character. She is totally unnecessary. Patrick Swayze's character... again, I suppose added in there only for some incredibly minor plot points that could have been handled differently, too. He was a very weak link, much like Barrymore, and there just was no reason for them at all. If you watch this movie, pay close attention to their parts in the film. Maybe I'm missing something, but they were some seriously big pieces of fluff. The fat little girl who says only ""Shut up!!"" twice in the movie and nothing more, though I did like her little talent show dance routine... why was she there? I thought maybe that, while she was sitting outside after the dance, she would look out and be the one to alert SOMEone that Jim's (Swayze's) house was on fire or something... anything that made her being there actually have a modicum of sense. No... nothing unless it was deleted. I didn't bother with the special features. The more I think about it, the more I realize that almost ALL the characters were unnecessary, redundant, and fluff only and maybe that was the writer's statement... but then, we get into the French attitude there and there's a reason I don't watch French films.The whole Frank thing was fascinating. He of the injured eye, the one line of cryptic ""I'm so sorry"" in the theater. (They were watching Evil Dead and making danged sure they never showed Campbell, but I have to give them kudos for the movie choice.) Around that time, I was getting flashbacks of ""American Werewolf in London"" where the main character sees the undead souls of this victims and talks to them. It was kind of like that but not. And Frank tells Donnie to do things like burn down houses for no apparent reason. Oh thank goodness mister ""Fearlove"" was actually a child porn baddie, but not like anyone knew, so it made no sense to burn down his house in any kind of righteous anger or anything. And there was no righteous anger, Frank just said do it, so Donnie did, for no particular reason. We find out much later than Frank and his bunny suit is actually the killer of Gretchen and gets shot in the eye, but you know, it's not really fair of the writer, because the guy who plays Frank is not important to the storyline except as the bunny. There is no foreshadowing, there is no hint, it's like a poorly written mystery novel where we, the viewer, don't get enough to figure it out, we're not privy to what the detectives know, and /that's/ the big mystery. Of course, it doesn't have to be linear. Obviously, this movie was going against linear things, but whenever time travel is involved, I have to cringe: it always makes such a mess of things.So there's the jet engine that ends up being the engine of his mother and sister's plane 28 days in the future. It crashes through Donnie's room, he's out cuz the bunny told him to be, so he lives, and the movie happens. In the end, it all happens all over again except that Donnie is in his room and dies, thus creating a new reality where the bad things that happened to people like Gretchen don't happen. Except it's his mom's jet engine and she may or may not have gone on that trip 28 days in the future now that Donnie's dead and none of the stuff ever happened. Weird, yes, but it's not a mind bender in the smart sense since anything to do with time inescapably gets warped, ruined and twisted in a way that wouldn't happen if time travel were possible. It's the grin and bear it syndrome. So be it.Summary: It's a good movie and worth a watching. Some people swear by this flick and more power to them. But I say strip away the fluff and fancy words and see what's underneath, look at the base. Does it stand on its own? Donnie Darko is a bit wobbly, but it manages to spin a fascinating tale and should be rented, not bought, and viewed at least once if you're in the mood for something French but that makes more sense.On the technical side, good camera work, rich filming, decent directing and an eerie atmosphere. The acting is pretty solid. The main character was creepy and scary, yet we could sympathize with him and his love interest. It is a well-made movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I want my money back,"It's too bad the IMDB doesn't award votes of zero for a film. Donnie Darko would be a candidate for the goose egg.I've sat through many a bad film -- Gummo comes to mind -- or challenging films from the Goddard canon. But Donnie Darko was so awful that I nearly shut it off 30 minutes in, and I only stuck around because there was *one* funny scene that referenced the Smurfs. I'm now regretting that decision.The plot, if you can call it that, is like Harvey meets Amelie on a dimly-lit back street. Set in 1988, Donnie Darko is about a high-school kid who's being haunted by visions of an ugly bunny rabbit who visits him at weird hours of the night. The rabbit, who really looks like a guy in a bad Easter costume, saves Donnie's life one day from being crushed to death by a wayward jet engine that falls out of the sky. The bunny rabbit then convinces Donnie that the world's going to end in less than a month, which means Mr. Darko has to go out and vandalize his school or the homes of no-gooders all in the name of ... well, I'm not entire sure.Nothing makes sense in Donnie Darko. There's all sorts of allegories to the 1988 U.S. election that don't pay off. The ending is muddled and, by that time, you'll have stopped caring why nothing makes sense. Then there's these bizarre extended musical sequences set to horrible '80s music that pop up for no apparent reason other than to possibly pad the running time.But you really don't want to get me started on the dialogue and the acting. Drew Barrymore is *horrible* as an English teacher, and seems to be reading her lines off a TelePrompter. Some of the high school bullies look spaced out on drugs, and *aren't* threatening or menacing at all. And I have absolutely zero idea what Gretchen, the token romantic interest, sees in our (anti)-hero. Note to screenwriter: ""He's weird"" doesn't cut it.Then there's the god-awful CGI, which liberally borrows special effects last seen in *The Abyss*.There's only one good decent thing I can say about this movie, aside from the aforementioned Smurf scene: the kid who plays Donnie actually does a good job. He almost makes the whole thing watchable -- until the utterly confusing ending cancels it out. Sometimes, aping David Lynch is *not* a good thing.I don't get how so many people have been duped by this waste of time. Personally, I want my $5 in rental fees back.

Potentially great...that is if you can understand it.,"This can be a potentially great film ,you just have to follow it really, really well. You always have to with these psychological thrillers.

Make sure you see one of the best films of 2001 and one of the most stunning debuts of a director ever.,"You'd think angst in the late 80's was reserved for those who could foresee Wall Street greed transform itself into a monumental crash a little more than a decade later. Then there's Donnie Darko, who could see the end of the world prophesied by a menacing Harvey-like bunny, a sort of guardian devil.The film `Donnie Darko,' directed by first-timer Richard Kelly, depicts teenage disaffection in such a low-key way as to make it almost sweet, largely due to the eponymous hero as played by the sweetly low-key Jake Gyllenhaal. The precipitating crisis of a falling airplane engine seems to crystallize all the danger of the modern world that Donnie accepts ruefully and cynically. This film is funnier and more truthful than last year's excellent `Ghost World.'Although at times Kelly seems to be imitating David Lynch, this is as original a film as `American Beauty,' `Memento,' or `Mulholland Drive' and sometimes just as dense.  Yet there are moments of clarity such as when he tells a gym teacher where to put her timeline or when he exposes the self-help guru (Patrick Swayze) for what he really is.  Donnie is a crusader for the disaffected teens of the world.The key ingredient of the film's success is that Donnie appears to be normal except when he's bullied by a giant rabbit.  Not a totally weird kid, just a slightly rebellious teen who can see the end coming. Make sure you see one of the best films of 2001 and one of the most stunning debuts of a director ever.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Giving Into Fear,"It's films like these that make me love cinema. I know I say that a lot, but it's worth mentioning how movies like Donnie Darko give me a unique feeling. It's hard to explain, but much like Mulholland Drive, I wanted to look up more about the film after I watched it. It's not a film that allows you to go back to your normal life before you sit down and think about what you just saw. I cant believe I hadn't watched the movie until now, but I'm also jealous of people who haven't seen it. It's one of those movies that transcends the screen and becomes more than just something you watched, it's something you experienced.It's 2015 and Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the top actors in the world, but way back in 2001 that wasn't the case. In fact, Donnie Darko was one of the first movies to showcase what he had to offer. I will still maintain that the most impressive thing Gyllenhaal does is create a character with his eyes. Everything goes through his subtle eye movements and gestures. Take a look back at his performance in Nightcrawler or Prisoners and analyze how much his eyes define his character. He may very well be the best actor working today. As Donnie, he was able to showcase just how good he can be at nailing a character with inner demons. None more terrifying than Frank, the strange rabbit who appears frequently throughout Donnie's dreams. More importantly, Jake gives us a character who you sympathize with even after all of the horrible things he has done. Not many people can say that.For most of the film, it's hard to figure out just what is going on. Not just because of the huge cast and seemingly several important characters to the plot, but because the film juggles many different genres all in one. It's a psychological thriller at heart, but mixed in is sci-fi, horror, crime, and even a little bit of romance. It's actually probably because of those many genres that I feel the films main weaknesses derive from. The tone is shifting a lot throughout the film and the music constantly switches from being a 90's high school angst film to a dark twisted psychological mystery film a lot.But overall it's a really good film. The phrase ""keeps you on the edge of your seat"" can be considered an understatement for Darko. The two hours sped by and I honestly didn't want it to end. Even after the twisted ending, I wanted to see where these characters went. Speaking of characters, it's worth mentioning how good all of the other actors are here. Maggie Gyllenhaal, playing Donnie's sister, looks just about as stunning as she's ever been, and is also pretty darn good in the role too. Jena Malone in one of her first major roles definitely carries her own weight as the lead female and love interest to Donnie. But Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, and Mary McDonnell all make their presence felt here.So of course, then comes the question of what my opinion is on the ending of the film. While in some senses it's ambiguous, I don't think it's beyond belief to think that the ending was meticulously crafted in order for us to debate for years to come. I've done my research and am satisfied with what I believe to be the fate of all the characters. But one of the biggest takeaways from the film I found was the inspiration the film seemed to take from David Lynch. Even though Mulholland Drive came out the same year, it really seemed to take a whole lot from that type of storytelling. If you told me Lynch directed Donnie Darko I would have believed you. But anyway, Donnie Darko is on it's own one of the best thrillers I have seen in a long time, and definitely one of Gyllenhaal's best films.+Gyllenhaal's performance through his eyes+Great cast+Unique+Ending that takes some time to process-Genre mixing can be exhausting at times9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
What a mindtrip,"In Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse-Five, the protagonist Billy Pilgrim meets an alien race from Tralfamadore who can see a lifespan in the form of a line moving from the entity's beginning to its end. This view, called the fourth dimension by the Talfamadorians, allows them to piece together every part of a life and know the past, present, and future of all living things.Director Richard Kelly seems to be a devotee to the Vonnegut story, piecing his first film, Donnie Darko, into a story that defies much of the three-dimensional boundaries set in stone by the modern living. As the film slowly peels away its story of Darko and his suburban milieu, the audience can easily imagine a future that could involve marrying a woman like Valencia Merble and a 1976 demise similar to Billy Pilgrim's. Even the character of Kilgore Trout and his sci-fi writings have been recreated in an absentee old lady called Grandma Death (Cleveland) who wrote a book on time-travel.Donnie Darko (Gyllenhaal), of course, is not Billy Pilgrim in many ways -- the setting has left World War II and moved into the Reagan era and Valencia Merble has become a more likable youngster named Gretchen Ross (Malone). Darko is a dark young man whose actions have frightened his parents into sending him to a psychiatrist (Ross) and pushing him on medication for his mental condition. Donnie, of course, is distraught by his parents' ineffectualness for his feelings, especially in his mother (McDonnell), who tries desperately to relate to her son.Set in October 1988 (the Bush-Dukakis election remains a constant background story), the film delves into Donnie's belief that the world has only 28 days left before destruction. A six-foot rabbit with a skeleton mask named Frank has told him this and he is intent on making sure he can understand as much as possible about the world and correct a few problems before the 28th day. This involves everything from a budding romance with Gretchen, an obsessively doting teacher (Grant), and a pretentious local self-help guru (Swayze). There are many Holden Cauffield phonies roaming around this suburban sprawl and it is Donnie Darko's task to put them in their place before the world ends.Calamity serves as a major device in the film with equal attention set upon time-travel and the Tralfamadorian ability to look across one's life like looking across a timeline in a book. Richard Kelly's film works on many levels to produce a satisfactory tale of sadness and resolve in a misbegotten mind. Rarely do films come along that yearn to not only entertain on a simple level, but also painstakingly pit the characters in worlds not necessarily farcical, but not too realistic either.The film's dark side will remind many filmgoers of American Beauty, though Kelly's resolve to turn the film to absurdness at times may hearken a little closer to Being John Malkovich. This is a movie where the downtrodden appeal serves a greater service to the surrealism than the melodrama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Nothing less than a cult masterpiece,"Donnie Darko is an extraordinary cinematic masterpiece that defies categorization, leaving audiences in awe with its ingeniously perplexing story and a tour de force performance by Jake Gyllenhaal as the enigmatic Donnie. Richard Kelly, the visionary director, weaves a complex narrative that has left countless minds spinning in contemplation. The film effortlessly walks the tightrope between teenage drama and mind-bending mystery, creating a truly unique cinematic experience. Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Donnie is nothing short of exceptional, capturing the character's internal struggles and fractured psyche with remarkable depth and intensity. His nuanced performance allows us to empathize with Donnie's journey of self-discovery amidst a web of time travel, parallel universes, and existential themes. The film's thought-provoking storyline is layered with symbolism and metaphysical concepts, inviting endless interpretations and discussions. Donnie Darko transcends the boundaries of conventional storytelling, challenging our perceptions and leaving us questioning the nature of reality itself. Richard Kelly's directorial prowess shines through in every frame, as he masterfully creates an eerie and atmospheric world that envelops the viewer.

Bizarre but slightly brilliant,"This is a weird film - but that isn't a bad thing.A mind-bending story with some great stylistic choices and career-defining starts for the Gyllenhaals produces a fun film, and it doesn't hurt when the soundtrack is of a similarly high quality.Following the titular character's consequences from a brush with death, Donnie Darko tackles supernatural influences, personal demons and the iconic ""rabbit"" that is now synonymous with the movie. Some of the guest appearances are also good additions: Patrick Swayze is excellent in his cameo, and several other characters embody their roles.Stylistically this film won't tick the boxes for everyone - there are some unique shots and some slightly heavy-handed uses of antiquated CGI - but all in all, Donnie Darko is worth watching for the experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

You'll like it or you will not.Maybe it's just better to be dead,or stop doing anything in order to save the humanity.Look at the history,or even better,look around yourself,watch on TV,hear on radio,the destruction is a form of creativity.Like Ivo Andric wrote in his Nobel prise winner work ( Bridge on the river Drina )-""Nothing can bound and gather people as collective disaster"".Donnie Darko is wicked story about mentally unstable teenager who thinks that a world is going to be end in less than a month.Dialogs are quite interesting,David is awesome and whole plot is excellent set.Everything is spinning about Donnie's rationality which is perfectly used to give an answer of some major questions about growing up and to criticize cold,cliché way of living in American dream. Maybe the perfect way of living,in the world where problems doesn't exist,creates monstrous people,changing calmness to destructively behavior. The main question in the movie is-when is going to be the end of the world? Now,when i've watched the movie,I think that for Donnie the end came on the night when his girlfriend was ran over,and when the love was, once again,destructed by human hands. We create love,we destruct it,it is endless circle of our existing and the only thing that separates cowards from heroes is an answer on question-Would you have enough heart to change things if you would be given one more chance? Even though that a price of changing the faith is your own life.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Surprised and still puzzled!,"Tonight a Dutch television station broad-casted Donnie Darko. I saw it listed in the television guide, and decided to watch. For some personal reasons (for which I don't give any explanation) I hesitated a bit, but I still did. The story was well told, and the plot was based on a good foundation. However, it wasn't too hard to follow the storyline. Even the meaning of the ""cellardoor"" was clear to me! The most special thing about this movie is the consequence: its story is still puzzling me (in a pleasant way)! So, the movie is much longer than listed! It's a real fantasy-story, in which several things are very illustrious. But following the plot until the end, it becomes clear. You even are beginning to believe the possible truth of it. It's hard to name a negative point of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A dark, original, and imaginative masterpiece!","From the creation of up-and-coming director/writer Richard Kelly, DONNIE DARKO is the brilliantly bizarre story of a young man who is far from normal.Donald Darko (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled high school with an intelligent, but cursed, mind. He is depressed, on medication, and likes to voice his opinions without any regrets. One night, he is visited by a monstrous, 6-foot tall, rabbit named Frank. Frank has come to Donnie, from an unknown dimension, to deliver a terrifying message: 'In 28 days, the world will end...'.What follows is an absolutely incredible movie that, unfortunately, did not get very much notice or publicity. DARKO is truly one of the best films I have seen in a VERY long time. Kelly has filled his story to the top with twists, turns, and enough dazzling images to last a lifetime.Jake Gyllenhaal (OCTOBER SKY) is extraordinary as the title role. You can tell, just by observing his performance, that he is aware of what acting is really made of. He is backed by a stellar ensemble cast, including Jena Malone (STEPMOM), Drew Barrymore (RIDING IN CARS WITH BOYS), Mary McDonnell (DANCES WITH WOLVES), Patrick Swayze (GHOST), Noah Wyle (TVs ""ER""), and even real-life sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal (HOMEGROWN)!In conclusion, if you are ready to take a psychological roller-coaster ride into a dark universe, look no further than DONNIE DARKO!Rating: A+!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Donnie Darko is a truly strange movie, and is pulled off in a viewer friendly way that makes you want to understand it.So, to sum it up, rent this with the expectation of watching it again, because it's no fun thinking you'd wasted the last two hours.Get the DVD and watch the full motivational videos from Patrick Swayze's character.

I found many of the characters really likeable too. However, to understand this movie I had to watch it several times and delve into explainers. But the key here is I really wanted to watch it again...and again - it's got a magnetic pull to it, that's very hard to explain! Hence being a cult classic.So yes, I needed the help of an explainer to understand the film better, searching online immediately after watching it first time and also the second! I highly recommend Looper's explainer after you've watched it. Once understood, I watched the film again and it all fitted together perfectly!

"""Donnie Darko""-  The quintessential movie for social misfits and weirdos who grew up in the 90's and 2000's.","Perhaps one of the most beloved cult-classics ever crafted, writer/director Richard Kelly's ""Donnie Darko"" to this day still holds a place in the heart of every outcast, social misfit or general ""weirdo"" who grew up in the late 90's and early 2000's. A brooding tale of Science Fiction and drama, ""Darko"" is very much emblematic of its time, symbolizing the sort-of loss of innocence and change in cultural direction many in my millennial generation have felt over the past twenty years. And though it may not quite hold up now, fifteen years after its initial release, I do think that for the most part it remains a relevant and fairly compelling movie that can be analyzed and debated by fans of film and complex storytelling. It just unfortunately suffers for feeling a bit dated and trying too hard to speak exclusively to the loners and oddballs.In October of 1988, troubled teenager Donnie Darko is haunted by visions of a man wearing a demonic rabbit costume who calls himself ""Frank"", and warns Darko of the impending destruction of the Earth. After Frank's aid seems to help him avoid a curious and inexplicable brush with death, Donnie is manipulated into performing an ever- growing list of crimes and demented activities all while dealing with typical teen angst and issues. However, it will soon become clear that there is a great plot at hand, when Frank asks Donnie about the concept of Time Travel...To start, the film's casting is quite remarkable and I think the perfect players were selected for each and every role. Jake Gyllenhall makes for a fairly complex and fascinating protagonist, and despite how off-kilter Donnie can be with his plethora of psychological turmoils, you still feel for the guy and want to see where the story goes. Supporting roles by the likes of Mary McDonnell, Drew Barrymore and Jake's own sister Maggie Gyllenhaal all perform their parts admirably and with great flair. And there's even a really surprising and fun turn by the late Patrick Swayze as a motivational speaker with some skeletons in his closet that shows just how good Swayze could be when he was able to stretch his acting chops. Director Kelly also excels as a visual storyteller with some beautiful camera-work and a keen eye for composition that he compliments with a gleefully moody soundtrack and a deliberate sense of pacing. While his later work may have suffered for its meandering and needlessly confusing plotting, Kelly's talent as a filmmaker is on full display here in terms of visual artistry. However, I do think that his more than competent directorial eye cannot quite overcome the most obvious fault of the film.I've recently began to find that the most fascinating thing about ""Donnie Darko"" in terms of writing and filmmaking is that it is very much a film where the quality of the story at large doesn't quite work with the tone and style of the dialog and general structuring. Kelly actually manages to craft a compelling and consistently intriguing premise, and it affords much room for interpretation and discussion. Ideas like closed time loops, destiny and fate run rampant and will keep most viewers guessing and theorizing throughout its runtime and even beyond. And yet, the film also feels a bit forced in retrospect because of the tone and style Kelly establishes. I think there's a real reason why the film spoke to so many of us when we were in High School or College... this is essentially the movie every Goth kid or oddball who sat alone during Lunch or loner who spent study-hall drawing dark and sarcastic doodles in his notebook dreamed of. With a cynical voice and sometimes dated visual motifs that ooze the early 2000's, this movie is essentially the perfect personification of what everyone wanted to see when they were younger and coming of age. And that's where it loses some points for me. It just doesn't quite hold the same relevance when you're pushing 30 and decide to re-visit it after having not seen it in a couple years.However, this fairly major complaint aside, I do still think that the movie is fundamentally a very good experience and is for the most part still well-worth the time of those who will go in with an open mind. Dated attitudes and ideas aside, the complexity of the basic plot line will keep you completely invested as you ponder the deeper meaning of each and every tripped-out scene and trying to predict the next big twist or turn in the narrative. And the performances will also speak to you in the best of ways as every actor is given their moment to shine on a consistent basis. While the movie may be a bit too ""quirky"" and ""gothy"" for its own good during more than a few scenes (I know I rolled my eyes when Frank sarcastically asks Donnie ""Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?""), this cannot detract much from its greater qualities. It's a very good film... just a slightly troubled one that doesn't quite hold up as perfectly as we might nostalgically remember.I give ""Donnie Darko"" a very good 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Phenomenal film with a tone and feel that is near unmatched,"Donnie Darko is a film that is absolutely oozing feeling and asking its audience to reflect on life, love, family, growing up, and ultimately sacrifice for those that you love. The film doesn't hold your hand and while the knock on this movie has always been that the story doesn't make much sense, however if you simply follow what is presented to you a general idea of what is taking place isn't at all hard to see or understand. There are however a lot of deeper details about this universes time travel mechanics we the audience are left to interperet our own way and I believe the film is better for that. The performances are absolutely top tier as is the soundtrack and the cinematography. Don't get too bogged down on analyzing this and just watch it and allow yourself to get soaked into the celluloid and simply feel what the movies making you feel which for me is a wide range from sadness to reflection to laughter to satisfaction to frustration and it all is put into a soup that makes the movie a very watchable, entertaining escape from reality for 2 hours.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Sure to create controversy and confusion,"DD is a teen-oriented fantasy about a troubled young man who has a series of odd visions, including of a six-foot-tall rabbit that looks like Harvey's evil cousin. The rabbit advises Donnie on and off throughout the movie, while Donnie goes off on some apparently time-tripping adventures. Early on in the film, Donnie avoids a close call with death in the form of an errant airplane fuselage. From that point, the movie unspools like ALICE IN WONDERLAND on acid. My initial take on the movie, back when I was reviewing under another name, was that Donnie's visions were spurred by his schizophrenia. Thanks to my wife, the nurse, I have come to understand that his problems were more likely the consequence of being heavily and perhaps unnecessarily medicated. While the film is hardly perfect, it is interesting to read the endless interpretations posted here. Younger viewers tend to see the film as literally involving time travel while older viewers see it as a nightmarish dream. Whatever the answer, Jake G. is note-perfect as Donnie. And among the supporting players, Drew Barrymore stands out as one of his teachers.

"Lost but enjoyed, definitely a one time watch.","I was left utterly confused. It's not often that a film leaves me completely baffled, and when the occasion does occur, it's not solely due to a confusing plot. Donnie Darko is one of those stories that leads me to question the filmmakers intent. Obviously that's basic critical thinking and is provoked by all types of media, but this film specifically just left me so lost. I wonder if that was director Richard Kelly's goal. Perhaps he himself enjoys the endless possibilities that a seemingly unfinished ending provides. I say unfinished because I feel that it's so open to interpretation, almost as if the ending, or rather explanation of it was undecided behind the scenes as well. Overall it's an enjoyable film, one that requires no prior knowledge and I think a diverse audience can enjoy.

My questionable thoughts about Donnie Darko,"Today I was watching Donnie Darko. I have had some notions that this film might have something to do with time travel and all those paradoxes. And this happens to be a really enjoyable mind-ride.My expectations rose.But to my utmost disappointment, it never stood up to my expectations.First of all, tangent universe! This terminology itself creates problem. If you are actually going to portray some sort of parallel universe theory, then I guess it should sound like that. But they changed the concept entirely. They made a whole new concept of Tangent universe and while the film progresses, they try to feed the ideas to the viewer in the form a book. Once a theory shows up and in the next scene that incident takes place. This, I found a bit confusing and hard to get.Not only had it been done in a strange manner, but the concept also is not so acceptable. The classical parallel universe or multiverse theory is way more promising and interesting.Secondly, the irritating portals. A time travel portal made using water! And that too looks like some sort of transparent tunnel! This is awkward.Thirdly, the protagonist i.e. Donnie himself who is also the living receiver is having some strange superpower. Telekinesis and huge strength. Already the viewer is messed up with this new terminologies and concepts and now they impose superpowers without proper vfx.Fourthly, not-so-impactful background score. Lately, I am pretty much into this. For a mysterious plot, you must have great music to implant the uncanny feeling right into the nerve of the audience. That thing, I terribly missed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Genius Cult Classic For Its Time,"Donnie Darko is a film I was not expecting to turn out the way it did. Whether the theme was about one thing or something deeper, the plots ability to make me feel the intense , cold, and ominous feeling was enough to rattle me and keep on the edge of my seat for the whole movie. Although no true jump-scares, the reflection and themes struck massive chords with me as a viewer of the movie. The twist at the end of the horrific tale was a very good ending rewind the whole scene of events that occurred through the movie and kept these themes honed in at the end. The actors of all the characters showed amazing depth and intensity throughout the movie, bringing characters to life that wouldn't be too connected or intriguing otherwise. The setting of the movie was well thought out and was very interesting and relevant to the time period it was in.

"Not perfect, but definitely worth watching","This film is absolutely stunning in its originality, and will blow you away with its intelligence, creepiness and individuality the first time you see it. It might just have you looking over your shoulder for a few days.That said, it might not have reached its full potential, because it almost couldn't decide what kind of film it was. Though no movie should limit itself to one genre and set of conventions, 'Donnie Darko' tries to cover too many bases - haunting supernatural sci-fi story, outcast romance, condemnation of hypocrisy, social commentary, and even high-school movie. The confusion is most apparent with repeat viewings, and as a result the tone can be somewhat erratic.

Fear of Responsibility,"I remember the first eight hour shifts I pulled at my first real job in a hospital kitchen. I was 16. The stark reality of the monotony, the adult supervision, and the volume of the workload blew me away. ""So this is what life is like for adults,"" I thought to myself. There was no fun or entertainment involved, and when I finally finished, the only thing I had to look forward to, was doing the same shift again the next day.When you're a teen, you watch the world of responsibility that your parents and teachers inhabit and it scares you to death. So you take a stance of rebellion and consider them suckers and hypocrites. They have lost their passion. They don't know what real life is about.But you do. You're not sure what it is, but it isn't work and bills. You are on the inside of some kind of cosmic truth. You feel things deeply. The world is mysterious, threatening, twisted, and potentially enchanting.Donnie Darko is afraid of the world. He has stared into the future and it terrifies him. The life lived by his parents and teachers is a window onto a nightmare. Add to that mixture an older sister who takes life with a grain of salt and is heading to Harvard for a load of responsibility.She mocks his melodramatic spaciness and his dependency on psychotropic drugs. He's a freak and she is normal, and he knows it.Having said all that, I remember being spooked by reality like Donnie. I liked the way the film has him sleepwalking and waking up on a mountain road. I lived near an area like that, and I can almost picture myself doing something like that. That was an awesome opening.I'm not sure why this film was set in 1988, but I read that the writer was 13 at that time. I guess he is hearkening back to the beginning of his own teenage journey. The injection of 80's music fit well. Another reviewer felt that grunge would have been better, and that the film should have been set during that era. But I liked the contrast of a dark character in a still bright and optimistic period. Nice use of the song Mad World at the end.Since most viewers themselves do not know what the movie was officially about, I wonder if the actors were told. Either way, Jake Gyllenhaal was impressive as the tortured teen. I think he escaped potential clichés and made it his own original work. The rest of the performances were forgettable.I find Virginia beautiful,which is where DD was set, but this one was actually filmed in Santa Clarita, California. It looked great.The mountains and the suburbs were lovely.I choose to see the old lady as a scary depiction of another thing that Donnie and teens like him fear. That is aging and death.Interestingly Katherine Ross came out of obscurity and showed up as the psychiatrist. She was the love interest of the original alienated young man in ""The Graduate"" from the 1960's. She also played the lead role in the terrifying original Sci-Fi ""The Stepford Wives"" in the 70's.The actor who played DD's dad looked just like the guy who played Katherine Ross's dad in The Graduate.In the midst of all his confusion, he's still a teenage boy.He needs a girlfriend for both supportive companionship and to temper the relentless assault of the male libido. So they threw in a love interest for him to bounce off. It seemed like he was more into his own problems than hers. Although given the ending, he must have cared more than he showed.I don't want Donnie's character to be considered a hero by new teens discovering this film. He's not.He's a self-absorbed, irresponsible, and sometimes cruel individual.Just for the record, I grew up in a suburb like the one in DD, and there were loads of wonderful hard working adults and conscientious kids. People did volunteer work, went to church, studied music, built things in their garages and respected their siblings. This is contrary to the suburban life depicted in American Beauty and Donnie Darko.I see the bunny and the plane engine as hallucinations that stem from a combination of his immense fear of both life and death, and his use of anti-depressants. Time travel is attractive to someone who can't deal with the reality of their present time. If only I could go back in time or forward, I could find the world in a better condition, or escape my own reality.There is great danger in young people indulging in pop culture that depicts life as pointless,doomed,and unfair. It often breeds a nihilistic malaise that can last for years and affect one's maturity.This is your wake up call: Like Jackson Browne so poignantly noted in his famous song The Pretender, you do what you have to do, and then you ""get up and do it again.""

Really not that good,"For starters, I watched the whole movie and I do understand all of the parallel universe stuff and the plot, it really isn't that difficult to understand.Having said that I still think this movie was average at best and I would not recommend it to anyone, it's just a waste of time. The dialogue is especially atrocious I can't imagine that a room of grown men looked at the lines for Donnie's friends and the lines for the bullies and approved them. Those characters are so childish and dumb.Honestly none of the characters were interesting, not even Donnie in my opinion, the reasons why he is so scared of being alone and so scared of death are never shown so I really don't think he's a compelling character at all. The movie was also annoyingly slow and it gets very boring at parts.In conclusion, if you are considering watching this movie, just read some spoilers and spare yourself the waste of time.",4.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
what,The type of film you need to watch twice - but only once you read an explanation online after the first watch.

DONNIE DARKO - REVIEW 2 (SHARP SPARK),"""This makes David Lynch (of whom I'm a big fan) look out-dated and flat. This is a brilliant little film. Confusing, intriguing and inventive, it eventually folds back upon itself, and makes you leave the cinema in a daze. A great movie, that you'll have fun figuring out, both while you're watching it and for days after!! So many possible theories exist for this movie, I won't include one here... Suffice it to say, go see it yourself. Its one of those movies that is more enjoyable the more you watch it, rather than less.""The above is the original review I wrote about DONNIE DARKO. But I just want to say and write so much MORE about it. This movie has become a huge part of my life lately. After buying it on DVD, I watched it several times more, with and without the two commentaries - and became engrossed in the deleted/extended scenes and other extra features.There is so much to say about this movie - I could fill a book. Suffice it to say, well that there is too much to say and no one review is justifiable for this movie.Is it a science-fiction movie? A teen-angst drama? A social commentary focussing on 1980's suburbia? All of the above? And more? The last two -yes. And it has passion perfectly balanced with pain, and emotional depth layered within its complex and intoxicating structure of suspense.Unlike other so-called ""weird"" films, this is not intentionally weird. It just is ... well, its own movie.Watch this movie. Maybe you'll hate it. Maybe you'll be nonplussed. Maybe like myself (and my friend Kevin - hi Kevin if you're reading this!) you'll become addicted to it. One thing is certain: it's one of the most original movies I've seen in a long time.Don't just read reviews of this movie - see it for yourself. And that is all. Thank you for reading.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"music, story and acting are all great","Mystery is perhaps the best word to summarize. It is a film that gets under your skin. It has complexity and beauty in it. And yet it is simple.

Love it or hate it,"People seem to either love it or hate it-like Moulin Rouge, American Beauty, Blue Velvet-but there's no denying it's cult power.  The film is a convoluted mix of pop culture, philosophy, science fiction, rebellion, and comic books.  I'm not sure how I feel about it but I know Roger Kelly has talent and an effective technique that also shows some skill; by contrast compare with Roger Avary's sloppy The Rules of Attraction.  He managed to coax fine performances from a cast you wouldn't normally take seriously (Noah Wylie, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, Katherine Ross) and get interest generated in Jake Gyllenhaal.  He's a sexy nerd who could be Toby MacGuire's darker, more complex brother.  Mary McDonnell acheives small miracles as Rose and Holmes Osborne does well with Eddie.  There's really not a bad performance here.While the film does confuse, I think the key can be heard in the DVD commentary: Mr. Kelly confesses the ending was clear in his mind but allows the viewer to come up with their own answer.  It's a tricky thing to accomplish well and while The Fight Club throws its twist from left field-an idea Chuck Palahniuk thought of halfway through writing it-that film was just stylishly satiric pulp.  Here, the warnings, messages, and wormholes build toward the inevitable yet it bogs itself down; it finales with the American Beauty montage and a haunting Gary Jules song.Kudos for Drew Barrymore for seeing something here and being instrumental in getting it made.  Another round of applause for Patrick Swayze taking a risk and playing a slick-but-shallow guru. And another for Richard Kelly being brave enough to follow through with his vision.Though it's flawed, there's enough here to satisfy a movielover and make one curious in this new filmmaker.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Über Cool Teenage Angst.,"Donnie Darko has become a sell-out hit amongst angst-ridden/fashionably uncool/persistently 'individual' teenagers the world over, primarily down to its slit-your-wrists soundtrack 'Mad World' Its 'über-clever' plot twist and freak out scenes remind us kids just how terrible our own lives are and make us want to be as insane as the title character.Donnie Darko is a troubled, but undeniably clever young high schooler, not only traumatised by the usual teenage worries, but by a six foot bunny rabbit named Frank who tells him when the world will end.Superbly talented Jake Gyllenhaal again impresses with his creepy, somewhat sinister portrayal of Darko and shows us just how evil he can look by staring crazily into a mirror.However clever the writer/director Richard Kelly wanted it to be, it's still a teenage film. Most people over the age of 25 will deem it 'self loving' and 'ostentatious' but unfortunately few people under the age of 18 will actually understand what this film is all about.Donnie is troubled and meant to relate to us as an audience, and Gyllenhaal as always does that superbly, perhaps his talent was over-shadowed by the films overly pretentious ending.Donnie Darko's blink and you miss 'em jokes and dark humour might be wasted on some people who are wanting laugh out loud gags, which they aren't going to find in this film.If you're thinking of slitting your wrists Donnie Darko will only remind you of how awful the world is and how little you actually mean to anyone - so give it a miss.If you're looking for a light little piece of cinema to entertain you one evening, you might be shocked to find that Donnie Darko requires some thinking and might just root up some unanswered questions about your life - so give it a miss.If you're immune to psychological hallucinations and become freaked out easily then Donnie Darko might just terrify you - so give it a miss.If on the other hand, you're in for a little 'deep thinking' and want to be moved, then Donnie Darko is the perfect film for you, and will give you some wonderful topics of conversation over the coming months.If you like your 'indie-cool' flicks with clever plot-twists and meaningful scenes of silence then this film will open your eyes to how a slight pause here and a little look there can create a whole lot more than reels and reels of drivelling script.If you have a slightly odd sense of humour and are fed up of the 'Frat Pack' comedies like Anchor Man and Wedding Crashers then this little gem will take you away from the gags and offer you a darkly humorous, intelligently funny film.If you're a fan of any of the (surprisingly) star-studded cast including a fantastic Patrick Swayze and a slightly weird Drew Barrymore then that won't fail to delight.Or if, as most self-acclaimed fans of this movie will be, you just want to join the ranks of pro-mainstream teens who think they're making a bold statement of their intelligence and individuality by listing Donnie Darko as one of their favourite films, then watch it. You might ask what the fuss is about, or you might just end up being in awe of this film, which under all the fuss and hype is a frighteningly beautiful and well-acted piece of teenage angst.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Hallucination or Reality?,"Donny Darko is a very original and disturbing film about a teenaged boy who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which causes hallucinations and delusions. On the day that an jet engine from an unidentified plane crashes into his bedroom, Donny's life is saved by a vision of Frank, a gigantic horror-bunny who leads Donny out of the house and gives him a count down to the end of the world - less than a month away.As Donny's visions of Frank become more frequent, Frank leads him to commit more dangerous and more destructive acts. At the same time, Donny discovers that the 'crazy' old woman down the road once wrote a book about time-travel, and he begins to believe he can see people's path through time as well as wormholes. But is Donny really hallucinating, or does he simply see a reality to which the rest of us are blind?",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Watch ""Donnie Darko"" only if you are impressed by its 'cult film' status.","What does one observe while watching a film depends on how the viewer watches a particular film ? However, there are certain elementary things which all viewers can notice easily. These qualities are related to the way a film progresses, how its narrative structure is composed and what is the general feel about it. Donnie Darko is one film which provides ample chances to viewers to detect its essential qualities. Most viewers would not waste much time to conclude that it is rather slow, episodic in nature and popular only due to its status as a ""cult film"". What do these three primary qualities leave for those viewers who have not yet watched it ? This is a key question to be discussed by all intelligent viewers but there is hardly any secret when it is revealed by some viewers that ""Donnie Darko"" is a story about a high school student and his psychological frame of mind to deal with senseless acts of violence. The worst thing about ""Donnie Darko"" is that actors Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore have been given too small roles which do not do any justice to their acting talents. Having the name of a literary giant associated with a film is a blessing in disguise for a good film but ""Donnie Darko"" is so pointless as a film that even the mention of British author Graham Greene does not help much to elevate this film's chances of success. Lastly, Donnie Darko is to be watched only if a viewer intends to ascertain whether it truly deserves its cult film status or not.",4.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
My favorite film,A masterpiece to say the least. I have no words for how much I love this movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
7.8/10,"Donnie Darko is a film that refuses to be neatly categorised. It plays with time, mental illness, existential dread, and alternate realities, all while making suburban life in 1988 feel like an eerie dream. It doesn't unfold with a clear answer straight forward message, nor does it attempt to explain itself fully. That's part of its brilliance.At its core, the film presents Donnie, a troubled teenager who may be experiencing paranoid schizophrenia, or may be navigating a time-looped, fate-driven paradox. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance captures this uncertainty beautifully, as he absolutely outdid the weird-kid role. His vacant stares, sudden bursts of intensity, and unsettling smirks make Donnie feel both like a real teenager and someone who exists on the fringes of reality. His interactions with Frank only heighten the sense that something isn't quite right. Frank also initially seems like badly done cgi, but as you get deeper into this film, you realise every uncanny and ghostly design choice is intentional. But is Frank a hallucination? A messenger? A manipulator of fate? The film refuses to answer definitively.Visually, Donnie Darko leans into its strangeness. The slow-motion sequences, the deep blues and greys, the haunting glow of Frank's face: it all builds an atmosphere that feels warped and slightly detached from reality. The cinematography echoes Donnie's mental state, making it difficult to separate what is real from what is imagined. And then there's the soundtrack. Everything feels both nostalgic and otherworldly, and the 80s feel familiar and real.The storytelling is ambitious, balancing psychological drama with sci-fi elements without feeling disjointed. It introduces concepts like the Tangent Universe, time travel, and manipulated dead, but never in a way that feels like pure exposition. Instead, the film expects the audience to piece things together, or to accept that not everything needs explaining. The plot twist is where everything converges. Its unexpectedness is both tragic and mind-bending. It's a rare kind of twist, one that doesn't just shock but redefines everything before it.As a portrayal of schizophrenia, Donnie Darko is unsettlingly effective. While stylised to be adapted as a film, everything is warped in a way where the viewer is unsure if what they're seeing is real or hallucinated. Donnie's experiences with delusions, grandiose thoughts, and a blurred perception of reality mirror real symptoms of the disorder. Obviously not perfect, but it portrays an aspect of the wide spectrum that is schizophrenia. The film never outright confirms whether Donnie is mentally ill or if he truly has access to a greater cosmic understanding. It plays in the space between madness and enlightenment, forcing the viewer to question the boundaries between the two.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Meaningless and unconvincing,Is this a sci-fi movie? Or a horror movie? Or just only the story of a psychopathic boy prone to hallucinations? In first case it's poor in terms of invention and imagination; in second case it's not scary enough to be good; and in third case it's not bad but not good either because just only ordinary. It looks like an ambitious movie which didn't come up to its director's expectations because he is no David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick or even Steven Spielberg. The final scenes give us the impression that the movie's director didn't know how to end the story imbroglio into which he had got and then imagined some meaningless and unconvincing sequences in a Halloween atmosphere.

Cult classic,I'm pleased to say I saw this in the cinema again 22 years after I first saw it and was blown away by it .It's an undoubted masterpiece and sadly Richard Kelly has never been able to recreate anything close to this cult masterpiece.It's a film you can watch over and over again because there are so many loose ends and potential plot holes that you're never really sure what you've actually seen till the end when you get a chance to formulate your theory but you guarantee if you watch it again you will question your original theory and come up with a new hypothesis. What you see is not what you get .The soundtrack makes this film the inclusion and rehash of eighties british classics sets the scene - this launched the career of siblings Jake & Maggie Gillenhaal ( spelling ? ) and was one of the last films to feature Patrick Swayze - and may never have been made had it not been for Drew Barrymore's finance and production and the parallels with ET are uncanny .I can't believe I haven't reviewed it before and the fact I'm not giving it 10/10 doesn't mean it's not one of the best & one of my favourite films of all time it just means it's not perfect but it doesn't need to be its still brilliant and it's one of the top 10 films of all time you must see there's just so much to it allowing you to watch it over and over again .An absolute ClassicPad.

Truly a work of art,"Donnie Darko has to be my favorite movie of all time. I love everything about it: the score, cinematography, imagery, acting, plot... everything is perfect. The score is so phenomenal that whenever I listen to it, I can link each track with its corresponding scene from the movie, but then again, I've probably heard the soundtrack more times than I've seen the movie. Even though Gary Joules' cover of ""Mad World"" is the best known song from the soundtrack, I associate the song ""Killing Moon"" by Echo and the Bunnymen more with the movie, and it's the perfect song for the movie. It fits flawlessly and makes the intro all-the-more memorable. Nobody can review this movie without mentioning Frank the Bunny. His outfit is maybe the most iconic part of the entire movie. His voice is haunting and his mask, once seen, can never be forgotten. The only problem I think anybody can find with this movie is it's ambiguity. After the watch this, make sure to research it and listen to theories about what it means, and make sure you watch the director's cut too. It makes the movie make a lot of sense. I would do a deep dive into the plot, but I have to keep this spoiler free. Anyways, 100/100, absolutely flawless and a true work of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Philosophical meaning hidden in a great movie.,"The acting is as good as it gets, the editing still fits the area it's made, and the overall camera settings or choreography is nothing unique. The soundtrack is really good, it fits the 80's era alot, with post-punk and old pop rock. Nothing disappointed me in this movie, other than the cgi, but that was very new at that time, and doesn't really affect my experience that much. Where this movie gets interesting is when you start to puzzle the story together, and ""read between the lines"".For me time travel or any physics topic in general, isn't very interesting, but this movie took the topic to another level. Without spoiling the plot, I can still say this is one of the most confusing. But still at the same time, one the best movies I've ever seen. I loved the ""out of context"" mysteries and unexplained story development. It really peaked my interest to find out what actually happened. Every single scene has something to be said, there are hints to what's going on in every single scene, but they only make sense if you notice them. Some of the set up/pay offs or hints are more clear than others, which at the same time tells alot about the overall premises of the movie. The premises in this film is also something to take note of. The movie tells alot about things in our everyday life, that we may not be noticing alot. All from deja vu's to noticing patterns that repeat itselves in the future, like some sort of karma. The question everybody asks themselves at some point; ""Is there a God?"". What authority has the power to predict, control or decide where YOUR destiny is going? We control what happens around us every second we live. Every small decision or thought we have changes the future. There is so much to be said about this movie, and so much that is just unexplainable, but that's also what I love about it.

What a fantastic movie,"Well, as I write this, there are over 1200 comments already below mine regarding this movie. And not surprisingly,either. This one is a good one, and quite unique.A couple of distinguishing characteristics of this movie, briefly:1. Atmosphere: masterful, a tour de force display of creating atmosphere. This kid ought to be hired to make a movie from every Stephen King novel there is. What Stephen King does for atmosphere in his books, Kelly has done in Darko.2. Excellent realism with an ensemble cast. He manages to humanize secondary characters in a very short time. In fact, some of the secondary characters seem almost to be there only to create a sort of verisimilitude with respect to a human environment.  The movie feels more lifelike because there are secondary characters whose function seems mostly unrelated to the plot, yet who are rather well drawn and fleshed out, nonetheless. Or rather, many of the secondary characters are fleshed out in ways that have nothing to do with the plot. This movie is quite Australian, in that regard: it has a large ensemnble cast where many of the characters seem to actually live lives of their own, independent of the central plotline.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Unfortunately, this bunny rabbit leaves no eggs.","There's a nice little scene in ""Donnie Darko"" where his girlfriend reflects upon his full name.  ""Sounds like a superhero,"" she muses.  Donnie gives her a sly glance and quips, ""Who's to say I'm not?""Indeed.  And by the movie's end, we're left to question whether or not Donnie really is such a savior.  At least I did.  In fact, I did a lot of questioning at the end of this picture.  Not the good kind, either--born of wonder and amazement, but the bad kind: spawn of frustration and delirium.The year is 1988, and Donnie Darko is a dorky, reclusive, temperamental teenager growing up in a typical dorky, reclusive, temperamental teenager environment.  He deals with bullies at school, falls for the pretty new girl, fights with his caring, concerned family at home, and desperately tries to understand the life he's been given.  Oh, and as our story opens, he begins to receive regular visits from a nightmarish overgrown bunny rabbit from the future named Frank.Frank reveals that the world is about to end and the only person that can prevent it is Donnie.  Thus begins his quest to unravel a mystery that includes a 100 year old woman named Grandma Death, a new age spiritual evangelist who preaches about love vs. fear, a mysterious book called ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"", and two young school teachers who seem perfunctory at first but then take particular interest in Donnie.I love movies that toy with my mind, confusing the hell out of me while promising understanding and sometimes, by the movie's end, delivering revelation.  ""Jacob's Ladder"" ranks among my favorite films of all time. And even when ""The Ninth Gate"" failed to deliver a satisfactory ending, it worked for me nonetheless because I so enjoyed the journey.But ""Donnie Darko"" seems to think 1 out of 3 is enough.  It's not.  With every dark scene, every social satire, every equitable performance, this movie promises greatness.  But that's all.  The ending is simply another enigmatic scene.  I wish I could say that the sum of its parts makes up for it, but it doesn't.  There are moments where you brace yourself and smile and think: okay, here it comes, here's where it all falls into place!But, unfortunately, this bunny rabbit leaves no eggs.2 OUT OF 4 STARS",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Different and interesting,"This is a very interesting movie, but I might require you watching it more than once. There are many things in the story that doesn't make much sense, unless you have made a bit of research about black holes, Einstein's theory of relativeness etc. But you don't need to, because there are many ways this movie can be interpreted, and everybody's interpretation is as good as mine. This is what makes the movie so great. Some of the scenes in the movie are dark and surrealistic, as we follow the protagonists life and it's ups and downs.

My favorite movie of all time.,"As you can tell I really love this movie. I do believe it is not for everyone, its a love it or hate it kind of situation. I am not trying to spoil too much but the ending is truly something that will stick with you for a couple days. The acting performances are really good especially Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko), this movie got him known in the acting world for a reason. I do recommend not watching this movie if you're easily frightened or if you are know for movies too have a big emotional impact on your mood, as I said earlier the ending is something that changes the movie and can screw with your emotional state. The movie also changed my view on life allot not necessarily in a good way so another warning there. Thanks for reading my review, I hope it helped.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Incomprehensible,"This film's plot is incomprehensible and I couldn't quite make sense of it all. There are a lot of things that seem to make sense but as a whole it requires the audience to piece together the puzzles. Some elements include a satire of suburbia, time travel and a hallucinatory rabbit man. There are quite a few theories about what really happened, and also a director's cut which makes everything clearer, which I haven't seen. It's hard to tell what I think of this film because I was confused, but I was also hooked, I enjoyed it and I came up with my own theories.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Probably The Best Film Of Our Time,"For the money and time spent on this masterpiece it has to be hailedas the greatest flawless work of art to ever hit the screen.

A Cult Indie Film where Science & Philosophy Clash Head On !!,"Part Coming of Age, part Sci-Fi, this film is one of those unique pieces of Cinema, which you may not fully grasp in the first viewing but will surely leave an impression.

He miraculously escapes an accident & starts seeing a mysterious figure who commands him to do certain things & gives him powers.

Confusion from the cutting room,"The Region 4 DVD release of Donnie Darko contains more compelling material in the ""deleted and expanded scenes"" section than the feature. Here we find parts of a puzzle that explains much about the probable intentions of the writers and director. What a mess! There are concentric subplots involving a link between Frank the rabbit as a boyfriend of Donnies Sister, discussions over the subtext of Watership Down and some illumination on Karen Pomeroys' deeper beliefs over the misdirection of students by faculty and parents. From the cutting room we are left with an incomplete and oblique story that allows more latitude for the viewer to interpret(or be confused by) the message assumed to be contained therein. This is where I can get off the fence and state clearly that the misuse of common, adolescent male isolation fears and confusion, mixed with some slick ""liquid metal"" effects and gibberish about portals and time travel does nothing but make Pop-Culture Pulp. Go watch Repo Man or Being John Malkovich for more stylish and capable presentations of similar theories.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This film did my head in!,"Donnie Darko is the name of the teenage hero of the film.  One night, a jet engine falls from the sky and lands through the roof of the Darkos' home no one knows where from and Donnie encounters a rabbit-headed figure, Frank who informs him that the world is coming to an end in twenty eight days.Days pass accompanied by more bizarre events which builds up the audience's anticipation of what will happen when the time runs out.  We learn early on in the film that Donnie is taking medication which hints that day to day episodes may be tricks in Donnie's mind.  What makes the film stimulating is the fact that you cannot be sure whether events are real or the result of Donnie's state of mind.You get the sense that throughout the film, Donnie is a trapped soul (whether it be in a time warp or a dream I can't decide) where teachers and adults such as the Patrick Swayze guru character want to simplify everything in life into two extremes: fear and love.  You also have Drew Barrymore as Donnie's English teacher who invites the new girl of the class to sit next to the boy she finds the cutest.  The romance which develops between Donnie and his new classmate is nice and helps to lighten the tone of what has already developed into a pretty dark film.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a likeable performance as the hero and displays good comic timing and laidback personality he reminds me of Tobey Maguire in many ways.  He is not an actor I am familiar with but he looks to be a promising future star.I went to the cinema seeking a film that would be unpredictable what better film to choose than a film where a boy meets a human-sized rabbit and the world is meant to end in less than thirty days.  When the 28 days of the story had run out, I was left with no logical explanation to what I had seen.  I left the cinema very confused, this film did my head in!",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

I'd say that this is the story of a boy, named Donnie Darko. That's all.

What is with this movie???,"Ok, I was really intrigued by this movie. I thought it was an interesting division between comedy, horror, and just plain drama. One of those movies where the ending keeps you talking about it for days to come. I was surprised by the acting... Jake Gyllenhaal did a superb job as Donnie Darko, and with back-ups like Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore, the movie drew you in to the characters. I thought that it was a great idea for a horror- type theme, even though the director did not go that route. The bunny was the freakiest thing I have ever seen, and what made it worse was that it didn't DO anything... reminds me of the stuffed animals I used to be scared of when I was a kid, because, in the dark, they looked like monsters.

Poorly executed movie about conservatism in the 80s or quantum physics,"Personal/Plot: Great premise. Really got me interested with a bunny and a teen who's either insane or living in a crazy world. But after 15 minutes I got extremely bored as the pacing was terrible and the plot got worse. It examines interesting ideas (that I'll talk about) but I think it should barely get 1/2Aesthetic/Cinematography: Mid, no further questions 0.5/2Spiritual/Ending: I had to watch a wisecrack video to understand what was happening since I didn't watch the directors cut(which I should've). Basically there are three ideas you can absorb after watching this movie. 1, that destruction is a form of creation. This seems to be the most interesting and viable until you see the ending. Everying Donnie does aligns with this, until the end. And I personally thought an emphasis on this would make a better/more interesting/less confusing movie. The second idea is that Donnie lives in a reality where there are tangent universes that occur because of a decision/action/etc that causes one universe to split. There's a theory that talks about photons (both seen as partices and waves) that is extremely similar to this idea. I honestly don't care for this idea as its representation was terrible and poorly thought out. The last idea is a critique on conservaitsm in suburbs in the late 80s/90s. I liked this examination, but there were too many ideas and overall bad execution on a single one. 1/2Acting: 1/1 Only because Gyllenhaal is amazing.Score/Music: 1/1 Not bad actuallyRecommend/Rewatch: Absolutely never again.

A Supernatural Coming-of-Age Story about a Psychopath,"Donnie Darko follows a boy who befriends an imaginary bunny rabbit who manipulates him into doing horrible things in the days leading up to the end of the world.Jake Gyllenhaal has been one of my favorite actors for a while, and for good reason. His performance as Donnie is no exception. He pulls off the best performance of the film, and again manages to impress me beyond what I expected, as usual. The rest of the cast is good as well, none of them managing to reach Gyllenhaal's level. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays his older sister too, which was kind of funny and probably not a coincidence. Just saying.The story as a whole it very interesting. The movie makes you as the audience wonder if Donnie is actually insane or has some kind of supernatural powers. Regardless of what it ends up being, it's very cool to see how it all plays out.Donnie Darko himself is a great character. He's complicated, relatable, and just fascinating to watch. He says the things that sometimes I wish I was willing to say, and it often made me root for him, most of the time. The character of Frank is pretty great too. He's an intriguing addition to the story that adds an extra level of creepy supernatural/insanity to the story. And the costume designers really nailed it with his. He's so creepy looking, and yet the design is pretty simple, save for the mask, which is still great. On top of that Gyllenhaal and Malone have great chemistry together, so that's even another plus.The ending is pretty great too. It leaves room for a couple of different interpretations, or at least I think it did, and it requires a little thought to fully understand, but it's not super complicated or anything either. The movie doesn't treat the audience like a bunch of idiots, yet it also doesn't expect us go to hardcore with our thinking but instead use what we learned during the actual movie to figure it out.On occasion something would pop up that maybe I didn't like as much. Sometimes I wished certain things remained a mystery or something like that, but always each of those scenes was later proved to be done for a purpose, and thus I liked them even more.Overall Donnie Darko is fantastic. The acting is great, the characters are realistic and interesting, the ending is thought- provoking, the story itself is riveting, and most every screw up turned out to be purposeful and only for the betterment of the film. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Thrilling, Intriguing, Hilarious, and Somber","Created by first time director, Richard Kelly, Donnie Darko is a sci-fi thriller, released in 2001. It follows teenager Donnie Darko through high school, family life, romance, and parallel universes.Set in the late 80s in a small town in Virginia, Donnie Darko showcases a troubled but intelligent young man grappling with high school bullies, an inability to fit in, and apparent schizophrenia. Upon brushing with death in a bizarre and secretive accident, Donnie is haunted by visions of a man in an eerie rabbit costume. Donnie is pushed to commit crimes, uncovering dark secrets of the town, leading to a larger conspiracy. Time travel, black holes, and alternate universes are woven into the story, leading Donnie to learn more about the unusual happenings of the town.A plethora of interesting characters are featured in the film, brought to life by the star-studded cast, including Jake Gyllenhaal, Drew Barrymore, and Patrick Swayze. The dark subject matter of the film is contrasted by the comic relief put forth by many of the characters. Witty dialogue touches on political issues, mental health struggles, and teenage angst. The characters become increasingly self-aware as the plot thickens, guiding Donnie on his journey to sacrifice and salvation.The soundtrack, possibly the best part of the film, creates a dark and horrific tone like none other. Excellent use of new wave brings to life the 80s high school vibes in the movie. The somber ending is also perfectly captured using Gary Jules' Mad World. The soundtrack in Donnie Darko is used to not only used to develop setting and time period, but evoke deep emotion in the audience.Donnie Darko is a phenomenal film, telling stories of heroism and bravery. The characters' ability to recognize that things are not always as they seem make for a unique plot line. Each watch offers a new perspective on the film. The audience will discover new meanings each time the film is consumed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Great for those who love to rewatch,"Donny Darko is a layered film with a great narrative story and even better performances. Darko is in a sense a sci-fi movie that checks all the boxes . As the mystery of the films purpose unravels, the viewer is taken on a journey through time travel, existential dread, religion, and mental health.As Darko begins to scratch the surface on his purpose or mission throughout the movie, he is met with more questions. As a viewer, the best experience is through the extended cut where many of these questions are answered upon rewatch and reflection. There are many articles and videos that can explain it far better than I can, but in its simplest sense, Donny is on a quest to save the world and and make sacrifice through use of magical powers including seeing into the future and being able to see others future movements along with other powers not explicitly shown.This film can feel frustrating and unsatisfying, but the score and performances along with the writhing keep the film from ever feeling boring. This is greatly helped by the mystery around frank (the bunny). The film is incredibly engaging and is absolutely deserving of a watch and then a rewatch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The ending blew me away,"""If the sky were to suddenly open up, there would be no law, there would be no rule.

It's all up to you to decide.Yet the tragedy is, neither way you gonna get all your questions answered! The director (Richard Kelly) deliberately crafted the film in such a way that it would very much be open to interpretations without concrete resolutions. Now, I know what are you going to say, let me tell you, I'm well aware of the existence of a separate director's cut and many had said that iteration gives some much-needed clarity over the subject. Well, it could be, but I wouldn't know, since Amazon Prime has only the theatrical version, or so I have found.Nevertheless; my opinion remains the same, it is a movie that I highly recommend, even if it's not perfect in any shape or form, but despite having a couple of issues it still manages to captivate!",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not weird,"I don't understand why people call DD weird. While I would never call this movie a classic, in the end, its nothing more than a camp new package for a forgotten theme. In terms of genre, I would say it is a pretty standard example of the written science fiction of the golden age (50's, 60's) combined with some good old Stephen King scares. I just think contemporary movie goers aren't used to science fiction films without things that go boom.Three factors combine to make this movie seem strange: its soft science-fiction applications (fiction loosely based on science or fantasy), the age-group of the characters and the comical special effects that make it seem more juvenile. (Perhaps making it more appealing to a younger audience.) These things detract from what is otherwise a lovely ramble down the 80's memory lane, (semi-biographical of the director's) and a perceptive look at a teenage boy's existential crisis.On the whole, I think its a good movie for teenagers and parents to watch. Take the science fiction out of the movie and you'll see a very scary look at how middle class children are raised today. Cared for by well-meaning but wishy-washy parents and confused by sanitized psycho- social babble and drugs.I give the director/screenwriter some kudos for having the gumption to not just pose the question, but an answer too. So many so-called serious film makers don't do that anymore. (From his commentaries on the DVD, its clear that the director doesn't really know he did that in defiance of conventions. Maybe if he did, he'd make other cool movies.)In the end DD has to decide what he believes, make his peace, and shrug his shoulders.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Fever Dream Psychological Thriller!,"Donnie Darko is a complex yet remarkably seamless film. The quick-developing plot gives the viewer minimal time to piece together what is truly going on in Donnie's world. A considerable role in thematic development is the quick tempo that is ever-present during the film's first act. The speed helps to grab the audience's attention as the film induces a fever trip right before your eyes. I was surprised to find out that Donnie Darko was Richard Kelly's debut film. Kelly's ambiguous storytelling comes across as polished, courageous, and dramatic, which is uncommon for directors' first feature. Donnie Darko establishes itself as not only a first for the director, Richard Kelly but a first for Jake Gyllenhaal as well. Gyllenhaal's debut performance is riveting. The role of Donnie Darko is clever due to the multitude of emotional layers he possesses as the main character. The sophisticated writing encourages Gyllenhaal's success, as he embodies the role to perfection. Awkward mannerisms work in conjunction with well-delivered dialogue to create an emotionally deep character in Donnie Darko. The film Donnie Darko was considerably enjoyable to watch and remained fresh even in 2020, almost 20 years after its release.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

In the words of Enid from 'Ghost World' - People are too stupid,"Referring back to the title of this entry, 'people are too stupid', the sort of people who hate this movie and think that it's crap are the product of the Hollywood revolution. Those who go to the movies just for explicit violence, romance, and sex.Donnie Darko is about none of these things, at least not explicitly. It is a journey of discovery, exploring the nature of fate, and whether all our lives are predefined by a higher power, be it God or whoever. Donnie avoids his fate, and so the world ends, when he goes back and dies at his proper time, things are better in the world. 'Everybody has a time to die' as the film says.For those who don't see why Gretchen must die at the end, here's my theory. Donnie loves Gretchen, he doesn't want her to suffer, so by going back he saves her, sacrificing himself. People's lives are improved, when things happen according to His (God's) plan.I think that in the new reality there is a sense of Déja-vu, Donnie's psychriatrist wakes up in a cold sweat, and Gretchen's pause when Donnie's neighbour asks 'Did you know him?'The film is surreal, not least the giant bunny rabbit, and the music is poignant, especially 'Mad World' originally by 'Tears for Fears' performed exquisitely by Gary Jules and (Micheal Andrews - i think?).I think this film is a masterpiece, and extremely thought provoking, although I have only seen it twice, I think I have a better understanding of it than some of the big-wig complainers on here.

I'm not going to be watching this again despite it being a very good and iconic film, but I personally just don't like rewatching movies unless it's in my top 5 movies of all time, which this one is far from. Still liked ""Donnie Darko"" though, fantastically confusing film with great acting, especially from Jake Gyllenhaal.(On a sidenote though, i'm never going to be watching that fake spin-off ""sequel"" trash, S. Darko or whatever it's called.)",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

How was such brilliance ever made?,"Some people will disagree, but i think that films like Donnie Darko are only made once every so often. Sometimes a few excellent films come all at once, or there is a slight 'drought' before another one comes.However, Donnie Darko is undoubtedly the best film i have seen (yet). Of course there are some films that are called classics which i haven't seen.But this film blends a lot of genres in a way that i hardly ever seen before. American Beauty, for example, is another excellent film. That ONLY blended comedy and drama. Donnie Darko, however, blends comedy, drama, sci-fi and fantasy, to say the least.Now, this film is not for the faint-hearted, and NOT everyone will like it.So, for the time being, i bid you farewell.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Dynamite debut!,"Having heard absolutely nothing about this one, I risked a rental and came away very impressed,indeed, by Mr. Kelly's debut film. He has learned his lessons well: every technical trick that CAN be employed IS employed- to great effect. (It's a testament to the storytelling skill of this neophyte filmmaker that the very impressive visual fx never once detract from the story.) The ending, too, comes almost unexpectedly from left field (and is the very first time I've ever been COMFORTABLE with this type of ending). Casting Gylanhaal was a stroke of pure genius: this young man can ACT! No doubt about it: this is one of the most impressive debut films I've ever seen in my life. The only thing I can't figure out is why this one wasn't hailed the way the vastly overrated VANILLA SKY was; this is clearly a far superior film.

"one of ""those movies""...","After seeing it twice now, I've come to the conclusion that ""Donnie Darko"" is a conundrum--but a conundrum even the most disciplined philosophical mind wouldn't want to ponder. Writer-director Richard Kelly's tale of a psychologically disturbed boy (the title character, played with remote detachment by Jake Gyllenhaal) with the ability to see through time and space, aided by a creepy rabbit-faced entity, is simply too ambitious for its own good. It has a lot of worthwhile ideas and characters going for it, but their realization usually only reaches the halfway point, thus transforming the film into an underwhelming, frustrating experience. Though it addresses issues of mortality and fate, the emotional tone could have been lifted from any number of ""Teens-Coming-Of-Age"" movies (the presence of Jena Malone made me recall the much better ""Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys""). Perhaps the director's cut fleshes out some of the weaker threads of plot, but I'm not curious enough to find out. I won't fault ""Donnie Darko"" for going in a different direction that most teen-oriented films, but ""12 Monkeys Meets Ghost World"" is quite a stunt to pull off, and nothing here comes close.",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

An Instant Classic,"Easily one of the best movies of 2001, Donnie Darko can not be defined by any one genre of film.  It's a dark comedy to keep the audience smiling, a drama to keep the audience emotionally connected to the characters, and a movie that will just plain out make you think.  Donnie Darko tackles a variety of subjects.  It deals with underlying family tones, the possibility of time travel, an in depth look at psychosis, and, oh yeah, in its spare time it manages to tackle the question of the existence of God.  This is probably the best movie I have ever seen and recommend it to anyone who has ever found themselves questioning the existence of God.  Watch for the metaphor of Donnie as Jesus.  The metaphor is so intricately woven that I found myself clapping and yelling at my TV at points during the movie.  A movie not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Cult flick with sophisticated themes, great cast, but meh story","Released in 2001 and written/directed by Richard Kelly, ""Donnie Darko"" is a drama/fantasy starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a troubled California teen dogged by apparitions of a man in an evil rabbit suit who manipulates him to commit several crimes, after he narrowly escapes a peculiar accident concerning a jet engine falling from the sky. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays his sister, Holmes Osborne & Mary McDonnell his parents, Drew Barrymore his teacher, Katharine Ross his therapist, Jena Malone his girlfriend, Noah Wyle his science teacher and Patrick Swayze a self-help guru. Patience Cleveland is on hand as Grandma Death.While the movie flopped at the box office, it has since become a serious cult hit. I saw it recently for the first time and went into it cold without knowing anything about the intricacies behind the plot. The only thing I knew was that the kid was harassed by an ee-vil bunny apparition. The film mildly works as a high school drama with a satirical smirk. But the story's just not engaging enough on that level. While the movie has some quality women, it fails to capitalize on their presence (Barrymore, for instance, is barely in it). But Jake is a solid protagonist, even somewhat sympathetic despite the curious things he does.By the middle of the second act I found myself getting bored with the story and trying to figure out what was going on, but the film perks up in the last act, particularly when it reveals the truth about the scary bunny guy. After viewing, my overall impression was that the story never really took off and was burdened by perplexing ambiguities even while possessing some fascinating elements. I came up with a theory to explain the events (explained below) but, upon reflection, I realized that all the pieces didn't fit. And the movie simply wasn't entertaining enough to bang my head further trying to figure it out. I would've given the movie a mediocre 5/10 rating, but after investigating the official meaning and the alternative explanations I had to admit that the film is genius in this respect. It just needed to be attached to a more interesting story with more stimulating characters.The film runs 113 minutes, which is the version I saw; the Director's Cut runs 20 minutes longer. It was shot in Los Angeles and surrounding areas (Angeles National Forest, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Santa Clarita, Burbank & Calabasas).GRADE: B-ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY (*** SPOILER ALERT***Don't read unless you've seen the movie):My casual interpretation turned out to be one of the alternative explanations of the movie, the so-called ""Donnie Is Shown the Future"" explanation, which suggests that Donne is shown the future via the future ghost of Frank and so he sacrifices himself at the end to save everyone. But, as noted above, there are too many holes in this interpretation.A couple of other popular explanations are the banal Schizophrenia Theory, where the film shows the protagonist going through an episode of his illness, and the Dream Theory, where it was ""all just a dream,"" which is too clichéd and idiotic to even consider.The 'official' interpretation I would've never pieced together because it's just too sci-fi-oriented and complex: It's the Tangent Universe Theory, which suggests that time in the Primary Universe (i.e. reality) is occasionally corrupted and an unstable alternative universe is created, but it will only last a few weeks. Nevertheless, it threatens to destroy the universe. The events you see happening in the bulk of the film are this alternative reality where the universe (or God) is correcting the error to get back to the Primary Universe using an Artifact (the jet engine), The Living Receiver (Jake Gyllenhaal), a Manipulated Dead person (the bunny guy), and so on. Google it and you'll see that the Tangent Universe explanation ties up all the loose ends.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The best 80's Movie made in 2001.,"I would label ""Donnie Darko"" as ""The thinking person's ""Twilight"". For anyone looking to rent or buy this movie, I would suggest getting the original version on DVD. Watch the movie in it's entirety and then watch the deleted scenes. A couple days later, view the entire film again. Then you can get a grasp of how many levels this movie was made on.In the meantime, you'll be thinking about it often.Every now and then you'll see a movie that has such a great cast that you can't pick out just one superb performance because they're all top notch. This is one of those movies.Jake Gyllenhall and Jenna Malone portray their characters with so much realism, you're pretty easily drawn into their relationship as a teen couple, both dealing with troubled lives.Mary McDonnell plays Donnie's mother with such empathy, that you feel as sad for her as you do Donnie.The one thing I noticed about this movie that I haven't seen posted a lot is the Messiah-like undertones. If you pay attention to when Donnie does something under the control of Frank, he always has his hood up looks ""Satanic"".At the end, Donnies realizes that he must sacrifice himself so those dear to him ( his mother and Gretchen especially) can live. IN other words, he crucifies himself. If you watch the deleted scenes, you can see what I mean.One of my all time favorite movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A strange surreal journey that's equal parts nostalgic and alien, it's little wonder Donnie Darko has become a cult cinema touchstone","Set during October of 1988, Donald ""Donnie"" Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a disturbed young man prone to sleepwalking and waking dreams whose world is shaken when he is visited by an apparition of a man in a rabbit suit named Frank (James Duval) who leads him out of his home and tells him the world will end in 28 days. The encounter with Frank saves Donnie's life as a jet engine crashed through his bedroom where he would've otherwise been sleeping which sees a ripple effect as Donnie's experiences may be leftover remnants of time travel assuming they're not part of his disturbed mind.Donnie Darko is a 2001 psychological sci-fi thriller written and directed by Richard Kelly that has since become an enduring staple of cult cinema. Kelly wrote the script basing it on an urban legend about a piece of ice from a plane that fell through a boy's bedroom and incorporated various autobiographical elements with underlying concepts of time travel and alternate universes. Kelly was able with the help of his producer Sean McKittrick to get the script circulated around Hollywood in the late 90s and early 2000s who were taken by the novelty of the script having not seen anything like it at that point and on a budget of $4.5 million ($2 million of which was provided by executive producer Drew Barrymore's production company) Kelly managed to get the film made and saw positive response but also uncertainty from many distributors as the shadow of Columbine and September 11 scared some distributors away from the more charged material and the film avoided a direct-to-video release thanks largely to the intervention of Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas. While the film was barely a blip on the cinematic radar during its initial theatrical run, the film quickly garnered a cult audience through home video and subsequent re-releases and is now rightfully regarded as a cult hit.While on the surface Donnie Darko is a surreal and fantastical mystery with allusions to Alice in Wonderland (with Frank the Rabbit serving as a catalyst for Donnie's journey) and a quirky sense of surrealism in the mold of David Lynch, the movie further serves as a commentary on American conservatism with the film set during the tail end of the Reagan administration and the Bush/Dukakis election with the town of Middlesex, Virginia and the private high school serving as microcosm of that era's varying spectrum of values who aligned with that political movement. The residents of Middlesex run the gamut from more center right figures such as Rose and Eddie Darko (played by Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne respectively) who possess few social reservations while focused predominantly on financial and economic ones, while others such as Beth Grant's Kitty Farmer are representative of the moral guardians of the time who labeled anything they didn't understand as ""pornography"" while also adhering to the words of professional charlatans like Patrick Swayze's Jim Cunnigham turning a blind eye to any evidence of wrongdoings less it shatter their worldview. At the center of this is undeniably Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie Darko who gives a fantastic performance as the central lead portraying a character who doesn't fit within the rigid confines of his small town and is written off as more of a problem to be reigned in than anything else. Donnie's journey involving his relationship with his family, friends, and (possible) figments of imagination intertwined with notions of faith versus science makes for an engaging journey that while often operating with little clarity creates a dream like atmosphere that engages on an emotional level as well as a metaphysical one.On a side note: I did watch the director's cut for the sake of comparison and it is a significant step down from the theatrical cut. While I wouldn't say it ""kills"" the movie or anything, the replacement of certain soundtracks and extension and addition of other scenes does not work to the film's benefit especially since it takes away the interpretation from the viewer at key points and instead bluntly tells the audiences and downplays the dreamlike atmosphere of the original cut in favor of something more ""grounded"" which does not work at all.Donnie Darko is an enduring staple of cult cinema for good reason and you can see why it struck a chord with so many of its core audience especially given the rise of neoconservatism at the turn of the new millennium and the cyclical nature thereof. Definitely a worthwhile watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
cool premise and unique blend,"It's 1988 upper class suburb Middlesex, Virginia. Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a disturbed kid who talks to a giant creepy bunny called Frank and disappears at night. His parents (Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osborne) have him talking to psychiatrist Dr. Lilian Thurman (Katharine Ross). Frank tells him that the world is ending in 28 days. A jet engine crashes into his room while he's away sleepwalking. No one knows where it came from. He falls for new student Gretchen Ross (Jena Malone). The school is flooded and English teacher Karen Pomeroy (Drew Barrymore)'s assignment is blamed. Gym teacher Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant) begins to teach lessons from motivational speaker Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). His science teacher Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff (Noah Wyle) gives him a time travel book written by local mad woman Roberta Sparrow.I love the weird moody style. It's got a surreal suburbia that feels more like the small town in Blue Velvet. It's a beautiful place on the surface hiding an ugly core. Frank is just weird and Jake Gyllenhaal plays off of it with a disturbing performance. There is the crazy sci-fi element. All of it mash together in one of the most unique blend. The 80s music is terrific. I also didn't notice Seth Rogen was in this until watching much later. The final ending is a little bit confusing and I'm not sure what it all means.

Director's cut made me lose respect for the film itself.,"I recently decided to introduce Donnie Darko to a couple of friends of mine, but the only available copy the movie store had was the director's cut. Having not seen it, I immediately assumed that it would be better than the theatrical version and would be great for first time viewers. I was wrong. Dead wrong. Not only did the director's cut pretty much scare away a crowd of about 15 first time viewers with its off-beat pacing and obnoxious super-imposed editing sequences, but it also scared away a long time Donnie darko fan. Many of the beautiful transitions and music sequences which were so crucial to the delivery and near aesthetic perfection in the theatrical version were gone. What was left instead was a less familiar Donnie Darko with repetitively clichéd editing techniques, unfamiliarly disjointed music sequences, and abrasively disproportional pacing that really took away the meaning that film once held for me. Now that I've seen what the director originally intended for the film to look like, I don't know if I'll ever be able to appreciate it the same way again.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Does this really deserve a top 100 list?,"Let me start by reminding my readers Donnie Darko is not a bad movie. Jake gyleminahalfardein or whatever does an exceptional job as the weirded out high schooler with evil bunny vision and supersonic god hearing. The movie is set-up nicely and paced right on time.

When I watch a movie, I need to have images and themes bootprinted in my brain like jackie chan just kicked my ass....brain or something like that....anyways, one reason this movie failed to be great is it tries to be classic. They try to inject Donnie with super smart intelligence and emotional anti-social speeches which just don't move me in the slightest. I wasn't even nudged by his ""gripping"" lunch room monologue. I don't like subplotting religion into a film like its supposed to be some sort of subliminal message only heard by listeners and then calling the bulk of said message science fiction because you add some time travel and an exploding plane.

Reading the FAQ and visiting the site for it, and working through the puzzles found there, also help. I don't mean to scare people away from this, more to inform. This is like a jigsaw puzzle, and not a simple one at that. When the pieces do all come together... well, I imagine that it's satisfying, I honestly can't claim it's happened for me yet. But I really can't find anything in this to criticize. The plot is interesting, and develops throughout. The pacing is deliberate, nothing is rushed or dwelled upon in a manner it shouldn't be. The acting is flawless. The philosophy and food for thought are well-done. Editing and cinematography are excellent. They're experimental(that, in fact, is a word that really applies to this entire film) without being flashy or over-stylized. The music is amazing and always well-chosen. The production never shows that its budget was little by today's standards. The effects are astounding in every case. Kelly definitely deserves his work being noticed. The overall concept is well-thought out, and while this is certainly not the first depiction of it, even on the silver screen, it is the most ""realistic"" and consistent one, and it's near the top of the list as far as how engaging it is(The Butterfly Effect does, for me, beat this in that respect, but I will admit that the writers of that did do stuff that was more cool than it was sensible, if not very often). I understand that the Director's Cut is the version that largely explains what happens, whereas the Theatrical(which is the only I've seen thus far), to a wider degree leaves it up to individual interpretation. There is a bit of disturbing content, and there is some language, as well as dialog that should perhaps not reach younger ears. In any event, this is hardly meant for children.

Donny and the bunny man,"Donnie Darko is a brainy but depressed teenager. Between a familial cocoon on the verge of splitting up and a conformist high school, he's suffocating. His only real friend is a giant rabbit named Frank. The latter orders him to commit acts of violence and predicts him the end of the world in 28 days, 06 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds......And this is what grabbed my attention about the American independent movie made by a 26 year old young director, Richard Kelly. I was amazed at the general enthusiasm on this site around this flick while knowing it opened around the world with little hype (in France, it had a very quiet opening). ""Donnie Darko"" could occupy a prominent place among the movies which were sleepers at the time of their release but which gained the status of cult-movie. I have heard about it thanks to one of my favorite bands: Echo and the Bunnymen. Their grand song ""the Killing Moon"" opens a movie which in its first quarter of an hour presents a series of sequences drastically different in the content and form (from the moment when Donnie awakes in the country to the presentation of his high school to the first apparition of Frank, the rabbit). The first merit we can attribute to Kelly's flick is having gathered several cinema genres in a sole genuine story (fantastic, comedy, drama, thriller, teenage movie). This variety is equaled by the liberty of tones that characterizes the movie. Going from fantasizing to realism, swinging from fantastic to comedy as if it followed naturally, Kelly also excels in imposing climates. The more the movies goes on, the more intensity it accumulates. An intensity that Kelly controls without extreme special effects and by little touches, notably with the apparitions of the evil rabbit which pepper the work. This creature is a kind of witness of Donnie's troubled mind.As a matter of fact, the movie wavers nearly all the time between 2 poles: the exterior world and Donnie's inner psycho. We penetrate in the tormented mind of a teenager who is prey to a profound discontentment and especially rebelled against the world that surrounds him. By committing odd and alarming acts suggested by Frank, he expresses his contempt and his hate for this shameful world. So, in a way Frank is the intermediary point between Donnie's mind and his exterior contact.But these acts are for Kelly an excellent means to break the deceitful appearances and to remove masks of hateful characters. To a second degree, ""Donnie Darko"" is adorned with a scathing social critic whose target is especially the education system. This one is ossified, remains paralyzed in its conformist educational methods. One of its goals is turning young female pupils in pompom girls! And in one memorable sequence, the headmaster rejects Drew Barrymore's educational methods without explaining why! The critic is still more acid when the teachers welcomes nearly with open arms a persuasive preacher (an unexpected Patrick Swayze) who claims knowing how to crush fear thanks to a total master of positive energy. Ultimately, it is total idolatry or credulity for shameless charlatanism that the movie also attacks and when we learn Swayze's hidden secret, the satire is extra intense.Furthermore, Kelly also skilfully incorporated elements of teenage movie in his rich work and these elements are generally the ones which are put aside in teenage movies. The most important one is the difficulties of communication between teenagers and their parents. Donnie suffers but his parents (even his girlfriend or close relatives) are incapable of understanding him, although they seem to agree their son on certain points like the education in his school. Even his analysis sessions are of little help for him. What can he do? Perhaps contemplating the possibility of time travel...As for the cast, it alternates good and, let's say, less good surprises. The best: Jake Gyllenhaal is a real revelation, both frail and disturbing. The actress who acts his gym teacher also stands out even if she acts a grotesque character. But thanks to this, the movie is blessed with comic moments of a high quality. Then, I have always thought that Patrick Swayze had limited gifts as an actor but here, he is cast against type in a role for which he was the ideal man. However, the choice of Drew Barrymore for the young literature teacher is debatable. She's not bad at all but she was too young for the role (this is my opinion).I don't want to reveal the end but with it we could write that we've come full circle. It ends a movie which opens prospects to any possible interpretations. Not meant pejoratively, the screenplay has a good packet of holes or ambiguous points. Moreover, the logic behind the whole story is hard to perceive. The truth finds itself neither in Donnie's mind, nor in the exterior world. Maybe in every viewer's opinion. I address to the people who haven't watched ""Donnie Darko"": if you wish to watch it and at the end of the first projection you feel bemused, don't reject it like I did. Like ""Jacob's Ladder"" (1990), like ""the Sixth Sense"" (1999), it requires several viewings before the qualities of Kelly's work reveal themselves before our eyes. An undeniable tour-de-force in the teenage movie as well as a readable work on several levels, spanning fantastic movie, teenage movie and social satire, ""Donnie Darko"" should attract any movie-goer given it doesn't necessarily target a specific category of viewers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
in the context of September 11...,"""Donnie Darko"" is not the easiest movie to explain. The title character (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a high school student in 1988 who narrowly escapes death one night by wondering out of his house before a jet engine crashes into his room. He then has visions of an evil-looking rabbit who may or may not be there to warn him of something.That's the bare plot, but there's of course the question of the movie's overarching idea. That's very much up to interpretation. Is it about time travel? Maybe so; I can't say for certain. But other things strike me about the movie. One scene shows the debate between George Bush Sr and Michael Dukakis, in which Bush praises Panama's president. This gives an obvious sense of irony, possibly an allusion to what ends up happening in the movie.But I would really like to talk about the movie in the context of September 11, 2001, as the movie was released shortly thereafter. It's not just that ""Donnie Darko"" creates an eerie, mind-blowing feeling similar to the one that we got on 9/11. There is also Patrick Swayze's pop-psychologist: to me, at least, he represents the ""Bible-for-everything"" agenda that Bush used 9/11 to try and push.But that's just me.

"Promising director Richard Kelly's debut film is a journey of fate, faith and our ability to walk the thin line that separates these two","""28 days... six hours... 42 minutes... 12 seconds. That... is when the world... will end""  Frank, the giant bunny rabbit (from ""Donnie Darko"").When I first learned about Donnie Darko, the film was already a two years cult classic. Of course it was a devastating flop at the box office, so many people didn't know what it was, or what it was about. But when a local Israeli radio station first played Gary Jewel's melancholy adaptation of the pop hit ""Mad World"" (taken from the movie's excellent soundtrack), the announcer spoke of a forgotten American film about a kid who encounters a vision of a giant bunny rabbit that tells him that the world is about the end unless he takes some severe actions to prevent it.This all sounded surreal to me, and I decided to do whatever is necessary to put my hand on a copy of the film, and see what it's all about. And boy was I hooked. Jake Gyllenhall, in one of his earliest appearances (long before he started to become somewhat annoying), is Donnie Darko, the haunted teen who takes the impossible burden of fixing the world on his shoulders. Shortly after the film begins, a jet engine falls from a plane and crash lands into Donnie's bedroom. After eluding this freak accident, a sequence of bizarre occurrences revolving Darko begins to take place. Darko is led by his bunny-friend, Frank, to wreak havoc on his home town, supposedly in the interest of saving them (or something). Alas, it is not quite clear who this Frank bunny is, and why Darko is the only person to see him. This whole hallucinatory film takes place during the 1988 presidential election, but if you notice the voices in the background, you'll notice something went wrong with the alternate reality Darko is living in, and it is not the 1988 many of us would remember.Whatever he was trying to pull, promising director Richard Kelly's debut film is a journey of fate, faith and our ability to walk the thin line that separates thee two. Gyllenhall's real life sister and a talent on her own right, Maggie, plays Darko's on screen older sister, and Daveigh Chase (The Ring, Lilo & Stitch) is the younger one. Also taking part in this wonderful indie film are 1980's legend Patrick Swayze (as a child molesting sports coach), Drew Barrymore (as Darko's teacher) and E.R.'s Noah Wyle.If you manage to get your hands on this one, you won't regret it. The film's success is word of mouth in its full pride and glory  and an extremely justified one in this case.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"very original, thoughts provoking concoction","Let me start with this: This is a must see movie. Forget what you have heard or read about Donnie Darko and just go and get the DVD release. The suggested atmosphere is: a dark room (you should let the moon light in though), lying on your bed (preferably alone), leave the usual popcorn or snack in the kitchen this time and get ready to experience something original.I am not gonna tell you that I could dig the whole concept because I couldn't and even if I did, that wouldn't necessarily be the right answer. This is one of those: Vanilla Sky, Mullholland Dr., Lost Highway, Dark City and etc. kind of movies that wont provide you with the answer; it will make you work for it. Yes, this one requires some heavy lifting and that's the beauty of it. There are so many films out there where you can tell the end by just seeing the title or the leading actors. Those are not fun and we all know that. Well this one is different.I would say the plot was toooo complicated. Trying to make something really different and big, Richard Kelly (director and writer) got lost himself and us into the story. He could have simplified the script a bit to mine modest opinion. Because of the great number of different stories and characters throughout the movie the end fell short. It was of course impossible to comprise all the pieces into a 5 min meaningful ending. Kelly should have stick to a bit less of characters and slightly reduce the number of different stories and ideas. Just a bit. Notwithstanding, the whole cast was brilliant, especially the Darko es family. Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie) delivers a great performance. I canft imagine any better way to play this role. He is the sole of the film. Amazing. Memorable.  Mary Mc Donnell (his mother) was my second best with the greatest line in the movie: asked by her son ghow does it feel like to have a Wacko for a sonh she answers git feels, wonderfulh. Jena Malone (Gretchen) is also perfect for the role. And the whole 80fs sentiment with the soundtrack definitely pulled some strings.And at the end my understanding of the movie is: donft try to explain everything simply because you canft. There are certain things that cannot be explained and are better left such. And when you think, it wonft change a thing even if we could so because not everything has to do with reasoning. Human nature. This is one thing. Second thing has to do with not waiting somebody else to provide you with the right answers. Find your own answer to that movie as well. And I wanted to finish with something about sacrifice and ordinary people but it will be better to leave it unsaid.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Flawed, yes, but a must-see","Yeah, the really picky folks can hunt and peck at the flaws all they want to rationalize why they don't think this is so great, and, yeah, the flaws are there.  Some scenes arguably don't belong, the ""science"" involved is certainly questionable, and so on.  But c'mon, picky people, it would be wonderful if all films were this good.  Some films can be and are great even if flawed.  And this one I found engrossing, dark, sad, and beautiful.  And extraordinary.  You can argue whether or not some of the techniques employed haven't already been done before (the techniques for which David Lynch has become [in]famous come to mind, but they only come to mind; it's hard to pin down how exactly they're highly similar), but this film is still very unique and original.  Get past the nitpicking over details and judge the story as a whole; that's what made this special for me.  (E.g., something about the word ""sacrifice"" used in ads for the film, as it relates to the story.) It's rare that I see a film that makes so strong an impression on me, but I will indeed let some time pass and give it a second viewing to see how well it holds up.In the meantime, I'll give it a 9 out of 10 (and I don't give out 9's very easily).",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Jake,"Jake Gyllenhaal is one of my favorite actors. Such extraordinary performance at 19 years old is something special.However, I want to say that I enjoyed the movie but was very confused. Personally, i don't enjoy movies where I finish with confusion not knowing what's really the ending is all about. Sometimes there are movies where you are left hanging but add to that the confusion part in this movie. I don't like a movie where I have to read an explanation and theory after it finishes to understand the movie.The story starts great, it sets the viewer in the mood perfectly. The lighting, color and score made me FEEL the movie. Dark and gloomy with great acting of Jake. The story starts very simplistically, a trouble minded kid who is having visions of a creature. Could be many thing. Throughout the movie I'm trying to piece together and understand his situation and what could be happening. Is it a mental disease? Is it Time travel really? What is it all about? What's up with the teacher (she seems to know something but the movie doesn't show her relation to the story). ? and Roberta sparrow? Is it a dream? Hallucinations?I'm still not sure after finishing the movie! Very ambiguous! You can think of many conclusions which leave you wondering! If you are a fan of sci-fi mind twisting movies with philosophical/physical theory... yes! But personally I like a movie where in the end i'm satisfied. Not left hanging.Well anyways, i don't want to say it's bad but the only thing I like is Jake's acting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Much sizzle, little steak.  Wait, not much sizzle, either.","I'm a Johnny-come-lately to the Darko phenomenon, so I suppose I was somewhat set up for disappointment by the hype this movie has received on the internet and elsewhere. Catchphrases and visual references abound in people's sig-files, so at long last, in the interests of cultural literacy, I had to check it out.My verdict: not bad. But not nearly good enough.The movie's plot has been hashed out in many venues, and I won't spoil anything here (though I will note that I haven't encountered a better set-up for an O-Henry plot twist in a long while). So let's focus on the more numinous qualities which have to sell this movie: The acting is competent throughout, sometimes very fine, as in the title performance by a young Jake Gyllenhaal, and particularly in an unusually understated turn by too-often too-shrill Drew Barrymore, who manages to convey more bitter superiority in a few glances than most people could with a shriek. The cast is weighted down by a number of over-padded parts, however...Swayze serves a purpose here, but why is so much screen-time devoted to Beth Grant? She overacts miserably, and takes what should be a modern ""Turn of the Screw"" into the over-the-top territory of ""Heathers."" It jars.And what's up with the visuals? For a fantasy/sci-fi/psychological film like this one, however, I expected a good deal more...well, competence. The editing is often spastic when it shouldn't be (an early dinner-table conversation in the Darko household snaps back and forth from speaker to speaker like a badly-done MtV video) and too damn slow when it should rivet (several of the key 'demon rabbit' scenes are, frankly (hah!) boring). Maybe that's a problem with the director's cut alone.And then there's the sadly unfinished feeling to the plot. The whole goal of this movie is to bring things around in a big circle, to provide perfect closure. That narrative structure is completely inconsistent with the looping, inconclusive dialog. And where's the meaning? Roll your own? Look, I recognize that the screenwriter/director is grappling with weighty issues, and one of his points is that there are no easy answers. Thanks, anyone past middle-school knows that. So there should be something more substantive to chew on here and...well, there just isn't. Many overly-broad philosophical conversations between characters drift off into uncomfortable silence, and I'm left with the sense that I'm wasting time.Maybe that's the real point of the movie: time is precious. So don't waste. By, like, you know, watching movies.Grade: C+",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Dark, Ambiguous, Excellence!",Donnie Darko is really what you want to believe it to be. I love films that leave each viewer with entirely different perspectives on what they think happened and this riveting motion picture accomplished just that. Richard Kelly creates an extremely ominous environment and a cleverly thought provoking screenplay. This was also one of Jake Gyllenhall's first breakthrough bangers that put him on the scene in becoming a Hollywood rock star. Great performance from the youngster. This was my first viewing of Donnie darko but I could immediately tell this is a film that needs to be rewatched.,8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Incomprehensible without Companion Guide,"I started watching Donnie Darko expecting a classic horror, only to come out the other end with my head spinning from the superhero, super sci-fi psychological thriller that I had just witnessed. I'll admit I was totally bamboozled when the credits rolled - I hadn't even realised what I'd watched was actually a well disguised superhero flick until I done some research online. If ever a movie required a second viewing, this is it.What I will say is I have no idea how anyone could understand Donnie Darko or even begin to fathom the story it tells by viewing the film alone. To understand Donnie Darko, you must expose yourself to the works of Roberta Sparrow AKA Grandmother Death. The Philosophy of Time Travel provides something of a companion guide to the film. It is an entirely fictional book of course. In the world of Donnie Darko however, it is entirely fact.I believe some sort of directors cut was released years later that provided the source material for all these Reddit wonks and film buffs to fully digest Donnie Darko and put it in a form that I could understand. Only now can I fully appreciate the creativity and ingenuity of this film. For the writers to create such a complex cinematic universe and fine tune it until not a single hole in the plot can be picked, it really is a work of art.I recommend clearing your head of all expectations before watching this film. Then go to the website to find your companion guide The Philosophy of Time Travel and give it a read (caution it does contain spoilers). Then watch the film again. I believe this is the best way to gain maximum enjoyment and appreciation of the incredible Donnie Darko.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Overrated, nothing special about this for me","I'd been meaning to watch 'Donnie Darko' for some time having heard great things.

Ultimately the film leaves a lot open to interpretation and presents more questions than it does answers, which is not what I watch a film for.I've noticed a few users have mentioned that this film gets better with each viewing.

A worthy cult film that appeals on many levels,"I had had this film recommended to me by friends and knew it was considered a cult favorite, but have only just got around to viewing it, thanks to its turning up in a bargain bin at the local discount store.Though I went in with some preconceptions, not knowing much about the film except its basic premise, I was delightfully surprised by what I saw. Not many films now can take you on a voyage that is so free of clichés, formulas and predictable plot turns, but Donnie Darko does just that.Despite its faults (and it does have them, including phoned-in performances - thankfully brief - from Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze and the absolutely dreadful Mary McDonnell), this is a whimsical little film full of surprises and twists. It builds suspense with nearly every scene and there's hardly a moment when you're not aching to find out what happens next, and what exactly is to become of Donnie.This is also one of the few films I have ever seen to deal so effectively with mental illness, drawing the viewer so completely into the world of a paranoid schizophrenic (much as Scorsese so hypnotically drew you in in his bleak masterpiece Taxi Driver) without resorting to being patronizing, sensationalist, exploitative or simple minded.See this film if you enjoy the kind of movies that explore other versions of reality, whether they be fantasy, horror, science fiction or something else.

"""Donnie"" is everything you could ask for in a great movie","I heard some buzz about how great a little film called ""Donnie Darko"" is before, and I did spend five minutes pouring over the DVD cover at Target. So one night, after I got it on Netflix, I popped it in the DVD player and sat my fanny on the couch. It was one of the best two hours I ever spent in front of the television.Donnie Darko is portrayed magnificently by Jake Gyllenhaal of ""Brokeback Mountain"" fame. Donnie is a teenager of roughly sixteen who gets disturbing visions of a six foot tall rabbit who tells him that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. That night an engine from an airplane falls through the roof of Donnie's bedroom.This movie is filled with laughs and chills and awesome cinematography. It is a great film for those who like to think about the movie they just saw. The ending is kind of open-ended, which leaves room for the viewers themselves to interpret the film.On the cover of the DVD I believe, it hails Donnie Darko as a ""psychological thriller"". While very psychological, calling it a ""psychological thriller"" does not do it justice. The best classification of the film that us movie buffs can think of is a thinkpiece. Whether it's thinking about how the ending happened, if poor Cherita Chen will ever be understood, about the story behind Frank the bunny, whether or not every living creature on earth dies alone, how exactly one ""sucks a f*ck"", and about the sexual lives of smurfs, this film provokes those thoughts.I dare you to enjoy the masterpiece of ""Donnie Darko"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Donnie hasn't been the same since something of a near death experience has occurred in his life. Now he gets visions of a 6 foot tall bunny rabbit. At least that was what the description said once I pressed the ""info"" button on my remote. I wasn't too excited. Donnie the main character is one of the most pronounced and well developed characters in film history. Jake does his best performance that he has and will ever do. The secondary characters float around in an off positions with out much notice...except Donnie's girlfriend. This movie makes you care about only those two and nothing else and I wouldn't have had it any other way. By the end of the film I guarantee that you will have a different prospective on life. I don't expect nor recommend someone to watch it just once. There is too much to get with out a second viewing.

"A strange film, with a strong visual impact and a script with wild theories, but which fulfills its objective very well and is enjoyable to watch.","I saw this film very recently and I have to agree with all those who label it ""strange"" or ""bizarre"". Directed and written by Richard Kelly, it stars a young Jake Gyllenhaal and offers us a very complex plot where a young teenager commits several crimes under the influence of an imaginary friend who dresses up as a rabbit. Everything indicates that this young man is schizophrenic or psychotic in some way, and has developed several linked obsessions, but the film always leaves us in doubt as to whether he is, in some way, right about the things he thinks.There are several films that follow similar scripts, where imagination and psychopathy are almost indistinguishable from reality (""Fight Club"", ""Machinist"", etc.) and this is perhaps one of the most surreal because it allows us to see, from the beginning, that something is very wrong. That's a bonus for those who like these types of films because it's easy to keep our attention. Of course, those who are less fond of cinematic oddities won't have much reason to be satisfied.And if it is true that, on a technical level, the film does not present any major innovations or surprises, it is also true that it does everything very correctly and without problems or gross errors. We can even say that, considering the budget, it is one of those films that seems more expensive than it is. In addition, we must also mention the beautiful performance of the cast, where each one seems to do what needs to be done with correctness and restraint. Gyllenhaal has the right strength and charisma for his role and does an excellent job, and Jena Malone proves to be an intelligent and well-considered addition.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A film as good as this dosen't come along all that often,Donnie Darko. I'd watched it once before expecting a half decent movie. But at the time i watched it on telewests film service front row.

Donnie Darko is no Holden Caulfield,"The plot of ""Donnie Darko"" is rather chaotic. The film seems to be about time travel but ultimately is about a troubled teenager (Donnie Darko played by a young Jake Gyllenhaal).This interpretation of the movie is shared by director Richard Kelly, who compared ""Donnie Darko"" with the novel ""The catcher in the Rye"" (1951, J. D. Salinger). Evidently Kelly does not suffer from false modesty. The comparison is correct to the extent that Kelly, just like Salinger, is well known mainly due to a single piece of work. His later films were disappointments.To be like ""Catcher in the Rye"" takes not only a troubled teenager but also some hypocritical adults. In ""Donnie Darko"" these adults are the teacher Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant) and the motivational speaker Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze).All in all ""Donnie Darko"" is a little too chaotic for me. It depends also a liitle too much on film quotes. Although time travel is not the main theme of the film, it does play a role. Roberta Sparrow (Patience Cleveland) is an old lady who long ago wrote a book about this subject. Her appearance is (too) obviously) modelled on that of Dr Emmett Brown in ""Back to the future"" (1985, Robert Zemeckis).",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

But it was only after watching the DVD version with the Director's Commentary that the truth was revealed. Mr. Kelly's visual acuity outweighs his story-telling ability because the story he claims to be telling is not the one I saw nor one I would ever want to see. So heed my warning, approach this film with an open-mindedness and revel in its great soundtrack, clever plot, and well-turned performances and do not tarnish your experience by trying to connect Mr. Kelly's wayward attempt at telling his story of some sort of Super Hero.

differences between original and directors cut,"i noticed a lot of differences between the original and the directors cut. one of the main differences is that in the original, after i watched it, i was stunned. i literally stared at the blank screen after the movie was over for fifteen minutes, thinking ""wow. i gotta see that again to figure out what just happened."" i then watched it again and again, and read lots of things people said about it online, and i finally think i got the idea of what happened. in the directors cut, it explains what is going on, little by little, so if i was to watch the movie for the first time, i would have known what happened by the time i get to the end. i feel that this addition to the movie takes away from it a little bit. i personally liked looking for more and more information about what happened, and not knowing right away. if your the kind of person that likes to think about a movie long after you watch it or watch it over and over again, i'd say go with the original. if your the kind of person who likes to watch a movie, know what is going on most of the time, and doesn't like to look up too much info online, go for the directors cut. if you want the best of both worlds, i'd definitely say watch the original, think about it and possibly watch it again, look up stuff online, and then watch the directors cut maybe a week later, or whenever. the reason i gave this movie a 9/10, is because i liked looking for info about the first, and i think this takes a little away from that, so i dropped it down to a 9, but i'd definitely give the original a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

An Unclassifiable Masterpiece,"There are some movies that receive the attention of the critics and are given accolades that make them revered for generations. And then there are those that don't, but deserve to. Donnie Darko is one of those movies. What can only be described as an unclassifiable masterpiece, Donnie Darko explores the world of a seemingly disturbed teenager who is visited by a disturbing bunny named Frank, who tells him to perform certain actions before the world comes to an end. I'll refrain from going into any further detail and instead describe why this film is widely regarded as one of the most original films of the past decade. From the setting, to the cast, to the well plotted storyline, every aspect of the Donnie Darko film is memorable. One montage that is the most well constructed in any film is when Donnie arrives at school with his friends, and the song Head over Heels is playing. No dialogue is used while we are introduced to very important characters, instead the music's lyrics and the subtle gestures from the actors gives us great insight. This film is about love, family, acceptance, social expectations, and sacrifice. Multiple viewings may be required to help better understand the concepts of the film, which can be interpreted a number of different ways. But it is well worth it. The original version of the film is my favorite, while the director's cut tends to lend more of a helping hand to the storyline. The bottom line: Do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece of a film, you'll be hard pressed to find a more original and well acted movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"This movie is like a pack of Rizla papers, its what you make of it.","This movie is like a pack of Rizla papers, its what you make of it. Its like a really good poem, except...its a movie. Its more so your opinion and your movie than what was really intended.The fact that when I watch this movie, each time I learn something completely new. Its yet to fail to entertain me and it really was worth the £5 I paid for it. I like everything about it, the music, the way its filmed. It's just so good.What annoys me is when people say, ""It's rubbish...."" (a more modest way of rephrasing what was actually said). ACTUALLY...

Not the usual Hollywood rubbish but not good either,"I have read many comments on here about how you have to 'think' about this movie and how it's not for anyone who enjoys their plot spoon-fed ala Hollywood blockbusters. But at the same time very few of these 'in the know' people have actually bothered to explain the heck this movie is all about. Which leads me to believe they're sanctimonious English Lit students who are just as confused as the rest of us! But hey that's ok because this movie has depth and meaning, right? Well if there is it's totally lost on me I'm afraid. I did enjoy the way the film poked fun at the hypocrisy of American Christian Conservative culture, particularly Patrick Swayze as the child molesting motivational speaker.  Apart from that aspect I found the film rather morose, confusing and unsatisfying. And it's certainly not because I like brain-dead Hollywood blockbusters, on the contrary I usually like thought provoking independent movies but unfortunately this one didn't engage me at all.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An impressive debut,"This is certainly an impressive debut for writer/director Donnie Darko.  It is an inventive piece of film-making which is funny and surreal - heavily influenced by Lynch in places.  However, the storyline is full of pseudo science and clever complexities that in the end don't add up to anything. It's still an enjoyable film, though, if you don't take it seriously, and Kelly is definitely a director to look out for.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A Poetic masterpiece, which you will watch over and over till you die","I never ever liked my original review cause i never really explain why this is my all time favourite film not the best because it's Terry Gilliam's Brazil. (SEE FILMFANATIX.com)Over The Years, i've had favourite film for example...Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Harry And The Hendersons, Wild Wild West (extremely underrated film,it's not great but it's a fun blockbuster) and a lot more.It wasn't till some day in the fall of 2003, i found my favourite film and that films is of course Donnie Darko.At the time I was having a really bad time at school and it has helped me thought it and thats why i've seen it for i think like 100 times.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a teen in 1988 who may be imagining a 6 foot bunny rabbit called ""Frank"" or may not and people have said this is a complete rip-off of the James Stewart film ""Harvey"" even though it clearly is not.This is one of the films people love to try to compare to different films and you CAN'T it's a one of a kind film and the most similar films are David Lynch's Masterpiece ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Jacob's Ladder"" and those are still very different films.Now to the plot of Donnie Darko... Donnie is a kid who sleep walks and finds himself at different places in this home town of Middlesex (this mostly happens at the start) and one night when he is sleep walking, a jet engine falls into his room and escapes death and when he is sleep walking, he meets Frank The Giant 6-Foot Bunny Rabbit (played by James Duval). He goes to school and meets a girl and is moved into a hotel room.I will not explain it anymore because i don't want to ruin the impact of the film.Some films for me i just loved the first time i saw them and this one of them and some others are Lord Of The Rings Trilogy,Fight Club (but i wasn't one of all time favs till after i read the book but i loved it a lot),Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas,Brazil,Sin City and Hellboy.The Film seems so normal but like ""Blue Velvet"" it seems so surreal.The Script is one of the greatest pieces of writing ever written and i can't stress the fact that it is as good and even better then most books i've read.Jake Gyllenhaal really really deserved an Oscar for playing Donnie Darko but because the film really vanished out of the cinemas but it has became a cult classic on DVD.The Cast is unbelievable...Maggie Gyllenhaal (Jake's real sister),Patrick Swayze (who would have though my fav film would have Patrick Swayze),Drew Barrymoore,Jena Malone and many others.The Film is a poetic,tragic,love story,thriller,mysterious,surreal,magical,teen movie.And it's always nice to see Jake Gyllenhaal gets good roles after this masterpiece for example as Jack in Brokeback and Swoff in Jarhead.and i just identify with this film a lot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the most beautiful and unusual movies I've seen.,"I first watched this movie at a friend's house and was somewhat inattentive through lack of sleep and the lateness of the hour. I made up for this crime by buying it for myself soon after.The hazy blueness of a school summer in the 1980's was rendered with an attention to production values by a man I was very surprised to learn made Donnie Darko his writing/directing debut. The plot is either very simple or very complicated, depending on what you believe is going on or who you ask. On the one hand you have a school in the 80's and some well thought out character interaction. Against this backdrop, on the other hand, you have Donnie himself who seems to be in the middle of some kind of teenage delusional crisis. As the plot progresses however, it becomes apparent that he has become victim to some kind of temporal anomaly which is gradually pulling his world - and potentially everyone else's - apart. He gradually learns - from old ladies, six foot rabbits and reluctant teachers - that he is the only person who can reverse the anomaly and stop the world's time-line from unravelling completely.I have an appreciation of the whole writer/director thing and this Richard Kelly movie reinforces my belief that only the writer can truly interpret their vision in directing an actor. The cinematography is hardly groundbreaking but I found it impossible to fault. However there are moments of lucidity which almost seem to reach from the screen to command your attention. Some quite underrated and subtle performances from much of the cast, Ghylenhall included, add up to make this one of the most unusual movies I have seen in years and one which I am proud to have in my collection.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
WTH,"I don't even know what to say about this. It's been on my watch list for years because of it's positive reviews and cult status. After watching it, I just don't understand why. The acting is legit hard to watch. The dialogue in some places is thoughtful and mysteriously intruiging. In other places, it's laughably cliché or cringe. Then there's the story. It felt disjointed, unfinished, unrealized. I was all in at the beginning and all out at the end. What am I missing?There's a lot of thematic elements that are clearly emphasized but that doesn't save it from having an undercooked plot. The time travel elements were cryptic, which can be really cool, but here it feels too cryptic.

"Original version is just as good, if not better, as the ""director's cut""","First of all, let me make it clear that this is a great film. The script, the cinematography, the music and the casting make it one of the top films of the last decade. That being said, a new viewer, who knows nothing about the film, should see the original cut before viewing the ""director's cut.""What's the difference? The soundtrack of the director's cut features more tunes from the 1980s (which, according to NPR's FRESH AIR, Richard Kelly could not secure the rights to back in the day) and also incorporates chapter shots which resemble something from Wes Anderson's ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" Apparently the director felt that his film needed more framing; hence, the illustrated chapter pages used to break up the narrative. These chapter pages, culled from the Sparrow text on time travel, really don't add anything to the film -- in fact, they clutter an already perfect cinematic treasure. Plus one line from the ""director's cut"" -- which is delivered by the psycho-therapist near the end of the film , where she tells Donnie that he can ""throw away his medicine, it's only a sugar pill placebo"" detracts from the powerful ambiguities (even though, I assume, it was meant to call even more of his ""reality"" into question). The original version may not include allo of the songs that Kelly envisioned in his film, but it certainly is a tighter film from beginning to end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Falls short of a complete success,"After watching Donnie Darko, and thinking back on all of the trippy details, I felt the overall vibe it left me with was excellent.   There are some terrific ideas here and it really makes you think about it long after viewing.  HOWEVER, if I'm honest, my experience while actually watching it was not quite as positive.Most of the characters in the film are cartoony stereotypes which really kept me from getting fully caught up in it.  A few of the actors manage to infuse some subtleties that lift their characters above this (most notably the family) but most do not.  Most notably, I must say i had an easier time believing Drew Barrymore as a Charlies Angels superspy than an English teacher in this one.  Also, it seemed like there were way too many scenes where it was more about playing a song for the soundtrack (which are all very good by the way) than advancing the plot.This is a film that should be seen, and I hope to see more from Kelly. Right now, though, any comparisons to David Lynch and Mulholland Drive are extremely premature.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Migraine-Inducing But Fascinating Stuff,"Some movies take many years to achieve cult status; others become objects of cult adoration relatively quickly. ""Donnie Darko,"" released several weeks after 9/11, has achieved that quantum leap to cult status faster than any film I know. I've never seen so many laudatory reviews here on the IMDb, where over 1,700 (!) people have taken the time to sing the film's praises. Having now finally seen the movie, I can understand its cult appeal. Dealing with an emotionally troubled youth, Donnie Darko, who is not only in therapy and on prescribed psychotropic drugs but who is also possibly hallucinating a death's-head, man-sized bunny rabbit, the film dishes out a story involving time travel, alternate universes and kozmik wormholes. The picture has been impeccably made by tyro writer/director Richard Kelly (and for only $4.5 million!), is well performed by the entire cast (how nice to see Katharine Ross on screen again!), and features excellent use of '80s pop tunes, especially ""The Killing Moon"" by Echo and the BUNNYMEN and Tears for Fears' ""Mad World."" Too bad the film is also hopelessly confusing. I've watched the darn thing twice on DVD already, and although the second viewing (with the English subtitles on) did clear up some matters, too many questions remain, and still left me scratching my head. One can get a migraine trying to riddle out all the temporal paradoxes and Mobius-like plot convolutions hinted at here. Thus, the aforementioned cult, spending endless days picking at clues and debating this brainteaser no end. But as Donnie himself says somewhere in the film while talking about God, one can debate some subjects forever and still not come up with concrete answers. And that's just how I feel about Kelly's film. Still, pretty fascinating stuff...",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

From here, strange occurrences and coincidences take place, and Donnie starts to both mature, yet also lose control of himself. He is tormented, multi-layered, and played eye-catchingly by Jake Gyllenhall. All 110 minutes of DD is climaxing and superbly engaging.

Director dumbs down Donnie Darko,"As good as the movie is, the open-endedness left more to the imagination, which the director's cut attempts to over-elaborately explain. I understand that the director is probably just trying to respond to comments about how hard it was to understand, but his response shouldn't have been to dumb down the movie. I loved it exactly the way it was. For example, in the scene where Donnie puts a hatchet through the bronze mongrel, the original leaves the audience in a state of awe. The Director's cut, on the other hand attempts to explain it with a quick except from a text book which states that those who go back in time are given super-human strength.

The Emperor's New Clothes,"I'd like to advise any one who has read this far down on the additional reviews page to disregard any positive reviews you have read about this movie. I strongly believe it is a waste of time. The director, Richard Kelly, comes from USC film school, which trains him to take what is successful in other films (i.e. Magnolia, Being John Malkovich, to name a few) and slap them together. Unfortunately, he doesn't add anything else to this mix except for a convoluted, plotless story and TV sitcom, one-dimensional characters. I'm sure many people have commented on how the plot was ""confusing"" or ""complicated"" - it is. That is all it is. It means nothing. And then, in one scene Darko yells at a teacher who is trying to get him to label a situation as either ""Love"" or ""Fear"". He says that life is more complex that that duality. Ironically, every character in this film is either good or bad. There is the mean, knife-wielding bully, the sweet girlfriend, the good, daring teacher, the mean, narrow-minded teacher, etc. etc. Watch any other film besides this one, please.

He begins to be visited by a 6-foot tall rabbit, Frank, who tells him he has 28 days to live. As he begins a crusade to rid the town of hypocrisy, he also meets a nice girl (Jena Malone) and is influenced by a strange book called ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"".Part science fiction, part teen comedy exploring disillusioned suburban America, the brilliance of Donnie Darko invokes comparison with some of the most interesting films of recent years. Like American Beauty, it delights in the beauty of small things, like Pi it depicts the strange internal life of its protagonist as it probes technical mysteries. And, as in Happiness, the social satire is razor sharp. But while Donnie Darko is more complex than any of these films, it can be appreciated on a number of different levels.

Mind Distortion,"Have you ever watched something that left your mind so distorted you felt confused for the rest of the night? Donnie Darko will leave you dazed and confused until your second screening, and even then, you might still be slightly confused. Young Jake Gyllenhaal does a very good job at keeping the audience attached to his character. Throughout the entire movie, you feel for Donnie Darko's problems with his family and his social life. At first everything seems really strange and bizarre, then the film progresses, and everything still seems very strange and bizarre, but you can't help but watch because you want to know what Donnie is going to do next. Unfortunately, this senseless wondering never ends, and Donnie's decision making never really makes any sense. However, that's what makes this film so enthralling, and its what draws the audience into the film itself. You never truly learn what is wrong with Donnie, but the twist that occurs in the movie makes you wonder, if there is actually something wrong with him. Donnie is a troubled young man whose parents' solution to his troubles never really solve any of his problems. He may be a misunderstood child, but he may also be a teenager with a serious illness in need of professional help. Fortunately, Donnie finds a companion that he can find solace in. This companion ultimately helps Donnie find his way and affects his decision making. Without this companion, Donnie would have remained a lost and crazed individual.

Donnie Darko may remain a mystery to the relaxed viewer, but will be an astonishing inquiry into the mind of a troubled teenager.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Hilarious, beautiful, thrilling and down-to-earth","Donnie Darko is by far one of my favourite movies. Even after three viewings, I still can't give myself any credit for understanding it. In fact, I'm am confused by it.For me, the charm of this movie lies in it's humour, brilliantly brought to life by Gyllenhaals character - Donnie Darko. The humour is often very subtle, and relies heavily on the stereotypes we remember from high school.But there is a lot more to Donnie Darko than the humour. It is a dark story, set in a sunny suburban environment, occasionally interrupted by disturbing imagery. If I should try to categorize this movie, I'd say it is a dark satire.This movie is not for everyone - you should have a sense of dark humour to appreciate the jokes. You should also have an open mind, to prevent being put off by the bizarre and pseudo-scientific twist on time travel.As for the acting and music: Spot on.Give this flick a chance.

One rabbit of the apocalypse,"'Donnie Darko' has a reputation for being a seriously strange film; but in some ways, it's undeserved. This is not just to say that it is fundamentally very conventional compared with the work of the likes of Bunel; it's actually far coherent than many mainstream science fiction thrillers (for example, 'Open My Eyes', or it's American remake, 'Vanilla Sky', which where simply praised for their ""dazzling"" plots); or horror films like the 'Ring' cycle. My guess is that audiences were thrown primarily because of the expectations of genre; supernatural, surreal happenings are simply not supposed to appear in what is partly a teen movie, and partly a suburban satire. As a straight film, 'Donnie Darko' isn't bad: all the sympathetic characters are unnaturally beautiful, of course, and there are the customary easy pops at educational behaviourists (to a Briton, this recurrent aspect of American teen movies is very strange, can they really be so prevalent to deserve this amount of attention?); but there's some nice dark comedy, and the acting and editing are generally of a high standard. It even manages to possess a good soundtrack using 1980s songs (in my opinion, quite an achievement in itself!). As science fiction, on the other hand, it bears some resemblance to Douglas Copeland's book, 'Girlfriend in a Coma' (and indeed, makes much more sense than that book did). What it doesn't give us is any indication of why the events we see should happen to its hero; the film may be sensible, but it's also essentially meaningless. Nonetheless, it's intelligently made, distinctive, and not really that confusing, providing you leave your preconceptions at the cinema door.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The theatrical cut is much better...,"If you asked me what I thought of Donnie Darko when I first saw it (I first saw the Theatrical Cut on DVD), I would have told you I consider it a decent film with a good soundtrack and a creepy atmosphere. I understood why so many people love this film, but it did not connect with me personally, at best a 7/10. However, it has been stuck in my mind, and after finding out more about Richard Kelly and his career path since, but also rewatching the film, I have both become even more critical and also more respectful of it.
If you're reading this review and haven't seen the film, the Theatrical Cut is much better in my opinion, as it leaves many things much more vague and ominious. It is an incredibly creepy film that would not work without Jake Gyllenhal's performance, and the way the studio interferred with the project. I am usually against studios re-editing films to change an artist's vision, but Richard Kelly is the type of writer-director who needs to be told what is good and what is stupid. His Director's Cut, while nowhere near as bad as Southland Tales, removes the vague interpretation that can be taken from this story and especially the ending. It hammers home the sci-fi angle without understanding that it is unnecessary to the final tale. The story also loses its uniqueness once you learn about Southland Tales and his script for a ""Holes"" adaptation. Refraining from complete spoilers yet again, the 'end of the world' and 'ridiculous sci fi turns' thing starts to wear off once you do it a ton and sacrifice character for cheap science fiction thrills. That said, what makes Donnie Darko so effective and even more tragic is the grounded nature it has. There are some wonderful characters in this film, and the Terrence Malick-style floaty camera movement shots at the start really set up their family dynamic. While the Director's Cut does butcher the impact and vague creepyness of the ending, the theatrical cut does contain one of the most haunting endings to a motion picture. Honestly, Donnie Darko works much better as a tragic fantasy film more akin to Pan's Labyrinth than a twisty sci fi movie.
Also,I wouldn't reccommend looking up all the ""Motivated Living"" or ""Motivated Dead"" and Parallel Universe stuff. While this does add an interesting angle to the way the story progresses (and arguably, it makes more sense), I prefer the total preventability of the ending and the interpretation you can take from it. Still a good movie though.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A bizarre and beautifully perfected masterpiece,"I've seen this film many, many times. I love this film, and so I felt the need to finally upload a review.With Donnie Darko, Richard Kelly has created a flat-out masterpiece. It's so good in fact that even with a lifetime of directing and writing movies I doubt he'll ever be able to top it; quite a feat when you consider it was his directorial debut.Anybody who's seen the film will know that it's a bizarre mix of genres all tossed into one: Drama, teen, comedy, phycological thriller, romance, horror. Trying to define it to somebody who is yet to experience it is by no means an easy task. It is this mystifying cocktail of genre's that make the so great however. It's freakishly unique and will most likely alienate some people who prefer their cinema cliché and predictable.One of the film's many merits is it's style. The film lunges back and forth from light hearted comedy into some segments which are very dark and unsettling. It's this contrast that makes the film work so well; the dark segments give the film it's sense of danger and intrigue but these are balanced out nicely with lighter elements. Combine these with impressive cinematography and the film quickly establishes it's distinctive feel.The writing is on certainly on par with the rest of the film. It's often laugh out loud funny and always feels believable and totally un-cliché. The characters themselves are well established. Donnie is a well realised character: he's intelligent, he often speaks sense but deep down we know something is not entirely right. The rest of the cast perfectly supports the rest of the film. There's the perhaps equally unusual but brilliant Gretchen Ross. And of course the hilarious role of Jim Cunningham from Patrick Swayze.The real elephant in the room to address if of course the ending. Or rather'""That Ending"". Throughout the whole story is the backbone of doomsday prophecies given to Donnie by the entity known as 'Frank'. It isn't of course till the end that we begin to realise what Frank was referring to.Or do we? As mentioned by many others the film is not a simple one. Upon first viewing you may think that you've understood what just happened. Of course once you have time to think on it (and/or perhaps discuss it with others) you realise that perhaps you're not quite sure. That, ladies and gentlemen is the brilliance of Donnie Darko. It's not a film that you're really supposed to figure out straight away, or perhaps even ever. The second watch you'll possibly prove yourself wrong, the third you'll pick up new clues. Even after over 10 watches I find myself picking up new clues, disregarding others, changing my theories. That is why it is such a cleverly constructed film. This brings me to also point out why the Original theatrical cut is far superior to the Director's cut. The DC removes a large proportion of the mystery and riddles surrounding the films by attempting to explain what happens, practically spoon feeding you the information. If you're a true lover of interesting and thought-provoking films do yourself a favour and watch the original.Long story short, Donnie Darko is a mini-masterpiece. A beautifully crafted thrill-ride that is totally twisted, utterly bizarre but most definitely PERFECTION",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Perhaps I was intoxicated at the time, but...","I thought this film was dull. I understood it, though it was a challenge, and saw its point, but I couldn't help feel unsatisfied at the end. Perhaps I wasn't meant to; I usually don't feel satisfied at the end of any film. (Save Jean-Pierre Jeunet's `Amelie', everyone liked that)Richard Kelly is quite young, so we may forgive him for being so skittish with his plot, but not his debauched characterization. Donnie, the protagonist, veers from suicidal freak to happy-go-lucky in a matter of seconds. He's on medication and is crackers, but it's still not forgivable. It is important for us to feel connected with the main character, and here it is possible only for deranged teenagers with a giant rabbit for a friend. These particular persons are a minority.I quite liked Drew Barrymore's acting in this; but then again I hated Charlie's Angels and am always up for giving people a second chance. (Save Kate Bosworth)In short, the movie was well acted, well-cast (Particularly Gyllenhaal, whom I will always applaud) and is delightfully dark. However, like other delightfully dark items such as Black Forest Gateau, the thick veins of the movie are choked by a sour chocolate sauce. There are too many subplots. Now I love subplots, don't get me wrong; they are one of the three Messiahs of the film world (the others being Marty Feldman and Hitchcock) but here it is absolutely ridiculous. There is a jet, time travel, Christina Applegate (who is ridiculous enough by herself) a giant rabbit named Frank, the 80's for chrissake, and something about water coming out of people's chests which evaded me completely on the first viewing.   The whole thing is like a drunken trip round a disco first time round; you're supposed to take it with a pinch of salt and not really do anything. Don't think about it, and you'll be cynical. Do and you'll be lost.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An okay movie,"I heard and read so many good things about this movie, that perhaps my expectations were too high. David Lynch Mulholland Dr. it's not! It's a rather predictable story, not difficult at all to follow like so many reviewers have warned us, full of cliches (the redneck teacher versus the ""liberal"" one who gets fired by an unimaginative principal, you see the type...). It's basically a teenager movie, with teenage-style bubble gum philosophy. It is well filmed, has a nice atmosphere, but everything is telegraphed from the start. The characters development also suffers from a simplistic black and white view of the world. Not a waste of time, but not a great movie either. 6* out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Time is always coming back to point one. And a month later, when the ""The accident"" accurs again, time takes it course...I _STRONGLY_ recommend this movie, the soundtrack to this movie is also excellent.

Every High School Teacher Should See This,"Drew Barrymore's line is the best one of all. Kicked out of a provincial high school faculty because she dared make her students think, she says, ""We're losing them. We give them all this prescribed fecal matter and they get nothing."" She is fired by the dumb, bureaucratic principal so like every principal just about that I've ever had, out-IQ'd by every teacher in the school except for the aging cheerleaders masquerading as counselors.Our high schools are failing because they are undereducating our kids, avoiding anything controversial like the plague, forcing our kids to take meaningless tests that only test memory, not the ability to think. This kid is obviously both brilliant and disturbed. I couldn't help but think of the kids I know from Bedford, Ma. who might not have turned schizoid had he not done a few innocuous drugs that made him vulnerable to what he had probably inherited. Who knows? But those parents must have felt like these parents, intelligent and kind even if they were Republicans.Great movie, and Jake Guygendal with his eerie, evil smile is tops.Yes, I'll be seeing it again, and wonder why more wasn't made of it at the time, except that it might disturb our corporate masters who love the fact that we are an undereducated nation of peasants. ""Without an educated electorate this delicate experiment called 'democracy' is doomed to failure."" So said deTocqueville, and boy, was he ever right!!See it, think and demand more of your School Committee than they slavishly follow the dictates of whatever Town Clique is ruining/running YOUR town, as in Canton, Ma.

Pretty Darko,"Of the mainstream American movies I have seen in the past months, this is surely one of the most surprising.The nice suburban setting made me wary at first, expecting another of the countless exposes on the problems of people who have nothing to worry about except the excess of luxury.But pretty soon I got swept up in the mystery of this boy who is somehow doomed. The story is pretty thick and the music is outright annoying at times. Still, the acting is good. Especially the guy playing Donnie is terrific. I also liked the way the movie evades overt moralism and instead lets you judge for yourself. This is only partly true, but if you compare this film to 90% of other Hollywood teenage films (Life as a house stands out as a particularly ominous example), it certainly is refreshing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Anyway, Donnie is whomever you wish him to be--your secret self, your tortured adolescence, your unknowable friend, life in general. He wanders alone, finds out whatever he can about life alone, and dies alone. It is the predicament of all humans. What in the end is the meaning of anything? Things happen, we're pulled into them and left to decipher things later. Everyone gives an opinion about what 'we' have gone through or felt. We go from wondering if it is a god's will or fate to the simple fact that it is. God is just another explanation (rather a childish one) of what is. If we are honest, nobody from the afterlife has visited us and no beings who aren't there speak to us. We imagine these things at times, particularly if we are schizophrenic. It is still fun to see images on the screen coming as close to an understanding of things than anything else.

The world of a paranoid schizophrenic teenager who appears to be having insomnia along with nighttime and daytime hallucinations, but is he? Jake Gyllenhall makes this troubled teen into a likable character as soon as he smiles and opens his mouth to speak his first line. We don't know if he's really sick or just really brilliant as he seems to be when he answers his teachers question, and questions them in marvelous fashion.

"If we've done the passing, is the rite any use to us?","It's said that the most difficult word to translate from Spanish is 'duende'. In dictionaries it shows up as 'elf' or 'magic', however in actual practice the word doesn't mean the woodland spirit, but another kind of magic, the one that stirs the emotions.I'm coming really late to this teenage cult flick, I've done the passing so the rite itself is useless to me now, but the translation of the movie's duende is an interesting problem. Do we accept Donnie Darko's magic as an earnest expression of angst or do we bemoan how unsophisticated it is, perhaps the angst itself, that a young man gets to stand up and lecture the grownups?On one hand, it's the charming combination, the esoteric preamble into an apocalypse of the mind, the perverse parody of a white picket fence society, the youthful rhapsody for understanding and love. To the degree that Richard Kelly is trying to emulate the David Lynch film, I'm left at a distance, amused but not terribly interested by these easy contrasts and the stretch for eccentricity, by the perversion of the moral right or authority.What I appreciate here, like in Gummo or earlier in Godard's Breathless, is the youthful expression, that a young director gets to make a film to tell us what it means to be young, that these feelings are not addressed after the fact. As with the Harmony Korine film, I find the nihilism to be as much a fashion statement as a political expression of disenchantment, and when Richard Kelly speaks of life and death, it's coming from the pretentious point of view of adolescence. Trivial problems overblown, magnified, ruminations from the safe distance of youth. But it's exactly that distance that makes them possible, even gives them a bit of charm.But I also sense a yearning for the presence of a god, plan or meaning in the macrocosm, airheaded perhaps but genuine. I think the tolerance or affection an adult viewer can foster for a film like Donnie Darko, or Gummo indeed, boils down to whether or not we recognize that the young can ask the same questions even from a naive viewpoint, whether or not they can attempt to feel the spectrum of emotion within their limited experience of the world.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Donnie Darko is an unusual film with very loose plot,great editing and music.","Donnie Darko is an unusual film with very loose plot, cheap character development, and sci-fi, phantasmagoric occurrences to hold it together. The visuals are great, the music tightly integrated, and the rather contrived plot twists are enjoyable. It is so well edited that I kept looking for more profound insights or meaning, but they never arrived. Several profound concepts are never satisfactorily explored, and the film rests on undeveloped cliché characters.

There could easily have been more actual depth rather then just the pretension of such.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Modern Catcher In The Rye?,"Donnie Darko is the type of movie that should stand alone without comparisons or genres, quite simply because it's a genre bending movie. Donnie Darko pays homage to everything from theories of time travel to the coming of age struggle that has earned it titles from a Modern Catcher In The Rye to the definitive coming of age movie.The movie finds the title character Donnie trapped in suburbia, where his intense questions and huge intellect are less than welcome. While the movie does have a large section of sci-fi and thrilling plot twists, the viewer cannot ignore the poignant first love of Donnie and Gretchen, and the more personal struggles Donnie has to overcome in order to face his demons (including the giant bunny rabbit Frank).If you're looking for a movie that you can glide through, Donnie Darko is not the movie for you. It's thought provoking, an attack on the mind. Donnie Darko covers such a large scope of genres from teen romance to saving the world to atheism. Donnie Darko is a movie of questions, made to raise questions.It may be lost on an older generation, but in my experience it is a movie that appeals to the lost teen to the mature adult.

Donnie,"Fascinating as it opens and develops, ""Donnie Darko"" works as an effective study of a section of the young's inadequacy in crucial years of self-search, while it entertains us with time travel folklore, Psychology 101 and paranormal occurrences. With all this information added, the film moves to a satisfactory surprise ending, but it leaves situations (the never-fulfilled descent into the cellar) and references without explanation (the allusions to Frank during the party), a few characters go to limbo (like the Chinese-American girl, Cherita Chen) while others are simply wasted (the professors Pomeroy and Monnitoff, played by Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle, or Grandma Death, a nun turned into a sort of Stephen Hawking.)

28 Days... six hours... 42 minutes... 12 seconds,"Donnie Darko, a film set in angst-ridden suburbia gives a village almost like an 80's Stepford but with secrets, is one that leads you to question all conventions and boundaries set by films at this moment. As always, the change comes from an unknown, Richard Kelly who wrote and directed, with some minor parts in the editing and camera work suite too.The film itself, throws up questions, mainly existential theories such as everybody dies alone, but never actually answers any. Many would see this as a downfall to a film, but when done outside of the typical Hollywood formulaic style it works amazingly well. It throws you a resolution that doesn't give a full equilibrium, it more leaves you confused as to what went on, and leaves you wanting to know even more about this film.Jake Gyllenhaal makes a big statement about his abilities in this film, taking the seemingly 'super hero' named character of which the film is named. An ever so slightly sociopathic schizophrenic with a tendency to sleep walk. Gyllenhaal manages to take on such a crazed, scared yet unfearful character with aplomb without dropping anything about the subconscious of Donnie himself.The plot comes as hard thinking as they come. It normally lose everyone on the first watch, and the second too. It gives everyone the sense of loss of mind and sends you home re-thinking every minute detail over and over, drawing you away from the bigger picture which itself gives away all the imagery you need to see to figure the plot is not actually that testing, just a science fiction film set in an all too familiar suburban town.

If you are a fan of his movies, this one is definitely one of his best. Director Richard Kelly is not a very famous director, but he proves in this movie that he has great potential in a film career. He made the movie flow very well and with the release of 'Donnie Darko: The Directors Cut' makes the movie very easy to follow.

"You will be disappointed, I promise you.","A friend, whose judgement I normally value, recommended this to me as a 'must see'.  Set in 1988, Donnie Darko is the tale of a troubled American High School Student (yes, yet another one). After 40 minutes of this I was still waiting to be grabbed like my friend was. And here's the rub - you won't be grabbed, believe me. The true test for any piece of fiction is that you care about the characters, or, at the very least, care enough to find out what happens to them. Be honest folks, did you really care about what Donnie's problem was? Of course not. He was a bland, unsympathetic cipher. A lot has been said of the performance by the lead, but I've seen Keanu Reeves turn in more heartfelt and engaging performances. The writer/director has obviously stuck by his 'Youth Films 101' coursebook to a T. There is one excrucitating tacked-on scene where Donnie and his mates discuss the deeper significance of 'The Smurfs'. The director clearly liked Tarantino's deconstruction of 'Like A Virgin' in Reservoir Dogs and has attempted a weak copy himself. NO ONE ever had that conversation (and certainly not teenagers in 1988) and to pretend otherwise is just smug revisionism. There is another scene where, to the strains of 'Head Over Heels' by Tears For Fears, the world goes into slow motion. The viewer expects something to happen. Like the rest of the film, nothing does. Drew Barymore and Patrick Swayze play minor parts. Why? Who knows: they certainly brought nothing special to the table. Set in 1988, the 'special' effects mimic the era also. Strange, translucent 'watery' worms emerge from people (think 'The Abyss'). And what does it all mean? Should you last till the end, you will be very, very disappointed. Chronicle of a death foretold - how original. Don't believe what the 'respected' critics have said about Donnie Darko.

Here's a film that fuks with your brain!,"Donnie Darko (2001) :
Brief Review -Here's a film that fuks with your brain! If you find words like dream, time travel, paranoid schizophrenia, daylight hallucinations, vortex, portal, ghost, psychological trauma, and so on, then Donnie Darko is your classic movie experience. It's a fascinating, mind-bending, brain-twisting, and absolutely nerve-wracking experience. James Stewart saw an invisible rabbit in Henry Koster's classic comedy-drama, Harvey (1950), and you'll see a similar rabbit in Donnie Darko. Harvey was about goodwill, kindness, and light, whereas Donnie Darko is about evil, hatred, and darkness. The rabbit has an evil look and forces Donnie to commit vicious acts. Donnie sees Frank (the bunny rabbit) in hallucinations, who tells him that the world is going to end in 28 days. In these 28 days, Donnie does many wrong things commanded by Frank and becomes a ""whacko."" ""How does it feel to have a whacko as a son?"" he asks his mother, and she replies, ""It feels wonderful,"" with tears in her eyes. This is the only emotional layer you see in the film, while the rest of the layers are exactly the opposite. The ""Roberta Sparrow"" angle is quite intriguing too. Just imagine seeing an insane woman wandering outside her house, having no sense of the car accident that once killed a science professor. That tells you about the consequences Donnie might face in the future. However, the climax has a different meaning and results. It shatters you to some extent as the curiosity for the end reaches its peak as a viewer, and then you see a solid ending that destroys the entire structure of the confusing plot within a minute. That's how it's done for psychological thrillers, I believe. That's exactly what ""The Sixth Sense"" did, but Donnie Darko is too clever, conversational, and disturbing in itself. The girlfriend's angle did not work for me. The girl has lost her mother and she comes to BF's house to have sex, leaving the house all smiling. Seriously? Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role and Richard Kelly as a director have done excellent jobs. Kudos!RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

So glad I watched this.,"With well over 1600 other reviews here at IMDb, I'll be surprised if mine ever gets seen! Oh well, this is a great movie, and I want to write a review.I saw this movie for the first time 6 days ago on IFC, a Canadian movie channel. I was utterly fascinated by it by the ten minute mark. I couldn't stop watching. By the end of the movie, I had grasped the basic concept (time travel, saving the world, sacrifice for love...), but was utterly confused, but in a good way. I watched it again the next day, and though still not grasping every concept, liked it even more.At this time I decided to purchase the directors cut and watch that version. Well, it certainly cleared up a lot via the extra scenes and the commentary track (that's 4 viewings now in 6 days!) and I'm glad I saw it, but I liked the theatrical cut better. More mystery made for better viewing.The acting was topnotch, and the dialog was fantastic. The conversation about emotional problems was my personal favorite scene. The music suited this flick wonderfully also.Although I still don't understand the role of Cherita Chen in the movie (it's almost like she's the embodiment of the primary universe...far-fetched and wrong I'm sure, but that's the best I can come up with) and the role of the man in the red jogging suit. All the theories I've heard about this guy just don't add up to me, and I can't figure out the point of this character at all.As a word of advice, seek out this movie, but only watch the directors cut if you want clarity, the theatrical cut is better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Thought provoking, thought not hard to figure out","First off, I should say that I'm not sure if I watched the Director's Cut or the original version. I downloaded it not long ago, and the file didn't specify which version it was. Anyway, on with the review. I really didn't know what to expect from this movie, having heard many different opinions over the last little while. After watching it, I'm still not sure what I thought of it. While I didn't like his character very much, it's hard to deny that Jake Gyllenhaal gave a very good performance as the title character. Something about him just seemed out of place and strange, which suited the character well. I don't think there was a single likable character in this film, except maybe Donnies girlfriend. I don't see what everyone finds so hard to get about the ending, I thought it was a good ending, don't get me wrong, but pretty straight forward.

The film that cant be described,"U know i have seen many films but this film is far from the ordinary. It even is far away from the unordinary. Every element of the film tackles a different genre. Romance, Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller black comedy. but i think it can be summed up in one word. LIFE. The film is unpredictable and ultimatly backwards. It deals with fate time the paths people lead the expiriances we have and death. It is an extreme form but how can it not be a film about life.Simply watchable, simply funny, simply complex.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the Greatest Films of My Generation,"A troubled teenager (Jake Gyllenhaal) is plagued by visions of a large bunny rabbit that manipulates him to commit a series of crimes, after narrowly escaping a bizarre accident.Having graduated high school in 1999, I was very much a product of the 1990s. And being into the industrial music scene, I saw the 90s as a decade consumed with nihilistic imagery, both with films and music. Friedrich Nietzsche was back in a big way, for better or worse (probably worse, since he is so misunderstood by people).""Donnie Darko"" missed the 1990s, but I think many people may age saw it as the film that capped their experience of adolescence. The film is quite nihilistic (in the most uplifting way) and even has James Duval in a minor (but important) role. Duval was well-known to those of us who gravitated to the films of Gregg Araki.Before we had ""Lost"", this was the film that sparked amateur philosophy debates. We were not quoting Locke or Descartes, but we were wondering what it all meant, what was the deeper meaning, is time travel really possible... it all seemed so profound. Looking back now (in 2013 at age 32), I cannot help but wonder how much of this was youthful eyes and mind, and how much was really in the film... but I did find myself captivated watching it (yet) again, many years since the days when it was on constant rewind.Richard Kelly was supposed to be the next big thing after this film came out. As near as I can tell, that never happened. ""Southland Tales"" never really took off. And then ""The Box""... a film that wants to be deep, but probably is not. Many of the Darko devotees (myself included) wanted there to be something in the story, something beyond the original version, but it all seems so convoluted.Anyway, ""Donnie Darko"" remains a classic of modern independent cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"'...and I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad' (Mad World)","Richard Kelly's flawed but utterly promising debut is one of the best things that could happen to post 2000 cinema. In fact, I use the word 'flawed' with caution because it isn't the most appropriate term to describe the slight imperfections featuring in Donnie Darko. It feels a little like Kelly wants to add too many ingenious elements and gimmicks and the screenplay often is a little messy. Nevertheless, it's a project that breathes its own personal atmosphere and the creativity nearly drips from the screen. What makes this film so unique and fresh is the half-apocalyptic, half depressing tone. We're welcomed in a bitter 80's setting and meet Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) who's living in a socially strict suburban town called Middlesex. Donnie is a not-so typical teenager who suffers from severe hallucinations and bizarre states of mind. It even gets worse when he has a near death experience, as he starts spotting a giant ugly bunny that tells him the world is coming to an end. What follows is a blend of almost-brilliant sequences, an outstanding 80's soundtrack and slightly too many digital effects. That's not a bad thing, though, because you especially remember the good sequences like Donnie rebelling against his superficial teachers and hilarious Smurf-speeches. Jake Gyllenhaal is great and there are sublime supporting roles for Mary McDowell, Patrick Swayze and Holmes Osborne (he's the coolest father one could have). Special mention goes out to the gorgeous Maggie Gyllenhaal in her (too small) role of Donnie's sister Elizabeth. Richard Kelly has talent. That's not an opinion, that's a fact and even those who dislike this film should reckon this. Just look at how he pans the camera over the high school playground while 'Head over Heals' by Tears for Fears is playing. That's pure class!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Donnie Darko,"Donnie Darko is the psychological thriller directed by Richard Kelly it is a story of Donnie who has visions of an evil rabbit possesing him and making him commit acts of violence and predicts the end of the world. ""Drew Barrymore"" and ""Patrick Swayze"" have smaller roles in the film along with Jake's mother Maggie Gyllenhaal.Donnie Darko was something that had always grabbed my attention but I had never decided to pick up at the store, but I'm glad I did. It was a very moving and powerful yet strange and sadistic movie, it is unlike anything I have ever seen, I rate it at the highest of levels for its acting and originality. Obviously it isn't to be taken serious as it is fiction but Jake Gyllenhaal does a very real and psychotic performance he just keeps getting better and better, pick this movie up when your at the store you won't regret it!",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This movie is basically a waste,"This movie came highly recommended to me and now I'm questioning their judgement of movies.  Maybe I have spoiled myself by watching great films such as Waking Life, Barton Fink, O Brother Where Art Thou, The Legend of 1900, Amelie, Illuminata, The Red Violin, etc.  Those movies all had the three important aspects going for them:  a good story, a good ending, and a good purpose.Donnie Darko comes out at you with a character that is mentally disturbed. For those of you not familiar with characters that are a little strange, Donnie Darko's character might seem like a breakthrough to you.  You people have been watching too many ""Oscar caliber films""!  Donnie Darko is not a good story.  It is a bunch of random events that leave little character building for anybody but Donnie and oddly enough, the bunny.  If you think about it, you could have come up with a bunch of random events involving a mentally disturbed character and come up with a movie similar to Donnie Darko in about a week, tops.  Stop and think about the different emotions that any character besides Donnie's showed if you have seen this film.  If you haven't seen the film, just watch for any character change at all, this will probably entertain you through the boring parts, I guess I should just say the movie.Donnie Darko has a horrible ending.  Think about the ending for a second.  I don't think Donnie does anything in the ending himself.  Also, the ending should repeat over and over again with different endings given the story line we are given.  Just think about it for a second.  People who haven't seen it, get ready for a pretty bad ending.   Donnie Darko has no purpose. Well, I guess maybe that's a lie, it does have a purpose.  I've never been a big fan of movies that are out just to be weird and get people names in the business.  Seriously, what else could have been the purpose?  The whole moving point behind the movie is based on a premise that cannot exist.  I won't say anything more because I don't want to spoil the film for people. Even though the film is bad, Donnie's actor turns in a wonderful job and the other characters do their best to the script's ability.  Check this film out, but your not going to like it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Great movie, i'd recomend it for people around the age of 15.","I have seen many different comments on the film. And there is the people who say its one of the worst movies they have ever seen in there lives. In addition, some who say it's the best or close to it. I personally think that the people who find this movie a bad movie have no understanding of what the movie is about. It seems like people almost haven't seen the movie. I have to admit it took me a few times of watching it again to get it. But then again you need to wonder about the movie and what it means to want to watch it a second time. For the people who didn't understand the movie and didn't watch it again for the second time around. I recommend you do watch it again and just sit there to try to fully understand the true meaning of the film. If  you don't get it then I guess your too far off or just to stupid to understand what the film is about and how rare it is to find a movie of such great work. I personally have never seen a film that could make you wonder, what does this all mean. I mean really what kind of film does that to people anymore. I am really awaiting Kelly's next film. It looks just as good, I believe its titled ""Knowing"" it looks quite interesting. This man is a Genius for being able to write something of such wondering and at such a concept few will understand. This film, If not already, should be a cult classic. Another thing to add on. I may be only 15 years old and I might not be getting the full understanding of this movie. But From what I think Its a great movie and for the people who have only given it once chance, you should really take another chance at it and watch it over.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Theories on why it became cult,"For some reason, it wasn't as good as I remembered although it does have its strong qualities. I think it became cult because of 3 of those in particular: the memorable confusing ending, the great eighties soundtrack and the central character who's a dark (;), troubled and rebellious teen. I should also say that the overall mysterious tone and ""impending doom"" atmosphere helps a lot in its appeal. When that weird surreal guy in a rabbit suit with the freaky mask tells Donnie the world will end in 28 days at the very start of the movie, you want to know what will happen and the plot slowly builds up on the suspense while being clever enough to make you doubt Donnie's grip on reality. I quite enjoyed the jabs on American conservatism. Jake Gyllenhaal did very well portraying the awkwardness and ambiguity of Donnie. The secondary characters were all very good and you wish there was more with them (probably in the Director's cut which I haven't seen). It's definitely worth watching for fans of teen or quirky movies.Rating: 7.5 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Psychological Masterpiece,"Though I think Donnie Darko is the best movie ever, its not for everyone. I'm not quite sure what it is about this movie but half the people who watch this movie either completely love this movie or they completely hate it. Of course the people who don't like science fiction and horror movies won't like this movie.The main plot of this film is a very different one indeed. A high School student that suffers from emotional problems under goes strange events of seeing a 6 foot tall Bunny Rabbit at night. This bunny rabbit had woke him up late at night, and told Donnie to come to him. After Donnie reaches the rabbit at a golf course, the rabbit tells Donnie the world will come to a end in 28 days. Donnie then wakes up at the golf course and hurries home finding that a jet engine has fell from the sky and landed in his room. Through out the film Donnie must realize his dark destiny, under go high school, and life as we know it. This film is truly a masterpiece containing mixed genres such as science fiction, drama, romance, mystery, and much much more.After I saw this movie I went to the store and bought it right away. I then showed it to my cousin Joey, he loved the movie and it became one of his favorite movies. I showed it to my friend Nathan and he didn't see the point of the movie and called it retarded.So honest to god truth, there's no way to know if you will like this movie or not. Some people see this movie and it makes them feel good inside and reminds them about life in general but they don't understand the movie itself. Its a very hard thing to explain but when I see this movie I get this feeling. But some people will watch this movie and call it the most ridiculous movie ever. So all I can say is to watch this movie yourself and see if you see this movie the same way I do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Gutsy and brilliant,"It takes a lot of guts to purposefully make a movie that makes no sense, especially if it's meant to be serious. But strangely, ""Donnie Darko"" works because it hints at so many things, which are explained with just enough information, that it's always captivating.Donnie Darko (a terrific Jake Gyllenhall) is an already troubled kid when the movie starts. But when a mysterious bunny rabbit draws him away from his house, thus saving him from a fatal accident, the real story starts.Apart from what Iv'e said before, there are two things that are really surprising about this movie: how professional it looks, and the star power it has. According to the IMDb trivia, ""Donnie Darko"" had a 5 million dollar budget. But this film looks as professional as any other film that's released with a budget fifty times that. That's especially interesting considering the star power it has. Either Richard Kelly was very good at selling his script, or all the actors immediately got everything just by reading it (which I would have thought impossible because a lot of the stuff that happens is very visual). I guess it also helps that Drew Barrymore is an executive producer. Whatever it is, it worked, and the movie is all the better for it.This is a love it or hate it movie. If you don't like to think when you watch movies, you'd probably be better off staying away from this one. You're not ""invited"" to think during this movie, thinking is pretty much a necessity. It's that complex. But for those who are willing to give this a try, the experience is well worth your time and money.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A different angle: Frank is an evil one, sort of Bob from the Twin Peaks!","Donnie Darko is my Top 3 movie of all time. It is similar in its impact to the Mothman Prophecies with its dark optimism, but way bigger.I haven't read The Philosophy of Time Travel yet, but saw vague allusions to Twin Peaks, and came up with a different approach to the plot. The idea of ""corrupted"" Universe being ""fixed"" by Frank through weird acts has its grounds, but after all black holes and E-R wormholes are permanent phenomena and don't necessarily imply on ""corruption"" of the (infinite) Universe. These portals simply exist, and some beings can make use of them.I think Frank on one side is a thoughtful serial killer who enjoys his supernatural powers and plays with people and their dreams the way he wishes, spies after them, push them to death and even kill some here and there. On the other side he's a young guy that has a name and even a girlfriend (his cover).Franks says, his male ancestors were named Frank, and judging by Ed Darko's comments on a bed in the hotel, a guy named Frankie died on his way to a teenage party in days of D's parents' youth (strange coincidence!). So it is probable that Frank's clan has always been doomed to die of young age (early 20s, it seems). Knowing this, F might have tried to cheat his own future too or maybe even was a multi-dimensional thrill ride freak (like in ""Retroactive"")! I might be wrong, but Frank looks a bit like a native Indian to me, which only adds to ""the other reality"" spice, ensuing typical means of interacting with it (hinting on Don Castaneda and Indian magic and all that there is in altered states).Suppose Frank is a being similar to Bob from Twin Peaks. Is F a good guy? Over the course of the movie I couldn't find any proof to that. He's got some Master Plan of his own, and only the events and end results reveal his real nature: a spider playing with a fly. Franks is an ESP being that sees the world in 4D, and he lives in both realities and is also capable of reading other people's minds and affecting them through their dreams. That is he exists in many realities and it's even hard to say which one is real. I'd even call him an eternal being that sheds his skin and cheats his fate or plays games with it. He is also capable of sharing his enormous powers by inducing those in his preys as well (Donnie's power to be invisible, drive an ax deep inside solid bronze sculpture etc.).The movie more or less delivers 3 ""time loops"". Loop 1 ends in the episode with the plane engine fall in Donnie's room. Loop 2 can be called ""Frank playing the cat-and-mouse game with Donnie""  finalizing with death of G & F (and possibly Gretchen's mother + Rose, Samantha and those on the plane, too). Loop 3 realizes Frank's plan with eventual death of D from the loop 1 engine. In the end we see F still alive (sitting on the floor touching his right eye as if to check that this time it's there  so he's won, the game's over). G is also alive.If Frank would have wanted to save D (and D believed he would), he'd have done it. No matter how you turn it, the cause of all Donnie's troubles in loop 2 is Frank. That's why the theory that he's a serial killer in a rabbit's suit (or the one trying to escape his own death in loop 2) appears plausible to me.D is not sick, he's pretty sane and is much smarter than most of his peers, but he's affected by F most of the time. The treatment he gets is water placebos and useless talks with his shrink. I can easily suggest that Frank KNEW that in one of the possible realities (universes) Donnie would kill him after death of Gretchen. And F could manipulate/ foresee the events, let's not forget that. When D+G were happily sitting in the movie, the Manipulated Dead Frank (with the already smashed eyeball  which he kept hidden behind the rabbit mask from the very start) asked D to forgive him (""I'm so sorry""  for killing G!) and soon D FELT (thanks to his superpowers) that F was ""going to kill"" someone (hypnotherapy episode  but he didn't know WHO the prey would be).Now what if F enjoyed using his superpowers and simply played with objects and people as a crazy juggler? What if he was an evil being who simply drove others to craziness or death? He had known beforehand that in THIS reality he'd eventually get killed by D after hardly unintentional (F could see the future!) killing G! He didn't want to end up like his ancestors and he started playing that fishy game. He played ""saving"" D and the Universe on one hand only to reverse the situation and kill G & D. It slightly resembles of Bradbury's ""A Sound of Thunder"" (doomed to die T-Rexes are hunted on by thrill-loving guys from the future). And if we weigh positive and negative end results, the bad outweighs.Re. R.Sparrow. She's gone through some experiences of 4D nature (as a heavily praying nun she might have found herself in an altered state or gained the ESP abilities. She simply KNEW about the parallel universe(s) and saw things and tried to explain them, but couldn't change/ affect things or people, it seems. And ended up in seclusion and mental disability with the only thought that someone would send her a letter (clairvoyance). Again, if she'd be sane or as powerful as F, she'd somehow save G and D (and don't forget: she after all caused F make a turn resulting in killing G!).",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
So close to getting the whole picture yet so far away,"A great film. After seeing it for the first time I spent about 3 hours surfing the reviews and the fun sites. I had not visited the official site before seeing the movie, so that was where I first went. It answered most of my questions but created more. I suggest to anyone that might suffer from Darkitis to do the same.I particularly enjoyed the films reference to ancient Greek Drama, which is the mother of all spectacles. In the scene where Donnie is being held down at knife-point, he uttered the phrase ""deux ex machina"". I think such a twisting plot could only be resolved artificially.I hope there will be more work of that level from Richard Kelly once he goes into bigger budgets. He could even do a sequel on one of the so many subplots that are in this movie. Maybe he tried to include too many stuff in it though, thus, causing confusion rather than interest to the viewer.Regards",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Jet Engine Question,I have read in many comments on this site that the whole idea of the movie is that Donnie has to send the artifact(the jet engine) back through the portal from the tangent world because having 2 identical artifacts in the tangent universe was making it unstable and going to cause the world to end. If so surely at the end of the movie when Donnie is in bed laughing in the real world and the engine comes through the roof and kills him there are now two identical artifacts(jet engines) in the real world now i.e. the one in his bedroom that came through the portal and the one on the plane somewhere else in the real world??

But I also can understand negative comments towards this film here. Why?

"What's Up, Doc?","This is ""an edgy, psychological thriller about a suburban teen coming face-to-face with his dark destiny,"" according to the promotional verbiage for the film, starring Jake Gyllenhaal as ""a delusional high school student visited by a demonic rabbit with eerie visions of the past and deadly predictions for the future."" This description hardly scratches the surface of ""Donnie Darko"". While watching the film, to enjoy a quirky, satisfying thriller, you may get the impression may be watching something more meaningful. You are. Repeated viewings (recommended) will reveal completely different films. Writer/director Richard Kelly creates more than a movie monster.""Donnie Darko"" is an multi-layered, inspirational, and beautifully produced work. Most obviously, it is superbly written and directed. Mr. Kelly, who really pulls a rabbit out of his hat, should have received an ""Academy Award"", along with several members of his crew; perhaps, the film's more ""independent"" status was an obstacle. The cast is exceptional, from Mr. Gyllenhaal's central role, to the many supporting characterizations, right down to the smallest players. This film is full of memorable characters, arriving on the screen for a variety of reasons, and for various lengths of time, to serve a defined purpose. They're all jewels.The film is set in Middlesex, Suburbia, during 1988. Forget April, for the Darko family, October is the cruelest month. Gyllenhaal is a kid held back in high school, for burning down a house. Presently, Gyllenhaal is a disturbed sleepwalker, who is not taking his medication; perhaps, intuitively, he knows it wouldn't make any difference. Gyllenhaal lives with mother Mary McDonnell (as Rose Darko), father Holmes Osborne (as Eddie Darko), big sister Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Elizabeth Darko), and little sister Daveigh Chase (as Samantha Darko). They're all jewels.As with the entire cast, it's difficult to single out one Darko family performance. Gyllenhaal never disappoints. Secondarily, Ms. McDonnell's may be the best, due to Kelly's skillful writing. Motherly love, for a son who seems to be drifting into madness, is wondrous; the delicacy of McDonnell's performance is perfectly suited to Gyllenhaal's fragility. Even Ms. Chase, who you'd expect to be the minor Darko, is magical; she even writes about ""The Last Unicorn"", Ariel (before he died in the possession of Count Petofi).The characters who exist outside the Darko family are as important. Many of them are teachers. At school, Drew Barrymore (as Karen Pomeroy) covers English literature in spectacular fashion; she challenges students' critical thinking skills, and gives Gyllenhaal guidance. As one of the film's producers, Ms. Barrymore's the most valuable member of the faculty lounge. Beth Grant (as Kitty Farmer) displays a limitless ability to multitask. Noah Wyle (as Kenneth Monnitoff) lurks in the science department, and helps Gyllenhaal consider slipping into time. Moreover, he reveals the truth about Patience Cleveland (as ""Grandma Death"" aka Roberta Sparrow), who whispers:""Every living creature on Earth dies alone.""Among the students, new girl in school Jena Malone (as Gretchen Ross) provides Gyllenhaal with love interest; and, with a dark past of her own, she's a natural. Katharine Ross (as Lilian Thurman) is a dignified and memorable hypno-therapist. Patrick Swayze (as Jim Cunningham) plays the self-help guru with a convenient focus, ""Controlling Fear"". Even small parts shine, like Jolene Purdy (as Cherita Chen). And, imaginary friend James Duval (as Frank) belongs in a very special class (note, he is not actually related to the addiction-signaling ""Harvey"").Finally, the soundtrack, including original music by Michael Andrews, has to be one of the best assembled for a motion picture. From ""The Killing Moon"" (by Echo and the Bunnymen) to the new ""Mad World"" (by Gary Jules), the mood is always finely tuned.Look up. Plane to catch.

"Dark, multi-layered, thought-provoking, but also vulgar in delivery","Donnie Darko was a mix of horror, sci-fi, and even had a little dark humour. It leaves many questions unanswered by the time the credits roll and encourages multiple rewatches- which is probably why I find myself coming back from time to time. This is my third rewatch and I still haven't decided on a meaning for the film, and can't nail down an explanation of what is happening. I think that is what makes a film a cult classic; there are many ways to look at it. It is certainly a very complex plot and takes some pondering to understand- something I really love from films. The acting was great all round, everyone played their characters perfectly. This is a truly deep and multilayered attempt at storytelling, which can be interpreted there a variety of different perspectives. One challenges the notion of destruction and creation, another focuses on the sci-fi, another focuses on mental health, and then their's the message of teenage angst and distrust of a world fashioned by adults, and another even challenges religiously held notions of good and bad and sacrifice. That final one might trigger their religious amongst us, but I felt it worth viewing the skilful execution of storytelling regardless, maybe not introducing it to the kids until they're much older.However, I feel the storytelling was somewhat marred by the vulgarity of some of the discussions between the boys and their obnoxious behaviours toward others. In fact there is a lot of cussing all throughout the movie. It wasn't necessary to have a lengthy discussion about their desire for smurf-like girls for example, and I don't understand the artistic value in a character hoping a girl gets ""molested"". The boys of Middlesex are completely unlikable, unrealistically so... Or maybe that's just how 80s kids were in suburban America?The blu-ray I have from Arrow is packed with special features and the video quality looked great on a 75 inch TV. It came with the Director's cut I watched and the Theatrical cut tool. I spent a lot of time going through the extra content after the movie finished to try and get a grip on what I had seen, but instead I was pleasantly surprised to find a good amount of content on the sub-culture surrounding the movie- numerous fans giving their take on the inspiring movie. Interviews from the cast were short and added insight to their characters. This set was definitely worth the price.All that said, there is something about Donnie Darko that I find myself repeatedly going back to, but can't quite put my finger on it. Perhaps that was the director's ambition all along, and for this reason I will be keeping the film for a later rewatch - away from the kids.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

My main problem I suppose is how they present the space time continuem.  I have read about this in a couple college courses and have a friend who is a physicist.  This movie presents is falsely.

"An excellent blend of Sci-Fi, Drama and Mystery","I bought this movie on DVD like 2 months before I watched it. The reason why I didn't watch it was that I was expecting one of the most disturbing films ever, so I never wasn't really ""in the mood"" so to speak. I wanted to see it, but it seemed like there never wasn't time for a movie like it. So one day I decided ""What the heck? I have to see it in some point anyways.."" so I watched it with my brother and friend. Looking at the trailers, the reviews, the plot outlines and everything it had to be sick, right? Well, the disturbance level wasn't even near the level I personally was expecting. Honestly, it isn't even disturbing apart from a couple of scenes.The movie tells about what the title says, a teenager named Donnie Darko. Donnie may seem like an ordinary American guy, who lives with his family in a sleepy suburb. Nothing could be farther away from the truth; 18-year old Donnie has a large bunny rabbit named Frank as his imaginary friend, who inspires Donnie to do things which seem to be unreasonable. Frank saves Donnie's life when a huge aeroplane's engine falls in middle of the boy's room. Donnie ""investigates"" the bizarre accident and finds out unbelievable things that lets him to manipulate the streams of time and space. Donnie travels through daring and secret paths, he tries to understand the chaotic, raging universe around him and he finally sees the truth; Even the smallest acts can have serious consequences.The film itself is a great blend of science fiction, mystery and drama. It cleverly leaps between the real world and the imaginary world, and it does it with such a credibility that the viewer won't get lost in any part of the movie, it stays in a tight package throughout. The screenplay is fantastic, it doesn't bother you with any unnecessary or pointless subplots or scenes, it stays in the main theme all the time and the end solution is just brilliant. Through the vision of Richard Kelly, who has written and directed the film, ""Donnie Darko"" offers you an intensive and interesting movie experience, which can not be compared to any other films because it's also original and pretty unique in its own genre. Although the film is pretty dark and gloomy, it still doesn't affect you as much as you could imagine, as the story's just so interesting you'll get hooked to it and instead of thinking how dark the movie is you keep on thinking of the twists and turns, and how brilliant the movie itself is.Donnie is played by Jake Gyllenhaal who is outstanding in the role. Just like the leaping between the real world and the imaginary world in the story, also the character itself changes between these leaps which makes it pretty enjoyable to watch because of Gyllenhaal's strength on the screen. The character progresses really well too, as when we start off the movie the character is totally different in both of the ""worlds"" but as we move along the character crafts into a person who's surprisingly similar in the real world and the imaginary one. There are good actors in other roles too, for example Maggie Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Katharine Ross, but they are left out in minor roles as the film concentrates on Donnie after all. These characters of the supporting actors do not have that depth like the main character does, but their purpose is in fact more like complimenting the character of Donnie, which is also pretty genius. Soundtrack is also marvellous; The music's composed by Michael Andrews and like the movie itself the music also mixes between soft and dark pieces of fine compositions. It's sometimes beautiful and it's sometimes really dark like the main theme, which works really well with the build-up of the film.""Donnie Darko"" is definitely one to watch, but only if you're open minded with films or if you just happen to be a sci-fi addict. If you're expecting heavy disturbance like I was don't be fooled, as even when you get something disturbing it isn't nearly as disturbing as you could imagine, so don't let the plot outlines or trailers fool you. To me ""Donnie Darko"" is all in all a great movie and at times it's pretty thrilling as well. It isn't sick or gross, it's a fine piece of film making which works really well in all of its styles, drama, mystery and sci-fi. Although it is a short film you should watch it when you really have the time for it, as it's just not one of those movies you can watch when ever you want to, it requires that certain mood which I was telling you about. Even when this is a movie which probably (and still) gets mixed opinions from really negative to really positive you should just see it yourself and make up your own mind. No-one's going to make it up for you anyways, so it's your decision.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Amazing!,"""Donnie Darko"" is one of those films you'd say to yourself, ""I'm not looking at that"" but because nothing else is on, you catch it. You'll think you know what's going on. You think you'll know what it's about. Don't pre-judge, just take a look. When you do, you'll kick yourself for not knowing about it sooner.This little film was done well. It is a smart film, I really liked the elements of it and the theme of it. Many reviewers said enough about this film so I wont add more story elements to it, all I will add to their wonderful reviews is for you to watch it, at least once.This is a film where the writer/director will go on to do either more great things and be a strong writer and/or director in this decade, or as a few others in his shoes prior did, get the old ""Hollywood Shaft"". I hope its the former and not the latter.I recommend this film highly. Go rent it, or catch it on Cable. You'll be glad you did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Donnie Darko: A Mind-Bending Trip Down the Rabbit Hole,"Strap in, cinephiles, because Donnie Darko isn't for the faint of heart. This 2001 cult classic throws you into a whirlwind of time travel, philosophical pondering, and teenage angst, all wrapped in a nostalgic 80s haze. It's a labyrinthine puzzle, sure, but for those willing to embrace the cryptic, it's a deeply rewarding trip down the rabbit hole.Jake Gyllenhaal shines as Donnie, a troubled teen haunted by visions, existential anxieties, and a talking rabbit named Frank (seriously, you haven't lived until you've seen a fluffy bunny spouting philosophical riddles). Gyllenhaal perfectly captures Donnie's vulnerability and intensity, making him a character you can't help but root for, even when he's caught in the throes of chaos.Director Richard Kelly crafts a masterfully woven narrative, seamlessly blending sci-fi elements with coming-of-age drama. Every frame is packed with symbolism, from the iconic jet engine to the burning house, each layer adding depth and intrigue to the mystery. And don't get me started on the soundtrack! 80s hits like Tears for Fears' ""Head Over Heels"" and Duran Duran's ""Planet Earth"" perfectly complement the film's emotional beats and amplify its melancholic beauty.But here's the catch: the ending. It's deliberately ambiguous, open to endless interpretations, and might leave you scratching your head and muttering ""what the...?"" While this open-endedness encourages discussion and contemplation, it can also be frustrating for viewers who crave closure. Plus, the pacing can be a bit uneven at times, with the non-linear narrative occasionally feeling like a jumbled puzzle box.So, who should dive into this cinematic enigma? Fans of mind-bending sci-fi, coming-of-age dramas with a philosophical twist, and anyone who enjoys a good cinematic brain teaser will find themselves right at home. But if you're looking for a straightforward story with clear answers and zero ambiguity, steer clear.Ultimately, Donnie Darko is a film that rewards multiple viewings. It's a challenging and thought-provoking experience, but one that also offers moments of genuine beauty and profound emotional resonance. For those willing to take the plunge, it's a film that will stay with you long after you've emerged, blinking in the sunlight, grappling with the echoes of its enigmatic questions about life, death, and the nature of reality.Rating: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"A dreamy, intriguing and paradoxical story","An intriguing, paradoxical and dreamlike movie about...well, that's the question. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a teenage boy who, one day, has a jet-engine drop onto his bed, seemingly from nowhere. We learn some things about Donnie...he is on medication...he sees weird things. Maybe the things he sees are the result of his medical condition, or the drugs he takes for it...or, what happens in the movie is real...could involve time travel and alternate planet Earths. The entire movie plays like a dream-which is to say it is dreamy. Some of it is a bit creepy and disturbing...so, this isn't really a movie for the kiddies.The main 'hook' of the movie is a countdown to some impending catastrophe which Donnie is trying to avert...every now and again text on the screen alerts us to the time remaining until something horrible will happen.Hopefully this description isn't too off-putting. There is humour in this movie and it is very poignant towards the end. I said before that the movie was paradoxical...which is to say that any movie dealing in this sort of subject matter will bang up against the same kind of wall. However, for me at least, I didn't let the paradoxes get in the way of appreciating this story. It probably doesn't really make sense, but you know what is being attempted and you are happy to play along with it. In any case, the movie does tie up neatly (sort of!) the issues it has been dealing with.Can't omit a truly wonderful sequence in this movie...when I saw this movie for the first time on SBS TV a couple of years ago, I think, I was reminded of what an all time classic song ""Head over heels"" by Tears For Fears was. That is one of the great 'pure' pop songs of all time. It is featured in this movie...brilliantly. The sequence is dreamy and a bit like a music video. Can't tell you how aesthetically pleasing it is (presumably it works better the more you like the song though!).Seth Rogen cameos in this film-his debut? Check out ""12 monkeys"" if you like this kind of territory. It too is dreamy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

And I find it kind of funny; I find it kind of sad...,"'Donnie Darko (2001)' is one of those movies that seems smarter than it is because it's purposefully oblique, vaguely hinting towards the mechanics of its pseudo sci-fi plot and loosely philosophic purpose. Its admirable ambiguity generates an enigmatic allure that allows you to come up with your own interpretation of its events and their meaning, and whatever you come up with is likely going to be more satisfying than what was initially intended. The internet's countless 'Donnie Darko Explained' articles and videos have naturally removed some of the movie's mystique in the years since its release, as has its own director's cut - which conveys writer-director Richard Kelly's original ambitions more explicitly and, by most accounts, clumsily. When you actually break down what happens in the film and why, it all gets a bit too silly for its own good. There's an intangible, metaphysical charm to a lot of the picture that's reduced drastically once you get into the minutia of its events, and very few of the actual nuts-and-bolts explanations measure up to those you concoct for yourself upon viewing the affair. Having said that, the ideas at play here are still fairly potent and they're well-executed across the board. Although (and I'm aware this point goes against what I said about the piece being at its most powerful when it isn't answering the questions it poses) the ending is a tad too ambiguous and is essentially so bizarre that it catches you off guard no matter how closely you've been paying attention, the rest of the picture has a palpably puzzling and peculiar vibe that's quite intoxicating in its own way. It conveys a genuine sense of loneliness, and is often quite sinister in its own subdued way. It's also rather funny on occasion, with a dryly dark sense of humour often based around suburban satire. There's quite a bit going on here, but for me the most successful stuff is the unconventional teen coming-of-age story at its centre. Amidst the ominous imaginary friends, portentous omens and strange science-fiction, there's a boy coming to terms with his place in the world and a community coming to terms with their place in his. Jake Gyllenhaal is notably good even this early in his career, and the supporting performances are equally as compelling. Mary McDonnell, in particular, puts in an understated yet fantastic effort; her brief scene in the psychologist's office stands out to me as one of the movie's most memorable moments thanks to her effortlessly emotive acting. Generally speaking, this is a confident and compelling effort that doesn't quite feel like anything else out there. It isn't great and some of the, I suppose, canonical explanations of its events are somewhat tiresome, but it's a strange and suitably obscure experience that's engaging and enjoyable throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

No doubt its entertaining, but it becomes hard to sit through.If you like films that are different, and films you have to have a reference book to completely understand its for you.

Great portrayal of schizophrenia...,"There are many ways to interpret Donnie Darko. Many seem to take this all very literally and it's SF/Fantasy film. Some find it pointless and too full of plot holes and things that can't be explained (the SF hardcore have explanations for these things...). To me, it is a view of what a functional psychologically challenged young man might see - and how everything is fits with his different internal logic and how beautiful that world can be. The non-standard associations that he makes are akin to what an artist (or for that matter, a good scientist) might make. This is really, really hard to do - most of the time it comes off as super-lame or at best forced art-house stuff but Donnie Darko brings it off and we are able to accept Donnie's magical world (props to Jake Gyllenhaal).Sort of a magic psycho-realism (if you -like - get what I'm trying to say man...).The hardcore SF people would probably say that is a cop-out explanation and normally I would agree - but not this time.

Donnie Darko,"Donnie Darko, a movie I've been wanting to watch for a while but haven't gotten to yet until today. I think this is one of those movies that you have to let sink in, and sleep over. Because it's incredibly engaging, and just takes you along this strange story. I went into this blind, and I'd recommend anyone else to do the same.Directing is solid, no real issues and some genuine moments of creativity. Perhaps some of the slo-mo moments where somewhat without purpose. And the fast-forward sections didn't always work. So a few misses with that but in general it's directed well and mostly the creativity is great. The editing makes the movie melt away and puts you in a flow that doesn't really end. Besides this, this seems like a movie that benefits from a second viewing, there are so many underlying notes, and visual things that go unnoticed (mostly) during first viewing.Acting is phenomenal, Gyllenhaal owns this and fits the characters perfectly, perfectly cast, and perfectly acted. Everyone else is good, some not so though, almost to a comedic aspect, that one bully, awful acting, but funny I guess. Writing is another strong point here, whilst the story keeps a lot of ambiguity, it is a intriguing one, and kept me engaged. It wraps up well too.Music is another great aspect, perfectly fitting.

"Disturbing and Unsettling, But for Certain Tastes, Exquisite","Even if you don't like ""Donnie Darko"" (and I'm sure there are many people who hate it, if they've ever even seen it), you're not likely to forget it quickly. This film lingers in the mind in a very unsettling way. It left me feeling creepy, and it's actually a fairly nihilistic film, but at the same time I was weirdly exhilarated by it, mostly because it's just so damn good.It's got an expert cast, including the Gyllenhaals (Jake and Maggie), both of whom are two of the best young actors currently working, Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze (yes, Patrick Swayze) and Jena Malone. All the actors are top-notch and make so much of their characters that they prevent the film from falling into too-quirky-for-its-own-good territory, a fate that befalls many ""independent"" films.

For those of us (and I include myself) who can never understand how, for example, religious people are so easily able to have a pat answer for everything that's complicated about the world in which we live, this movie gives us something to relate to. It doesn't provide answers, unfortunately, but there's something comforting about knowing other people out there are struggling with the same problems. Donnie almost can't live a functional life because of the anxiety caused by all of the unknowns about existence, and he sees the bland, self-help answers offered by so much of middle-class American society for what they are: shams to hide behind rather than to really help. He wants to be able to live without fear, without having to be convinced that there's a point to it all, but he can't, and watching him struggle with that is poignant and heart-breaking.This is a terrific film that deserves to be seen.

Must see,"Donnie Darko, is perhaps one of the better films that was released in the early 2000s. It centres on a troubled teenager in the midst of his latter college years. He is awakened by a mysterious character known as Frank (a 6ft bunny rabbit) who saves his life. Throughout the film, Frank tells Donnie he must do certain tasks in order to save humanity.I think, the beauty of this film is solely due to the underlying theme of religion combined with science, or science fiction. Whilst, the director has highlighted how troublesome high school can be for some people. It drops subtle religious hints throughout the film suggesting that Donnie could ultimately represent the saviour.Furthermore, although the directors knowledge of science may be all but perfect, watching the movie it is hardly noticeable. Watching the film for the first time I didn't rightly know where the ending was going, having given it some thought and reading up on the storyline it was encouraging to see how creative this movie really is.

Things start coming unglued as his time left on earth dwindles. This is a good film, but its imperfections really stand out.  Time travel has a big play in the film and it is hardly developedthis causes major confusion in the key scene of the movie.

Very good entertainment,"Completely delirious flick (something you could expect with a schizophrenic hero :)) that tackles more subjects than I thought possible without having the plot collapse under its own weight.Against all odds this little UFO of a movie does a pretty good job of it. It managed to move me from the first to the last scene. The director achieves a subtle balance of humor and seriousness, quietly unfolding the crazy plot without ever overdoing it. The movie is never patronizing or pretentious, as it could have been for the aesthetics of the pictures and deliberate obscurity of the script.Surely the surprisingly good performances from young and talented actors, very pleasant typically 80's soundtrack and ironic glance at the post-Reagan transition contributed to the effect of the already efficient mix of teen angst and sci-fi.That is certainly cult movie stuff. Well worth a try.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Good original Sci Fi flick, overrated, but still good.","The story is creative, its a super hero movie that you don't find out is a superhero movie until its over, and the use of time travel and world destruction is new as well. The pace is off, it feels much longer then it is, thats a problem, it makes it feel boring, even though it really isn't, it feels that way. I was expecting Donnie to do a lot more then he did, i was expecting more pranks and anarcistic deeds then what we got, we see him flood the school, burn a house, shoot someone, thats it, for entertainment value we should get some funny and shocking mischief. The performances were decent, no Oscar material, but tolerable. It has its moments, but overall, it could be a much better film, 6 out of a 10. I hope to see more films that kelly writes, but not directs, hopefully since Scott is directing Domino it will be a great movie with a great story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Eh,"This movie left me slightly conflicted on whether it was a well thought out depiction of mental illness and personality disorder, that forced you to question even your own sanity. Or if it was just another two hour long attempt at convincing you that a rich white guy is misunderstood or of some hallelujah, christ like importance.
But looking past my conflicting opinions, there were parts of the movie I really appreciated, like how I always felt like I was in the real world while watching the film. Which sounds ridiculous because the film was set in a version of the real world, but what I mean is, even though Donnie is portrayed as this time travelling, beyond human like being. He still feels like a real person as if he's someone I could pass on the street. So even with all of the absurd plots of the movie there will still aspects of his life that were normal like his relationship with Gretchen or for the most part, his average family dynamics. This was all there so we could still have this relatability to Donnie even as the rest of the story unveiledso in conclusion, I couldn't really decide if this was just a ridiculous film created for only the most pretentious of film critics. Or if it was the cinematic masterpiece of the early 2000's. But you know it didn't win an Oscar for a reason.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"confusing...if you like puzzles you can't solve see it,if you're practical person don't","I read about Donnie Darko on IMDb , saw high scores he got and rent it from a local DVD store . It was disappointing, for what I expected ,but had a nice dark atmosphere I really liked . I must compare it with Mulholland Drive. These kind of movies somehow get the high scores but don't make much sense.They raise a lot of questions , they seem to have some clues , but if you try to put all of the clues together you'll realize you're left in the dark.To be honest it seems like another of the Hollywood's ways to get more money...just by making something really really strange every few years. Additionally , watching the crew interviews , I got the feeling that even them , that were actually working with writer can't understand what's the movie about . The good things are acting and atmosphere . In my opinion all actors did good job with no exceptions.

An interesting movie about one' s self.,"It is unfortunate that this movie was a commercial disappointment. In Hollywood, the ""formula"" for a successful movie seems to be in making three times what is cost to produce that movie. ""Donnie Darko"" did not do it. This movie is an interesting interpretation about mental health / hygiene.Whether or not one appreciates the status of one's emotional stability is NOT important. This movie captures the essence for those unfortunate ones suffering these afflictions.Jake Gyllenahaal definitely gets to the emotional core of his character.

Promising director's debut,"Great characters and ideas, but it left me thinking something was missing plot wise to make this a great film.

A Puzzle missing the picture and several pieces,"I have to confess that I was not as ""into"" this movie as I'd hoped to be. As it was wrapping up, I kept looking at the timer on my DVD player to see how much longer it was going to continue. It was not that I did not enjoy myself, I did and my friend and I had an interesting discussion about it afterwards, but I just got really bored as the movie hit the home stretch. That final climax just didn't do much for me.I must warn viewers of the film that it is not an entire story. In order to understand the film you must read the book of time travel written by Kelly (on the film's website or included in the DVD special features) and read through a lot of the other stuff on the website in order to ""get it."" Sadly, after going through the rigamarole of watching the lengthy film and poring over the website/special features for a couple hours the given explanation still has flaws - big ones.Kelly has cited 12 Monkeys as inspiration for this film, but I feel like ""Blair Witch Project"" is a better model. He has created this snippet of a story (made it into a film) and then uses a webpage, interviews, etc. in order to finish telling the story. It is a shame really. This film is very close to being able to stand on its own. Kelly comes really close to pulling off a tremendous film, but falls tragically short.Of course, this is a film that should rank high on people's ""to see"" list, but I feel that its inclusion in the IMDB top 200 is a bit of an overstatement. Sure it has got great acting, a relatively well-established, though young, cast, good writing, an original plot and nice cinematography but it just does not have a plot that will hold up to numerous watchings. Here's a test to prove it: read that book that Kelly wrote and put on the dvd and website so that you understand how he explains the film, what is actually going on...he's rather explicit. Then watch the film again and see if what happens fits with the ""model"" he presents in the book. With some things it fits so seemlessly it is amazing. With others, Donnie's insanity (or lack thereof), Donnie's first experience with Frank, etc...you will notice that a great many things just do not gel.Sorry to burst people's bubbles, but once you know what Kelly's explanation was, you'll realize how it pales in comparison to all of the imaginative, exciting and complex scenarios that viewers have given to it. It is a good film, definitely top 75%, but as more people read what Kelly was doing in the film through his explanation, I think this movie will drop down to the realm of Boogie Nights and 7.5 land...that's not a bad place to be for a first-timer either. Looking forward to Kelly's future works...I'm sure I'll wait for them to hit DVD, but I'll definitely watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Mind-numbingly bizarre,"Have you ever been so confused by a movie you walk out of it still not really knowing what happened? For me, that is how I feel about the 2001 film Donnie Darko. At first I tried to solve the puzzles the filmmakers presented to us, but once the concept of time travel was introduced I knew I was never going to solve anything. Time travel is one of those things were if I think too hard about it I'll eventually go down the rabbit hole of no return. Now, I won't spoil the film as I feel you need to experience it in all of its mind-numbingly bizarre glory.The film has many different genres in play from science fiction to action to drama, but the most unique thing is that director Richard Kelly fits in a coming of age story along with everything else that is going on. The fact that this part of the movie works so well is in thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Donnie. He is genuinely creepy with his twisted smile, but the most impressive aspect is that he grounds the film in reality through his performance. Donnie experiences common human emotions like the fear of being alone and Gyllenhaal is so vulnerable in those moments that the audience cannot help but relate to him. The scene where he completely breaks down in his therapist's arms when he is talking about his loneliness is genuinely heartbreaking.The lighting works to set the mood of the film. The narrative is really mysterious and the lighting (or lack of lighting) reflects that. In particular, the scenes with Donnie and Frank are always in darkness to reflect the dark nature of Frank and how Donnie is stepping into it through Frank. This also adds to the question if Frank is only a hallucination since the audience always sees him in shadow. The lack of answers is frustrating, but if the goal of Richard Kelly was to thoroughly blow his audience's minds then it was a success.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
makes you think,"This movie was incredibly confusing to me at first and that was probably the best part about it. If you just want to get entertained this film might not be the best for you to watch but if you want to have something to think about for days its great!There are so many possible interpretations that you will probably keep thinking about it after you watch it. The different dimensions seem to be very confusing at first but if you keep thinking about it you realize more and more things and you get how many small details make sense. You feel like the person who did that movie really thought about every small detail and that makes it very enjoyable to watch it! However, there are still some open questions which leaves u wanting more!The thing that really catches you is just how strange and weird the whole thing is. I also think the actor of Donnie fits perfectly because he did a great job being weird and creating that horror effect. The settings really match the atmosphere as well. I really enjoyed how fantasy and reality were connected and time travel was presented. I am not the biggest fan of fantasy movies but I still really enjoyed watching this one because the fantasy part is integrated in a very good way. Besides, the soundtrack was very good!I feel like this movie is very unique and original, but maybe thats just because ive never seen a movie like that before.Also, the story was great ( I loved the end!), very tensive I always wanted to know what happened next and there were almost no boring points in that movie at all.Overall, a very great movie!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I've got it!!!,"I've got it!!... At least I think I have. The reason why the bullies and Cherita are set up behind Donnie in some shots could be symbolic of the angel and the devil on his shoulders. Generally, whatever is good is shown on his left side and whatever is evil or threatening is on the left. For example, in the lifeline exercise shot, the bullies are on his right shoulder and Cherita is on his left. This also relates to the lifeline exercise in which fear is shown on the right side of the line and love on the left. Cherita, who obviously fancies Donnie, could also portray her role as an angel through love and the bullies are maybe to do with what Donnie should fear. When Donnie says to Jim Cunningham that he's an antichrist, Gretchen is on his left side and the bullies are on his right. This cant just be a coincidence Oh god now I even sound like Donnie, I really need to find a new movie to be obsessed about! Anyway, let me know if you agree with my interpretation.

Enjoyable timey-wimey tale,"There are probably two ways to enjoy this film. Just sit back and enjoy it and not worry too much if it all makes sense, or forensically try to work out what on earth is going on.If you choose the latter path, you'll likely need a second or third watch to piece together all the clues. Either way, it's a pretty good film.Our lead character, Donnie Darko, narrowly avoids being killed in a freak accident thanks to a visitation from 'Frank' - a giant rabbit-like creature. Played very convincingly by Jake Gyllenhaal, Donnie appears to become more detached from reality but may in fact be closer to understanding reality than those around him.Why is Donnie acting strange, who or what is Frank, and what was the cause of the freak accident? All is eventually revealed - but not in an obvious explanatory way. The film comes to a reasonably satisfying conclusion in terms of ending the story, but leaves what you've just seen open to interpretation and debate. That's when you might decide to watch it again for some answers.Overall an interesting watch with some pretty decent music to boot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Great social criticism movie, with hints of thriller and Sci fy","Although this movie involves the topic of time travel and has a bit of suspense, it is primarily a look at how teenagers can feel alone, confused or even despaired.It is a fantastic script which dwells on young Donnie Darko and how he deals with the hallucinations of a figure in a rabbit suit which causes him to commit crimes / wrongdoing and effectively work as an escape route for his troubles.But at the same time, it touches on many other sides of personal anguish - a fat kid who is bullied, a teacher who is frowned upon by teaching at more innovative curriculum, the pressure of getting into college, and I could go on.He shows how this people cope with these issues.
In Donnie's case, it was indeed by his relationship with this rabbit suit figure.It is a very interesting story, very well written and that will lead to debate for anyone watching.Gyllenhaal's performance is remarkable, specially considering his age at the time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
My new favorite movie!,"In the last month, I have seen this movie three times.  It is one of the best movies I've ever watched and definitely my favorite movie that has come out within the last five years.  It's wonderful!  I think that it is not only realistic (in the emotional anxiety the lead character suffers from), but also because it really shows how people can hide their true feelings and keep a smile on their faces, even when they're really feeling like crap on the inside.  Everyone in this movie did such a terrific job.  The only person I felt was not suitable for her role was Jena Malone.  She was great in Stepmom, but not right for this character she tried to portray. However, the lead, Jake Gyllanhaal, really shined.  I have only seen him in two other roles, the first of the two others was, Moonlight Mile, and The Good Girl, in which he also plays a little mentally disturbed. And being an avid Drew Barrymore fan, I felt that this was the best role she had ever been in, as small as it may have been. I was also surprised to learn that she was one of the executive producers to the film.All in all it was a great watch, and I can't wait to watch it with more people to see what their reactions will be.  And in case you don't already know it, a fun piece of trivia is that Jake's sister in the movie, is his real sister in real life too.  Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze were the other two small characters in the film and I thought they were really good.  I'm not a big fan of Swayze's but I thought this was the best role I'd ever seen him in as well. I also thought that the woman who played the annoying teacher, Ms. Farmer, was really good.  She made you hate her so much and she was really good in her role.  She really became her character.Weird, bizzare, and confusing might describe this movie for some, but for me it was beautiful, interesting, funny and really well written and directed.  The construction of the movie was intricate and  unusually put together nicely for such a confusing structure of a story.  Again, I enjoyed this movie a great deal, and hope to hear anyone else's thoughts on the piece.  A definite 10 out of 10.And that's the end of my review.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Dark, funny, creepy, and full of questions to wrap your brain around","Donnie Darko has something to do with time travel and something to do with fate. The fun of the film is that it asks a lot of questions and doesn't provide many answers. It creates a strange mythology that boggles minds upon repeat viewings. The fun of watching the film is that people find themselves developing many theories. Any film that achieves cult status involves a certain mythology, like we've found ourselves in the middle of something grand and we're only given a glimpse of whats actually going on. Donnie Darko is a well crafted ""hero"" of sorts. To what end is up to the viewer to decide. He's horribly flawed yet has a huge burden to carry as we approach the closure of the film.What is often overlooked about this film is the deconstruction of 80s suburbia. ""The end of the world"" is often mentioned in the film and Donnie Darko's character is often unraveling those uncomfortable truths about a hidden facade of safety in suburbia. His family looks perfect in the very beginning til they start cursing and discussing politics at the dinner table. What kids are learning at school is questioned by an ignorant parent, while they question vandalism at the school. The local clean cut celebrity Dr. Cunningham has a dark secret. Suddenly their world becomes a little unsafe, all thanks to Donnie Darko. All this is done with a dark, and devilish sense of humor.I didn't care for the director's cut as much. The fun of this film is in its mythos and lack of explanation. The sci fi fantasy of the film is great as well as the suburban satire. Read too much into it, you might enjoy it less. To me though, the film seems to be a happy accident, as Richard Kelly, in all his indulgences, hasn't reproduced this kind of magic. It's a special near perfect film that loses its enjoyment with too much analysis.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Donnie Darko: fodder for the artistically blind...,"Donnie Darko aka the plight of humanity expressed and transposed through tip-top, dysfunctional, tripe pseudo-art. The mean looking, everyday angst-ridden, emotional Mall dwelling kid does well here, staring at the screen, smirking all film like you're the father he hates and wishes to plot eradication towards. If this is good acting, then sure, take any semi-coherent, yet handsome teen off the street and fire them up, they are READY TO GO! Essentially, the film is perfect for the 'alternate' cliques of people who dislike the norm, dislike societal structure, are appalled by the standard of everyday tastes on display for them. This is fair to take this stance, but, the irony is, this film is merely a sugar-coated black-spot on modern Art. Posing as something acquired to this clique's general 'norm', thinking it is an excuse to be happy that something 'creative' has reared finally to end the scruple and bring forth the mental endearment. I'm sorry folks, I just don't buy it. It lacks charm. It lacks gripping drama. Depth. Meaning. Humour (well it was humorous to me and my perplexed mind). This disdainfully repulsive creation had me cringing in the Cinema, while all around, seemed to be enthralled by the apparent 'spell-binding' blandness of this superficial sham, while I was only fully exasperated by how offensively bad it truly was. I don't blame the 'alternate masses' for being desperate for something of this kind of repertoire, but, you don't jump into bed with the first person you meet.At least when left bewildered by a Rothko painting, you are just that, for differing reasons. Which has you scratching your head and 'wondering' in positive ways. This film had me bewildered for all the wrong reasons.I dislike spoilers, so I won't include one, no matter how inadequate the film is, but the ending just epitomizes the whole film, what he turns out to 'be', uniquely stupid. Bravo.Seriously, what was 'unique' about this film? Because the plot was dull, possibly the dullest part of the film. So yes, this film descends into new levels of self mental-depravity toned by it's atrocious plot, dull acting, lack of ideas, lack of basis and downright lack of general creativity. The only possible atonement being, that I get to rip holes in it for the rest of my life. Though, nothing can atone for the scar left in my mind forever.Oh, what a surprise, Richard Kelly also wrote something as repugnant as 'Domino', also.

jklein8787 you are RIGHT!,"I have tried to watch Donnie Darko four times.  Each time I find the characters stereo-typical and the performances (except For Mary McDonell's) abominable.   Since this movie is supposed to be telling a story, and a story is only intersting if one finds the characters interesting, this movie is boring.Other people may like it (and find it interesting), but I dont.  (And apparently, a great many others don't either by the look of the negative comments here.)As has been said before, there are negative comments for every movie (Wizard of Oz, 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc).  Just shows that people have different tastes.I like science fiction, and horror, and cross-genre movies.  I like movies that catalyze thought.  I don't think Donnie Darko does that.Sure, lots of young people like Jake G. (especially--at least on this site--young females.  I don't.  I think his performances (Bubble Boy, The Good Girl, and Donnie Darko) are all the same, and don't demonstrate (to me, at least) any ""great"" acting skills.Some may find the story ""thought-provoking.""  I don't.  (As an aside here, I COULD make a list here of movies I do find thought-provoking, as I have seen fans of this movie demand of others who have said things similar to what I have said, but I dont feel the necessity to;  I am commenting about THIS movie, not others.)  I feel Donnie Darko's story tries too hard to be thought-provoking, and thus brings about its own failure.The thing I find most unappealing about this movie actually concerns its fans:  It seems that they are outraged (for some reason) by anyone who posts negative comments.  These fans (for some reason) suddenly feel the need to make negative comments about the intelligence of people who dont like the film. I find this very saddening.I guess it really says something about themselves...",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"INCREDIBLE MOVIE,so hard to understand!!","From the cover of the DVD i stayed amazed,i passed to another world, surrealism in a pure dose,a world in another space,maybe a 4th. dimension,the soundtrack takes us to a journey through those years, What can change our world? Is our willingness or after all it is written in the stairs?(as John Lennon said),all the actors played so smartly the game:Gyllenhaal with his grainy,bitter face,Drew and her fatal sexy-tenderness,Swayze a mild-mannered deceiver,Katherine Ross(i didn't see her a long,long time ago)made the point,Maggie was OK,and i'm still feeling there are so many mysteries that aren't unveiled.In my head will always remain 'till the on the times that unforgettable image about those girls dancing on the yard of the school under the progressive tones from ""Head over Heels "" a state of minded-son, caging you with that astounding sound created by Orzabal-Smith AND THEIR MAGIC KEYBOARD.

"Dark, beautiful and unexpected","Lovely. Haunting and beautiful, this piece of film does what no hollywood production manages these days. It is unexpected, you never know what will happen, and the paradoxes of the movie are not resolved in sweet little fluffy pink clouds.Actions have consequences, which this film proves so well by it's storyline. It is mysterious and it keeps you guessing, and so far I've only seen two other movies that keeps me guessing for so long as Donnie Darko does (Fight Club and Sixth Sense).It is a modern gothic, an urban legend and a truly unique piece of art.

A pleasant surprise,"Donnie Darko is the first, and perhaps the best motion picture of the young director Richard Kelly. With an interesting cast, that includes new Hollywood faces like Noah Whyle, Drew Barrymore, the Gyllenhaal brothers, Jena Malone and Seth Rogen with more experienced artists such as Mary McDonell, Katherine Ross, Patrick Swayze, Beth Grant and Holmes Osborne, the movie was produced with a low budget and shot in a very short period of time.Now, we have Donnie Darko: The director's cut, a DVD that includes 15 more minutes than the original film, which represents the real work Kelly and his crew did. Set in 1988, the movie narrates the story of Donnie Darko, a troubled teenager that suffers from schizophrenia. One of his hallucinations, in the form of a giant rabbit called Frank, tells him that the world will come to an end in exactly 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds.This singular event is accompanied with the fact that a plane motor falls in Donnie's bed at midnight (he's saved because Frank's appearance). Since then, the facts of the history and the situations the characters are in, seem to drag them to that imminent end. Kelly shows Donnie's world, with his parents (Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonell), his sisters, his psychiatrist (Katherine Ross), his teachers and girlfriend (Jena Malone).Donnie Darko tells a complex but well worked story. Understood in first moment as a psycho-thriller, the film combines effectively elements of comedy (with acid sarcasm), drama and science fiction. The 80's background is also greatly accurate, in its political and social context, where we can see Donnie as a teenager looking for the truth, affected by two visions of the world: one of the annoying teacher Kitty Farmer (Grant) and the hypocrite Jim Cunningham (Swayze), that represent the most conservative side of the American way of life; and the other, represented by teachers Monitoff y Pomeroy (good performances of Whyle y Barrymore), young and in-conformist characters at the school.With outstanding and realistic special effects, a precise direction and an open final, Donnie Darko is a great surprise and an interesting and unclassified movie; a sort of gem in the American film industry: a total win for its director, who was awarded with more than 10 prizes for the film, mostly in independent film Festivals.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Mad World Indeed,"Donnie Darko, is, without a doubt, my favorite film, and in my humble opinion, the absolute best film ever made. While the effectiveness of something like this is entirely subjective, I believe the appeal, message, and quality, are universal.Donnie Darko is a teenager whose way too angsty and moody for his own good. He's temperamental, volatile, and kind of a prick. He's a guy with some 'emotional problems', a therapist, and some pills. However, he isn't the typical angsty teen, he's a teenager who has visions (or 'daylight hallucinations') of a man in a large bunny suit who tells him the world is going to end.And thats where I'm going to stop. Upon first viewing, its best that you don't know a single thing about it going in. Watching this movie and being able to appreciate it is more akin to an experience rather than a viewing, an all-consuming, all-engulfing, journey into immersion. As you follow Donnie down the 'rabbit hole' (Ha ha) you might just change your outlook on basically... anything really. It is one of those movies, a film like Fight Club, Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind, American Beauty, Eraserhead, and K-PAX that makes you do a bit of self critiquing once you finish it. You sort of re-evaluate yourself and your opinion and knowledge on the world. Its an absorbing and haunting movie that by the end, had me in tears, and the best part is I can't even say why. Its such a transcendent film, its a damn shame Richard Kelley hasn't made another decent film since.Bottom line, whether you'll love it or hate it (Its a polarizing flick), Donnie Darko is easily in the my list of top 5 movies you HAVE to see before you die.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
this movie changed my life,"let me start this by saying i saw this movie a month before i turned 13. so some people think my view of this are immature. let me follow that by saying very rarely does a movie touch me deeply enough for me to cry. the ONLY exceptions were ""dead poets society"" ""pay it forward"" and now ""Donnnie darko"". my friend advertised as a cool sci-fi pic but i think it is an amazing abstract film that hits the perfect balance of emotion, science, humor and darkness.

Theatrical Version: 10/10... Directors Cut Version: 8/10,"This is my review of the Director's Cut version only.I own both versions, and while I thought the load of new scenes were amazing to see, the original theatrical version is definitely the definitive version of this film, and I advise anyone not to watch the directors cut version first.The extra scenes are good, but these scenes should definitely have been left out of the movie, as it throws the pace of the film off balance, some scenes don't add that much extra. Whilst some scenes are amazing to see, I still don't think it is best if you see them the first time. Also the soundtrack has been changed, in an irritating way. Same songs, just they appear in different places in the film, I don't feel it works as well.Both are definitely worth seeing though, but I recommend you see the shorter theatrical version of the film first, or perhaps even 3 times through before you tackle the directors cut (which ultimately raises more questions, yet kills the lust to be asking them).",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Film-making at it's absolute finest.,"This movie is more than just a thought-provoking thriller. It is a dark, enthralling journey that leaves you wanting to watch it over and over. Not because of how entertaining it was (which it definitely was), but to gain more understanding and insight into the masterpiece that is Donnie Darko.After first viewing, I understood the premise of the story, and was impressed with the overall tone of the movie, but was still confused about some scenes. So it wasn't until my 3rd viewing of Donnie Darko that I realized what a fantastic piece of art it really is. The score is perfect, the acting is superb, and some of the lines are hauntingly resonant.You will want everyone you know to watch Donnie Darko, just so you can talk about it with them for hours afterwards.

Donnie Darko,"Jake Gyllenhaal is the eponymous teenager who just doesn't really fit in. Ever since he was a young child, he has struggled and it's only ""Gretchen"" (Jena Malone) who has anything to do with him. It's maybe on the psychiatrists couch that he seems most able to relax - under hypnosis - and under that influence we embark on quite a curious learning curve that follows ""Donnie"" from childhood through the turbulence of his adolescence. Now his development might not have been helped by the arrival of an aircraft engine through his roof, so his body's self defence mechanisms seem to be seeking solace from his friend ""Frank"". No, he's not real - well not unless life-sized bunnies have escaped up the looking glass, and when he is told that the world will end in just short of one month's time, then it's time to find his psychological TARDIS - or as near as he can. Why did he survive the accident? Well that's the question that continues to plague him as his torments mount and his frustrations begin to manifest themselves in petty criminality and a testing of his relationship with his only real friend ""Gretchen"". Now I don't know about you, but until now I'd never thought of bunny rabbits as being the least menacing. Think ""Thumper"" from ""Bambi"" (1942) and that's about it. Here, though, auteur Richard Kelly uses the light - well mostly the dark - to create quite a sense of peril as young ""Donnie"" seems to lose what little grasp of the plot he ever had. It's also quite darkly comical at times, with the rather potent script treading a line between fact and fiction in an engagingly blurred fashion. Gyllenhaal plays the part well, adding a vulnerability to a role that is quite difficult to define and as we progress, well some of our earlier assumptions become just a little more fluid. The haunting Gary Jules version of the Tears For Fears ""Mad World"" song tops a strong 1980s soundtrack and the whole film has an ethereal eeriness to it that I did quite enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Quite moving,"I enjoyed the film a lot because - 1. it contained a touching romance plot - Donnie & the new girl in town, a vulnerable young woman who seems to die and does not deserve her death; 2. the supernatural character was completely enigmatic: this dimension of the plot cannot be boxed into a neat framework of explanation. Who is Frank ? Where did he come from ? What is he up to ? 3. some kind of scheme of poetic justice seems to be in operation - Swazye's character turns out to be evil, the ""wicked"" Donnie is actually vindicated for the viewer 4. the music at the end of the film was appropriately stirring, lending a tone reminiscent of the composer Henryk Górecki's most moving work; 5. the viewer is wrenched out of the usual process of narrative expectations eg in which normality goes awry then is repaired by a hero: allowing the possibility of time travel enables Donnie to sacrifice himself to save the new girl. Nevertheless the story could loosely be called a tragedy, ending the film on a note of suicidal heroism, leaving the viewer with an implied statement of the nobility of man.A friend recommended the film to me & he was right...",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

full of camp and teen angst,"Having just watched the movie and having just read the first abysmal comment left by some belicose Ebert & Roeper wannabe, I would like to contribute my own opinions to the movie Donnie Darko.I sat down to watch the movie expecting some vapid, Hollywood teen thriller saturated with mild pornography, whiny suburban rock, and a couple of cute teen faces. Ah! how looks can deceive! Instead I found a campy, dark, sweet love story about teenage alienation and the meaning of the universe.I should have known immediately, with an incongruent Patrick Swayze in the credits, as well as dimpled Drew Barrymore, that something was awry, and that this was no simple summer flick.The film is rife with genre reference and kudos, Stephen King and Sam Raimi among the most blatant. The surface of the story is indeed a confused sci-fi fantasy about time-travel, highschool alienation, teenage love, and rebellion. But to leave it at that would be impertinent, it would be like reading Camus's L'Etranger and deriding it for something as simple as murder story.Standing on a beach With a gun in my hand Staring at the sea Staring at the sand Staring down the barrel At the arab on the ground See his open mouth But hear no sound-- The Cure, Killing an ArabEnter Happy Camper #1, Donnie Darko. A slightly deranged though sympathetic loner who disagrees with everyone, doesn't fit in, and is plagued by dreams of death and destruction. Obviously if you don't sympathize with him, you've led a life of drab conformity! Happy Camper #2, his girlfriend, Joanie James, who's mother is a battered wife, who's step-father is homicidal, and who has to face the ritual ridicule that new schools seem designed to promote (at least in white suburban America that is). So we've got the hero and his love, a hero who is being led by a sibilant voice in the form of a nightmare bunny rabbit (Jimmy Stewart never had hallucinations like this, that's for sure) which, surprisingly, isn't that original, having been used in both ""Of Mice and Men"" and ""Harvey"", though certainly never so menacingly. Proceeding. Our morose and disgruntled protagonist ambles along the plot line, only becoming tangled with the possibility of time travel (Stephen Hawkins obviously a sh*t disturber). What if, what if? What if it were possible to change time? What if in doing so you annihilated God? What if in doing so you annihilated yourself? (Teachers be forewarned, you can lose your job over this line of thinking) and so... Enter Patrick Swayze, Happy Camper #3, who seems to have conquered all of life's dilemmas by vanquishing fear, the Almighty Fear (brought on no less by alcohol, drugs, and eeee! pre-marital sex! Does this sound like a panacea? Sure does, but our hero can see right through his polarized morality. Isn't the gamut of human emotion more than just FEAR and LOVE, can't the two sometimes combine, or even collide?Donnie Darko is about one boy's choice to live alone, an existential duel between faith and fear. He is given no option, no saving grace, only a repetitious plague of waking nightmares that remind him of his estrangement.If he tunes out the calling of the voice, if he shatters fate, then he knows that the universe is empty, that there is no redemption in heaven, and that he must face oblivion. However, if he continues along the path, the foreseen future, rife with its hallucinations and demons, he will never be sane, will never be normal, and will lose the only person he comes to care about. Like he says ""What's the point of living if you don't have a dick?"" If there is no hope, if there is no love, who cares. But what if love drives to to an even greater alienation, what if love forces you to destroy the ""world"" the Cosmos (in its original meaning), and so doing, destroys you. What choice is that? Well, Donnie chooses, and the world does go on... so maybe Death isn't waiting in Samara after all.I won't uphold my writing, or the structure of this argument, because it sucks and I'm tired, but I feel that if I at least garner a response, a retort, or even sympathy for this movie, then I haven't wasted my time.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Full of questions, but no answers","Donnie Darko the movie is quite a bit like Donnie Dark the character. It raises questions worth pondering, it searches for truth, it wants to see good in humanity, it challenges many assumptions, and it tackles many issues with passion. However, also like its namesake, the movie is restless and desperate. It jumps from issue to issue like Donnie, searching for hope, but finding none.His psychiatrist asks him the question, ""Do you feel alone?"" He responds, ""I don't want to."" He explains to her that he wants to believe in God, that the debate could go on and on forever, but that there's no point because there's no proof. No proof, no point. The movie concludes that weather or not there is a God, if we can't prove he's there than it doesn't matter, so we should just live the best lives we can live.**SPOILERS**Donnie ultimately realizes that his impact on the world only causes negative results, so he 'heroically' jumps in front of a plane engine to save the world from himself. It was a touching end, but strangely unsatisfying. To think that he was only able to do evil was as chilling as the thought of there not being a God.**END OF SPOILERS**As far as movie making quality the movie was top notch. The acting was excellent, and often stellar. The movie's pace was a thoughtful but gripping, and the story was original and fresh.However i found the the 20+ F-words to be distracting and in poor taste. Also the strongly sexual conversations and sub-plots were poorly handled. If they wanted to deal with those kind of issues that's fine, but they didn't, they just threw disjointed sex around until it dirtied their story and characters.However captivating and gripping a movie (and character) it was, i don't only take story, quality, and acting into consideration when rating a movie. I also take message into my decision, since message is a huge part of what why we tell stories. And the message in this movie was hopelessness.

absolute absurdity,"first time writer/director richard kelly has crafted his film ""donnie darko"" much in the tradition of samuel beckett.  the young donnie darko (jake gyenhaal), who has ""intimidating"" test scores, leads an alienated audience down a dangerous and disturbing quest for god.  like the vagabonds in beckett's play ""waiting for godot,"" darko too waits for something to happen. darko waits about a month.there is a beauty in kelly's certainty, or rather, his comfort in his uncertainty, about the answers to the film's questions.  too often, filmmakers seem compelled (maybe by studio philosophers) to solve every enigma man faces.  kelly refuses, and instead, presents a challenge to the audience instead of a pacifier.i appreciate the complexity of the family dynamics.  instead of painting a norman rockwell painting of suburban dysfunction, gyenhaal and his real life sister maggie gyenhaal, are in many respects, well adapted and healthy teen-agers growing up in the late 1980's.the performances are very well crafted and the delivery is unexpected.  if you can divorce yourself from the need for resolution, ""donnie darko"" can provide an excellent spring board for pondering the unknown.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A brilliant film to be seen time and time again.,"In an ordinary world we could peer out of our quaint kitchen windows and find gentle bunny rabbits frolicking in our gardens, munching on our freshly mowed green grass and nestling under bushes. However, in the world of 'Donnie Darko the bunny rabbit is quite a different animal! Richard Kelly's cult film 'Donnie Darko' presents a demonic, human-sized rabbit, who announces to a mentally-ill teenager that the world is doomed to end in 18 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. However this is only before the adolescent is lured from his bedroom at midnight, narrowly escaping death from a crushing jet engine that crashes into his bedroom. Donnie spends the movie on a journey to self discovery, embracing his schizophrenic state and differentiating between what is reality and what is fantasy. Set in 1988 during the presidential elections 'Donnie Darko' is centered on a teenage boy named Donnie, played by Jake Gyllenhaal who suffers delusions from schizophrenia. Confronted by this rabbit, who promptly informs Donnie that his name is Frank on his village golf course, Donnie feels it is his responsibility to save the world before it ends on Halloween night. Frequently skipping his medication Donnie's delusions become more frequent and more vivid, giving him the added responsibility of deciding what is real and what is not. Director Richard Kelly pays homage within the film to countless other famous flicks like Back to the Future, The Last Temptation of Christ and E.T which also features Donnie's English Teacher, actress Drew Barrymore. Both written and directed by Kelly, 'Donnie Darko' is the budding film maker's first full length film however he has directed two short films in 1996 and 1997 called 'The Goodbye Place' and 'Visceral Matter'. In spite of his lack of experience in the film world, respectively Kelly's 'Donnie Darko' has achieved and maintained a legendary cult status among viewers. Whether this is due to its appealing cast, engaging story line or eye questioning special effects is anyone's guess. Made clear through the film it is evident that Kelly possesses a fetish for time travel, the supernatural and questions of faith. With the dream soundtrack of any 80's teenager that is sure to satisfy all tastes 'Donnie Darko' features a variety of 80s classics. These include Joy Divisions 'Love Will Tear Us Apart', Tears for Fears 'Head Over Heels' and Duran Duran's 'Notorious'. They are a continuous reminder of the films 80's setting as well as a reflection of the teenage angst felt by Donnie. With a slim budget of $4.5 million you wouldn't expect much from this first time director. However I shortly found an understanding for its renowned cult status after watching the film for myself. Not very popular with critics upon its release in 2001 Donnie Darko found a large fan base when it went to video and DVD release, remaining in the hearts and minds of all those who've had the pleasure of viewing this cinematic masterpiece. Actor Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain, Bubble Boy) does an excellent job portraying the warped teenager, revealing the sexual frustrations of male adolescents, the relentless desire to belong and a boy's search for the answer to life's questions. Oscar nominated actress Mary McDonnell plays his concerned mother and his own sibling, Maggie Gyllenhaal (Secretary, Mona Lisa Smile), portrays his rebellious older sister. Donnie's love interest is played by rising star Jena Malone (Life as a House, Pride and Prejudice), who's character has a sordid past and the chosen pseudonym of Gretchen Ross. Dirty Dancing stud Patrick Swayze is the mortal enemy of Donnie playing a self help guru with dark secrets who comes to Donnie's school preaching the idea that emotion is simply divided between fear and love. Donnie disagrees, thinking it's a monetary ploy and in his rebellious wisdom is elected by Frank to see to the demise of Cunningham and reveal him as the fraud that he is. Interestingly Donnie's high school nemesis is played by Jake Gyllenhaals real life friend Alex Greenwald, singer of 'The OC's' memorable theme song 'California', and his trusty side kick is played by the recently famous Seth Rogen star of 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up'. Kelly intentionally wanted this film to mean different things to a variety of viewers. He himself admits, ""Maybe it's the story of Holden Caulfield, resurrected in 1988 by the spirit of Phillip K. Dick, who was always spinning yarns about schizophrenia and drug abuse breaking the barriers of space and time. Or it's a black comedy foreshadowing the impact of the 1988 Presidential election, which is really the best way to explain it. But first and foremost, I wanted the film to be a piece of social satire that needs to be experienced and digested several times."" Therefore leaving this film difficult for discussion. Those who've seen it and loved it have merely recommended it to others and spread to others the phenomenon that is 'Donnie Darko'. 'Donnie Darko' embraces a variety of genres like sci-fi, romance, and thriller as well as a few of chuckles for the comedy lovers. This apocalyptic tale offers something for every viewer, which could be a potential explanation for its countless devoted fans, who apply the woes of Donnie Darko to the unexplained occurrences in their own distorted lives. As the films tag line quips, 'Life is one long insane trip. Some people just have better directions'.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Atrocious 'American Beauty' for 80s kids,"Sometimes the buzz is wrong. Really goddamned wrong. So wrong you walk out of the theater in disbelief that the movie ever got made in the first place.Cloaking itself in some social satire against the easiest targets possible, the movie shifts clumsily in tone from horror to teen comedy to family drama. Pop culture references from the '80s--the smurfs, hungry hungry hippos, etc.--pepper the film, largely out of an attempt to capture the decade through products rather than through a compelling or sensical plot.The end makes little to no sense and is made worse by a severely inept soundtrack decision. Executive producer Drew Barrymore has a small role as a rebellious teacher at the high school. This is about as fitting as anthony hopkins as jabba the hut. You'll laugh a couple times, cringe a helluva lot and taste bile at the schlock end.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
loved it,"i saw Donnie Darko for the first time 2 nights ago. i really enjoyed it. lots of people have been talking about it recently and its popped up everywhere lately. i think its because some people have been studying it in their class. anyway, i really enjoyed it. i think Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic. yes, i am in love. he does a fantastic job at playing Donnie. i was very freaked out when he is at the cinema with Gretchen and he talks to frank with the evil eyes! i also really like Jena Malone. she is popping up in movies i have seen recently and i am beginning to like her. my perception of the film is that its all a big dream, and just before we see the jet engine crash into Donnie's room again, we see shots of everyone waking up, so this is why i think it's all a dream. but i have only seen the original version, not the directors cut, and i have heard from people that the directors cut makes it a bit easier to understand. but leaving that alone i really liked the film. i find Donnie fascinating and i was upset when he died in the end. but on the other hand, if it were a Hollywood ending where everyone lives happily ever after, i was have been disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
the added depths of the directors cut,"i first watched Donnie Darko when i was about 14 years old, i was with a lot of my friends as i have having a birthday sleep over. at first i grew tired of the film and became easily distracted by my friends. but what i do remember is the ending of the film and thinking ""what the hell just happened?"" a few year later i saw the DVD for the film in a shop for cheap. needless to say i brought it straight away hoping that with a few more years of wisdom and an empty room i would understand the film. i watched it many times before i even fully understood what was happening. after this i still kept watching and discovering many secret philosophies and hidden meanings within the film. i was taken over by the film. after my parents worked out my obsessions for the film they decided to buy me the directors cut for Christmas. i was glad of this as i wanted to know what was going on in the directors head when he made this film. but before i did this i decided to watch the film with the added scenes, i wasn't expecting much but from this but i thought i would give it ago any way. i am glad that i did this, the added scenes and passages from Roberta sparrows book answered so many of my questions and helped me to understand so much more about the time travel aspects of the film and the meanings behind certain actions. along with this the added scenes opened up so many more questions and ideas within my head. the directors cut just takes the film to a level of deepness that is never ending. even now when i watch the film for the 100th time i an amazed by the story. enjoy",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Jake Gyllenhaal best work,"This is a fantastic film, to me it is Jake Gyllenhaal finest work to date. It is full of small but good acting performances by Drew Barrymore, Noah Wylie and even Jake's sister Maggie Gyllenhaal.This movie has the surreal look of Jacobs Ladder with the time / dimension warp element of Steven Hawking. The story line is solid and logical yet it throws you curves. You may try and guess the ending but it keeps you wondering until the end.It is not super scary but has enough to spook you if you watch it late at night. The dialog of this film is brilliant, actors lines are intelligent and articulate and are delivered with intensity.I am afraid of bunnies now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
What's all the fuss all about?,"Everyone kept repeating to me over and over again ""Donnie Darko is great Max, you should see it"". I finally did get to see it and was quite disappointed really. It was basically a horror version of the considerably better James Stewart classic ""Harvey"". The actors in it were good and I did find a few bits interesting, but for a lot of the film I sat staring at the screen saying to myself ""Oi, what's the point of this film"". I didn't understand a thing about the film when I saw it, and had to ask tons of people over and over again. I was told that when I understood the film I would say to myself ""Oh now I get it. That explains everything"", but when, after a considerable amount of time, I finally understood the film I found myself saying ""Oh. Is that all?"". It does have a song that is played over the closing credits (""Mad World"", it was number one at Christmas) which I admit to finding quite good. But other than these minor good details this film is not much. If you want to watch a good horror film watch ""The Shining"" by Stanley Kubrick starring Jack Nicholson (I'm pretty sure you've heard of it). 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Loved It!......But Why?,"I just recently rented this movie(2005), mainly cause it was an employee favorite at Blockbuster, but WOW! This is one of those movies that makes you sit there in silence for a few moments thinking as it ends. Straight up this is a weird movie, no getting around it. And while watching it you will be asking yourself ""what the hell is going on?"". Even after I've seen the movie I'm still asking myself that same question. Well, this movie has some unexplainable appeal. I mean, i was reading some of the 'preview' stuff thinking this movie is going to be stupid, mainly cause of all this giant rabbit nonsense(which has no real relevance until you get through the entire movie). To give some insight about it, it is about a high school age teen, who takes medication to soothe some condition he has(not sure what) and he hears and sees really strange things(particularly a large scary rabbit who's name is Frank). The characters are believable and interesting. Gyllenhal makes a awesome performance here. After i seen ""The Day After Tomorrow"" i thought he was just some goofy pretty-boy who was only around because he knew someone, but i cant think of anyone better for this role. The supporting cast is also great and has some heavy hitters like Swayze and Barrymoore. All and all i highly recommend this movie, but i cant put a finger on why. If nothing else it is entertaining and appeals to the emotions and intellect in a way very few movies do.One more thing, the song at the end is icing on the cake for this movie. And somewhat puts it into perspective.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

this is a great movie,"You have to watch it alone and watch it carefully. This movie has a great philosophy and I like that kind of philosophy. At first you think that authors are trying to say something about Freud's desires but than you realize that everything you see is different. You realize that what they show as time is very close to your idea of time and the way it changes. Donnie Darko is just a normal kid... I would actually like to be acquainted with him. I am a teacher and I pray to have such a student every day - this Donie Darko is very intelligent, asks a lot of questions - such men are identified as genius: they are open minded, curious and they have to pay for that with something (this case is somnambulism). At the end of my watching the movie I realized that I have a lot of questions not revealed... for those who care - just write about that in the letter to me. But these questions are only there because they should be. The story is not finished and you can think over what is going to be in the aftermath over and over. Life is what makes us wondering - and the plot of the movie in this case is close to life - despite the fact that this is philosophic sci-fi.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Demands multiple viewings.,"Donnie Darko is an entertaining, well thought out film with a mysterious aura and a sense of mystery and foreboding throughout. These rare and difficult elements that have been woven into this film combine with several other things creating something memorable.There is a healthy mix of rather dark humour early on as we witness our hero swearing at and around his family which integrates with the amusing one-liners he is using them with. This is combined with the suspense which builds and surprises which crop up now and again very early on in the film. You are left guessing and attempting to work things out from the very first frame. The feeling that everything is, in actual fact, normal is very much present as there are no complicated settings, nor are there unfamiliar characters. Everything is everyday and familiar, in fact the closest thing there is to any abnormality when it comes to the setting is the time of the film takes place which is in the late 1980's.This clash of an everyday world setting but mysterious aura throughout works very well as we attempt to work out what's going on but at the same time, realise that the mysterious element is still there through the character of Donnie. One other thing is that the rest of the characters seem to act 'crazy' in their own unique way. Everyone has a fault and everyone has a goal; whether it be a schizophrenic trying to work out what's going on, a pervert trying to 'heal' people or even if it's an obsessive person bent on making sure a certain music band containing young girls is a success over everything else. Each person is searching and we, the audience, are searching with them. We are with them through their highs and lows and Donnie's therapy sessions act as checkpoints for this journey as we go deep into his mind during hypnosis. This little technique acts as a good suspense filler too, but it often also produces a few laughs. This is very clever.Throughout this film, there is a definite element of confusion. I was never 100% sure as to what was going on but this is healthy as films like this demand a second viewing anyway. We ask ourselves: what do the dreams mean? Why is all this happening and what's causing it? This, to me, made me feel like the film was coming together like a puzzle and every time a dream came along, it was as if I'd suddenly found a piece which linked up several others. The film unravels in this way and it's not too demanding yet at the same time, it doesn't insult the viewer.With wonderful music throughout, using both popular tracks from the era and instrumental music, along with a clever manipulation of the speed of the footage; both fast and slow, Donnie Darko is a very clever film and well worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Strange, hypnotic and beautifully twisted.","When I first saw Donnie Darko, I was unable to see what all the fuss was about, I borrowed it of a friend who loved it and defiantly told me I would not understand it. She was right, I didn't, however about 3 weeks later, I came across an article on the top films of the decade, upon further thought, I went out and bought it. It's a great film, the strange darkness that underlies in every scene is superior to anything I have seen before. Okay it's really weird and it doesn't make much sense, but that I one of the reasons why I liked it, I liked the way Richard Kelly adds a small amount of dark humour when dealing with the characters. Overall It's powerful, dark and strangely funny.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Awesome Movie!!,"I absolutely love Donnie Darko. I first saw the movie about a year ago and bought it the next day. It has amazing acting by Jake Gyllenhaal and many other amazing actors and actresses. Jake portrays a teen dealing with some mental issues which include hallucinations about a six foot tall bunny rabbit named Frank. Donnie {Gyllenhaal} starts waking up in odd places and then discovers that weird events are happening around the town of Middlesex. He thinks that time travel somehow has an effect on his life. Some other amazing people in this movie include Jena Malone, Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and Beth Grant. I would definitely call Donnie Darko one of the best phsycological comedies of my time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Donnie Dorko,"Donnie Darko stars Jake Gyllenhaal (or however spelled) and of course it sucks. There's nothing much to say about it, but I hate it so because it tries too hard to be a movie that is supposed to make you think.

He's a terrible actor and should be murdered in the worst way possible.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A small masterpiece,"It's easy to understand why this movie floundered at first: Something that works so well on so many different levels can leave marketers catatonic with fear. Is it about a technology ""indistinguishable from magic,"" (Clarke) or psychotic delusions or drug-induced hallucinations? It manages to mix drama, humor, social commentary, horror and a Passion Play mysticism into a crucible that is filled to its brim. Although it has its own style and set of (many) themes, it falls into the same category as films like Memento and Pi, which stick in your mind and make your brain itch until you realize that you just need to see them again -- preferably with a few friends. Once just wasn't enough and the third viewing is often even more rewarding than the second.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
10/10,"There's no way I can write something that will give you an idea of how truly amazing this movie is. It can't be crammed into one category or tried to be explained at all, but it's for sure a movie you got to watch before you die. Donnie Darko is a journey. That's the only way I can think of it. The most beautiful one ever imagined. The main character's doubts, confusion, intelligence and blunt innocence will make sure to keep you hooked. Jake Gyllenhaal couldn't have done a better job. From his body language to his light stutter and distant eyes, while he is in front of those cameras, he is not himself anymore. He IS Donnie Darko. In a way you will only understand once you've watched the movie. It's simply genius. it'll knock you out.

DOES NOT DESERVE THE HYPE,"I've heard quite a few people comparing this film to the 'sixth sense', the 'usual suspects', 'Open your eyes' and the likes. What they have in common is (obviously) that the end changes the whole film and makes you understand it. I just think this doesn't work at all with Donnie Darko. The problem is that our interest has to be kept until the surprising end, and mine did certainly not bear with Donnie. it's just not enough to show a countdown to make me really interested in knowing what will happen at the end of it. I wouldn't say I hated the film, there were some good and very funny moments in it, but  not enough not to make me annoyed with it. Also, I felt it lacked to comment on the things it was depicting. The American-High School-Not So Feel Good-Setting with the contrast between the two teachers was not developed at all, and at some points during the film I just thought I might not have been getting it because of cultural differences (but I was assured by some American friends that that's not the case:-)) All in all, I think it's VERY overrated. Not a bad film, but why the hype???",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
My Favorite Movie of All Time,"Donnie Darko, I actually could not believe that I have never written a review of one of my favorite movies of all time. I actually first saw this movie more than seven years ago and immediately fell in love with it. It is a movie that I proudly own and will never get tired of watching. This film has so many themes but principally teenage angst, social isolation, hallucinations/schizophrenia, time travel, metaphysics, parallel universes, and how choices that we make each day in life affect us. All set in the backdrop of a beautifully American, Virginia suburb in the heat of the 1988 presidential elections. Donnie Darko is a modern masterpiece of thought-provoking and emotionally haunting film-making.Genre: Sci-Fi/Drama/Fantasy/HorrorThe Good I never really liked Jake Gyllenhall, but this is by far his best work as an actor, his role as the title character takes the cake. Donnie Darko is a boy suffering from ""Schizophrenia"" and he sees hallucinations of a dreary giant bunny rabbit that warns him of the end of the world. He narrowly avoids a really strange incident that starts off a chain of events that will change his life forever. The human emotion displayed by all the characters is amazing. You will relate to the whole range of emotions in this movie. Donnie Darko is someone I can relate to very well as a boy who understands the deeper meaning of the Universe yet feels lonely and spiritually isolated because no one sees life in his level. His family is your typical suburban household in which no one seems to truly understand or get along with each other, but who nevertheless love each other. Another character Donnie Darko reminded me of was Holden Caulfield from ""A Catcher in the Rye"" as the boy who exposes the phoniness of the adults, especially self-help guru Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). Along the way of Donnie trying to explain his hallucinations we encounter several very deep questions such as the ""philosophy"" of time travel, the meaning of love, choices we make in life, predestination, parallel universes and how genuine people are. The soundtrack of this movie really stands out ""The Killing Moon"" is a haunting track and then Head Over Heals by Tears for Fears and Mad World by Gary Jules leaves you absolutely loving the film. The best thing about this film is that you can watch this movie over and over again and still pick out new details from the movie and storyline, and you can even interpret the ending and themes in a variety of ways. The setting is perfect as well, as the movie takes place a seemingly perfect American suburb in October 1988 amidst the heat of the Presidential elections.The Bad: Nothing was bad about this film, except maybe the typical movie goer would find this film a tad weird or hard to understand. But this is why I love it.The Ugly: Roberta Sparrow as the crazy old lady with wild hair who holds the secret to time travel.Overall this is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. Some might compare this movie to ""Butterfly Effect"" but ""Donnie Darko"" did it earlier and better. Richard Kelly is an absolute genius filmmaker, I think he can officially be called a prodigy with this film. This is a movie that I can never stop watching just because it makes you think each time you watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Timeless movie well deserved of watching multiple times.,"Donnie Darko is a timeless film that I'll continue watching far far into the future. I've probably watched this movie a dozenish times and each time it's as if I'm watching it for the very first time. 'Time' isn't being used as a pun btw. An 8.0 rating, in 2019, is surprisingly low in my humble opinion. Perhaps a majority pressed the rate button after watching for the very first time as this isn't the easiest movie to follow unless you give it 100% of your attention with 0 distractions. Even after being released 18 years ago, it'd be hard for a movie to come along and knock Donnie Darko out of my top 10 favorites of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This is Frank,"What I liked best about this film was the way it was so lovingly directed. The camera pans over settings, landscapes, and characters languorously, as if trying to savor every aspect of this tale of a paranoid schizophrenic teenager who may see into other dimensions.Jake Gyllenhaal (as Donnie Darko) deserves to be lingered over. His performance summons memories of what it was like to be in high school and surrounded by real teenagers, not the fakey teens usually on display in Hollywood movies, even well-intentioned ones. Gyllenhaal's performance is a perfect melange of rage, vulnerability, fear and wonderment, tempered by psychosis. I don't know of many actors who could have pulled this role off as well, creating a character who is definitely mentally ill, yet is also someone the audience might want as a friend.Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle both give impressive performances. Both are entirely believeable as high-school teachers, a great feat considering that it's hard to get the image of Wyle in a white lab coat (from ER), or Barrymore with bleached-blonde hair lisping babytalk in a ""girl road movie"", out of one's mind when seeing them these days. Barrymore, especially, takes her energy level down several notches from her norm, portraying a woman without much overt ""personality"", but with lots going on under the surface. She's still lisping, but now it's merely a speech impediment rather than an attempt at cuteness. Wyle also portrays a rather meek man who issues lots of shy grins, a person of limited heroics who indulges Donnie Darko's interest in time travel as far as he can without putting himself out.One of the best scenes in the film is a brief one where Barrymore and Wyle's characters sit quietly together. Barrymore just says, ""Donnie Darko."" After a pause, Wyle laughs. No more is said, and the film goes on to something else. But for that moment, we see through their characters' eyes as much as we see through Donnie Darko's for the rest of the film.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A movie for a generation,"I think Donnie Darko is one of those generation movies. That is, it's a movie I would have loved had I seen it when I was 21 when the movie was originally released. I think then I would have given it either a 10 or 9, as I might be just among the generation it tries to speak to.But I didn't see it when I was 21. I saw it when I was 34, 14 years after it was released, and the issues it handles, the social alienation, difficulty of human relations and adults who don't understand, don't feel as close to me as they did to me when I was closer to the years I had gotten out from the school.DD is not a bad movie by any means. It is a bit gimmicky with its time travel plot, but it is an intriguing tale of a young man with psychological issues, trying to make sense of the world around him. The script is good and the actors all do great work. At the baseline, there's nothing really wrong with the movie, I just think I saw it the wrong time to fully appreciate it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"A little off,","OK, first of all, that guy has to stop being so critical and start actually watching the movies. Obviously, this guy didn't look further than the screen for the deep meaning and truths in this movie. This movie is about more than the summary stated. It is more than just a thriller with a scary bunny and the end of the world. This movie is about what is real and what isn't real, and it is about the truths and lies in our everyday life.

"Perfect, Compelling, and Out of This World","Donnie Darko. I think of every movie I have ever watched, this one has stuck the most, and has certainly stayed in my mind for the longest. I am almost ashamed to admit that I spent the better part of three days watching this film. Eight times in three days.When I first saw Donnie Darko, I was a little confused. Was it a teen drama? A black comedy? Sci-fi? Or just a trippy indie flick? The answer is really what Darko is about. It's perception. It's every aspect and genre of this movie that makes it so perfect.The performances, to begin with, are pretty much fantastic. Jake Gyllenhaal proved that he wasn't just a pretty face by portraying the best interpretation of a NORMAL teenage boy I've ever seen, even disregarding the extra issues Donnie had to deal with. He has a love/hate relationship with his bratty sister (spot-on performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal), an up and down, constantly developing love for his mother and father, a need for acceptance and understanding, love, sex, knowledge, and normalcy. He's incredibly creepy and sometimes even mean while remaining likable, relatable and making the audience feel for him, but never come too close to pity.Mary McDonnell delivers and amazing part as Donnie's mother, who's careful involvement in Donnie's life seems believable and makes us all wish we had a mother like that as a teenager. The always wonderful Jena Malone makes us wonder why she stays with Donnie yet completely understand why she understands him. Holmes Osbourne, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, Katharine Ross and Beth Grant are among the many underrated actors involved in Darko.The only performance that was not spot-on was Drew Barrymore as Dr. Pomeroy, the smart, bold English teacher. She seemed to be trying, but the truth is she didn't quite make it.The combination of music and stylism contribute to the atmosphere of the film. It stays true to it's name with the ever contrasting color schemes. In the bright classrooms of Donnie's catholic schools, there are kids and teachers in colorful eighties clothes, but the mood quickly changes as Donnie is sent into Frank's world. The lighting dims, Donnie's ""other"" side emerges, and the entire mood of the film changes effortlessly.The pop tunes are unexpected and still manage to fit perfectly, and the ending selection of Gary Jules' cover of the Tears for Fears song, Mad World, is haunting in the truest definition of the world.There is no question that Richard Kelly put his head and heart into writing Donnie Darko, and although it can become discouraging when, especially after watching the Director's Cut, Kelly believes the ambiguous, mysterious POINT of Darko is meant to be a strictly sci-fi view, we can all continue to watch the film and imagine the many different interpretations.Donnie Darko is the most connective film of the 20th century, perhaps long before that, and probably long after. The fact that it's sometimes difficult to put together the pieces just proves that Donnie is the embodiment of every average teenager: the world isn't always easy to understand. Life isn't always in black and white. And at times, it can seem very, very dark.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Messy but worth the watch,"This movie has been on my watchlist for ages and I had never gotten around to it. Twenty years later and I still think this movie is more even relevant to the social climate as ever.I won't even try to summarize the entire plot since it's been reviewed thousands of times before, since it was one of the weak points for me, but I will attempt briefly. Donnie Darko (Gyellenhaal) is an angsty high school student who is seeing visions of a blue rabbit telling him to commit crimes. The rabbit, named Frank, warns Darko the world end in 28 days and that he is the only one that can stop it.While this doesn't even begin to capture the essence of the story, I think it's a film you need to see in order to understand. However, I do believe the ending was a bit lackluster and there were several plot holes that I had trouble tying up. I do think this is more of intellectual issue rather than a filmmaking issue, but it does making for a very confusing and dissatisfying conclusion.Stylistically, I can appreciate this film for being different and brining a unique spin on the time travel trope. The cinematography and soundtrack brings you right back to the early 00s and it feels almost as an escapist movie to that time period.The film is also incredibly well acted, with a stacked cast including great performances from Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, and Beth Grant. While both Gyllenhaals are good, I personally don't believe that either is their best film.In all, this film is definitely worth a watch but to capture the full message of the movie, multiple rewatches are very necessary. I appreciate the artistic style but think the plot is difficult to follow and does not pay off in the end. Some parts were very slow and I felt myself become very disengaged halfway through the movie. For me, I find it more of a critique of society and human ignorance than anything else.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

I love movie that makes you think,"I do not know how to explain it, but the movie left me a strong taste of heavy psychology and headache bothered me about how the film is built step by step, the film basically a headache, but a good headache.

Great film,"Fantastic movie, weird and wonderful. Great lead performances and some brilliant 80's pop music in the soundtrack by the likes of Tears for Fears and Echo and the Bunnymen. Donnie Darko is one of the best films I've seen in recent years, I look forward to the Directors next film. One of the best endings to a film I've ever seen too. I spotted a couple of nods to other films too, most notably ET, so the director has good taste in films too. If you like films like The Sixth Sense, Signs and Fearless you'll love Donnie Darko.

must see!,"This film is a relief from all the main-stream movies that are out there. Produced by Drew Barrymore, it tells the story of Donnie Darko who is made to do 'bad' things by an evil (is he?) bunny rabbit. But the actions to which Donnie is forced have a somewhat humorous tint to it and allthough it is in no way a comedy, I was entertained by the colourful script writing: Donnie interacting with his teachers, his shrink, friends..And since the rabbit is warning Donnie of impending doom, the closer you get to the end of the movie, the more curious you get what that will be, a nice build up!Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as a disturbed broody young teenager, the way he looks down and tilts his head up, then shows an evil grin, scarier then the bunny for sure!",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Twisted and dark cult film,"With more than a touch of 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'Harvey', albeit with a decidedly odd twist, Richard Kelly's debut feature is a clever and thought-provoking piece of sci-fi.Donnie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled teenager in therapy, a schizophrenic with imaginary friends - Frank the evil rabbit - and aspirations to travel through time. Add to this bodily projections carving out each person's path through life, a mad old lady always checking her mailbox, portals, Graham Greene's classic short story 'The Destroyers', a creepy self-help guru (played by Patrick Swayze), and a girl dance troupe, and gel it all together with an 80s score and that famous cover of 'Mad World', and you have a recipe for success.But does it work? From the strange opening premise, as destruction comes to the Darko house in the form of a fallen jet engine, through to the bleak and haunting finale, it's a valiant try, but for all it's good points, it feels a little sterile and undeveloped.Familiar faces such as Katharine Ross (The Graduate), Mary O'Donnell (Dances With Wolves), Noah Wyle (ER), and Drew Barrymore add interest, but the focus is strictly on Donnie himself, and he ultimately leaves us baffled.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This movie is pretentious trash! Get over it.,"Oh my GOD! If I have to keep listening to people saying this movie is good in any way I will scream. It is pretentious crap. C-R-A-P. The plot makes no sense! In fact there is virtually no plot at all. Even the people who like the movie have said that they have watched it numerous times and still don't fully understand it. It is not a movie to be thought about and pondered as some would lead you to believe. Just trying to think about it is guaranteed to short circuit your brain because there is no logic to this movie. It tries to be witty and cool and dark and funny, but in reality it is just dumb and half baked. The acting is very poor, Jake is at his worst here. The director must have told him to make the same face and deliver his lines in the same monotone way for the whole film. The cinematography is also poor, it looks like a bad student film; a first attempt at doing something stylized. I could have made the same movie with my hand held. I can't understand why all these teens like it. I am 16, but I hate this movie. The only reason that so many people like it must be because the majority of people are dumb and can't tell if a movie is good or not. Also a lot of kids who like it are trying to be non-conformist and emo. They think if the adults don't like this movie it is because ""the man"" is trying to keep it down and rebel by liking it. I went to see it thinking that I would like it, and I really tried to like it but it is just bad. It is a pretension magnet for people who think they know good film. Please do not see this movie, especially if you are not between the ages of 14-22.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

You almost feel sorry for him during the whole movie even though you know the outcome after seeing the movie so many times. It still grips you to see the life of the struggling young guy and his imaginary friend Frank the evil crazy looking bunny. You might have to watch it twice to understand and appreciate Donnie Darko fully but it is certainly worth doing it.

"It will make you laugh, cry, and give you nightmares","When I first heard of Donnie Darko, I was intrigued by the demonic bunny rabbit. I was watching the indie spirit awards on IFC and I saw that it was nominated for a couple things, including best actor, Jake Gyllenhaal, so I decided to check it out. Lets just say my first reaction was wow.The story is about a teenage boy, haunted by a daylight hallucination. A demonic bunny rabbit named Frank, who tells him the world will end on October 30, 1988. He is driven to do things he wouldn't normally do, like flood his school or burn down a ""Love yourself"" guru played by Patrick Swayze. Not normally a role you would see him in. Throughout the story we meet the girl (Jenna Malone) Donnie falls in teenage adolescent love with, ""Grandma Death"" a woman who wrote a book called the Philosophy of Time Travel, An English teacher (Drew Barrymore) trying to get through to her troubled students, a chemistry teacher (Noah Wyle) who tries his best to explain time travel to Donnie without getting fired, and best of all, Frank, who we aren't really sure actually was a person of just a figment of Donnie's imagination. There is a point where they are sitting in a movie theatre and Donnie asks, ""Why are you wearing that stupid bunnysuit?"" His chilling reply is "" Why are you wearing that stupid mansuit?"" Donnie then says ""Take it off."" And we see a boy with a ruined eye. It makes us think. Why do we wear ""Mansuits?"" The diologue fits well in it's minimal amount, and the scenes with no diologue are even better. Actor Jake Gyllenhaal transforms his character magnificently, changing his voice from normal when he is awake, to scared childlike when he is hypnotized or talking to Frank. Jena Malone strives to meet his character, but doesn't quite get there. But then she isn't in it enough to make much of a difference. The conservative parents voting for Bush and Donnie's sister voting for Dukakis represent a tension between generations, and simple messages written on the white board on the fridge (""Where's Donnie?"" or ""Vote Dukakis"") leave us wondering, ""what was that for?"" Director Richard Kelly wrote this as a teenager and as a teenager myself, it is inspiring to learn that we can create beautiful works that traumatize the mind and relate to our lives and experiences. I recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind, or wanting to confuse the hell out of themselves.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

haven't seen much better than this in loooooong time,"This movie blew me away and i have watched it many a time without ever getting bored or sick of it. There are so many different perspectives or ways of interpreting the movie that every time i watch it i discover something new. Casting was perfect as Jake Gyllenhaal brought something to Donnie that perfectly captured the hopelessness and irony of todays youth and his creepy smile that appeared at the most inappropriate times such as when handling the gun and when carrying the axe really caught me by surprise and made me cringe and then giggle my ass off.The plot is generally a boy Donnie has emotional issues and is awoken by his friend Frank, who reappears throughout the film and is saved from death. From here random events lead to Donnie believing he may have the power to affect time and possibly the future. However cryptic and involving this superhero-like drama storyline is what most enthralled me was the sideline stories that took snide swipes at modern society and our insecurities.Such examples of this were the paranoid soccer mum, who screams censorship at the top of her lungs, daytime TV preacher celebrities, self-help and psychiatry (the first hypnosis scene had me rolling in the aisles).However all this social comments do not crowd the film but add level upon level of intrigue and mystery to a complex enough cinematic experience.I would not recommend this to people who generally like simple movies and expect a horror movie because this is so much more than that it cannot be classified so simply into a genre. To true fans i would also recommend the directors cut as it raises even more issues and brings others to light such as ""the manipulated dead"" and the workers. Great movie which is largely considered a try-hard independent film that is not cool because it is too popular but do not fall for that rubbish, this is a true modern classic that really forces serious thought and interpretation as every person who i have watched it with had a different perspective on it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The creepiest and quirkiest time travel movie i've seen,"The story unveils slowly at the opening and gets to normal pace when the characters set in. Yet the story is filled with the constant mood of mysterious happenings and suspicious possible connections. The details are very sketchy, these kept the viewers curious and stay on watching. But some people with less patience will likely be bore off, I know I did feel kind of bored as the story only reveal sketchy hints and details to make out a guess. Yet the finale revelation is nice enough that covers and sums up the entire story into one complete tale. Jake Gyllenhaal acted out just enough to keep the story alive while his sister gets not a very significant role here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
perfect marketing strategy,"This movie is the best marketing strategy of all times!! I believe that the average vote here on IMDb has been raised thanks to a planned marketing strategy (even if IMDb itself could be not aware of it)and the result is that a lot of people (like myself) bought the DVD because of the high rating (also written on the cover of the DVD). Is this movie so good? No, of course. Is mr.Gyllenhaal an actor? Are we sure? 90% of this movie is absolutely boring, I waited all the time for something interesting to happen. What about the time travel explanation? I think that the time travel related episodes in Star Trek are much more interesting and convincing. If you want to see a good sci-fi movie, there are at least 100 movies better than this (you could begin with 12 monkeys). If you want to see a movie that gives space to interpretation, see Mulholland drive (why is it rated below this? Are we crazy?).I will sell my DVD.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the most complex thrillers of our time,"Donnie Darko is one of best movies of our, and possibly, all time. To the dull or weak minded, it will seem boring and without point. The plot contains very deep and very complex meaning. You may find yourself, as I have, watching it time and time again, revealing more and more of the puzzle. The whole picture simply cannot be seen the first time. This complexity coupled with the intense eerie mystery of the movie itself make it grounds for history books in cinematic quality.

A very different kind of teen love story,"This is the only film made over the last 10 years or so since 1995 that I've watched twice, even though it was made for teens and twents and not a middle aged twerp like me. I've always loved off-the-wall sci-fi, all the way from the Epic Of Gilgamesh to Micromegas to Harvey to this, a much neglected modern classic.Basically it remains a well made, languidly photographed love story chockful of teen angst, cynical of the present (1980's) but still full of hope for the future. Oh, it also has the continual butting-in of a metal-rabbit-headed teen from 28 days into the future and a tangential Universe complete with wormholes - but Donnie Can Save The World! Thought-provoking is hardly the word for this film! The DC runs in at a precious and often visually stunning 122 minutes plus 6 minutes credits and a beautifully remastered and tinkered-about soundtrack (Joy Division are now at the Party). The incessant '80's pop music (original recordings) play an important role here in setting the right ambiance - never did like Echo and the Bunnymen though!Overall, although undisciplined in places abounding with non-sequiteurs and pretentious arty-fartiness this is a marvellous film - if you can't like it or even be slightly impressed by its cleverness it's your loss!",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Interesting, worth watching, but ultimately not that great","I have so many friends who are utterly OBSESSED with this movie, I decided finally to watch it. And, while I think it is definitely worth seeing, and didn't lose my interest until near the end, I think ultimately it's a bunch of hooey. I think people who love it are saying ""Woah, it's so DEEP,"" without understanding what is happening in it. I'm also not sure that what's happening in it makes a great deal of sense. Luckily Jake Gyllenthahtehalaal is so adorable no one will mind.None of the performances were that great. Drew B seemed to be in ""I'm a serious teacher--really!"" mode the entire time. I think Jake overdid his smirking and evil grin a bit. The whole thing has an air if indie self importance, and I'm just not convinced it's nearly as important as it thinks it is. It could also be 20 minutes shorter.Nevertheless, it won't leave you feeling THAT cheated, and I say again it's worth seeing. I would describe it as ""Igby Goes Down"" meets ""The Mothman Prophecies."" In fact, the similarities between the mythology here and the hallucinations (and their purpose) in Mothman Prophecies would be an interesting topic. ""Donnie Darko Meets the Mothman!""

Director's Cut,"Richard Kelly wrote and directed this opulent modern vision. It comes straight from his own mind and heart, and it doesn't stop coming until it can only be called his. When such a collaborative thing like a movie can converge as predominantly the ideas of an only fraction of the amount of people who contribute to a film's making, whether or not it is great, you have seen the work of a powerful filmmaker. It is definitively original. Even if it were not so inventive a story, Donnie Darko would still be original because it can most certainly be said to have originated from its maker.It only makes sense for Kelly's story to revolve around a Nietzschean superman in the most close-to-home and identifiable way. A swarthy Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title character, a troubled teen and unassuming madman. Or a superhero. Of course not in the customary mold but nevertheless an individual who makes the ultimate sacrifice to save the world within the view of more recent generations as he shakes the algorithmic fabric of everyday life in his reactions of disgust and vitriol to the hypocrisy of the status quo of his environment.In its refiguring use of time and its uniquely transcendent effect on a single central character, it is deeply reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five. But really, there are different ways to read the fundamental interpretation of the film, though there are many. Kelly is deliberate, though not exactly subtle, in his use of hints through references to Graham Greene's The Destroyers and Richard Adams' Watership Down, the latter apparently new to the Director's Cut. The direct presentation of passages from The Philosophy of Time Travel book give us intermissions to decode the sometimes oddball occurrences in the plot without allowing them approval to go to the extreme and hammer us with infodumps.But while the speculatively supernatural facets reveal a ambitiously vivid imagination, Donnie Darko affords a parallel in its savvy depiction of the real world, the key to which is how the most motivated forces of Donnie's life propel him towards the references I previously mentioned. Kelly portrays what it feels like to be in high school, no matter where you are. In encapsulating the confusion and suffering of high school, he provides observations what could lead young people to acts of violence against their peers. Aside from the right-wing religious dingbats who rail against Donnie's own personal belief system, not to mention those of the tired and repressed characters around him, Kelly shows the casual cruelty of other kids, the posses, the kids who don't fit in, the snail pace and the occasional inspired points in time.Gyllenhaal makes Donnie the ultimate onslaught to adults: Brilliant and inquisitive. Gyllenhaal's performance is acidic, sensitive and beneath it all, crushingly sweet. Kelly familiarly relates Donnie's family life. The scenes between Donnie and his sisters, one of them played by Jake's real life sister Maggie, scream their acquaintances with our own observations throughout life. The parents are truly caring but are often at a loss for how to handle their son. The first scene of dialogue is a cleverly subjective way of looking into a fiscally conservative household who doesn't realize how socially liberal they are. One scene, supposedly newly restored to the Director's Cut, with the father who condemns most people for being full of ...it and commends his son for being a challenge to them, is welcome and reveals another dimension to the older character. And alternative dimension is definitely a prevalent theme.The film ponders the perfect modern query: What if the universe as we know it, not just as we respectively conceptualize it, indeed isn't as we logically perceive it? In making the everyday as complicated as the cosmic, Donnie Darko has the fortitude to endures as a koan to many even in its sensed audience. Kelly headlong facilitates uncensored expression of the universal conscious with broad parody and satire with purposeful psychodrama and reveals action and events no one could foresee but him.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
awesome movie.,"This movie is great. It may be sort of creepy to some, but to me, it's very entertaining, and very deep.

There's a lot of language, I have to say - but it doesn't lessen the greatness of the movie. Donnie and his imaginary friends are really quite interesting. The ending is amazing, and kind of unexpected. Jake Gyllenhaal (I actually think that this was one of his first movies?

Self important flaw,"What people call a love or hate film, pinning down what rubbed me the wrong way about this film is difficult. Friends expected me to enjoy this but I found it self indulgent and grating despite the curious initial x-files-like turn of events. What I would like to know is why the world is ending or if an explanation for it was given in the film? I feel it is a device just to wow the audience or just to add unnecessary weight to the protagonist's heroic gesture to end his own existence. I hate this selfish vein in film where the hero's story exceeds the logical constraints or plot integrity of the world the film has created eg. The Matrix - Neo/Trinity magic kiss or how phones allow entry/exit to matrix world despite being a construction of the matrix (a historical construction of the machines themselves who never chose a pre alexander bell time period?).

But I do remember why I've watched it every time since.Everything about this assemblage of pictures, sounds and ideas works. From the eerie opening scene to the thought- shattering climax, you will love Donnie Darko, Kitty Farmer, and everything in between.A major aspect of the film's success is its quirky atmosphere. The licenced soundtrack, including Echo and the Bunnymen and Joy Division, perfectly sets the 80's mood. Even greater though is the original soundtrack, which can't be described as anything other than haunting, is perfect. Mixed with great camera-work and lighting, Donnie Darko engulfs you in its world.Inside its world are the characters, and there are very few movies with an equal cast. With a mix of stars like Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze, and up-and-comers Jake Gylenhaal and Seth Rogen (!) , Donnie Darko's characters will steal your heart. Donnie is the confused, lonely teenager everyone can relate too, the bullies are legitimately scary, and even the annoying Ms. Kitty Farmer is so sensitive you just won't be able to help yourself from smiling whenever she has a scene. Completed by amazing dialogue, (the dinner, talk of smurfs), the characters and acting in Donnie Darko are another reason to see this movie.Lastly, the story. Simply put, you can't see Donnie Darko once. You may think you understand it, but then the end comes and WHAM you mind is in shambles. It demands several viewings. I've seen it on YouTube, rental, and three times on Blu Ray and still don't understand what truly occurs.

It's in the same genre as ""Final Destination"", but better. Its essentially a teen-horror-SF combo, with a bit of a love story mixed in, but It didn't really grab me.For some reason its set in the 80's, and it reminded me of ""ET"".

Amateur Filmmaking Goes Big Time,"I hated this movie.  The plot made no sense.  There was this whole thing about time travel and worm holes and it was just ridiculous.  They had no real insight to the sci part of this sci-fi piece, which makes it pretty hard to enjoy much less swallow.   As far as acting goes, Jake Gyllenhaal was unbelievably bad.  The fact that he was cast in this part goes to show how amateur this director is.  He showed no ability in any part of the film, especially when he was supposed to be either hypnotized or under the spell of Frank.  And speaking of Frank, the satanic bunny, it seemed like a bad rip off of Paul McCarthy at best or just bad make up design at worse.

The scenes with Frank (especially the one that takes place in the therapist's office against the backdrop of a conversation about the end of the world) are quite frankly some of the scariest things I've ever seen in a movie, as they literally made my skin crawl.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Over Rated,"Read so much about this film that it was inevitable that I be let down by high expectations.  It's good but not great.  Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more had I watched it when I was younger.  Much like what Hal Hartley had over me when I was a teen but not now.Anyhow, the soundtrack was a great throw back to the mid `80s.  And there's this great version of Mad World (Tears for Fears) right at the end.  But then again, it isn't great like the Some Kind of Wonderful soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Psycho-Drama that keeps viewers thinking and provides clever twists,"This movie has Jake Gyllenhaal in one of his finest roles. Along with him, this star-studded cast too leads fantastic roles that really add to the power of this movie. There is a constant struggle between fear and love and the lines are blurred in a way that makes the viewers think. Each plot development makes the story even more intricate and complex, but this movie is meant to be pondered and will take several viewings to be completely understood. The special effects in this movie add to the disorientation that it is supposed to convey. This movie deserves an 8/10 for being a very fresh view on bipolar disorders. I loved the story and found that it always kept me guessing and required some significant thought after the first viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Cult Classic That's Not for Everyone,"""Donnie Darko"" (2001) is one of those movies that people either love or find overrated. It's a surreal psychological thriller with sci-fi elements, exploring time loops, mental health, and existential themes. The atmosphere is eerie, the soundtrack is fantastic, and Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a solid performance as Donnie.That said, the movie's ambiguous nature can be frustrating. Some parts feel overly cryptic, and the pacing drags at times. It's a film that demands multiple viewings to fully grasp, but if you're not into heavily symbolic or abstract storytelling, it might not hit as hard.Overall, it's an interesting watch, but not as mind-blowing as some claim.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not your father's easter bunny,"Greetings again from the darkness.  This is not so much a review as a recommendation.  Wonderful offbeat film directed by newcomer Richard Kelly. Really looking forward to future films from Mr. Kelly as Donnie Darko will be tough to top.  Thought-provoking and mesmerizing, the script will play games with your head as you attempt to keep up.  Excellent turn by the well cast Jake Gyllenhaal (October Sky) as Donnie.  He really captures ""all"" of the character(s).  Jena Malone first caught my eye in the putrid ""Stepmom"" and she shines again here as the only one really trying to accept Donnie. Great to see Katherine Ross back on the screen, albeit with the worst make-up since the original ""Godzilla"" films.  Nice cast, nice script, nice directing.  The pressure is on Mr. Kelly ... we're waiting!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Awful movie alert! Beware!,"I can't possilbly see what's so good about this movie.  It was just total nonsense.  The script was poorly written, some idiotic exaggerations made every possible role a disaster.  The main character was the worst of all, he just... didn't fit!I couldn't really tell about the actors' performances, the script was so horrible.  What could save a movie like this?  A good storyline perhaps?But no.  The story was much much worse.  Especially because it uses ideas from Stephen Hawking in a disgustingly abusive manner.  I can't help but mention this, some may not have understood the movie and thought it was deep or something, but that's not the case:""To travel through time, you must travel faster than the speed of light and then find a wormhole"", this was claimed to be found in Hawking's book, but what it really says it that it's IMPOSSIBLE to travel faster than the speed of light and wormholes have NEVER been found.And the idea about having a liquid timeline growing out of your stomach... do I really need to say anything?So, in conclusion... an awful movie with an awful story, definitely worth a 1.  The only movie I've ever seen worth a 1.  Not even funny, like ""Battlefield Earth"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A fascinating, breathtaking, work of art that is unlike anything ever before.","Donnie Darko is one of the most unique, interesting, and thought provoking films of our time. The film shines on almost every front, from acting, to writing, to cinematography, to its masterful directing style- even when it was only a debut- the film simply has it all. Behind all the usual aspects of great filmmaking though, comes something much deeper, much riskier, and much more clever than most filmmakers have shown on screen before. The intense focus on social commentary, and provoking take on mental illness, makes not only for a interesting narrative but a story that makes it feel needed to be told. The look of the film is deeply enriched in the atmosphere of the 1980's, and makes for a stunning portrait of a time often seen, but not well known. The acting, most exclusively Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie Darko is simply electric and there is no doubt that only he could play the role. Other standouts in the film include Drew Barrymore, surprisingly, Mary MCDonnell, Jena Malone, and Patrick Swayze. In the end, Donnie Darko surpasses the quality of filmmaking for its time, making it not only underrated, but an astonishing piece of art. It's well executed, intriguing, puzzling (in the best sort of way), and downright entertaining, and there will simply never be anything like it.

Ingeniously Imaginative Psychodrama,"An ingeniously imaginative psychodrama, mixing science fiction, teen love story, satire and many other themes. Truly ambitious for a débutant Director, but as someone said 'ambition and imagination trump mediocrity any day of the week'.Many may find it confusing, bizarre or illogical. And even after watching, viewers might come to different conclusions. But there is only one intending story and concept. It's one of the very few movies which required a double viewing and the director's explanation to completely grasp the concept and really enjoy it. The correct order of viewing, understanding and enjoying it would be: 1> see it once, 2> read the explanation on 'http://www.donniedarko.org.uk/explanation/', 3> watch it again. It's completely worth it! The concept is brilliant! Once you understand the whole intended story, it sweeps you off your feet leaving you almost speechless. You'll be in awe how every single thing in the movie falls into place.Jake Gyllenhaal truly stands out in the amazingly rich cast including Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mary McDonnell, Katherine Ross, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Jena Malone, Noah Wyle.The soundtrack is amazing too - goes quite well with the twisted dark fantasy. It starts off with 'The Killing Moon' by Echo and the Bunnymen (the director's Cut uses 'Never Tear Us Apart' covered by INXS). Both are quite good, but I personally liked the Director's Cut soundtrack. The movie ends with the amazing cover of 'Mad World' by Gary Jules.This movie is not for everyone, definitely not for people who watch movies just for the sake of entertainment. Recommended to those who love intelligent & puzzling movies with brilliantly new concepts.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
In the mind of a psycho,"This movie is full of twist and turns that can become confusing to most people. It depicts the story of a high school kid that has a problem with seeing and they slowly become more and more realistic. The movie starts out very funny with Donnie and his older sister arguing at the dinner table while their family eats. They bicker back and forth and it becomes very funny with a few of the insults that they throw across the table at each other. After that the film slowly starts to take a turn to the more mysterious and frightening side of things. This movie is not in category of a horror film by any means, but as the film goes on there are more and more scenes that make you want to crawl under your seat. Is this due to Donnie and his family, or is it from his mental problems? There is a question that can only be answered by watching this hour and 53 min film, and trust me, it is worth every minute of it.
Personally I really enjoyed the movie. Although it became very confusing at some moments, it was all tied together by the end of the movie and made everything a lot better once I could connect the dots.As far as the structure of the film goes, I felt it was very well organized and all of the emotions that the director was going for. When they wanted the audience to laugh or become frightened and uncomfortable it was very clear and worked. The picture was very well done as well with great use of film technique such as the use of close ups, slow motion, parallel action, etc. It was all done beautifully to get the most out of every shot in this film. Overall I really enjoyed the movie and would definitely recommend it to a friend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Description-defying but very original movie about a disturbed adolescent with schizoid fantasies that manages to be charming, disturbing, funny, touching and thought-provoking all in one","Many genres magically and effortlessly blended  supernatural suspense, comedy, sci-fi fable, teen high school romance, adult drama and fantasy. Could watch it many times over. Tears for Fears amongst others soundtrack. Acting is a bit like a very young Dustin Hoffman. Slow fast frames. Oscar material  except it seems, from disclosures made since its release, that this may have been almost luck rather than judgement on the director's part, as his original cut had given the movie a religious slant that would probably have weakened it greatly. Having seen no end of directors make a fool of themselves after an initial hit, the Academy voters may, as they have been known to do, exhibit a tendency to expect people to earn their spurs' rather than voting for what may have been a fluke (cf Sam Mendes with American Beauty, followed by the lamentable Road to Perdition).

"Suspenseful, interesting, intellectual, creepy- a great movie","I thought that Donnie Darko was a really good movie. I saw it a few years ago when it first came out, then I watched it again recently and it's one of those movies where you notice little things the more you watch it. I really enjoyed the symbolism in this movie. I think Donnie represents an ordinary person, just like you and me, trying to deal with the hypocrisy, beliefs and overall difficulties of society. In the movie, there were those conservatives like Kitty and Jon Cunningham, who try to rule the society with their mumbo jumbo about fear and love and everything being bad for everyone. Then, of course, much like real life, Jon is a total hypocrite, who dabbles in the kiddie porn business.This movie is pretty suspenseful, you don't really know who the bunny is, although he makes for an interesting character. Donnie's character is full of surprises, very interesting and intelligent, you tend to feel bad for him. It is really interesting how the story unfolds. I must say that I found myself googling Time Travel after seeing this movie. I highly recommend it to the intellectual movie goer, who isn't looking for something strictly entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This fun movie will make you think but it has enough clues for you to figure it out,"I have just watched Donnie Darko. I must have watched parts of it half-asleep on a red-eye flight, because I had this funny deja-vu feeling about lots of scenes. This only helped the effect of the movie, as you can imagine. I offer below my own personal interpretation of this quirky movie.In my opinion, this movie definitely has a messianic theme. If you notice when Donnie is leaving the movie theater, we can see that ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is showing in that cinema. Why is that important? Because in that movie and book by Kazantzankis, there is also a time-loop involved, after Christ avoids death on the cross and goes on to have a normal life. The result is complete chaos, after which Christ goes back in time and dies on the cross, thereby sparing the world from destruction. Just like in ""Donnie Darko."" (Edit: this messianic role is reinforced when Donnie's girlfriend say that his name sounds like a super-hero name). In ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" it is also open to interpretation if Christ really climbed down from the cross, or if everything was just a vision, a last temptation. Again, just like in ""Donnie Darko."" By dying in the freak accident, Donnie saves the world. (Edit: There's a thread on this interpretation running on the Donnie Darko IMDb Board, previous to this comment, at http://imdb.com/title/tt0246578/board/thread/41699057).Another clue is the title of the book, ""Philosophy of Time Travel."" It is not ""Physics of Time Travel,"" or ""How to Build a Time Machine."" Time travel is never a clear-cut reality in this movie, instead, it's the philosophy behind it that is important. Are we in control of our destiny? Do we have true free-will or is everything pre-determined? Another clue for this is the opening song, ""The Killing Moon,"" by Echo and Bunnymen. If you listen to the chorus of that song, that's exactly this theme it addresses (If by ""he"", you interpret ""fate"").A somewhat similar quirky movie with philosophical undertones is ""Being John Malkovich"". I wish there were more of these types of movies, they are great fun and thought-provoking.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
What if you could go back in time and replace all those hours of pain and darkness with something better...,"I first heard of Donnie Darko when i saw a review for the film by Jonathon Ross on the BBC. I was immediately fascinated by what i was seeing. 'Frank' in his 'stupid bunny suit' and Donnie in his 'stupid man suit'. So, when the DVD was released i had to get it. Returning home i gave a brief outline of the film to my parents. 'It's about a guy called Donnie who speaks to this giant bunny'. Anyway,it was enough to intrigue them and although apprehensive they sat down with me to watch the film.We sat through Donnie Darko enchanted by the beautiful imagery and mesmerising score. From 'Donnie' to 'Gretchen'. And Tears for Fears 'Head Over Heels' to Joy Divisions 'Love Will Tear Us Apart'. The film just oozes a style and sophistication barely recognisable. The film is a fascinating portrayal of life and has a serving of every film genre. The love story between 'Donnie' and 'Gretchen'. The horror between 'Donnie and 'Frank'. As well as a helping of quick whit comedy and drama that I can associate with everyday life. Drew Barrymore is fantastic as Donnie's English Teacher. And Beth Grant also shines as the infuriating 'righteous one',Kittie Farmer. In fact the whole support cast are genuinely individual and believable. Patrick Swayze as 'Jim Cunningham' is a character that shows evil and deceit stretches through all walks of life. Regardless of social status and reputation.Donnie's caring parents and his turbulent relationship with his older sister 'Elizabeth' (a relationship I compare with me and my twin brother). It's because Donnie Darko makes it so easy to believe the characters that the film is a good account of how 'normal' people view others as 'strange' or,'weird'. The film gave me the chance to make up my own mind as to what it meant. After endless discussions with family and friends,Donnie Darko still lets my imagination run wild. Being a keen fan of Horror and Steven Spielberg films I like the references to 'Evil Dead' in the 'Portal' scene and 'E.T. in the 'Cellar Door' scene. It is without doubt in my top five films of all time and films of this calibre come around all too rarely.The film emphasises to me that as a Race,our existence depends on acceptance and equality for all. While at the same time showing a togetherness in times of need and hurt. Donnie laughing at his own fate at the end of the film emphasises this to me. In my eyes the films acceptance depends on what you believe in. What is fate? What is real? What is fake? Why do we dream? Why are we here? Do you believe in deja-vu or,a parallel Universe? Or,how about Portals? The fact is we all have our own ideals and beliefs and I see a lot of mine in Donnie Darko. Through life comes death and through dark comes light. That is what the film means to me and that is the way I see life. Donnie Darko is a refreshing take on the way we view life and death as individuals. It is indeed a 'Mad World' and video is a form of escapism.Without films like Donnie Darko what would we do? Go mad i suppose. With films like Donnie Darko in it the world is a better place. Richard Kelly is a legend and I know that with his very existence on earth that there is so much to look forward to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
different strokes... if you know what I mean,"There seem to be a lot of people who like this movie.  I won't argue taste, but different strokes for different folks, if you know what I mean. I won't claim to have better tastes than the average movie-watcher, but we have a group that meets every Thursday night to watch a movie and talk about it.  Initially two people out of eight liked this movie, and one changed her opinion halfway through the discussion, Why are the people who do like this movie so vociferous?  In my group, we all decided that it was pretentious because the filmmakers couldn't decide on what to say-- or even if they had anything to say at all. Most of us complained at some point during the movie about it's lack of authenticity.  There were several points where we had to actually stop the movie to argue about whether it was worth continuing with. Again, I don't like to say i have better tastes than 90% of the rest of the country, but quite frankly, what is the appeal of this movie among IMDB viewers?  Reviewers keep remarking on how much of a genius Richard Kelly is, how great the performances are, and how good the soundtrack is, but what is your basis of comparison?  In my group, we finally decided the movie would appeal to persons under 23 years of age who were 6 or 7 years old and heard the music of the film through their older siblings' doors during playtime.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
open your mind,"This movie is on my top 5 list of all time. This is one of the few movies that I can sit there and get more enjoyment when i see it over and over again (which is rare in my case).I didn't want to see this movie after i saw bubble boy. I was surprised by the performances. Even Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore did a great job. Every movie I've seen them in is usually Hollywood garbage (Charlie's Angels, Black Dog, etc.). Granted, they probably didn't get paid that much doing this movie.This movie is great because you can come to your own conclusions about the story. After the movie you can talk to your friends about what you believed just happened and what was hard to understand about the movie. You don't get these conversations after seeing 'Van Helsing' (""I wonder why this movie was ever made"").A lot of people will not like this movie because it requires you to think, which is fine by me. This movie has a huge cult following as it is and doesn't need everybody to enjoy it.The look of the film is amazing. The film represents the weird emotions of high school and youth, mixed with science fiction. You're on the edge of your seat to see what will happen at the end of the film. You get all the clues of why events are happening and you still don't understand at the end of the film, but you take these theories for the next time you watch the film.I hope more movies like this come out with a similar look and imagination.

I don't want to give any of it away, but still help you understand it. This story is as creative as it follows an almost Meet Joe Black type storyline, and does it 4 times better. The great thing is that the movie is actually really funny, but it is all dark humor, but it is all hilarious. However, it's not a comedy, and actually has a very deep story of the teen years, being different, and loving someone. I won't say that it has an exact Romeo and Julliet type love story, but it's pretty similar. For everything else, it has all the things I like about a Quentin Terrantino movie, and it doesn't sacrifice anything else.The performances are some of the best I have ever seen. This is Drew Barrymore's best role, at least what i have seen her in. Very Different from what you normally see, but it's outstanding, and incredibly well done. Jake Gyllenhall was fantastic to say the least. There are maybe 3 people who I think could have done Donnie Darko the right way, and he is top of my list.

Bluddy Genius,"A great film, I really enjoyed it. The narrative is based around the life of a mentally troubled teenager called Donnie and his inability to come to terms with the problems and turmoil of the world around him. I felt this was a very engaging and clever plot as the film is trying to communicate the message of how hard it is to connect and understand the thoughts and feelings of teenagers today. This allowed me to relate to the character of Donnie and enabled me to understand what he was experiencing. This gives the film a real personal feeling, which made me feel like I was going through the exact same emotions as the characters, especially Donnie.The casting was superb. Jake Gyllenhal was faultless playing the role of Donnie. He managed to capture the real essence of Donnie's negativity towards life and his vulnerability to the outside world that he doesn't understand. Recognised figures in the acting community such as Noah Wyle, Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore put in distinctively esteemed performances to give the film an extra edge and separates it from other cult classics. The only downfall to this film is the complexity of the ending. Although it ties in with the films highly complicated and sometimes bamboozling storyline, the ending poses a very confusing finale to what is a great film. However, this may also work in the film's favour as it just adds to the mystery, provoking the audience to want to watch again so they can try to come up with a conclusion to the elaborate finish. I personally love the ending. Though it can be perceive as sad, I thought it was the perfect manner to finish off this thoroughly entertaining masterpiece. All in all, Donnie Darko is an overly elaborate, dark and yet ingenious film and one of the best I have ever seen. The characters are believable, the narrative is captivating from start to finish and it leaves you with that feeling of confusion, intrigue and desire to watch repeatedly that makes the film of the highest quality.

The ultimate Sci-Fi film with true realism,"Donnie Darko (Gyllenhaal) suffers from visions of a rabbit called Frank who orders him to commit a series of crimes and tells him that the world will end in 28 days time.The Sci-Fi genre has always been open as to what is out there in the universe, discovering new and exciting worlds and dimensions, and an ideology which today is still being experimented with is time travel, which is explored beautifully in Richard Kelly's absorbing and open Sci-Fi drama.Can time travel be achieved? With all the evidence collected in this 2001 film it seems so, and the persistent view, looking at all the possibilities such as worm holes and vessels carries all the way through to an open and stunning climax as we follow one of the most interesting characters of all time.Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain) leads in only his second major film as Darko, a distant teenager who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and Jake creates a modern day teenage icon, a simple enough guy who lashes out at the world and stands by his own beliefs, and not to mention the Halloween costume is one of the best in cinematic history.Jena Malone (Into the Wild) Barrymore (E.T) Swayze (Dirty Dancing) lend great support to with their character's personalities and opinions.This is an opinionated film with plenty of ideas to engage you into thinking mode. Kelly helps add an extra dimension to this film by including modern day issues such as religion, teenage rebellion, and fear.The use of God mixed with the complex idea of time travel achieves a dark but colourful imagination and controversy to the narrative.Darko's actions against the school and bullies is a conflict between his beliefs and the schools rules and is especially significant to the overall picture, and Kelly's direction for the first vandalism ""They made me do it"" is terrific in achieving that drama and black comedy.The use of fear being negative and love as positive is a great reflection on human emotion and behaviour, and goes a long way to shaping the characters and is a terrific reflection on modern day rules and Darko proves a point in that emotions simply don't fall into these two categories, inviting audiences in to his world and sharing his opinion.This film justifies the drama genre through these realistic issues, and dives deep into the fantasy genre with Darko's visions of a rabbit that can see the future. Frank is the ultimate fantastic fantasy creation, a simple but highly effective symbol, as is this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One For The Ages,"I ended up renting Donnie Darko about a year ago, seeing it at the store. I had heard of it before, and just blindly decided to rent it after seeing the cover. Once the movie began and all the way till after it finished, I knew it was definitely something special.From the 6-ft bunny rabbit, to Jake Gyllenhaal's spell-binding performance, to the freaky plot and thrilling, intertwining story, to Richard Kelly's imagery and imagination, this is personally one of the greatest movies of all time, a massive achievement in film of the 21st century. For movies like Pirates of the Caribbean and Spider-Man to rip up the box office and have such great success, with independent flicks like Donnie Darko to be pushed aside is unbelievable and horrible to see.Although dark, psychologically trancing, mind-fillingly creative, Donnie Darko has made a major impact on the many who have watched it. A classic cult-hit teen movie. If you watch it, you will have to watch it again. An addicting, awe-inspiring tale of unparalleled psychological thrilling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
wow,"a great flick. i watched it again for the first time in a few years, and it was like the first time. i think everyone can relate to this. unless they are living in a f*cked up altered reality based on the notions of half an hour sitcoms, reality shows and the Hollywood bullsh*t that they put out like every week. taking jobs seriously. filling up your SUV with good old American pride. watching MTV. fox news. 15-30 second commercial spots. clear channel. if you're brain has been modified to accept this new gar barrage, don't waste your time watching this. this is still probably in my top 10 favorite films. dick and bush have an aids baby via condee called Texas (your mother). eat a dick. although there is a lot of pop music in Donny darko, i think it is used pretty tastefully. a good flick overall.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Watershed,"I did what a lot of people have done after watching this movie: I watched it again. Between the ""Director's Cut"" and the original version, the commentary tracks and outtakes, I have absorbed this work repeatedly. It's endlessly fascinating. Richard Kelly has done what Joseph Campbell has said a good storyteller must do, which is to take a myth and dramatize it. The myth Richard Kelly used is one he himself created. Just as Yeats had a construct of what he called ""gyres"" informing his poetry, Kelly has his timeline. I would say that the timeline helped him flesh out a primal story. Studying the backdrop to DONNIE DARKO is obviously legitimate (as are studies of Yeats's gyres) but, in order to be moved by this work, the viewer does not have to have it charted out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Speechless, One of the best movies i've seen in a long time","I didn't know about this movie since i saw on the internet that it was similar to American beauty. I wasn't so excited about watching it, but i had nothing more to watch. Jake G. plays an excellent role as Donnie Darko, the movie shows us how down to earth can be a crazy person. The more you watch the movie the better it gets, i was waiting for the end to come all the time, because there where so many questions, and then, when finally the end comes, it completely blow your mind, i'm not overrating the movie, and do think it's extremely worth watching it. MASTERPIECE. I wish i could erase my memory and watch it again and again. It's quite complex, so you should pay attention every second. GO AHEAD AND BUY IT.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
