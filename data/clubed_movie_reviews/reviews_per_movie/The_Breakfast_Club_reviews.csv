Time of your life,"Depending on when you watched this first (or will watch it), it will determine how much impact this will have. Obviously if you've watched it back in the day, sentiment will kick in too. And while I wouldn't go as far as to say this hasn't aged well at all, there are some indicators that the impact today for some new viewers will not be the same as back then.Having said that, the movie still holds up, as we get some missfits thrown in together and mixed up. All with different backgrounds, all with different issues and problems. All rebelling in their own way though. Against the ""teacher"" of course. But the authority figure here stands for more and the class struggle, the growing up struggle, the maturing struggle, the being in school struggle - all stand for something. So while you may not feel the biggest association with any of the characters, if you really dig into the movie, there is much to find here",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You pay after you play.,"One of the best if not the best brat pack flick. John Hughes writes and directs this dramatic comedy about five Chicago high school kids that are from different circles and stations in life being forced to spend a Saturday together in detention. Before the day is over this group finds out that they have more in common than they thought and even some friendships are created. The very impressive cast includes:Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall and Molly Ringwald. Paul Gleason plays the hapless teacher trying to contain the group and then there is John Kapelos as the custodian. This is a don't miss and is fun to watch over and over again. Spit that gum out and remember to ask for a hall pass.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Remember yourself,"We all remember being a teenager.  A crazy, intense time when your high were higher and your lows were lower, and every experience was that much more significant.John Hughes movie brilliantly captures that environment, that era in our lives, and all the social rifts that we all helped to create for ourselves. I have heard it said that ""The Breakfast Club"" is melodramatic, overacted, and simplistic.  If you subscribe to that flippant perspective you might as well join Vernon in his office because you are doing the same thing that he did.  Seeing the movie as you want to see it, in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions.If you really want to understand this film, think back to your own high school days.  Think about your last year there.  Dig out your old diary or book of angstful poems and reaquaint yourself with who you were then, when you felt things more deeply.  ""The Breakfast Club"" does not exist not for highschool kids, as some suggest.  Why would they need it?  They live there. It exists for all of us who have already been through there, who feel that they are above it now.  It exists so that we can remember what it was like and better understand ourselves, and the next generation.  Because you can't dismiss something you understand.",,Anonymous,Comedy
The cream of the crop in 80's fare.,"This movie is one of the best, if not THE best, 80's film there is.  The fact is, every teen character in this movie can be related to someone we knew in high-school.  As a child of the 80's, I can honestly say that this is a representative cross-section of every high school in North America. The geek, the jock, the outcast, the rich pretty-girl snob, and the future criminal.  They all exist, to some degree or another, in the classrooms of every high school on the continent.What makes this film rise above the rest is the character development. Every character in this film is three-dimensional.  They all change, in one way or another, by the end of the film.  Whether or not things remain the way they are long after this film ends is unknown, and that adds to the rama.  The most important scene in this film is when the characters, as a group, all open up to one-another and describe the hell that their daily school routines are in a personal fashion.  Nobody likes the role they must inevitably portray in the high-school scene, but the fact is, it is often inescapable.  This film gives the viewer some insight into how the other people around them might have felt during that particular time in their lives.Each of the main characters in this film shines, but Judd Nelson (John Bender) and Emilio Estevez (Andrew Clark) rise above the rest.  Simply put, these two actors each put their heart and soul into their respective characters, and it shows.At the end of the film, the viewer is left to make their own conclusions as to how things will carry forth.  And I'm sure that most people will do that. This is one movie that left me feeling both happy and sad for each of the characters, and it isn't easy to make me care about a film in that way. Even if you aren't a fan of the 80's genre, this isn't one you would want to miss.My Rating:  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A love letter to all high school loners,"I must admit that I was a true loner in high school, and essentially I'm now at 33 I'm still a loner who has become a bit more jaded with the passage of time.  With that said, John Hughes ""The Breakfast Club"" seems to me to be a sort of love letter to all of us who just seemed to blend into the background during our high school years.  Of course like everyone I also have a favorite character in the film, and my choice is Allison who is wonderfully played by Ally Sheedy.  So, my advice to all who have read this far is to try and watch this film with your emotions rather than trying to analyze the film to death.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best movies ever,"After reading some of the negative comments made about this movie, i decided to make some of my own.  Yes, to younger viewers,this movie will appear to be outdated. The only thing ""outdated"" is the clothing styles and the music. It doesnt matter what year you went to high school or what school you even went to, there will always be a ""criminal"", a ""jock"", a ""princess"", a ""nerd"", and a ""basket case"". This movie is the best teenage movie, no matter when you are a teenager!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of my (personal) favorite comedies. John Hughes strikes again!,"Parents have never understood the youth of the world. Elvis used to be evil. Now he's too tame for modern music enthusiasts. Just imagine how tame Eminem will seem years from now. And as a scarier thought, who (or what) could be worse than some of the singers on today's market?John Hughes is locked in a time capsule, still bearing the mind of a teenager, and he is able to tap into these feelings of teenage angst. That is what separates ""The Breakfast Club"" from, say, ""The New Guy,"" or one of those other stupid teen films of recent years.And the jerk, played by Judd Nelson, isn't meant to be cool. He is a jerk, and if older viewers took the time to pay attention to the film, they would perhaps realize that the point of the film, from the very beginning, is to establish that this so-called jerk is only acting like one to get attention. Because he is obviously shunned at home. He's an outcast. And unlike other films that refuse to establish their characters, ""The Breakfast Club"" introduces him as a jerk, and proceeds to explain why he is that way. This is what makes this movie tick.I knew a kid like Bender (Nelson) once when I was in school, and generations of kids continue to go through the exact same things. Once they reach a certain age, though, it seems as though all adults suddenly break away from the teenage emotions. John Hughes never did, I guess. (Although he certainly tapped into adult behavior with his best film, ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" [1987], a welcome introduction to Hughes' adult comedy, hinted at in ""Vacation"" [1981], which he wrote.)The film opens with a quote from David Bowie that just about sums the entire film up. We are introduced to five kids spending eight hours of detention at Shermer High School in Illinois. They are: Andrew the Jock (Emilio Estevez), Brian the Nerd (Anthony Michael Hall), Bender the Criminal (Judd Nelson), Claire the Princess (Molly Ringwald), and Allison the Basketcase (Ally Sheedy). They are looked over by the school principal (Paul Gleason), who assigns them the task of writing a report on why they are here in detention and what they did to get there.To say that the outcome is predictable is an understatement. We know who's going to get together with whom from the beginning, but getting there's all the fun. Watching the characters come to appreciate their differences and learn that they're more than just billboard examples of angry teenagers is more than half the fun.Teenagers are not as unaware of who they are as some people always think. John Hughes knew this, and deliberately tapped into this state of mind as no other director has done before -- or since, for that matter. Sure, they've tried. (Hughes' ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" was just about the only other film that tried to show teenagers as something more than stupid hormone-crazy rambunctious adolescents, but as young adults who were trying to grow up fast -- the scene where Ferris and Sloane pretend their water is wine is good evidence of this.)Hughes' teenage characters were not the clichés they are now when ""The Breakfast Club"" came out in 1985 -- this film has proved to be the steeple of teen clichés (many of them poked fun at in ""Not Another Teen Movie,"" which features a cameo by Ringwald). Think of ""2001"" or ""Halloween"" -- the drifting spaceships and psycho killers chasing sex-hungry teenagers is now routine, but it wasn't then. The Jock, The Nerd, The Criminal, The Princess, and The Basketcase weren't clichéd back then, either -- although Hughes purposely chose these references to the characters in order to let Brian, The Nerd, say that they were more than just that in the beginning of the film when he's reading his essay in voice-over narrative.I seriously doubt whether this film is any better than the work of Coppola, Cortiz, Kurosawa, Scorsese, Welles, et al. If I were assembling a list of ""the greatest movies ever made,"" I'd never include this.But sometimes the greatest films aren't just the films that are technically perfect, but those that connect to you on one level or another. I know that my all-time favorite comedy (""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"") may not be considered better than something such as ""Some Like it Hot,"" but that film doesn't affect me the same way. I either don't connect with the story, the characters, the feelings, or I just don't appreciate the film as a whole. I appreciate ""The Breakfast Club"" in many ways, and for that reason it will always be considered one of my favorite films. Even if it is kinda sappy.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Brat Pack Classic,"In this film five very unlikely students end up becoming friends during a Saturday detention. They end up opening up to one another and learning more about each other in one day than most learn in years of friendships. After the discoveries made throughout the day, they decide to call themselves The Breakfast Club. With all these students learn and go through together, it would be best said that it is a coming of age film with hints of judgment and stereotyping: many things in which teenagers go through at this time in their lives.For Clair (Molly Ringwald) and Andrew (Emilio Estevez), they fall under the popular clique so they have had previous interactions. While the nerd of the morning falls on Brian (Anthony Michael Hall). Then, there is always that troubled one in the group whose home life make them the bad-ass they get labeled is that Bender (Judd Nelson). Lastly, what group would be complete without that of the kooky member, which falls to Allison (Ally Sheedy). Without each of these roles the coming together, the group may not have had as large an impact in how they end up by the end of this film. In some small way, they take steps in no longer caring what others may think. Instead, they think for themselves, for the future.Everything occurs for the most part in one room of a school and with this simple setting, using open lighting helps one put more focus on each character and how they change through out the day. Allison and Bender seem to have the most growth during the movie. Sheedy does an amazing job in the beginning showing off the eccentric side of Allison. While Bender keeps his hard edge. It makes it more understandable who he is and what he silently needs. He finds out those things in this group of different kids – people he never dreamed he could befriend. But in each other, they all find what none of them could find before – themselves.In some ways, no matter the decade, I think this movie shows that you can find the best things in life in the most unlikely of places; certainly these five students did. Every adolescent has felt or been in a situation where they could relate to one or more of these characters whether it was like the odd one out like Allison, the nerdy geek like Brian, the troubled like Bender or the popular/jock standing like Clair and Andrew. Everyone is being judged by others that are different from them. It's a part of coming of age.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"dated, but likable","This is one of those movies I think I would have loved in high school. But being half way done with college, I think I watched it way too late in life to fully enjoy it. The film itself is fairly boring. High school kids in detention discovering there is more to people than stereotypes. But the message of the movie is accurate. In high school you are a prisoner to your cliche. Even if you like someone as a person if they're in a different cliche high school won't let you 'hang out' more or less. I admire John Hughes for hitting the nail on the head about what high school is really like. I wish Hollywood made more movies about high school that were this honest. Great 80's music as well, I might add.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Quite simply one of the best teen films of the 80s,"Five teenagers are assigned detention on a Saturday morning and afternoon. They are a jock (Emilio Estevez), a hood (Judd Nelson), a rich girl (Molly Ringwald), a geek (Anthony Michael Hall) and a basket case (Ally Sheedy). During the course of the detention (and with a little help from marijuana) they open up and talk and begin to know each other.A dead on target examination of teen life in 1984/85. This was a very challenging thing to do--release a film about teens just talking and relating to each other. It also was (unjustly) awarded an R rating for the frequent swearing--but that's how high schoolers talk!I was in college when this came out, but I saw it with a friend who was still in high school. According to him the movie got everything right--the clothes, dialogue, styles and music were accurate. He said it was one of the few movies that accurately showed how he felt. I felt the same way. I think any teenager can relate to this movie. The movie is somewhat unpleasant (some of the kids really attack each other verbally) but there's plenty of comedy mixed in too.The cast: Estevez (what ever happened to...) is just great as the jock. He gives a very believable and moving performance especially in a speech about his father. Nelson, however, is horrible as the hood. He looks the part but he's way too eloquent and his acting was pretty bad. Ringwald and Hall are perfect in their roles, but they WERE teenagers when this was filmed. Sheedy does what she can with a criminally underwritten role. John Kapelos (as a janitor) is hardly in it (I'm assuming his part was severely cut) and Paul Gleason (a good actor) is given a very 1-dimensional role--the evil adult. He does what he can with it.The movie isn't perfect--parents are the root of all the kids problems; there are annoying lapses in logic (like how does Ringwald get to see Nelson at the end and Sheedys character wasn't assigned detention, so wouldn't Gleason know that) and there is a whole dance sequence squeezed in.Still--a truly great teenage movie. A definite must-see. A bonus is that the movie opens with one of the best songs of the 1980s (and a big hit)--Simple Minds ""Don't You Forget About Me"". This is rightfully considered a classic.""Who'd your mom marry--Mr. Rogers?"" ""No--Mr. Johnson""",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Still Worth watching in 2021,"I was 14 in 1984 and this film didn't really grab me back then; however, as an adult now I decided to revisit it and thoroughly enjoyed it.
First off - it's not a comedy. There some humorous moments that work and some that definitely don't work.
Where the film really hits the mark is when we begin to see the background from which these 5 kids come.
Initially we are presented with them as being poles apart in terms of their academic achievements, physical abilities or artistic talents but as the movie progresses each character reveals a bit more about their relationship with their parents - and how they themselves are affected by either their parents expectations of them or their parents maltreatment of them.
The film really comes together when they begin to realise that they all share this common theme.Looking at it through a 21st century lens, and given the characters are schoolchildren- some of the script can be uncomfortable to listen to and watch, and would certainly not even be considered if it were made now, but If you understand that it was 1984- and we thought quite differently then, you will definitely come away with a very positive experience from having watched this.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Misses its own point, a sadly overrated experience","It had promise, but it wasted it all. The Breakfast Club is one of those movies that sound beautiful but when I watched it I found it undercooked in almost every way and then the ending was cloying, featured bipolar characters and went completely against the message it was trying to send.I'll give the film props for the five exceptional performances. Estevez and Ringwald inhabit their characters well, but the show is stolen completely by Anthony Michael Hall as Brian the Dork and Ally Sheedy as Allison the Basket Case. Judd Nelson is firmly in control of his character all times and is completely superb at all times. Whatever the characters need to do is handled superbly by the actors. John Hughes also provides key directorial choices, such as the character's lunches and how Hughes' characters completely ignore Brian because despite all their problems he is still the least popular. The dance scene in the film is delightful in isolation and there's something beautiful about watching the three boys in particular dance together.he Breakfast Club has a beautiful message that never gets across. I never bought any of the friendships because large portions of the plot felt rushed. It takes over an hour for the kids to even get on good terms. After that, there's some good stuff, but let me break down why The Breakfast Club craps the bed on its own message.It's meant to be a story about how five people with problems can become friends for one day. How are the relationships at the end of the film:Bender and Andrew: Bender antagonises Andrew several times and then this point is abandoned.Bender and Brian: The closest thing to a character arc is that Bender acknowledges Brian's existence.Bender and Claire: The romance with Claire is completely forced because just when they start to kindle positive words, he is horrible to her, then they kiss? It's like there are scenes missing.Bender and Allison: NothingAndrew and Brian: Andrew is the first to be kind to Brian. There's a hint of something there when it's revealed that Andrew beat up one of Brian's type of kid. Then, nothing.Andrew and Claire: Nothing beyond a scene at the start where the two are established as the only two likely to interact.Andrew and Allison: He finds her very strange until she looks pretty on the outside. Then they kiss.-Brian and Claire: Probably the most underrated connection, she responds and says that its okay to be a virgin (as we later find out that she is as well), a huge deal from one of the most popular girls in school. Brian later finds the courage to tell her to shut up when she condescends him. However, this goodwill is all undone when she manipulates him with compliments into doing all of their detention essays for them. Rather than parting as equals, Brian ends up being the bottom of the barrel.Brian and Allison: The two most likely to interact with other members of the Breakfast Club, this is undone by chucking Allison into a romantic interest with the cool Andrew.-Allison and Claire: No interaction between the girls until Claire suddenly decides to make Allison look pretty. Honestly, I think she looked better before.The problem here is that all of the relationships are forced, counter-productive and harmful to each other. Rather than feeling touched, I came away feeling sour because now Brian is the fifth wheel for a pair of couples when the film had no business doing that. Brian is in a way the most important character of the film, and likely the one that many identify with the most. However, his character is completely left out in the cold because now we have two couples. Now instead of remembering the day - and Breakfast Club - fondly, both boys will just remember their respective girl. Honestly, I think Brian was better off without The Breakfast Club.I don't agree with a number of directorial and writing choices, notably the emotional manipulation of the audience who are supposed to feel something for Bender distracting Vern so the others can return safely to the library undetected. Are we meant to forget that they left to fetch weed (something I can't see Brian or Claire doing) and only at Bender's urging to begin with? Vern is used inconsistently throughout - he hears raised voices at the beginning of the film and yet cannot smell marijuana smoke or hear a person falling through a roof. His interactions with Bender are also inconsistent, with Bender suddenly affected by his insults even though they only marginally differ from what he's been saying before.Instead of its beautiful message, The Breakfast Club goes forward and imparts the following:Nerds get nothing in life.The Breakfast Club is about romance not friendship.Look pretty so boys will like you.Weed makes everything better.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Definitive High School Movie,"Without a doubt, this is my favorite movie of all time. The quotes, the drama, the heart this film brings is just pure perfection. All of the cast gives someone to relate to. Brian, the 'brain', Andrew, the 'athlete', Allison, the 'basket case', Claire, the 'princess', and Bender, the 'criminal'. They all give a view to their personal lives and why they're there in the first place, which is something else that the audience can relate to. They may be different people at the beginning of the movie, but by the end, like the poster suggests, they are touched in a way they could never imagine. The way John Hughes directs the movie is why this film is pure 80s goodness. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie needs to watch it RIGHT THIS SECOND.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Breakfast Club,"The Breakfast Club, a perfect display of the shenanigans and relative life stories of kids in an ""unsupervised"" detention. This classic 1985 film from director John Hughes shatters social barriers and cliques that still exist in schools today. This film not only teaches life lessons, but also provides a good laugh. From the phenomenal storyline to the top-notch acting, this movie receives a definite thumbs-up.The story begins with five high school teenagers, each coming from a different clique within Shermer High School, spending an entire Saturday in detention together. There is Andy, the jock (Emilio Estevez); Claire, the princess (Molly Ringwald); John, the delinquent (Judd Nelson); Allison, the basket-case (Ally Sheedy); and Brian, the brain (Anthony Michael Hall). They all know nothing about each other, and while in detention are expected to write an essay explaining who they think they are as people. Soon they realize that they are not really sure who they are, and that even though they aren't from the same cliques, they are more alike than they had originally thought.Each actor sells their role perfectly as a high school student. From their body language to their facial expressions, they all suit the role of a teenage adolescent perfectly. Judd Nelson plays a great ""criminal"" in school with his extremely laid-back body language, giving even more support to his don't-care attitude. Then there is Emilio Estevez playing the jock, Andy, and his macho man athlete status. Estevez's monotone voice and his ability to show no fear from his facial expressions contributes to his status of the ""big man on campus"", and that is a credit to Estevez as an actor. These are only two small examples, as the entire cast does a wonderful job.Not only do the actors put on a superb performance, but the plot of the film is excellent, basically tearing down all social norms in schools in 1985, norms that are still present today. Stereotypically, jocks don't get along with nerds, and troublemaker-tough-guys like Bender don't really get along with well, anyone. It's interesting in this movie to see how a little turmoil between characters can be solved with just a little conversation, and of course with a little help from some marijuana smoked in the school library.This movie has it all; laughs, crazy antics, and all the drama of high school cliques. With great acting, and an amazing storyline, it's hard to find a reason not to see this movie. It is so easy to relate to since most people already know the experience of high school and the certain social groups, or eventually will know someday. The Breakfast Club is a prime example of how difficult it is to really know everything about someone, and how closely people's lives can be related, no matter where they come from. This film has a funny way of teaching valuable life lessons, and also gives an idea of maybe how tolerance of others can help bring people together. There is no doubt that this movie is a must-see, and is absolutely worth the time.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Cool, fresh and relevant- another classic John Hughes film","While I slightly prefer Planes, Trains and Automobiles, this along with Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of John Hughes' better films. It isn't a perfect film I agree as admittedly the characters are clichéd and there are minor logic lapses, but here's the thing- the more I see The Breakfast Club the more I like it. It still has its freshness, and while I never had a detention when I was in school even from what I've heard from people who have this actually makes detentions cool. And it is still relevant not only to the teenagers back then but now too, it does ring true a vast majority of the time what with its justified grievances, self-pitying whinges and hard-hitting home truths. The cinematography is nice and fluid, typical Hughes really, and the soundtrack adds to the film's coolness. Hughes directs wonderfully, and the script and story are well written and I think memorable. While their characters are clichéd, that I agree, the cast do a great job with what they have. Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall and especially Molly Ringwald give very appealing performances and interact well together. In conclusion, I love this film, while not perfect I like it more every time I see it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Enforced socialization,"The 80s was the decade of the Brat Pack and the decade of John Hughes who did films that spoke to teens and 20 somethings of the era. His enduring classic was The Breakfast Club a character study of a cross section of teen America of the Reagan years.In my childhood and adolescent years the culture had a great divide on what made the young tick. The model were shows like Leave It To Beaver and The Donna Reed Show. All the kids were wholesome and clean cut. The polar opposite was found on the big screen in Rebel Without A Cause and dozens of pale imitations of hot rodding kids. And the girls for the most part were just orbiting satellites around the males.That's the most radical thing about The Breakfast Club I Found. The teen princess Molly Ringwald and the weird girl Ally Sheedy are most definitely not satellites around the males. Although Ringwald could have shown up on The Donna Reed Show she like the others is a complex character with her own issues regarding school and life. Sheedy was something unique, an oddball who not only doesn't fit in but regards that as a virtue. Not that people weren't like her in real life, but just not shown on the big screen or small.The 'good' kids are jock Emilio Estevez and overachiever scholar Anthony Michael Hall. Superficially both of those could be Donna Reed or Brady Bunch characters. What's revealed is both are just trying to fit into their assigned niches in life and both question why is there so much pressure to succeed. One has suicidal intentions because of it.Judd Nelson is your James Dean character, good but truly the least original of all the charter members of The Breakfast Club. He could truly have been part of the motorcycle clique that Dean belonged to in Rebel Without A Cause. Dean himself bared his soul, Nelson took a bit longer to do it on the screen. For him and Sheedy detention is just part of the day. The other three are new to it and in the normal course of school day they would not be caught dead associating with these two or in fact each other. They all have their cliques except Sheedy who is a total loner. In the end they find they have a lot of the same issues and anxieties. Detention enforced socialization on them.Paul Gleason plays the school principal and in his career he took out a patent on these authority figures who are so alien to the kids. He did the part of the principal in so many films and TV shows his appearance almost became expected like Margaret Dumont in a Marx Brothers comedy. The Breakfast Club became his signature part.The Breakfast Club is a true classic, long and deep on character almost like a Eugene O'Neil play.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Another Over-rated 80's Feel Good Flick,"I can't say I hate this work, but I definitely think it's just another over-rated feel-good flick from a lost era.

Welcome to the writing for future teenage generations that is John Hughes!,"John Hughes was truly a magnificent writer for teenagers of the 80's. Even though a lot of people hated his previous works, it doesn't matter since many people have flaws in their career once in a while. Well, this is one of John Hughes's well-written classics: The Breakfast Club. It follows a group of teenage kids who have done something to get them to have detention on Saturday!(Bummer having to stay in that school on a weekend!) Sounds pretty simple huh? Well, later on the characters get to know each other thanks to the brilliant writing from John Hughes! Judd Nelson plays Bender who in the movie is called ""the Criminal"" and is a straight up asshole but in a cool way. The lovely Molly Ringwald plays Claire who attempts to hide things from people kinda like bottling her emotions. Plus there are other characters I wont get into. My favorite character is obviously Bender since he throws out the jokes which makes this movie funny. Now, be warned! You may start tearing up because there are a lot of issues covered in this movie that relates to real life. The stories the characters tell are very poignant and moving and riveting. So don't be surprised if you start crying during the movie. This is a brilliant John Hughes movie that launched his career next to Sixteen Candles(which is another good Hughes film). What makes this movie so great you say? The way the characters develop is genius thanks to the magnificent directing! The jokes are CLEVER unlike so many other comedies *cough Meet the Spartans*. However, while this movie is great it does have some flaws. One is its a little too long for my taste and its tone is a little mixed up at times. Like is this supposed to be a comedy or a drama? But thats a minor thing for me since I can relate to this movie as a teenager next to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Plus, there are so many memorable quotes in this movie! Go see John Hughes's finest written film! Sincerely Yours, The Breakfast Club",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A teen film which is sharply distinct from the rest,"Truth to be told, I really didn't know what I thought of The Breakfast Club. I think it is a film which would throw even experienced movie watchers off- the content of the film is so deceptively common and well explored, yet its style and how it approaches this is so distinct. It really is a film almost without comparison, though I shall try.The Breakfast club takes place exclusively within a high school library, where 5 disparate personalities are locked up for Saturday detention. These characters loathe each other at first, but slowly open up to one another. The movie is unusually talky, especially for a teen film, but the talk is never overly intellectual or witty like in Rohmer or Linklater films. They speak like normal American teens and interact with each other like so. Part of my dilemma with this film lies with the characters' transition from antagonistic fiends to warm, fast friends. The really good bits of the film only come in the last half hour or so, where partly due to the social lubrication of some pot, they start opening up to one another about their personal lifes. I find this to be at least slightly uneven- I would have liked to see more time devoted to this process where they grow closer together. I think the reason why I cannot enjoy this film more lies here- it does not adhere to any conventional narrative acts commonly used by stories like this. The film strives for realism as much as possible, so it does not have one big cathartic moment where all the characters' troubles are dissolved, and they become best friends forever. Rather, the transition is slow, and even in the last 30 minutes- the bit where they are supposed to become good friends- they still argue and cry. The film denies us a comprehensive, satisfying conclusion where all our characters' problems are resolved. Things may start to change as they hang out but, for the Monday after at least, Andrew stills remains meek, Brian stressed, John and Claire with family problems, and Allison a loner. Ultimately, The Breakfast Club works because it does not reduce its characters into stereotypes, instead recognising their distinct humanity while at the same time empathetically exploring the universal issues plaguing teenagers. It contains wonderful performances, but for me at least, the film seems strangely unsatisfying.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Is there a longer version of this movie?,"Bought it on Apple TV with a running time of 1 hour and 37 minutes. Had never seen the movie before, but knowing its reputation I was looking forward to it. What I saw disappointed me, for the most part because it seemed like it was missing a lot of key scenes that would make the interactions between the characters make sense. It's like they are arguing one moment, then the next they are all up for some hijinks together, then more infighting, friendly conversation, infighting... it's not that the scenes themselves are badly written (although they aren't great, except for the ending sequence with the letter), but that they feel like missing important bits that would make them flow logically. As it is in the version I watched, the script plays like a rough draft that needs fleshing out.How long was this movie in the theaters? How long is it supposed to be?",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Classic 80s for all Generations,"Ah the Breakfast Club. Although I am a child of the 80's, I came along at the tail end of Generation X. The cast of The Breakfast Club were actors that I looked up to as a child, and still enjoy as an adult. I remember my own mother was a big fan of this movie, even though she was an adult with children.Of all the ""Brat Pack"" movies, this remains my favorite. Even over two decades later, the movie still holds generations of people captive and sends us all into deep thoughts of our own glory days when we thought that life was BS, and that we had it tough. We were just a few years shy of seeing how tough life would be once we escape the protective circus tent known as high school.Over and over you hear people wishing that a sequel to this film had been made. I am very glad there was not one. Surely we can't imagine this would have been a happily ever after for these characters. They came together one day, but like most high school relationships, all good things must come to an end. The closest thing to a sequel for this movie would be ""St. Elmo's Fire"" and again.....all good things must come to an end.One thing that I loved most about this movie was the tell tale showing of intelligence in the least thought of places; the school janitor. The movie portrayed the janitor as being a hell of a lot smarter than the assistant principal. I have found in my life's experience this is quite believable. It's also sad. I believe that those employed by the education system could learn a very important lesson about young adults and the way their minds work. Youth knows when it's elders have forgotten how to see things. Youth knows how to use that against them. The moral is simple; stay young!",,Anonymous,Comedy
...most watched movie...,"TBS Superstation plays _The Breakfast Club_ so often that I've never bothered buying the movie. The thing is, no matter when it's on or what else is on, I always end up watching it with great intent. My mind never wanders from the screen, and if it wasn't for commercials, I would probably never get up for a snack or a bathroom break. The best thing about _The Breakfast Club_ is the fact that, even after 16 years, the film still paints a spot-on picture of high-school life. In fact, it may even be more relevant today that it was in 1985 (aside from the obvious changes in fashion ;-)",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Nice representative of the 80's teens.,"The Breakfast Club, a movie made in the 80's, about high schoolers of the 80's. The film has a very simple story that can happen to every American kid. Five students with different life styles and different reasons to be in the detention for one day, each one of them represents very clearly stereotypes from that time.Good characters and fun comedy is one of the best characteristics of the movie like when Andrew ask Brian ""What do you need a fake I.D. for?"", he answers ""So I can vote"", each one of the teenagers is a well made personality that makes you like and care for them.Shows how strong was the stereotypes in the 80's that now is almost non-existence but it shows too how the students judge each other, what still happens nowadays. The change of the characters during the film is what makes you want to have a continuation, to see how different personalities will be friends.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Definer of The 1980s.,"Hadn't seen this one in YEARS and I'm thrilled to see how well it's held up. So many categorizations that this one falls under a classic for: the hang-out film, the coming-of-age tale, and even a definer of its decade. Truly great.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The movie that made detention and high school a little cooler,"I really did enjoy ""The Breakfast Club"", and I can truly agree with people that this is a classic. There is a main reason why I liked this movie and it's not because of the acting or the way it was made.I'm a high school graduate(Class of 2003), and after high school you really take a look at what your years were like. Were you a jock, cheerleader, nerd, weirdo, junkie, party girl/boy, pretty, ugly, skinny, fat...? It goes on and on. Either one of these roles we were in high school and we did get harassed at least once by someone and all you could think was ""Why me?"". This movie helps point out what the problems were, everyone has their own problems and pressures and take it out on other people. While the kid who pulled a knife on you might go home and have his father beat him almost to death. The nerd you knocked the books out of their hands, might go home to parents who are pressuring them to get the best grades they can and put their social life behind. It continues and high school is always going to be like that, sorry to those who are still in school.""What will happen?"" ""You mean on Monday?"" They whole time during that monologue between the kids at the end, I kept on thinking, and they'll go back to their regular lives afterwards.I will always recommend ""The Breakfast Club"", because you will have a true taste of what high school is like.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ages okay,"I spent a good bit of the movie being very uncomfortable with how they treat Claire. The ending made no sense with who got ""coupled up"" and who did not. Is it of it's time? Honestly, it's hard to tell. If it is of it's time, I'm glad I wasn't a teen in the 1980's. I would say that this movie stands out as a more realistic writing of teens by a grown person compared to most teen movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
John Hughes Brilliance,"this is quite simply my favorite movie of all time made more credible by the fact that it took Hughes just two days to finish the script, the acting is believable, it is nice to see Molly Ringwald playing a character other then the ""loseR"" or ""reject"" despite wanted the role of the ""basketcase"" originally, she is perfect as the ""princess"", judd nelson is perfect casting as the ""criminal"" as are the rest of castings in the movie. The story is a good use of stereotypwes to show the idiosynchrisies of hih school and in particular the harsh reality of pressure on teenagers and the complications they face in everyday life. the scenes are realistic and it is worthwhile and entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. whether you want to laugh, cry or dance. the breakfast club is a great showing from start to finish. 100000000000000000000000000000 kudos!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Delight,"From the moment we got older, one of the biggest learnings I had was finally realizing that the world, nor anyone else, revolves around me. This seems silly, but it allows you to see a lot of things that you wouldn't have noticed before!""The Breakfast Club"" brings together 5 completely ""different"" young people and works each character very well in this short period of time and in this specific situation.And it gives us a comedy with drama in which you are curious from beginning to end to know the development of each of the members and why each one is there.The icing on the cake is at the end, where the learning from the film and the lesson, even through conflict, brings down the world of each of them.I really enjoyed Andrew's refractoriness and all his interactions with the rest!And I'm sure that every young person watching this film, even if just a little, will put themselves in the shoes of one of the characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the most overrated films of all time,"It's actually quite difficult to think of a more overrated film than this abomination from John Hughes. My only explanation for all the high ratings is that people over the age of 40 are badly misremembering a piece of their youth that may have seemed edgy and contemporary at the time. In reality it is slow, tedious, directionless and the main characters are highly narcissistic and totally unrelatable.Hughes' films give the impression of a man who was an outcast at school and uses his 'art' as a way of creating some kind of cool childhood he never had. The actors look 25 (except Judd Nelson who could pass for 33) and you never once feel like you're watching actual high school kids. The dialogue is incredibly unrealistic and not one single moment in this film feels authentic. The overacting is relentless with Estevez the worst offender and only Ally Sheedy coming away with any credit.The idea that Hughes gives voice to the oppressed youth of the times is also laughable. This is a bunch of highly privileged middle-class kids getting a first-rate education and doing nothing but complain about it. The fact that a teacher working overtime is the villain of the piece tells you everything you need to know about the deluded infantile fantasy that is John Hughes' view of the world. And it's not just the teacher who is made out to be the bad guy. All their parents are alluded to as oppressive bullies who stifle their children's creativity and personal development, yet all these kids are healthy, well-dressed, educated and living in safe suburbia. This petty rebelliousness is a common theme in Hughes' work, particularly in Ferris Bueller's Day Off- one of the few films I despise more than this.There are also some alarming messages regarding the place of young women in society. Allison is cast as a socially awkward virgin until she is given a makeover by one of the school's pretty girls. Within minutes she has surrendered her entire identity, is dating a jock and set to live happily ever after. Claire ends the day making out with a guy who has verbally abused her all day and done God-knows-what under the table. And let's just ignore the fact that she ends the day kissing a guy she saw literally spit into his own mouth a few hours earlier.And finally, the award for the 'worst attempt at acting stoned of all-time' goes to Emilio Estevez for his rhythmic gymnastics display after a couple of non-inhaled puffs of weed. I dread to think how this guy would respond to cocaine or ecstasy.If this was an obscure indie film that flopped badly I would probably feel bad for the producers and never think of it again. But the amount of acclaim and adoration that people have for this monstrosity is baffling and infuriating in equal measure.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best portrayals of adolescent life ever done,"John Hughes is in my opinions the ""king of teens."" Each of his teen films is great, from ""Sixteen Candles"", ""Pretty in Pink"" (which he co-wrote and produced), and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" They all have funny and serious moments and are classics. By the same token, ""The Breakfast Club"" is no exception. However, it stands out as doing the best job of the above films at portraying 80s teen life (and perhaps even teen life today) as it really was (is). Hence the familiar plot: Five high school students from different crowds in school (a nerd, a jock, a prom queen, a delinquent, and a loner) are thrown together for a Saturday detention in their school library for various reasons. Detention is supervised by the gruff and demeaning principal Richard Vernon, believably portrayed by Paul Gleason. As the day progresses, each member tells the story of why they are in detention, and by day's end they realize they have more in common than they ever imagined.What makes the film unique is that each character tells his or her own story with credibility and persistence. Jock Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez) is under pressure from his father to perform up to high standards, which Mr. Clark believes will add to his (dad's) lost youth. Nerd Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall) excels academically, but is failing shop class. Neither he nor his family can accept an F. Delinquent John Bender (Judd Nelson), while tough on the exterior, masks a difficult home life. Prom queen Claire(Molly Ringwald) has pressure to conform from her friends, as well as issues with her parental unit. Loner Allison (Ally Sheedy) has few if any friends, wears all black, and has similar problems at home. Can the emotional bonding they share in detention hold true beyond the library, and can stereotypes be broken?""The Breakfast Club"" presents no-doubt stereotypical characters, and every member represents countless real-life examples. But what makes it so enjoyable is that applies a variety of themes to its context: prejudice/discrimination, acceptance/tolerance, diversity, class/status differences, family matters, group dynamics, etc. It also encourages us to look at others and ourselves beyond surface-level appearances. Finally, ""The Breakfast Club"" has great 1980s pop culture and societal integrations, from the soundtrack with Simple Minds ""Don't You (Forget about Me), to wealthy, surburban American life (haves and have nots), and superficial values of the ""me"" decade. It reminds us that there truly is diversity in all of us. We are different, but we are all ""the same"" in one way or another.",,Anonymous,Comedy
must see 80's movie,"I am personally a huge fan of 80's movies to say the very least. The Breakfast Club hits all of the points of being a successfully enjoyable movie for its viewers. It surprisingly touches the viewer in a way that you didn't think was possible. This movie is still relevant even almost 30 years later. The Breakfast Club is a must-see movie, and it will be sure not to disappoint. The movie will make you laugh and it might even jerk a few tears.

The Breakfast club is a movie from the 1980's about the complicated relationships between teenagers of different social groups.,"I noticed the teenagers had quite a bit in common once they had started to interact during their detention, although they hadn't realized it yet. Once they started sharing the all of their pasts and their pain you feel a sense of sadness and sympathy.If I had to compare ""The Breakfast Club"" to another movie I'd compare it to ""Never Been Kissed"" and ""10 Things I Hate About You."" Both of these are great movies as well as ""The Breakfast Club,"" and all these movies are based on the same themes. There all movies on teen relationships, fitting in, social identities, and getting made fun of because you're not ""cool"" enough. These are all awesome movies that I would highly recommend watching and taking something from them.I think the message people should take from this movie is that everyone has a different social identity, none of them being right or wrong, and maybe students should start being more accepting of others. There are always reasons for why people are the way they are, and maybe if we gave different people a chance we could be more understanding.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Labeled: Delinquents -Actually: Students- Most Defineately: Human Beings- Undeniabley Eighties!,"The film ""The Breakfast Club"" reflects the recognizably flippant disposition that so many 1980's movies so vividly portrayed, however, it differentiates itself from such a post in several acutely creative aspects. Set in a Chicagoland north suburban high school, it accompanied the artistic genre that so many film companies engaged in when using Chicago as an ideal filming venue during the eighties' movie era. Unlike so many films set in Chicago, ""The Breakfast Club"" capriciously emanates a mandatory acrimony with every one of the main characters in this film! The one scene whereby all of the students commiserate with each other about their justified tales of woe, became a scene which evokes a bevy of utterly human responses. At that juncture in this film, these students were thoroughly aware of the fact that they could ill afford the luxury of pulling back any punches, and, it was incumbent upon them to ameliorate their socially awkward circumstances. Each one of them, the student (Anthony Michael Hall); the athlete (Emilio Estevez); the princess (Molly Ringwald); the basket case (Ally Sheedy); and finally, the criminal (Judd Nelson), became the precarious representative of the walk of life whom they represented in the high school which they were attending. The very last scene of Judd Nelson (The Criminal) was a significant trademark of the entire film's dynamic. Judd Nelson's agitation was manifested through his desultorily assembled attire. As a matter of fact, each one of the major characters in this movie were flawlessly executed to exact the proclivities of a handful of teen-age cultural stereotypes. Any director and/or writer will tell you that articulating a perfect 10 character development with every one of the main characters in any given film, becomes an insurmountable task which is neon impossible to successfully accomplish! The movie, "" The Breakfast Club"", managed to depict every one of their main characters with an uncanny cogency that puts this film in an auspicious category all by itself! ""The Breakfast Club"" was made in 1985, and, it was partially responsible for laying out the existing paradigm for movies, as well as high school students' attitudes in general, for the decade of the 1980's. In 1985, ""Out of Africa"" won the academy award for best picture. ""Out of Africa"" is, of course, a fabulous film, however, ""The Breakfast Club"" is far more adept at sparking naturally human interaction into the scope of cinematic entertainment. A film like "" The Breakfast Club"" accommodates the purpose of movie going, which is, often times, to re-emphasize the significance of delving into the tumultuous intricacies of faulted human nature. A grass roots recognition of our egregious inadequacies as individuals, is an indelibly crucial component to stellar movie making. At such a level, the film; ""The Breakfast Club"", is virtually second to none in procuring such a coveted feat. Director, John Hughes, deserves one accolade after the next for his efforts in the wonderful production of this film. The acting was phenomenal! Subsequent to the making of the film ""The Breakfast Club"", all of these actors and actresses have gone on to be eighties icons, as well as perennial top billing entertainers. It has always been a yearly ritual with me to see this film on the Saturday before Easter. Last night, I watched ""The Breakfast Club"" once again, and, I thought it was better than I ever previously remember it to be from times before! It is an absolute must to see this 1980's marvel; ""The Breakfast Club"" - Eighties Classic! An Ultimate Movie Treasure Extraordinaire! Five Stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
thank god for john  hughes,"the older i get the more accurate i realize 'the breakfast club' truly was. the depiction of high school as an evil cess-pool of social hierarchy with a caste system more rigid then colonial India is dead-on. i felt like i knew each one of these characters, and not because of the acting, which was done well, but because of how well writing this movie is. i don't think enough people recognize it for it's insight and wisdom because it deals with issues much more commonly discussed then they were in 1985. today with every adolescents sex/drugs/self-mutilating secret broadcast on four different networks each afternoon, it's hard to make a statement about this issues facing youth.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A lot can be learned from this movie.,"This movie has always been one that I have loved on so many levels so needless to say I have watched it many times and never gotten tired of watching it. It amazed me that a movie that is so well thought out and entertaining could be produced in one setting and have such a strong message and impact. One year when my son was home from school during summer vacation and was a freshman in high school I created a couple of homework assignments over the summer break. I had him watch a few movies that I thought he could learn something from and this movie was one of them. I feel its this movies story could help to teach young people about a lot of things like diversity, unity, peer pressure, bullying and just coping with pressures of home and school life. Especially at that time in life when you are going through so many changes. I loved the range of emotions of the characters and it makes me think back to all of my friends I had in high school.

iconic 80s John Hughes movie,"Five students have Saturday detention in Shermer High School. Teacher Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) is tasked to monitor the kids and orders them to write an essay.

It's got all of the John Hughes moves. It's got a song and dance. It's got his teen dialog which was unlike most teen movies, and so real. Many that followed would be heavily influenced by his style and it would become the new standard for a teen movie.

An uplifting cult classic,"The story of five teenagers in detention on a Saturday morning, all with different stereotypical personalities. It tells the tale of their lives and how by the end of the film they all come together to make an uplifting conclusion.The one thing that makes The Breakfast Club so unique is how John Hughes uniquely captured the teenage language and the problems students go through at high school. When the film came out the honestly of the film was praised as it tells all the truths throughout the film. As the film is played various themes are outlined. One of the main themes throughout the film is stereotyping. In the film Stereotyping plays a main part, portraying different styles of life and how people deal and live with them. There is a huge contrast between every character as each one is unique and lives a different lifestyle. By dealing with this main theme of stereotyping Hughes had made a film that had become a cult classic.Another key theme outlined by the film is the maturing or coming of age. At the start of the film all the relationships between the characters are very difficult. As the film gradually goes on the relationships build up and they become friends. At the start of the film the characters are very antagonistic. Another theme outlined by the film is the sympathy towards the characters. Characters start to open up as the film moves along and as some stories of their life spills out.The hero of the film has to be the bender played by Judd Nelson the criminal of the film. Judd Nelson gives a convincing performance of 'Bender' the criminal. He managed to sway from angry to emotional - making you feel for him when he is describing what things are like in his life. The princess in the film is Claire Standish played by Molly Ringwald. In the film she is somewhat reserved and tries her hardest not to reveal too much information about herself. She seems to be insecure during the course of the film until the end, by finally getting together with bender (Judd Nelson). Throughout the film she doesn't like the way her life is and seems to not be able to love herself. Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez) is your typical athlete on the wrestling team. He seems to be happy in his life apart from another of the key themes in the film which is parental pressure. The parental pressure for him mainly coming from his dad. He makes Andrew seem unloved and unwanted in his life and wanting him to do one thing only, wrestle, making his life a misery. A day in detention in the breakfast club helps him to solve this problem over confrontation. Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy) is the final member of The Breakfast Club to be introduced to us. She is certainly the most strangest of all the characters and is quite a content, quite character to start off with. Whenever spoken, it is at her defence of any comment made by the other characters. She suffers from boredom and loneliness, and on top of this is reserved. Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall) is the geek of the group. He is also pressured by parents to do well in life, but in his case to achieve the highest possible grades in his education. Brian is constantly pressured by his parents to do well in school, and this backfires upon receiving a bad grade. The Breakfast Club showed Brian that others have it much worse than him, which built up his confidence.The other two character that star in the movie and are the janitor and the principal. The janitor Carl is played by John Kapelos. He plays the ""eyes and ear of this institution"". The last character in the movie is the head teacher Richard Vernon played by Paul Gleason. He always wants to be the one in power and this is shown where he is squared up against bender making out he wanted to fight. He is also known for his vainness ways and how much that he loves himself.My own personal review on The Breakfast club would be that it is a good eighties flick with many morals and images created by the film. It is famous for its theme coming of age and life captured at a teenagers point of view and still to this day is well known and rated highly. Hughes has created a masterpiece of work. The breakfast club is to this day regarded as one of the best films to be made in the eighties.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"A flawed, but often entertaining and insightful film","OK, so I've said it many times, I'm tired of high school movies sticking with the stereotypical characters of the jock, the geek and so on and so on. That's why I appreciate a movie like ""Ghost World,"" which breaks free from the stereotypes, concentrating on two social outcasts and portrays them as INTELLIGENT people who don't say ""like"" and ""you know"" in every sentence. But the characters of ""The Breakfast Club,"" though forming from those stereotypes, aren't one-dimensional.  Eventually, we all arrive at the truths of why the characters are the way they are.Some of the efforts are heavy-handed (I doubt Judd Nelson's character would get so ticked off at someone's alleged insult that he climbs onto the spiral staircase like a monkey and curls up in a ball), but few films even attempt at getting to those truths.  Each character is flawed in their own ways. Even the super-smart nice guy, played by Anthony Michael Hall, says a few things that shouldn't be said.  Even the tough-as-nails, by-the-book teacher, played beautifully by Paul Gleason, has a few screws loose.  At first I felt total sympathy for his character, but then I realized how condescending he was towards each of them and I said to myself, ""Hey, two wrongs don't make a right.""  He'd bark at every one of the students, using a condescending nickname.  There are teachers out there who feel their kids are so unruly that they have access to torcher them however they please.  If I were in his position, I'd probably twist Judd Nelson's head off, but then again...I'm not planning on being a teacher.  If you don't have patience for kids like that, you should consider a career change.Nelson's character is disrespectful to everyone, but how is he supposed to be respectful to others, but when he himself was never given any respect?  I was still very annoyed by his callous remarks, but to criticize someone's unruly behavior, you must first realize where that behavior stemmed from. The character who I didn't quite understand was Ally Sheedy's.  I think hers was written with a little too heavy of a hand.  How can she go from not saying a word (and I mean that literally) to being brave enough to look Molly Ringwald in the eye and ask if she's a virgin (as well bringing up many other provocative questions)?  If you look at the transition from her in the beginning of the movie to her at the end, you think to yourself, ""How did this happen?""  What brought upon this change in character?  She's walking down the hallway with Emilio Estevez to get some sodas, he asks her, ""What's your poison?"" and she just spontaneously blurts out, ""Vodka,"" and explains how much she loves to drink?  I was the quiet person in high school and I never went through a drastic change like that through the course of a day, though I certainly dreamed to.""The Breakfast Club"" has some dull moments and some that are downright silly, but altogether it's a funny and moving film.  It may not be the deepest high school movie ever made, but it's certainly deeper than recent fluff flicks like ""She's All That"" and ""Never Been Kissed.""  It's definitely worth a look.  Plus, you gotta love that theme song...""Don't you...forget about me.""My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Life lesson you already knew,"A group of high school students band together during their Saturday detention and learn about each other, and come to some very basic conclusions.While I used to enjoy this movie a whole lot more, I find that a lot of these John Hughes movies have lost their edge as I grew up. The drama of seeing Bender act out his home life is not shocking, it actually seems to be more like an annoying attention-getting device. The most enjoyable elements of the film are smaller things - seeing the purse dumped out, hearing Brian Johnson detail why he's in detention.... But the larger message of the movie is useless to most people who have finished high school, and come to the realization that the labels and social cliques are meaningless and a poor way to arrange life. That's not to say that the film isn't fun. It's just not really worth taking seriously.My favorite guilty pleasure - Emilio screaming and shattering the glass.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Forced, artificial dialogs with eye-rolling character arcs","Released in 1985 and written & directed by John Hughes, ""The Breakfast Club"" is a teen dramedy about five high school students from five different sub-cultures during an all-day detention over the weekend at their suburban Chicago school. Molly Ringwald plays the popular girl, Emilio Estevez the jock, Anthony Michael Hall the Brainiac nerd, Judd Nelson the dope-smoking rebel and Ally Sheedy the neurotic misfit. Paul Gleason and John Kapelos are on hand as the host principal and janitor respectivelyThis movie has a big reputation as an 80's teen flick, but I was wholly disappointed. Most of the discussions between the five students from different cliques come across contrived and unconvincing. Some of the dialog is actually cringe-inducing.The hoodlum could've worked as a character, like the Fonz or Vinnie Barbarino, but he's such an annoying, loud-mouthed jerk that he loses all sympathy, particularly when he verbally rapes the redhead on multiple occasions for no ostensible reason. *** SPOILER ALERT*** The fact that the two end up together at the end adds insult to injury. ***END SPOILER*** Not to mention two others that unrealistically couple up.It's strange that ""The Breakfast Club"" is billed as a comedy because there's very little that's funny, although it's occasionally entertaining, like some of the music sequences. Unfortunately, Hughes wasn't into the heavier side of rock and so the soundtrack consists solely of bland 80's new wave bands, like his other 80's teen flicks (e.g. ""Sixteen Candles,"" ""Pretty in Pink"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off""). Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of quality songs, like ""We Are Not Alone"" by Karla DeVito, but where are the heavier popular bands of 1984, like Van Halen, Scorpions, Judas Priest, Ratt, Dokken, Queensryche, Def Leppard, AC/DC or Motley Crue? Is it asking too much to have ONE song that actually rocks?But the music is the least of the movie's problems (and isn't really a problem at all, except that there aren't any heavy tracks). The actors are fine, but Hughes' dialog is unconvincing. As such, you don't buy the characters. The script needed a serious rewrite.The movie runs 97 minutes and was shot in the suburbs north of Chicago.GRADE: C-",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Mix Fixations With Detention And You Get Candor!!!,"The cast in this movie is sensational!! It stars: Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, and Judd Nelson!! The nefarious escapades which took place at this typical north suburban high school in the Chicago area, garnered a fascination with the movie viewer in 1985!! What this movie accomplishes, is the homogenization of teenage attitudes and trepidations which formidably afflict all of these barely post pubic adolescents, at a firmly entrenched, grass roots level!! The plot focuses on a detention on a Saturday morning that all of these kids have to serve..The cross section of ""delinquents"" so to speak, include: The student, the athlete, the princess, the basket case, and the criminal!! The student, Anthony Michael Hall, is besieged with lofty assumptions concerning his predetermined success.. Why is this so bothersome? There is nothing above the grade A! The athlete, Emilio Estevez, (Just being related to a Sheen, makes him talented) is hounded by the quest for stellar accomplishments merely because he is suppose to be the ""ultimate man""! The princess, Molly Ringwald, (As synonymous with the 80's as Duran Duran and deficit spending) was the spoiled rich girl, her hang ups with being enormously popular, brought on a myriad of potentially fatal insecurities!! The basket case, Ally Sheedy, will do anything for attention, eventually, being sort of ""creepy"" has to lose the mystique that might be associated with it! Finally, the criminal, Judd Nelson, (""Suddenly Susan"") who had the largest role of any actor or actress in this movie, his character was one depicting a malcontent who was disgruntled with a capital D!!! The precarious camaraderie which all of them seem to share is the burden of identity displacement The question all of them are pondering is: How did everyone get to be like everybody else? Watch the movie, and you will know what I am talking about! I found this movie to have an appropriately intense dialog!! The concise delivery on many of the crucial points that this film purported were totally convincing!! The poignant portrayal of the supercilious social perspectives, which pertained to these five teenagers, for this movie, were astutely formatted with an acrimoniously succinct realism! Also, the only aspects that delved into the obtuse with ""The Breakfast Club"" were deliberate!!! The movie depicted an extremity of candid feelings that evoked a bevy of demonstrative inhibitions by all of the characters in this film! Their fervor was effective, not to mention, absolutely phenomenal in terms of their feasibility!! ""The Breakfast Club"" is considered to be a 1980's classic! This film signified a radical shift in material priorities from the Woodstock era! High School kids were different, however, they were no less complex! One of the biggest problems which these high school kids are faced with is that they have to listen to each other, because, by and large, nobody in the outside world, really listens to them!! Unrealistic expectations were the culprit to emotional dissatisfaction with all five teenagers' societal plight!! ""Breakfast Club"" was a proverbial instance of whereby a dash of powerful and esoteric philosophies about adolescent attitudes did, indeed, go a long way. The positive identification with the 1980's is ubiquitous in this film. Every decade has a unique cultural mindset, ""Breakfast Club"" contributed to the trademark of 80's idealism. It is always enlightening when the comprehension of another individual is impetuous, as well as successfully humanistic while evaluating someone's tertiary responses. When these five teenagers served a detention on a Saturday morning, they wound up becoming the recipients of an auspicious life lesson! I would have to say that I like ""Breakfast Club"" better every time I see it! Amongst all of the other attributes it possesses, ""The Breakfast Club"" is extraordinarily funny! Best line in the movie: Judd Nelson says to Molly Ringwald ""You won't let a guy stick his tongue down your throat, but you can eat sushi!"" Remarkable movie!! PLEASE SEE THIS FILM!!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Breakfast Club is a movie that will always be watched,"The Breakfast Club is about five kids a jock Andrew, princess Clare, brain Brian, criminal John Bender , and basket case Allison, that were thrown together for Saturday detention. At the beginning of the movie when they all arrive at school they just figure it was going to be a day of sitting there doing nothing; until principal Vernon told them that they need to write an essay about who they are. As the movie start you hear Brains voice giving a brief description of who they are. The theme of the movie is that no matter who you are and what kind of back ground you comes form we all have differences. Bender is always pushing the bottoms of the other to get things out of them on who there are. This brings them all together and they have became friends. The director made his point with different camera angle he would use close up in scene when a point was being made and how the music was tied in is the right point in the movie. The Breakfast Club is a movie that will always be watched. The pressure of being a teen ager will never change. They have become more then when the movie was filmed in 1985. Those pressures of using drugs having sex being forced by your parents to get all A's will never change. Just have to learn how to cope with them and not to judge people until you get to know them and you never know that you might have more then you know in common with that person. It doesn't matter if that person is a jock or a criminal it is just a stereo type of people and those you may think are a criminal might just be just like you and he is being judge by the way he or she acts. I would say that The Breakfast Club is a great movie the points made it the movie will never change in time. That is why people will continue to watch The Breakfast Club. For fifteen year the movie have never died and can be seen on TV this show me that the movie is a classic and the no matter when it is watch people can relate to The Breakfast Club.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

1-awful directing,
2-characters without any depth that just do stuff for no reason while constantly conflicting with themselves (teenagers have depth, too),
3-nothing original--yes, even back in its time.
it doesn't offer any ground breaking idea/perspective, any artistic approach or a brilliant acting. it offers nothing. most importantly, one of the girl characters is clearly harrassed multiple times and it's just represented as a normal teenage drama in which the girl ends up with her harrasser. i don't understand why its rating is that high. the breakfast club is just like any other hollywood highschool movie... or worse. 3/10",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Answer the question, Claire!","An iconic 80's classic. How does it hold up? It is well worth a watch. It has good humor and some emotional scenes as well. Five kids are in detention for the length of a movie. The first two acts do a good job of establishing their characters and giving you a look into their motivations. I always feel like the last part is a little weaker, especially where they all end up. That keeps it from being on the level of the very best of its kind, but I still think it's a movie that just about anyone would find enjoyment in.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The true meaning of the breakfast club,"I'm sorry but the meaning of the breakfast club isn't ""were all a brain, or an athlete, or a basketcase, or a princess, or a criminal.It's much bigger than that and thats what i love about this movie, it shows us that were all the same, everyone has the same problem, we all hate our parents, we all hate our friends, we all hate our life.The movies meaning is were all the same, were not perfect but were all the same, but its more than that.We all are afraid, afraid of what other will say, afraid to show our real selfs as we'll never be accepted, so we don't, we hide from the world hoping they won't hunt us.Everyone in the movie puts on a mask, of what they want others to see, they all suffer from it cause thats not who they are, they have friends they don't like, they do stuff for their parents attentions, even if it hurts them, they don't like their life.The library give them a safe space, to finally be their selfs, to take off the mask, stop caring about what others will say, letting go.This movie is a fantasy, as even if we try hard we'll never achieve this, we'll never stop think about what others will say, or try to get our parents to notice us, the real us, we'll never take off the mask cause were too scared of the world, we'll never ask for help to get out of this horrifying loop.I try, i try to be like this movie, this kids, i really try, to stop think what others will say, get friends i actually like, taking off my mask, actually ask for help, but its not very successful but its a try.This movie depicted us as a society, everyone is a little of a brain, an athlete, a basketcase, a princess and a criminal, it shows what society is and what it can be, and thats why i love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Breakfast Club was a Success,"The Breakfast Club is a heartfelt, thought-provoking, and emotional film. It is a story of five teenage strangers, who meet in detention and find out there is more to a person than meets the eye. They each embody five different stereotypical persona's; the jock, the basket case, the princess, the nerd, and of course, the rebel. Ironically their teacher, Mr. Vernon, who put them in detention in the first place, asks them to write an essay about who they think they are. Upon further discussion with one another, the students realize their beliefs and stereotypes go much further than expected and they share common problems such as loss of identity and trouble at home. Problems faced by the teenagers may seem insignificant to the viewer but the film does a wonderful job of capturing teenage misconception and loneliness in a world of on-going adaptation and rivalry. They reveal their deepest secrets, and learn about themselves in the process. Mr. Vernon's question of ""who do you think you are"" is not taken lightly, the students redefine the stereotype of who they are, and fully understand that it takes a lot more than a simple question to define someone. Mr. Vernon judges them based on who he thinks they are, and his ignorance makes the students look superior to him. The film leaves the viewer hoping the breakfast club will always remain friends, or at least remember the wonderful afternoon they spent, getting to know each other outside of their social cliques. Mr. Vernon is unaware that his punishment turned out to be a blessing in disguise. John Hughes provides a look into the sentimental aspect of high school labels and provides his audience with a light story of sympathetic virtue and contentment.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
great performances but a disappointing ending(worth watching except the ending!),"""BreakFast Club"" is one of the sweetest movies that I watched by ruling out the stereotypical fallacies. One can understand how parents latently and unwittingly force their kids to adopt their quirky behaviors in the past.Some parents do regard the slightest mistake as being a ""loser"". They are so perfectionist.Some parents see their kids as ""retarded big mouth know it all asshole jerks"". And others just ignore their own kids. Others say ""win win win"" but do not care about feelings. Well ""Breakfast Club"" is exactly such a movie into the inner-worlds of such kids who are bullied by internal pressure. I liked the performance of ""Emilio Estevez"" but impressive performance of Judd Nelson is totally great!!! . The way he says the lines ""Look, I can see you getting all bunged up for them making you wear these kind of clothes. But face it, you're a neo-maxi-zoom-dweebie. What would you be doing if you weren't out making yourself a better citizen?"" is totally cool I really liked it. Of course the movie is not a faultless one. Even if the performances and the message are quiet nice the movie itself is pretty stereotypical .Allison renounces her maverick ways and succumbs to the mainstream female image (makeup, pink dress, rather submissive, etc.). nerd, Brian, ends the film without anyone, reaffirming similar mainstream conventions of male stereotypes as well, that a male who isn't either athletic or rebellious, and more so is intelligent and bookish, will be left behind and ignored by the opposite sex. I say a movie which has such a great message could have been ended with a more original ending.",,Anonymous,Comedy
John Hughes Portrayed Teens With More Depth Than Hollywood At Large,"John Hughes' Golden Age - Breakfast Club a solid warm up to his greatest film one year later, ""Ferris Bueller...""Hughes didn't portray teens with the usual shallow Hollywood treatment.'The Breakfast Club' strikes a chord with a wide audience. It's not Shakespeare, nonetheless, themes of individual search for self realization, self-esteem, pressure of achievement, class stigmas, bullying, peer pressure, authority rebellion, social rebellion, contradictions of adult behavior and teen behavior, fear of being like one's parents, and the general adolescent challenges of growing up all touched upon.Add in the need for acceptance by parents and peers, random confusion about everything, and mix with impulsive venting exhibited in various forms, and the Breakfast Club is inevitable.Adolescence is never easy. Sometimes seems no one understands. Everything is magnified 10X, especially angst, trauma and drama.A lot of territory covered in 92 minutes.This is a must-see film and along with Ferris and Home Alone...one of Hughes' best films in his Golden Era period of the 1980s.👍👍",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Transcendent 80s comedy,"For a film that essentially takes place in one location (the library), it's rather remarkable that The Breakfast Club earns a 7.9 rating on IMDb.This movie succeeds because of the dialogue. The channel of communication between the characters is affable as each progressively divulges in their personal lives.We begin with five disconnected characters originating from a variety of domestic and social conditions. There is the quintessential jock, nerd, bad-boy, pretty girl and weirdo loner -- all serving an 8-hour detention on a Saturday.John Bender, played by the capable Judd Nelson, conquers the spotlight for much of the initial 45 minutes, probing his fellow classmates with a variety of contemptuous verbal thrusts. Bender effectively irritates all-star wrestler Andrew (Emilio Estevez) and prissy rich-girl Claire (Molly Ringwald) to the point where Andrew informs him that if he didn't exist, no one would care. Staying loyal to his boorish reputation, Bender pretends like the comment doesn't bother him, but deep down there appears to be some deep-rooted insecurities bubbling to the surface. His contemporaries aren't the only ones verbally jousting with Bender either as principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) frequently clashes with him as well. ""Dick"" -- as Bender acerbically calls him -- isn't exactly revered by the rest of the crew though. In fact, it's this universal resentment of their arrogant superior that eventually bands them together. When Bender falls through the ceiling after sneaking back into the library from a locked closet in which he was banished to, Vernon comes storming in demanding who caused the ""ruckus."" With Bender hiding under a desk, each vehemently denies any involvement, effectively covering for their once despised classmate.From that point on, each character gradually begins to destroy the superficial barriers that separated them, allowing the dialogue to transform from almost entirely idle and vindictive to somewhat fruitful, albeit harsh at times.More importantly, though, we learn WHY each character is on detention instead of just WHAT got them their.The ending is somewhat cheesy and clichéd, but not enough to ruin the film. Despite the conspicuous 1980s milieu, The Breakfast Club is a classic that can be enjoyed for generations to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...""I'm not a nymphomaniac. I'm a compulsive liar.""I've seen this one a few times now, and each time I seem to get something different out of it. The first time I saw it, I was in High School, and the same age as the characters in this movie. I relate most to Brian, I think. But, I was more of the book nerd who sat in the back of class who liked to play D&D. I guess you could say that I was more of a mix between Brian and Allison. I fell somewhere between the ""brain"" and the ""basket case"". I love this movie. It hits on a personal level, given when it came out, the music and trends of the time ... it can really take me back.The film starts with our teenage high schoolers being dropped off for Saturday detention for various offenses, which we find out more about later on. We are introduced to kids from all walks of life. We have the jock, the brain, the princess, the basket case, and the criminal - all acted out perfectly by the cast. And, we have the impatient and short-fused teacher who has lost all tolerance for dealing with misfits on a weekend day. Practically strangers at first, they find that they all have more in common than they realize, and are able to form a quick bond between them.This is John Hughes at his finest. However, despite the honest, believable, and relatable approach to most of the subject matters, the film definitely has its flaws. At movie's end, we had the jock and basket case becoming an item, and the princess and criminal pairing up. And poor Brian - all he got out of it was having to write all their essays for them. The issue of whether they would treat each other the same way when Monday came around in the school hallways was dealt with, and in a way that I could agree with. But, when romance bloomed between the two pairs I mentioned above, I was like, No. LOL. Not happening.Even so, this movie is so full of nostalgia for me, that I can easily look past it. The ending was weak, but the journey getting there was so worth it. And that is what this movie is about really. In the real world, they would've all gone back to how it was before. My personal favorite character was Allison, played by Ally Sheedy. Despite a great over-the-top performance by Judd Nelson, I felt she stole every scene she was in. I highly recommend this movie. Such a fun way to spend an evening.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Breakfast Club,"I'd struggle to recall any other of Judd Nelson's films, but in this he really does shine. He's the obvious recalcitrant amongst five teenage youths who have been dragged into school on a Saturday for some seemingly rather pointless detention. This is manna from heaven for their headmaster ""Vernon"" (Paul Gleason), who takes pleasure in exercising his gradually dwindling authority over his charges. Whilst he leaves them to work, they set about assembling and disassembling each other's character. Nelson (""Bender"") is the outlaw: loud, brash and a pain in the neck. ""Andrew"" (Emilio Estevez) is the high-school athlete; ""Claire"" (Molly Ringwald) the slightly aloof of the group; ""Brian"" (Anthony Michael Hall) is the swat and ""Allison"" (Ally Sheedy) - well she's the enigma of the group, rarely deigning to contribute as ""Bender"" begins an hour and a half that allows each of them to expose - sometimes more willingly than not, some of the more private and contentious aspects of their personalities. Whilst their supervisor becomes distracted in the basement with caretaker ""Carl"" (John Kapelos) this erstwhile disparate group of reprobates start to realise they have way more in common than they'd initially thought and thanks to a really quite potent script and some very natural performances, we begin to see something far less predicable emerging from these folks. Sure, there are some traditional stories of failed families or outrageous parental aspirations or rebellion, but they are presented here with plenty of humour and more of a degree of plausibility than in many films that just trot out the same old story arcs as if they were college lectures. There's little off limits, but nothing at all graphic as they try to find a new focus for their lives. John Hughes mixes the comedy with the more earnest engagingly here and these actors deliver something just a bit different.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Bleh,"So this is it? One of the most acclaimed and praised movies of the 80s? This?! I'm not sure I'm watching the same movie as all these folks so positive about this one.It tries to be very deep an meaningful but to be honest, it really goes nowhere. We have a pretentious bully, a spoilt daddy's girl, sports guy, a nerd and of course, a retard all in detention. What happens throughout the movie? In the beginning, they just have random scuffles with one another. And later, they open up to each other and basically talk and rant about their incredibly clichéd teenage problems. Hmmm, didn't you guys hate each other like 2 seconds ago? And then there's the stupid note, which is also supposed to be very in depth, towards the teacher who put them in detention which reads: 'You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. Correct?' Yeah, and even after the movie is over I see you as the exact same people, except perhaps the bully, who was also probably the only interesting guy in the whole movie but his character too was ruined towards the end. And, there is a scene where all of these idiots start dancing to synth rock music for no reason inside the school. How the hell did they find rock music inside the school while in detention anyway? Plus, the ending is completely idiotic and unbelievable.The worst thing about the movie is that I don't feel anything for any of the students. I mean, they could've dropped dead any second in the movie and I wouldn't have given a rat's ass. As this is a drama, we're actually supposed to feel for them in at least one way or another. Well, I didn't. And it's not that I have a stone cold heart. The last scene of 'Up' put me on the verge of tears. I fail to see why this movie couldn't do something that would make most people feel emotionally attached to the characters.Even if the overall idea of the movie isn't that bad, the execution seems completely terrible to me.

So, why is it good? It sets up a simple story with simple characters who have hidden motives and character traits that unravel in an extremely enjoyable 95 minutes full of heart, and humor that isn't too long or too short. The acting from everyone is every bit as hilarious as it is heartbreaking while we learn about their character and backstory of abuse and crappy home lives outside of their school persona's. John Hughes' directing and writing is as quirky, awkward, dramatic, hormonal, angry, funny, and depressing as high school itself making you cheer for these characters whether they be playing their type or expressing their true selves with a moral of don't judge a book by it's cover. 10\10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

John Hughes' Spruce Goose Equivalent,"Like anyone with a set of eyes and a video cassette recorder I'm favorably disposed to a great number of John Hughes movies (what's there not to like?) but ""The Breakfast Club"" is a bit of a porker.  A bit like ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" without the humor and the action -- I can only suspect that Hughes got a whiff of the vapors and wanted to do a ""serious"", ""introspective"", ""sensitive"" movie for a change and for me it just didn't work out.  Though lots of other commentators obviously think otherwise, but then there's got to be some people who keep Schwarzenegger in office and the Twinkie-makers in business.  The characters are unintentionally, comically overdrawn -- the prospective prom queen with a rich beemer-drivin', divorce-undergoing daddy, the bad-to-the-bones-but-really-quite-sensitive-rebel who rebels so hard as to make Charles Manson look like a pushover, the brainy nerd with an overambitious mom and latin-, math- AND physics-club memberships (and he's a virgin and his mum packs his lunch), the disturbed artist chick with self-harm-, body hygiene- and eating disorder-issues and the jock, who's just a complete jock, OK?  And then there's the evil teacher (why does everyone in this forum think he's the principal?  which principal has to go in on a Saturday to supervise detention?) and the janitor with a heart of gold who's really a philosopher.  Not just a social dropout.  In short, it would have been nice to have at least ONE character who's not from the teen-movie identikit.  Next, the plot is so paper-thin (some kids bond during a really long and tedious detention) that some gratuitous action scenes were thrown in just to get some movement on the screen -- too bad that John Hughes didn't care to think the plot through more thoroughly when he was writing it.  (But to compensate he chose to throw in that totally patronizing and sappy ugly duckling makeover -- goth chick puts on some lippy, a white dress and a hairband and instantly bags a boyf -- bring me a bag, I think I'm going to be sick.)  Then there's the predictable blame-it-all-on-your-parents mumbo jumbo which seems to have been lifted straight from the great book of teenager psychology (in my experience, teenagers may think like that but they never talk this way -- and if they do, I don't care to see a feature-length movie about it).  And finally, at the end everyone acts like they have had this life-changing experience and jump-started a revolution.But I'm being a bit harsh.  The acting is generally very decent (totally unlike today's teen movie fare) and I give Hughes credit for trying to take a compassionate, engaged view on teenagers.  So overall it's a movie that bears watching, even though it consider it to be far removed from it's ascribed cult status.",,Anonymous,Comedy
The Breakfast Club - Movie Review,"This movie is about five teenagers who have to stay a whole Saturday in school. Each of them has several reasons why they are in detention. At the beginning every character has a certain character and stamp, but during the movie you can see all of them have problems or reasons why they are as they are. The entire film is always a mixture between drama and comedy. The jokes and dialogues are awesome! It's just fun to watch the five students gradually become friends. I can recommend this movie to everyone, it gives you the chance to have a view back in the 1980's with it's hearty and funny image- and not to forget, it has such a beautiful morality behind it: Everybody is different but if you opened to get to know him and don't be impressed by stereotypes, they can become real friends!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The teenage struggles of growing up,"The movie, The Breakfast Club, is a movie about five high school students, from totally different social backgrounds, forced to spend a Saturday together in detention. At the start of the detention they dislike each other and argue. They felt they had nothing in common but once they begin to open up to each other that changes. There are a couple of themes in this movie. One is the stereotyping of the usual cliques or social groups that exist in high school, the jock, the hood, the nerd, the weirdo and the homecoming queen. Another theme in the movie is the struggles that teenagers face as they try break away from their parents' control to gain their independence. Two other movies with similar themes about teenagers dealing with the struggles growing up are The Wonder Years and American Teen. Bender (Judd Nelson) the ""criminal,"" is just an all around hood who is a regular attendee of the Saturday detention. He is in detention because he pulled the fire drill. Andy (Emilio Estevez) the ""athlete,"" is in detention because he wanted to break away from the straight and narrow and do something bad just once. He taped together the buns of a fellow student. Claire (Molly Ringwald) the princess is a little rich girl who gets everything she wants. She is in detention because she skipped school to go shopping. Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) the brain is in detention because he brought a flair gun to school and it went off in his locker. Allison (Ally Sheedy) the basket case came to detention because she had nothing better to do. While in detention they begin to bond. Their first bonding moment happens when Bender removes a screw from the detention room door and the door no longer will stayed opened. The principal walks into the room and wants to know which one of them removed the screw but no one admits to knowing. Another bonding moment comes when they are sitting around after smoking pot. This is where they begin to open up and tell each other about their home lives. Bender grew up in an abusive home with alcoholic parents. Andrew is consistently being hounded by his father to always win and not to do anything bad that will ruin his chances of getting an athletic scholarship. Claire feels that her parents do not care about her and use her just to get back at each other. Brian is pressured by his parents to always excel academically. Allison says her home life is unsatisfactory because her parents ignore her. The camera angles used during the scene where they begin to open up to each other had close ups of each of their faces as they each talked about their home life. Viewers could see their eyes well up with tears as they talked about how sad they were about the relationships they had with their parents. Motifs which are repetitive images, patterns or ideas that relate to the theme existed throughout different scenes in The Breakfast Club. Motifs were show through the many stereotypical social group conflicts that occurred between the criminal, the athlete, the princess, the brain and the basket case. Although all five came from different social background but they still had a connection.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An Iconic Film,"""The Breakfast Club"" is timeless. Despite being released in 1985, it is a film I, (A teenager in 2022) can relate to. What allows ""The Breakfast Club"" to connect with any audience is it's content and themes. Of course there's slang and cliques specific to the 80s, but the problems these five protagonists face still exist today.The idea of ""being stuck"" within a superlative, is something that many people experience. Whether you're a teenager or adult you likely possess a reputation, Something you're known for. ""The Breakfast Club"" highlights the many ways a label can control you, preventing you from being true to your actual ideals. Issues such as this (and many others covered in the film) are relevant and important for us to understand today.Overall ""The Breakfast Club"" is an iconic film that everyone should watch at least once.

Don't Forget About Me,"I was 31 years old when I saw The Breakfast Club and remember feeling ripped open and understood all at the same time. The film was so good in so many ways: the writing, the directing, the casting, the soundtrack all blended into the perfect recipe for a classic unforgettable portrayal of how savage high school can be. The acting was amazing when you consider the ages of the actors and how sensitively they portrayed their characters. And I cannot imagine a better theme song than the one chosen from Simple Minds for purposes of driving home a valid and many times overlooked part of a teenager's life: feeling invisible, unimportant, lost, and alone with the fear that they are the only person it is all happening to and that nobody would understand or care if they knew. It happened to all of us, regardless of whether we were the beauty queen, the geek, the jock, the nut, or the criminal...we dealt with parents, teachers, bullies, self-doubt, triumphs, joys, and first loves in the hallways and corridors of high school. If anyone denies that fact, they are lying to themselves. Thankfully, someone remembered all of it and made their memories into a classic film to let us all know we have not been forgotten. It is in this way that art imitates life, and changes us all. I hope nobody ever tries to re-make this perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Coming of Age in the 1980's,"Even though I was born in the latter part of the 1980's, this still speaks to me. John Hughes knew what he was talking about when he made this timeless classic. My middle brother watched this in high school (when he was a sophomore or junior, I can never remember which) and he came home talking about it until he was blue in the face. In all honesty, I had never even heard of the movie before he started talking about it. Once the two of us sat down to watch it, I could see what he was talking about...and I loved it. Just about every high school out there has their distinct cliques, whether they are in a public high school or a private high school. Cliques find you whether you want them to or not. In my opinion, this was the go-to high school movie before ""Mean Girls"" was even an idea. Kids today should really sit down and watch this movie, regardless if they find it ""old"" like certain kids do. Once they get a taste of this, they will never go back. That is almost a guarantee.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A John Hughes classic,"John Hughes is the master of the coming of age movies of the 80s and The Breakfast Club is his crowning achevement its fairly basic plot is really a cover for more than just a basic teen movie it has raw emotion which is shown through a powerful group therapy session at the end of the film which is a powerful scene.
The cast of the film is Emilio Estevez,Molly Ringwald,Ally Sheedy,Anthony Michael Hall,Judd Nelson,John Kapelos and Paul Gleason the cast of the 5 main teens has so many different perfect personalities that fit the high school hiarchy and each one of them is a criminal, a princess,a basket case,a athlete and a brain and as the film progresses we learn about there home life and about there parents treat them and we learn why they act like they do and John Hughes masters there personalites.
The breakfast club is by far one of the best coming of age films and teen movies if all times and the scence where they all sit around talk about there feelings was unscripted and the scence works so well in the scale of the movie and the cast of the film is so iconic and the movie is also very quotible and it is such a rewatchable movie that it has stood the test of time and has always been one of hughes best films",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The quintessential 80s film,"The Breakfast Club is a mark in cinema history? Yes. The so popular genre, the teenager genre, which explores the teenager world through stereotypes, became widely popular in the 80s - and still is- and the vast majority of the films in this particular genre shows Nerds being ridiculed and bullied by the popular guys...the 'bad' teacher....a girl that wants to be popular and date the popular guy...etc etc etc. And the great majority of these teenager films are comedies involving parties and lots of sexual references. Basically this is what the genre is about.But then, we have Breakfast Club. The film is the examination and study of these stereotypes. There isn't one dimensional characters here. Its the anti thesis of the normal Teenager genre, and I say, the end of them all. We still have films about teenagers produced nowadays, but we know that the genre ended when Breakfast Club was released back in 1985. A film that chooses to explain the characters instead of robotizing them.The Breakfast Club is for the teenager films what Once Upon a Time in the West was for the western genre. The definitive end. And what an ending.9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Don't understand the hype,"Despite having experienced enough high school detentions to last me a lifetime, The Breakfast Club was completely lost on me. Sorry in advance - I know this might be an unpopular opinion of a film regarded by many as a ""classic"".I couldn't relate to this film and found it overwhelmingly uneventful and monotonous.Perhaps it was a combination of things:The 1980sAmerican high schoolThe ability to bring a gun to schoolThe fact they had an unbelievable amount of freedom while on detentionDespite being born in '89, none of those things were relatable to me. The characters were well developed, but the storyline? Not so much. I felt like nothing really happened. Occasionally a random music break would wake me up.These critiques are not even touching on the fact The Breakfast Club is riddled with sexual harrassment and homophobia throughout. This is not a film that has translated well into 2019.All I can say is thank god for John Hughes giving us Home Alone and Ferris Bueller to make up for this boring mess.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Uncanny Revelations of Saturday Detention: The Breakfast Club,"The Breakfast Club, written and directed by John Hughes in 1985, has an award-winning cast that will blow any audience away, young or old. The film encompasses all of the different characteristics that compose the never ending clique-oriented aspects of high school including the jock, the emotionally conflicted rebel, the thief, prom queen, and (of course) the brain. Locked in a room together for the majority of their Saturday afternoon in detention they discover that maybe the theories they had about another are actually conceived by false interpretations they have developed based on biased opinions of their own secluded cliques and family backgrounds. They learn they have more in common with another than they had ever imagined.Andy (Emilio Estevez), Brian (Anthony Hall), John (Judd Nelson), Claire (Molly Ringwald), and Allison (Ally Sheedy) are shoved in a room together when their curiosity gets the best of them, questions fester, and fights begin. By isolating them Hughes gives them a chance to understand that everyone faces tribulations that may compare to peers, but each individual has different ways of getting past trials. Some steal, some focus on school, some work hard to impression the hard-headed, and others revert to a shell for safety. By doing this, Hughes shows that every person is different, but everyone has things in common. People cannot find the similarities unless they break free of preconceived notions and open their mind to new possibilities. This movie sparked a specific interest to me because of its barrier-breaking theme. Being the sap I was in high school I reverted to books and movies to understand the trials I was facing. I always saw people as people and never understood the concept of cliques or seclusion, so to see a movie that broke through those perceptions poked at my curiosity. To get an inside look at the idea of relationships based upon individualism and not social stature captured my interest immediately. I love this movie, what it promotes, and stands for. John Hughes picked a great cast and did a phenomenal job making this movie. Movie goers who haven't seen it purchase it now!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Respect for the director and writer for making it with a mix of subtle humor and overwhelming emotions and at the same time portraying the plight of the students which I think is what the entire movie revolves around. The entire movie was shot in a couple of rooms and with kids just blabbering about their worthless lives, it could have turned out to be a complete fail had it not been so realistic and fascinating at the same time.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"A jock, goth, nerd, princess and a punk all serve Saturday detention while finding out how close they really are.","Spending all of their Saturday, Andrew(Emilio Estevez), John(Judd Nelson), Claire(Molly Ringwald), Brian(Anthony Michael Hall) and Allison(Ally Sheedy) come together to serve detention and are assigned the task of writing an essay to explain who ""they think they are."" Throughout the course of the movie the students perspective of each other is altered in a life changing way as the Breakfast Club spill their deep secrets to the person they thought they would never speak to in a lifetime.This movie is a clever movie that is set apart from any other movie that was created in the 1980's. Attempting to cater to the typical stereotype the Breakfast Club consists of your standard clicks. But what makes this film great is the fact that it withdraws special effects and fictional stories. Since most have attended high school, we are able to identify with these characters in one way or another creating a special connection with the viewer from the beginning of the film. As far as techniques go for this film I especially noticed the amount of close up shots of each of the characters, as the film was supposed to show the emotions behind each of the characters so we could feel what they feel and respond in a way that relates to the character and theme.The second technique I want to discuss is motif, this is the primary element considered in the movie. There was a reoccurring theme that was presented as each scene provided some sort of controversy dealing with the stereotypes whether it be the jock vs the punk or the princess vs the nerd or maybe just the goth sitting in the back ignoring everyone was she makes a snowy city of dandruff on her essay.This is a timeless movie, we all have or will deal with these kinds of stereotypes at some point in our life and gets a great rating from me, even as a twenty-four year old. I have found that the theme of this movie is still presented in other forms even today with shows such as Glee and movies such as Cinderella Story. As possibly the first of it's kind, this movie executes exceptionally well and receives a thousand accolades in my book.",,Anonymous,Comedy
So do we remember school positively or negatively?,"I am not someone who came of age in the '80s, so for me, movies like ""The Breakfast Club"" are mostly remnants of the past. Still, there is a reason that this movie is probably the best remembered of the teen movies from that era, and continues to impress people today. The plot of course has nasty principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) making five students do detention and write about why they got put on detention and what they think of it all. The students are jock Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), nerd Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), hoodlum John Bender (Judd Nelson), princess Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), and kook Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy).As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that what these students did that led to their detention is almost immaterial. The important thing is their experience together. Bender holds some hostility towards Standish for her status, Johnson can figure out how to escape any situation, and Reynolds seems an outcast no matter what.Maybe ""The Breakfast Club"" isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it remains a cultural artifact. It's worth seeing for what it is. Bender's cynical attitude might disturb some, but all that I can say is, some people are really like that.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Can you say misogynist!?,"The female characters in this film are ridiculous.  What's with all the insecurity?  It seems Hughes hates women.  Why must Ringwald be such a masochist?  Why must Sheedy depend on Estevez's approval?  Why must there be total romantic resolution at all?  My guess to the third question is because Hughes wants his women to be in subservient positions.  Taken individually all characters are plagued with personal problems, largely insecurity. Nelson and Estevez leave with more security and the women leave with false security, they're dependent upon the males.  Hughes: women aren't that bad, you don't have to dislike them so much.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An insightful comedy into the mind of teenagers,"I've been on a bit of John Hughes kick, so expect even more reviews of his movies after this one. The Breakfast Club is my second favorite flick of his, a beautiful film that really gets into the mind of the teenager without even an ounce of belittlement. It just is. It displays what they are in a way that shows they are more than just a bunch of kids reflected in the conversations they have and the unfortunate way Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason), the school assistant principal, views them all (which I think shows the way plenty of adults view teenagers). It follows five teenagers who are sitting Saturday detention together and all come from different backgrounds. The ""criminal,"" John Bender (Judd Nelson), ""athlete,"" Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), ""brain,"" Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), ""basket case,"" Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy), ""princess,"" Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald). At least that's what they are on an extremely superficial level.It follows their time together on that Saturday that changed their lives, from having self-realizations and realizing how similar they truly are regardless of their clichés or stereotypes. To me, this is one of the defining movies about teenagers as were many of Hughes' films and they have remained timeless to this day. He shows that everyone has similarities regardless of what they are labeled as. Everyone has problems and bad things that happen to them especially at a young age where we are nothing but confused as to what we are and want to identify with something. From the opening piece of narration by Anthony Michael Hall's character to the finishing narration that completes said opening and the wonderful final shot as ""Don't You Forget About Me"" by Simple Minds plays, this movie is nothing but a delight.It's filled with plenty of comedic moments and in reality, most of the film takes place in one room which really shows the talent in this film. It relied solely on the actors and the writing, and it just works so well. Each actor plays their role to perfection especially Judd Nelson who is always the standout in this film as the stubborn punk/rebel. If anything, this is another prime example of how much Hughes' understands teenagers and wanted to show the world that they are real human beings, not just a bunch of dumb kids. Sure, they may do stupid things but plenty of adults are just as bad as said teenagers. Overall, people are different but that doesn't mean they aren't the same in many ways, that's the true key to this film, everyone has problems even if they are a criminal, athlete, brain, basket case, or a princess, labels just make them seem to be something they aren't.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A group of unlikely friends come together after a day of detention,"The Breakfast Club. This movie has a universal theme in a dated setting. The title clues the viewer in that this group of kids somehow forms a club, but it's not until the movie starts that we find out just what kind of club it is. The movie starts with a group of kids who has ended up with Saturday morning detention for various things. Each student in detention comes from a different background. These kids would not normally be inclined to associate with each other except for they are all in detention. There is the preppy rich girl played by Molly Ringwald, the tough street thug played by Judd Nelson, the smart nerdy kid played by Anthony Michael Hall, the psycho goth girl played by Ally Sheedy, and the jock kid played by Emilio Estevez. Through the course of the day these kids fight and argue, but they also come to some kind of realization that they are really all alike. They all deal with the same issues of insecurity about themselves and coming of age as all teenagers. They realize that just because they come from different backgrounds and have different interests, deep down they are all quite similar. Although the preppy kids don't necessarily want to associate with the nerdy kids once detention is over, but the nerdy kids feel like it would be quite an honor to at least be able to say hi to the popular kids once detention is over. The setting of this movie takes place mostly in one room, over the course of one day. It is interesting how the passing of time goes in this film. The students encounter some adventures throughout the day while trying to avoid the principal who is in charge of keeping them in line. They escape the library for a short bit and almost get caught. The bad guy played by Judd Nelson actually gets kicked out of the library until he breaks out of the closet and goes back to the other students. Every element of this story is used to develop each character, from their parents and the vehicle they are dropped off in, the conversations they have with their parents when they are dropped off, they way they dress, their choice of lunches, and most of all the reasons that they all ended up in detention. Each element gives us a better understanding of their lives and how they are different from each other. In the beginning the student have no intentions of getting along with each other and plan to spend their day keeping to themselves, but in the end they have formed a sort of club with a day filled with stories that they will share together.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The greatest teen movie of all time,"The ultimate in teen drama and also a well-rounded comedy, The Breakfast Club encompasses everything that is difficult about being a teenager and expresses it in such a way as to be accessible to just about anyone.Not being American, I don't fully identify with the cultural and social markers being employed, but the feel of the film is universal. John Hughes creates an atmosphere by bringing together five students from different cliques within high school and forcing them to interact with each other. At first this treads familiar paths, albeit an excellent standard; however, the conclusion gives an emotional, climactic pay-off which puts it ahead of the rest.Judd Nelson may look a little too old but shines as the main antagonist, striking a perfect balance between rebellion and childish back chat. The other characters too, are well played, and undiluted by a noticeable-by-its-absence supporting cast.If you are, or ever were, a teenager/in school, then you'll enjoy this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Kids spoilt rotten -- an American tragedy.,"Five students are brought in to detention on a Saturday ( the reason why is a spoiler) and what they get up to during that one day trapped in the school library.They are school joker Andrew Clark (played by Emilio Estevez), nerdy Brian Johnson (played by Anthony Michael Hall), school bully/wise-guy John Bender (played by Judd Nelson), rich snob Claire Standish (played by Molly Ringwald), and total head-case Allison Reynolds (played by Ally Sheedy).America, America. The home of the ""punishment of luxury."" Nearly every home have a car, most home's has several TVs, nearly every home has a fully stocked larder, but hey, they can be poor in their own way. Not material poverty, obviously but spiritual poverty. This film is about that -- people that don't believe in anything or want anything. Indeed they don't want anything because they have it all already and a soul can't be bought ""down at the mawwwl.""This bit of fluff was a hit in America, but is considered late night TV elsewhere. Proof that this means something to the USA. This three act morality play comes from that well known device of ""throw strange people together and truth will emerge."" Works in drama, but in real life all that happens is that people ignore each other or stick to their own -- like they do on a train journey.It also follows that drama convention of people being capable of sudden change. The ending is a complete hoot -- I've seen people change less in a stage hypnosis act!(Talking of change -- cop Molly Ringwald's hair! Seems to change between each and every shot. Who would have thought she could have so many hair styles in the one day!)The Breakfast Club is -- in summation -- a movie that is more interesting in its critical reaction than what happens on screen. Its far too cheap and cheerful to really please me and it also leaves you with the impression that destruction and soft drugs are a route to fun.This might be true -- for some -- but you don't have to advertise the fact.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"The Breakfast Club - review, 6/10","The movie is about five different teenagers - 'a brain...and an athlete... and a basket case...a princess...and a criminal' who are locked up together for a day of detention. I won't lie, this sounded like a boring movie to me but I watched it anyway to 'culture' myself on iconic movies of the '80s... or something.I'd heard that this movie really got teenagers, and maybe it did at the time but the characters don't really hold up as much as they might have in the '80s. The protagonists are clear-cut clichés of the cliques that usually exist in Hollywood's stereotyped high-school movies, these kind of social groups don't really exist anymore (if they did at all); nowadays the athletes hang out with the brains, the princesses hang out with the basket cases and the criminals... I don't know who they hang out with but the point I'm making is that I don't think a modern teenager can really relate to the teens in this movie. Saying that, the main point that the movie grapples with is exactly what I just said - that brains, athletes, princesses, basket cases and criminals can and should be friends but I feel that this argument is now about a decade too late to relate to which sometimes makes the teenagers feel somewhat 'alien' to me.The one thing that I really thought the movie got right was the actors, they're really excellent and spoke authentically about the universal experience of being a teenager (minus the weird cliques). They were the focus of the movie and carried it well until the end, listening to their stories and watching them form friendships was fun to watch and there was enough humour and quiet moments for you to just start to unravel the personalities of the five lead characters which, in my opinion, makes the movie interesting enough to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

In The Breakfast Club, nothing exists for the characters on that Saturday other than what's happening at that school. Parents don't matter for that day. Pressure is powerless, as is guilt, shame, and social hierarchies.Although this resolve often seems impossible in society, this movie possesses a contagious hope for just that.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Hughes gets to the heart of all the high-school stereotypes in The Breakfast Club, and creates an environment where they can be broken.  I loved this film when it came out, and I still love it 15 years later.Interesting side note about breaking out of stereotypes... Ally Sheedy tended to play the prom queen types, and was originally cast to play the part of Claire, as opposed to Molly Ringwald.  But they couldn't find anyone for the role of Allison, so they switched Ally over and put Molly in.  Can you imagine Ally Sheedy as Claire????",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Still Moving After All These Years,"Re-watched this last week thinking it wouldn't hold up and I'd find myself cringing through most of it, but I was surprised to find this tiny little movie about teenagers from all walks of life coming together in spite of their differences to be just the kind of movie we need right now. It's probably not the most realistic if we're being honest, but sometimes wish fulfillment films can be great, too. Imagine how much better the world would be if we simply listened to one another and realized that we're all in more or less the same boat? Looks like this one's staying around for awhile.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Nice 80's style 'teen' movie.,"Hughes ""masterpiece about 5 teens in turmoil"" doesn't bore at all however the whole movie finds place in the school library. Nelson is good as the criminal, Sheedy is credible as the shy 'weird' girl. Ringwald ( in '85 a very promising actress, is today wrongful an very underestimated actress ) is in her second big role very good as the rich, spoiled girl. The film is a combination of humour, drama and a little bit of 'action', sometimes too sentimental but the film is far above the average of the 80's teen movies.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Okay movie,"I linked onto other reviews that the people who thought this was a horrible movie wrote. I am surprised by the number of people who hated this movie. My buddy Mike thinks this is the worst movie of all time. And that dork thought porkys was awesome.Back to my review of TBC. Some of the acting was not the greatest, the development of the characters seriously lacked in parts, and at other times I would cringe with embarrassment when every character attempted humor or a dramatic moment. Critical moments of the movie seemed forced, lazy, or stilted. But besides those faults I moderately enjoyed this movie. I just saw it on USA for the first time in about 15 years. I could go another 15 years before seeing it again but I don't feel that my time watching it would be wasted.P.S.

It's been what? 35 or so years?,"Yet, if you ask me what my favorite movie is, it's The Breakfast Club.Maybe it's just being part of GenX, but there just is a timeless simplicity to this movie that transcends a lot of modern movie making.It's simple, it's uncomplicated, it's entirely supported by its genius casting, combining the best the 80's had to offer in one movie.John Hughes was an icon, and among all his great movies, there isn't one single other movie that manages to define and distill his vision into anything coming close the The Breakfast Club.It's such a simple movie, such a simple story, but between John Hughes, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Emelio Estevez, Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy...So many things just came together so right it made for a piece of movie history that I don't think has been equaled since.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
John Hughes Delivers,"John Hughes takes an old premise - a group of high school stereotypes (jock, brain, outcast, popular girl, slacker) meets and addresses their apparent differences and secret similarities - and avoids the lame, predictable disaster that could have been.Watching the movie all these years later, it's a little jarring to have a female character that largely serves no role besides being an object of desire of two men and otherwise seems to lack any agency. Setting that aspect of the film aside, a good bit of chemistry between the characters lets the actors deliver on an absolutely killer script, which is the real movie magic here. Just ignore the occasional out-of-character articulateness throughout and enjoy the dialogue. It's the lifejacket that saves the viewer from drowning in an occasional tsunami of teenage angst.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Rated less than a TEN ... seriously???????,"Just revisited the film and was gob-smacked at how good it is/was.As a reviewer, I have come to realize that people see films in two basic time frames. The first viewing, when, basically, they simply want to be entertained THAT MOMENT and don't care about much else ... and later, when they think back on a film they saw, and think, hey, there was something special about that film, I would not mind seeing it again...? This film is not merely a classic but one of the best films ever made, across all genres. The script is to die for. Remember that early films were based on stage plays (because that was all they knew) and early TV was based on films. This script is so pure it could have been a stage play, a really great stage play, and I think that is the acid test.I also think Judd, Estevez and Hall gave the performance of their lives here. I realize that could be taken as a compliment or a critique of their later work. But that is how I see it. Estevez for example was brilliant as Billy the Kid but really that role was just an extension of his role in Breakfast Club .. with bullets.Brilliant. Just brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Overview of The Breakfast Club,"In the movie The Breakfast Club a group of five different stereotyped students (the princess, the brain, the criminal, the athlete, and the basket case) come in contact of one another due to detention. While attending detention their principal, Mr. Vernon, asks that they write an essay about ""who do you think you are"" and the violations committed to end up at detention. Although the students did not get along in the first half of the movie because of their social differences as the movie progressed they soon opened up to one another realizing that aside from their physical attributions they were not too different from each other. As the five sit and hold a conversation, they explained reasons why they were at detention to begin with and talents that they have. They then begin revealing their secrets and eventually they all figure out that they have strained relationships with their parents and have the same fears in life. Along with the fear of making mistakes as their surrounding peers, they also begin to fear that they will return to their cliques and will not speak to each other again outside of detention. The movie ends with the letter written by the students being read which illustrates the changes that the students went through during detention and how their thoughts and views have changed and how it is viewed from a different perspective. I thought the movie did an excellent job thoroughly reflecting the teenage perspective because in reality teens tend to judge one another prior to knowing them personal. I think that this movie gives people, in and out of high school, an opportunity to rethink the negativity that goes through their head about an individual that appears different than what they are used to and keep an open mind towards the possibility of a new friendship. Throughout conversations in the movie the students saw that they went through the same daily struggles and although they had different classifications(similar to ones we have nowadays) they were able to realize that they were no different than one another. This movie is one of my favorites because it allows it's audience to take away a life lesson rather than be viewed as just another movie. Although the movie was based on school, the actors did a good job making the scenario comparable to situations that would be faced whether it be at school, work, or life in general.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Molly Ringwald terribly miscast in this movie.,"I know this movie is considered a cult classic but I just don't get what all the hype is about. I think it's an okay movie but very far from great. Molly Ringwald was terribly miscast as the beautiful & popular Claire! In what universe is Miss Ringwald attractive at all, in fact she's below average looking. Ally Sheedy should have filled those shoes, she's a lot prettier! I read somewhere once that John Hughes wanted Molly to take on the roll of Allison, but she campaigned for the part of Claire. I guess she thought she was hotter than the rest of the world does. Lol Everyone else was cast perfectly & did a great job.The music in the movie is epic! It has some fun scenes & some dull drawn out scenes. It's worth a watch but don't get too excited.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Spend not just breakfast, but a day with this club","This is John Hughes other baby. The other one, you may ask is Sixteen Candles. Here, honestly is a movie that's better than you think it is, you could actually beat yourself on the head, when not seeing it at the movies. A score of students are spending a Saturday detention, each character vastly different from the next. By the end of the day, they have bonded together, accepted each other for who they are, faced their fears and truths. That is a what a good movie. Over the course of the day we have a real a..ehole of a take no s..t principal, wonderfully played by Paul Gleeson. Watching him get riled by Bender (Judd Nelson, the standout performance in this, which honestly has you mystified as to why he never received more acting nominations during his career) is just too much fun. The actor's conversations, issues, whatever, become absolutely mesmerizing to the audience, we wanna feel part of the group. By the end of the day, one detentionee, a basket case as you will, has made a total transformation, another great performance here. Even the janitor is made interesting, popping up here and there, one piece of dialogue he delivers to Gleason, regarding these teens, stays with me. Truly this film is an aphrodisiac for movie buffs. Don't up pass this movie. As well as showcasing Judd Nelson's top of the line performance as our wonderful rebellious delinquent, Bender, It will have you cheering or giving cause to re watch.

Maybe slightly overrated but still a great movie,"On the surface The Breakfast Club seems like a very outdated movie. From the clothes to the direction to the entire situation really. All of them scream 80s. However beneath the surface of this film are some great universal themes that are as engaging and relatable now as they were in 1985.It's a film about a bunch of kids who are going through the troubles that plague teenagers the world over whatever time period they are in. Struggling to fit in, trying too hard to fit in, not having the confidence to be themselves, putting on a spiky exterior to hide their own insecurities, trying to live up to their parents expectations. We cover a lot in this film, with each character carefully crafted to bring something emotional, poignant or funny to the conversations that unfold.Considering this is a film where not much happens, the characters needed to be engaging and they were. They were all different and had something to bring to the screenplay, and I loved all of the interactions between them. You really feel like you are going on a journey with them, and a lot is crammed in to only 90 minutes.As mentioned earlier the style is unquestionably 80s, which I liked. If you enjoy the vibe of similar 80s coming of age type films you'll enjoy the creative direction taken here.Lots to enjoy with this film. It didn't necessarily blow me away, but was very enjoyable and it was great fun getting to know and deconstruct these characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Ahhhh, it spoke to a generation....whatever.","I remember seeing Breakfast Club when it first came when I was in the 11th grade. Many people hail this as the quintessential Generation X flick of the 1980's. What was John Hughes up to? He obviously had this penchant for blaming authority figures for teenage angst and problems in society. If that was his primary goal he definitely espoused it in all his other films as well. I think there were moments in this film that had sheer poignance when spotting the inner sadness in its characters. Several of the characters go through a sort of transformation and epiphany of how they see themselves in relation to others. The shame, the isolation and despair can be seen especially in Ally Sheedy's character.My biggest peeve about this movie is how it treats the characters and boxes them into these oversimplified stereotypes. If John Hughes wants to explore individualism and self-identity wouldn't he want to focus on how these stereotypes are often based on preconceived notions by others in that teenagers are more complex than he presents them? But the movie uses these stereotypes and wants to embroil them in a milieu to exploit discomfort as if this were one of those EST seminars for youngsters. Why can't a prom queen be a braniac as well as a popular social butterfly? Why can't a brainiac be a jock? Why can't a jock be a rebellious troublemaker? And why can't the oddball Goth-chick be a rebel as well? The movie intends to show very different characters in how they are all alike. But they aren't. In the beginning to the end they are still masked in their confined personas.I was also turned off by how the prom queen decided to make a pass toward the sullen Bender character after all that transpired between them. This was cinematic manipulation by making viewers believe that an insolent wild child can get the girl of any guy's dreams. What was even more disturbing is that he stated his intention to her that he wanted to be used to upset her uppity parents. It seems very out of character for her to suddenly just kiss him and offer him her diamond earring. Someothing tells me that this was a subtle way of displaying role reversals. The girl gives a guy a diamond earring instead of the reverse. The bender character, who is the strongest character doesn't change at all. He is still the hapless jerk he was from the beginning.I thought the most interesting character was the principal. Having worked in education I can understand his frustrations. He saw an institution he built his whole life's work around to crumble in a world of anarchy, disorder and uncertainty.What we see here is a generational gap between the older generation and the kids of Generation X and how much has changed in such a short period of time. Breakfast Club does have a message even though the scenes are contrived such as the corny dance nuances and silly pranks, but that's to be accepted in High School comedies.But the problems in public education today are far more egregious and worrisome than Breakfast club can even begin to convey.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the most overrated teen pics ever,"While a passable film. It just never rang true. Hughes tries to define all 80's teens in 5 cookie cutter characters speaking as if they were in their 30's. Although it is sometimes billed as a comedy, it's simply not funny. As a drama it comes across as preachy and overdone with the whole film trying to take itself way too seriously. It might have made a decent stage play, but didn't make such a great movie.  I was in high school in the 80's and if we would have seen kids that acted like the characters in The Breakfast Club we probably would have exiled them (after beating them up). Don't get me wrong, I don't hate this film, I just think that it's a far cry from the way it really was and much less than Hughes' other teen films of the era. Actually Fast Times at Ridgemont High had much more believable characters (of course they were based on real people). Even the teens in American Pie ring truer.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

You could see yourself in at least one of these characters, and though one of them is annoying due to his antics, you later begin to feel sympathy for him as you do with the other four.

The Quintessential Film of the 1980s,"Five high school students, all different stereotypes, meet in detention, where they pour their hearts out to each other, and discover how they have a lot more in common than they thought.Typically when you have this sort of plot, it is going to fail miserably because it is so contrived and stretches the bounds of the imagination. I mean, really, even if these kids had detention together, would they strike up a conversation or just sit silently for eight hours?But in the 1980s and in the hands of John Hughes, it works. This film, more than any other, defined the 1980s for a generation and really crystallized what it meant to be in the Brat Pack. Sure, we might not say all these people are in the BP and not all the BP is in this movie (it is a a very fluid, malleable category), but this is a must-see and one that most of us can watch again and again.And of John Hughes' films, only one (""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"") has debatably had a longer-lasting impact.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Classic Mix of Laughs and Drama,"The Breakfast Club (1985)**** (out of 4)Some great movies are works of art that should be studied by all generations. Some examples of this include GONE WITH THE WIND, CITIZEN KANE, PSYCHO and RAGING BULL. Other great movies are simply those that aren't really art but they succeed at being tremendously entertaining and manage to put a smile on your face no matter how many times you see it and that's where something like THE BREAKFAST CLUB falls. The story of five different types of high school students having detention is such a simple idea but writer/director John Hughes managed to make it speak to a generation of people much like REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE spoke to those in the 1950s. Again, this here isn't a piece of art to be studied but there's no question that it's a true gem. A lot of credit has to go to the screenplay because it perfectly shows how different types of people are usually haunted by the same emotions or fears. I really think the film does a very good job at shining a light on teenager's hypocrisy and how most simply don't like others because they don't really know them. There are so many great comedy moments in the film but some of the most memorable stuff comes towards the end as the drama starts to make its way to the center of the story. It also doesn't hurt that the cast was spot on perfection. Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy are simply perfect in their roles as is Paul Gleason as the mean teacher. All of them perfectly nail their characters and there's not a single frame where you don't believe that you're seeing real characters with real emotions and flaws. Add in the now famous main song, the witty dialogue and the overall fun nature and it's easy to see why this film connected with people in 1985 and remains popular nearly thirty years later.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Ultimate Teenager Flick?,"A group of kids are sent to detention on a Saturday for various reasons. They are all different, from the nerd, the jock, the rebel, the princess and the weirdo. These kids manage to find out things about each other and themselves while serving detention.Even though I was born in 1987, two years after the film was released, I can relate to it. That's what makes The Breakfast Club so damn good, kids generations later can still relate to the characters and their problems. John Hughes is the one person in the film industry who got what teenagers desired, were scared of and felt. The man was/is a legend and the 80's belonged to him. The Breakfast Club is one of my favourites from him. Planes, Trains and Automobiles still takes the top spot, but The Breakfast Club has more of an emotional connection to the viewer.The cast, also known as the Brat Pack, do a wonderful job filling in their high school clichéd roles. Emilio Estevez , the mighty duck man I swear to god, plays the jock. He has an intense and emotional scene that felt like an anthem for millions of teens going through the same problems. The same goes for the other characters, all have problems in their lives that every other teenager can relate to. Whether it's Judd Nelson and his abusive father or Michael Anthony Hall and the pressure to do well in school.Paul Gleason is wonderfully evil as the principal who seems to have a hate for these kids. His speeches are great to listen to and he nails the role. His performance is my favourite the in the film. Look out for that John Hughes cameo at the end as the kids are picked up from detention. That's a little something extra for you folks at home that dig that kind of stuff.The music rocks, the theme is still played today and is immediately associated with the film. There are many memorable scenes, too many to mention and the overall feel of the film has numerous re-watch capabilities. When people think of John Hughes, the one film I think that they will immediately go to is The Breakfast Club. Not only was it the film the teenagers of the 80's could relate to, but it's a film that will live on and touch the hearts of many others. It's funny, depressing and emotionally challenges you. It doesn't treat you like an idiot, Hughes knew his audience and treated the kids with the intelligence he knew they had.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Enjoyable but had higher potential,"I would take Breakfast Club as a very enjoyable teenage movie. It might not have a clear point or top performances but it still retains its entertainment value. Apart from that, since the setting is minimal and the movie is concentrated on the dialogues, there was room for far better lines. Plenty of plot elements could be analyzed and explored deeper. It does not really justify the forming of the bond between the kids. Moreover, while only scraping the surface of their problems, it tries to communicate some vague moral lesson, without having truly elaborated on it before.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"For a film that takes place in mainly a single location, it still stands as a clever comedy. How does it hold up?","""The Breakfast Club"" (1985), I've been wanting to review this movie for a while. So, I thought, why not do it now? John Hughes, in my opinion, is one of the best writers in the history of cinema. He has written so many great films, such as: ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986), ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" (1987), ""Uncle Buck"" (1989), the ""Home Alone"" trilogy, ""101 Dalmatians"" (1996), ""Flubber"" (1997), and more. What a career! One of his best ones is definitely ""The Breakfast Club"". It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is, five high school teenagers from different gangs spend a Saturday detention together. Now, that's about as basic a story as you can get. That being said, this is a comedy movie with a little bit of drama thrown into the mix here and there, but it's mainly a comedy. On just that aspect alone, the simpler the plot, the better. One of the biggest standouts about this film, is that it takes place in mostly one location, the school library. There are movies out there that follow that concept of staying in a single setting, which can be the difference between a masterpiece, or a flop. An example of a film where that idea is poorly utilized, is ""12 Angry Men"" (1957). That movie takes place in only one room for 95% of the film, and it just left me feeling bored watching it. However, what makes the single setting aspect in ""The Breakfast Club"" work, is the genius of the screenplay. One of the golden rules in my book is to keep it simple, yet complex, which is exactly what John Hughes did, and then some! The whole idea of five high school teenagers gathered in one room for a whole day is full of great potential, especially if they have rivalries with each other. Since the five teenagers don't get along with each, it just adds to the humor. Also, since it's in a single setting, it gives the movie a layer of tension, which adds to the excitement. I won't go into any extra details, but let me assure you, it's a storyline that you'll remember forever. Granted, some people may say that a basic story like this isn't for them. But, I say give it a chance, you might be in for a big surprise. When you watch it, you will be invested, intrigued and laughing all the way through. As far as the acting goes, it's just as phenomenal as the storyline itself. This film has quite a lineup! Such as: Emilio Estevez, Paul Gleason, Anthony Michael Hall, John Kapelos, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy and even more. What a cast! John Hughes even makes a cameo appearance as Brian's father, Mr. Johnson, which is always cool to see. Everyone in the cast nails their respectable characters, and their chemistry on the screen is impeccable All of the sets/locations are stunning, and they give the film a nice atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are all very well-done and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Keith Forsey is incredible and sets the tone for the storyline. His film score just adds another layer of emotion, which really helps tie the movie together. The final shot of the film is one of the biggest standouts, both with the film and soundtrack itself. If I were to rank closing shots of movies, then the last shot of ""The Breakfast Club"" would definitely be in my top ten. Well done, Keith Forsey! ""The Breakfast Club"" is an incredible comedy/drama film. It really holds a special place in my heart, given the fact that I was in high school when I watched it for the first time. That being said, the more I watch this movie, the more I enjoy it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen this movie yet, what are you waiting for? Go and check it out today, especially if you're a teenager! On the other hand, anyone can enjoy it at any age. Watch ""The Breakfast Club"" today, or be prepared to serve a Saturday detention!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Perhaps the poster film for the era...,"""The Breakfast Club"", is considered a cult classic, must see film. Although I've been pestered to watch it countless times by friends and family because, ""I'll absolutely love it"", it's important to note that the audience reception differs greatly. Films like ""Dirty Dancing"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""Sixteen Candles"", and more all fall under the same umbrella category as ""The Breakfast Club"", arguably due to their target audiences and how relevant they've stayed over time. Like I said, I've had many, many people suggest I give it a watch, all of which would have been in the middle of their teenage experience at the time of the films release. That alone gave me an idea prior to viewing, of how the film would likely portray teenage life, I'd say rather inaccurately, almost completely incomparable to teenage life today, aside from technicalities like the existence of school and cliques. It's obvious to me that one generation will generalize the film as a timeless piece of art, one that bears nostalgia for their youth, while another, specifically mine, may consider it a timepiece. It represents the time in which it was born exceptionally well as far as I'm concerned. I, being in the midst of my own teenage experience, can't be a primary source of knowledge as to how those times really were, but I'd go as far as saying that ""The Breakfast Club"", is the poster film for its era.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Breakfast Club — High school detention and colliding personalities on a Saturday,"The Breakfast Club presents to us the five archetype of high school students. Every kid can find himself in those, if not in true form, by the mix of two of them. Even today, it holds true, if the lingo doesn't. I'm not talking about cliques, I'm talking about personality and acceptability.This is John Hughes' master piece in term of analyzing the teenage mind. You're faced with what makes somebody cool, why you get rejected, the walls that are built between the groups, and how they are built, maintained. You get the different angst they face every day: from parental abuse to parental absence, from peer pressure to bullying, from delinquency to suicide.Those very opposite characters are put together and confronted with each other's reality. As they argue, squabble, and fight, they never forget to form common cause against their oppressors.There's nothing negative about this movie, it's just starting to date a bit, but not too much. Hughes did a great job to keep the 80s out of his film as much as possible. The only thing that can irk, is some bits of youth lingo which is now outdated. Fortunately, very little is used, and the rest is still current.You have to see this, but keep in mind the release date and that it's all happening in the library.

Best John Hughes Movie,"There are many John Hughes masterpieces. In many ways, he is the definitive filmmaker of the 1980s. In fact, he is often the first name that comes up when people think of the eighties in movies. But like some other great filmmakers (Soderbergh comes , his filmography is composed of some bad movies, some good movies, some great movies (including Ferris Bueller) and one masterpiece. This film is that masterpiece.I say way too often that a film takes a basic premise and makes it work. But for a film like this, such cannot go unmentioned. The first sentence of the Wikipedia recap is this: Five high school students from different walks of life endure a Saturday detention under a power-hungry principal.That right there describes the basic premise of the movie perfectly. There are only a handful of films that you can describe in just one sentence. This is one of them. You could hardly think of a simpler movie if you tried. But it works because of the characters.All five of them are, on the surface, your basic high school stereotypes, ones that films had played on a lot, but particularly over the preceding decade. But as they are thrown in a room and forced to interact, we discover that they are more than what they appear to be, that they are complex human beings that are often unfairly divided by our culture, including by many movies. It's kinda meta when you think about it.Anyways, it is a simple theme, yet a powerful one. That is probably why so many high school movies of the last few decades have tried (mostly unsuccessfully) to copy it. So many have done it, in fact, that is hard to remember that when this came out, it was the subversion of many movie clichés and patterns It was fresh and new and innovative.But that is not why this movie worked then and it is not why it works now. The characters this film runs through have humanity. Many of the failed rip-offs of this movie have just had a character prove that they are not a trait without giving off the feeling that they are not a character, that they are at least similar to a real person. Hughes didn't just understand what he was doing, he understood why. And that, with an assist from some truly impressive acting from the Brat Pack, is why this film endures. That is why this film is still watched and remembered today when so many other movies have been forgotten. This is why there are people my age who say that this is their favorite film of all time.This is not a heavyhanded film. It does not often shout. But when it does, you can almost hear it saying 'Don't you forget about me.'",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Made strong impression on me at the time,"I saw ""The Breakfast Club"" when I was 16 and, like the movie's characters, was in a high school in an upper-middle class American suburb. This film made a strong impression on me at the time, because it featured five rather stereotypical teenage characters-the wealthy princess, the nerdy brain, the cute jock, the obnoxious delinquent, and the goth kook-who talk their way into connecting with one another, scaling the social barriers of their rigid school ""groups."" My high school had much the same cliques and social stereotypes. ""The Breakfast Club"" is quintessentially '80s down to Claire's sushi lunch, Andrew's Nike running shoes, and Allison's dyed black shag hair, and of course, the Simple Minds theme song. The premise and plot are simple: the teens have all broken school rules, so they're serving a day of detention on a Saturday. It is set and feels like a play, entirely conducted inside the school, mostly the library, where the teens engage in intense dialogues. Eventually, we see beyond their facades, and they see beyond each other's too, exposing their pain and insecurities, hopes and desires.Criticism of ""The Breakfast Club"" at the time and by viewers since then is valid: these characters are high school stereotypes, the detention premise is a little odd (hey, it's fiction), Judd Nelson's John is over the top in his rebelliousness and soliloquies, crushes cross social barriers in unrealistic ways, and much of the dialogue is lofty and unnatural. I think director/writer John Hughes meant to do all of these things; this film was obviously unrealistic. Even watching at the time as a suburban high school junior, I realized that he was making a point with no attempts at subtlety. His famous teen movies (Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink) were not subtle.However, the messages of the film made an impact on me at the time and may still resonate with some teens today: we are all more alike than different. Although, I fear today's teens are more entrenched in their group and social identities than in the '80s, which saddens me. Hughes wanted us to dismantle our barriers; that is the movie's message.Looking back, I realize that my classmates, who were exactly like these characters, didn't turn out the way anyone (including John Hughes) may have expected. Our John Bender delinquent type outgrew his petty criminal phase, and now owns a successful business, is happily married and has two grandchildren. High school is not forever. The person you are as a teenager is a seed that sprouts into the person you become later.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Lacks subtly, real laughs or real emotion but is still an OK genre film","A Saturday morning is the last time anyone wants to be stuck in school, but that is the fate of a group of five high school students who have each been given detention for various reasons. With nothing in common but their location, tensions are immediately evident within the group with drop out Bender trying to out-macho jock Andy by competing for the attention of the prissy Claire. Meanwhile the geeky Brian and the reclusive Allison just seem out of place. While principle Vernon tries to keep control, the group fall out and then start to share themselves with one another, bringing about an uneasy bonding between them.Although I think this is an OK film I must admit to being a bit bewildered by the high regard that many viewers seem to hold it in. The plot is a fairly standard piece that relies more on the characters than any great narrative devices and, while this may work for some I found that the characters were not well enough written to really carry it. While elements of each character is recognisable none of them really stand out as being original or that insightful; in essence they are the characters you find in any high school movie and it never develops them to the point of being critical. Instead their issues and hang-ups are just accepted and it quickly turns into lots of teenage hand-wringing and complaining. If that sounds a bit strong then I suppose it is because the film still does enough to make things work and it does have enough within each character to be interesting but the problem is that, with so much of it being obvious, the clever bits tend to sound a bit corny rather than insightful.The cast are perhaps a little to blame because they do such a good job of playing rather annoying, up-themselves teenagers that that is exactly what they come off as. They are all OK and do manage to reveal layers within their characters but the surfaces of their performances are pretty obvious and it takes a lot to get away from that. Judd is the weakest because he takes so long to reveal anything in his character that by the time he did I had lost interest in him. Estevez is OK, Ringwald is suited to her character but Sheedy has little to do and Hall really just brings up the rear as the geeky comic relief. They are OK like I said but the film tends to go from ""loud school tomfoolery"" to ""quiet introspective revelations"" at the flick of a switch and this lack of subtly damages proceedings somewhat.Overall this is an OK film that probably doesn't deserve the reputation it has garnered over the years. It has good aspects but it lacks subtly or gradual development and the actors can't help this even if they do reasonably well. It provides some laughs and some nice moments but generally it doesn't do either that well. OK genre piece but nothing special.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Don't YOU, Forget about this movie!","Breakfast Club was a movie I wanted to see for a while. I heard it was one of the best of the Brat Pack films. One Saturday, I woke up early, and with nothing better to do, I rented it and watched it. Let me just say, there is no better feeling than watching a movie that takes place on the same day you are watching it. It makes you feel like you connect to it more.The movie highlights the lives and different tropes of teens. A brain, an athele, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. In reality, even nowadays, these are types of teens. The movie takes place entirely inside Shermer High School. Which was not what I thought of when I first heard about the film. Still, it is enjoyable. My favorite scene in the movie is still the Lunchtime scene when Bender is talking about Brian's lunch. ""All the Food groups are represented perfectly. Did you mom marry Mr. Rodgers?""That line is classic!Let's not forget to give these child actors credit for how they portray them. There are several scenes where they improv their lines, and they do so well.I am glad I saw this movie, it's such a classic. Maybe when I am bored again on a Saturday. I'll make myself a bowl of Honey Bunches of Oats and put on this movie again. It's worth the time.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
a film that every parent and teen should see,"There are films that tell you nothing. There are films that will make you laugh but have no real meaning, and there are films that have meaning but will leave you somewhat depressed afterwards. The Breakfast Club is different. This is a film that will make you laugh, think, cry, and laugh some more. I only saw this film for the first time last year and kicked myself for not seeing it sooner. It is a fantastic film about the pressures that every teenager will have to face in their lifetime, a film that will bring up a problem that anyone watching can relate to one way or the other.I for one like a film with a simple storyline, and this one has a pretty simple one. Five teenagers are forced to spend a Saturday in detention. Simple as that. But these five youngsters are very different from one another.Andrew Clark- The tough guy who thrives to be the best; Brian Johnson- The Grade A student. John Bender- The loud mouth nuisance. Molly Ringwald- The Prom Queen, and Ally Sheedy- the weirdo.5 very different people. One classroom, and a hard nosed teacher to deal with. They begin the day clearly frustrated at the thought of spending a Saturday with one another, but by the end their lives will have changed forever and they will realise that they are not so different.Overall, this is a funny and touching movie that you will be happy to watch over and over again.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Moronic Stereotypes add up to Dumb Movie,"The Breakfast Club has to be one of the dumbest and most boring movies ever made. Who can buy Jughead Nelson as a bully? He looks like a girl. Alley Seedy, Molly Ringworm, Anthony Michael (wasn't he in Van Halen), and Emilio Sheen Estevez (Thanks to his Dad, Martin Sheen, for this role). What a cast of boring rich kids.Ally Sheedy, she was what? An alcoholic? Judd Nelson was a victim of his Dad? Talk about unimaginative stereotypes. The Breakfast Club was one big stereotype, down to the dork who played the Principal. These characters are two-dimensional and dated. Would five people who hated each other spend all day whining to each other? What kind of school ever had Detention for more than one hour? Reform School? Of course, by the end of the movie, the corny canned ""Let's Be Friends"" ending is trotted out for the five millionth time. Hollywood thinks movie audiences are made up of morons, and the fact that so many people think that The Breakfast Club is a classic just goes to show that Hollywood is right about the dumb masses. Breakfast Club is the ultimate Low-Budget teen rip-off movie. Give them fake angst, whining, and blame the parents; and teens lacking self-esteem will run to the theaters to pay.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Can't help but empathise and attach to these characters,"John Hughes, who is known more for his writing rather than his directing. I have not seen everything Hughes has written, or even directed (Planes, Trains and Automobiles) but I have seen some of his popular and memorable work like Sixteen Candles, Home Alone, Weird Science, Pretty In Pink, Some Kind of Wonderful and Ferris Bueller. Something that I have picked up after seeing enough of his work is that he is a writer who creates these characters that are lovable and adored. When I was a child, I always wanted to be as fearless and clever as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and that is due to his writing. After watching this film, I feel that he has created his magnum opus in directing and writing but though it's his best, it has it's flaws.The plot of The Breakfast Club is a bunch of high schoolers serving detention. This is where I felt that Hughes' writing may not appeal to some people as this film is definitely not like other high school films out there. Hughes was bold to write about 5 people sitting in a library and talk. The film's goal is not very evident from the start but if you invest yourself within these characters then you would understand Hughes' intentions. It is about empathising the problems of others and understanding that teenagers are beyond the stereotypes society has placed upon them and that we all have our uniqueness that define who we are. This film focuses on these teenagers relationships, status and personalities. Hughes has created five very unique individuals who are viewed by each other within their stereotypes. This then takes the film into a dialogue and character driven direction in order to flesh out these characters and explore the emotions and hardships of their position. I personally found this film to be interesting and definitely relatable, which will be the reason why this film is universally adored.I felt that this was a personal film for Hughes and that he really cared for these characters. He achieved in crafting something that is so deep and at the same time entertaining which allows for one to revisit this film time and time again. What make Hughes so clever is creating young characters in his films that does not feel like they have been recycled from his other work. His most personal moment of this film, I assume, is the scene where they all sit down together and share their personal feelings and views. It really felt like Hughes has been in the situation before and just recreated it for this film.John Hughes and Thomas Del Ruth seem to have gone with a low budget feel to its photography and most of the camera's focus is on the actor's and their emotions and reactions. I felt that this style was appropriate and it does not distract us when key moments are taking place. There is very little movement to the camera and it allows us to take in scenes and focuses a little more on the characterization.The pacing, I thought was done well for a plot that takes it's time in moving things along. It takes it's time with these scenes, except for the hallway sequence which was paced a lot faster to induce tension. Some audiences may find this quite boring at times and may want for more things to happen.The music is driven by pop, new wave songs in the time period and fits very nicely with the setting. The music in this film gives people that sense of nostalgia and may not help themselves but to click along with it. I though, am a product of a later generation so it may not give me that heavy sense of nostalgia but it does get me clapping once in a while.This movie would have not worked and fallen apart if casting failed at acquiring actors who can understand the characters they are playing themselves. Thankfully the actors chosen are perfect and irreplaceable. Chemistry between the actors were excellent and all five play off each other well. These actors would end up working together commonly in later films.The Breakfast Club is a film that you may want to go back to, especially if you are a teenager, and relate to. It would make you think about others and understand the uniqueness that make that person an individual rather than a shade that can be identified solely on their surface.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Best High School Film Ever,"The Breakfast Club is, in my opinion, the greatest teen movie of all-time. I think what makes it so amazing is that it doesn't try to make high school into this magic place where we make friendships that last forever and experience our first loves, but instead, it presents it as a place where we are all trying to act like everything is OK but we're all equally confused and hurt on the inside. It shows that no matter how different people may look on the outside, we all experience pain. I kind of feel like the world would be a better place if life was more like this movie, where everyone's issues was out in the open . There would be less misunderstandings.

Talky and nothing more,"Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez and Anthony Michael Hall portray five of the most annoying young characters ever put together in a film.

Breakfast Club Review,I think the Breakfast Club is in some senses timeless and others a time piece. There are many elements of the film that are very of the time and not as relevant to today except for nostalgic value such as a lot of the visuals and the concept of going in on the weekend for detention. However the idea becoming friends with people you don't know that well in a sort amount of time because of a shared experience is a very universal concept.One of the main strengths of this film is that its sole focus is on the characters telling the story and everything else is very simple. For example it takes place in a single location and all of the conflict is between the characters. This brings the attention onto the character's stories instead of an elaborate background and production.,8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Came of age well,"Five different students that have never spoken before, are forced to spend 8 hours with each other in the library of their high school in detention. The first hours are somewhat awkward and ill at ease, but as they learn more about each other they start to connect in a most profound way.The main cast of this movie is absolutely astonishing and their chemistry is unmatched. Still in their late teens or early twenties, as I am now, when this was shot they manage to tap into that youthful liveliness with its all-time highs and all-time lows. Their dialogues are snappy and quick-witted - even in scenes that were improvised - and feel very much true to life. And the great fun of this movie lies in the fact that, even after 35 years, the stereotypes and the behaviours of the students are still very recognisable.The comedy is light-hearted and timeless with its clever punchlines and slap-stick-like actions. The drama goes deep and touches on difficult subjects such as abuse, neglect and the pressure young people feel being put upon them by adults. John Hughes (director) manages to blend the two brilliantly, although the film could have done with a more even spread.There are times though, where the dialogues start to take over the movie and the director forgets to reinforce the story with cinematography, sound design... but the soundtrack is legendary and as 80's as they come. Furthermore, the costumes of each character is perfect; we only need one glance at the characters to know who they are.The Breakfast Club is by no means Oscar-material, but timeless and part of movie history. It hits home, even today, and cracks a smile with even the most sour spectator. It is part of my parent's youth and now it's also part of mine.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Quirky and unique ragtag team,"This film on the surface definitely constitutes as one of those mindless things you watch and forget. The plot seems fairly monotonous throughout.However, I must say that yet at the same time, there is a certain attractiveness to its monotony. I had a couple good laughs out of this film. With the film dabbling a little into the drama that quite a few teens these days might face, it all seemed to fit together quite nicely. Whilst the characters all seems to be unrelated whatsoever, John Hughes still managed to piece the stories of the people together to form quite a wonderful piece.All in all, another typical teen movie from the 80's. However, if you watch the film with no expectations, you'll be in for a surprise.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
lacking any good character development,"This is quite honestly the worst movie I've watched. The soundtrack is overrated, and the acting and writing are both very cliché. This movie is s string of contrived conversations that are unrealistic and feel set up just so that the actors could read the lines, in remembrance of Hughes' own high school days.The film serves no purpose other than to solidify five high school stereotypes that everyone is aware of before watching the movie which does nothing to make any of the stereotypical characters likable.

I can see why it's a classic.,"Honestly, yes, I can see why it is a classic. I will say I enjoyed The Breakfast Club. I think the performances given by the actors and actresses was remarkable and outstanding. They perfectly captured the essence of what it truly feels like to be a teenager in the school system. There was so many struggles they go through, which is so relatable and truly saddening, and they managed to show it all in this film. I cried a bit. I think the characters, however, could've had more development. I feel us as the audience wasn't able to fully resonate with them and it would've been much, much better if we could really see their personalities and their backstories more clearly. I felt like they were a bit bland. Yes, they had a few extremely defining traits, but I wish they built on that. Also, the time periods are different, and I feel as though the younger crowds wouldn't enjoy it as much. There are certain aspects in this film that I think some wouldn't really get or see anymore. I was still able to understand the film completely, though. To wrap this up, I don't see it as one of the 'must watch' classics, but I still enjoyed it. Other than that, I think this movie was pretty good. I recommend, especially to those who like more...vintage/classic movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Great flick,"I love this movie. The idea that all of us are messed up is great. Suburbia has this pretty picture of normal and functional lives. I've watched this many times, but I'm taking a Youth Deviance class and we watched it in there. Makes you look at this movie a little more analytically. Parents treat their kids like mini-adults and pressure them into being something at all costs just to realize the ""American Dream"". Whatever that is. These kids represent those pressures and isolation. Claire, the popular prom princess who's used as leverage between rivalling parents; John, the punk bad boy with a foul mouth and abusive family; Andrew, the jock with no mind of his own; Allison, the emotionally unstable psycho with no friends and a bit of a compulsive/pathological liar. She's unsatisfied with her home life and wants to run away. And Brian, the geek who would rather commit suicide than face his parents about failing shop class. Each one feel pressure from parents, friends, and themselves to be or act a certain way. We can all relate to that. Yet, I can see why they're called the brat pack. You find it a little annoying that all it takes is some middle class kids to have some problems for people to be aware. What about urban kids who face these issues? Nobody doing a movie about their issues till Dangerous Minds or unknown films. It's sad that this country doesn't care about anything til it hits a certain class. Still, good movie to get some perspective about growing up in the 'burbs.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Iconic, but flawed","For its time and place it may deserve a higher rating, but on rewatching it all these years later, the flaws are apparent and harder to excuse. On the positive side, it's a fun film, filled with iconic images and a soundtrack that includes the Simple Minds song 'Don't You (Forget About Me)'. More importantly, it captures the enormous pressure high school kids are under, and how bad parenting/teaching feeds into that in incredibly harmful ways. The moment that the kid who acts out (Judd Nelson) reveals a cigar burn in his forearm which he got for spilling paint in the garage is breathtaking, as in that instant we see why he's such an asshole to everyone around him. There are several other moments when with their guard down, the kids who are so different relate to one another, and come away with a better understanding of each other. The casting was brilliant and the performances are superb all around.On the other hand, for a film that's trying to explain how these five kids are being stereotyped by the adults, it does a remarkable job in giving us five stereotypes - the so-called princess, jock, brain, criminal, and basket case (ugh). All of these characters are simplistic, and John Hughes coming up with only the princess and basket case for the female characters is pretty sad. The film also wants it both ways, to explore honest feelings but also to be a mainstream, successful Hollywood film, so it puts in those moments of the kids running through the halls and dancing in the library which are anything but authentic. Worse yet is the beauty makeover and the ending, which has four of the kids pairing off into highly unlikely couples. The troubled kid who's bullied everyone and made rape jokes ends up getting the popular girl, and the strange girl just needed to be made """"""pretty"""""" to be noticed by the popular guy? Argh. It's too bad the film hadn't dared to be more artistic, and opted for more maturity in the script.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Raw emotions and endless heartbreak,"We don't talk about John Hughes enough anymore. Sensationally capturing the essence of adolescent rebellion and nonconformity, unlike any other filmmaker before or since. He understood the constant struggle of teenagers in their quests to be understood, both by adults and by themselves and The Breakfast Club is the pinnacle of that experience. An extraordinarily well-blended mix of humour, heartbreak and anger as each character displays a pantheon of raw emotions, after all, we're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it. Hughes' direction is masterful, warm and insightful without succumbing to melodramatic tendencies, with his writing causing equal cause for celebration. But what is great writing without a cast to perform it, all of whom inhabit their roles perfectly as over nine hours of threatening, bickering and, eventually, poignant self-revelation, the stereotypes dissolve and re-form. The world is an imperfect place and The Breakfast Club doesn't need any earthshaking revelations to make its case known, instead offering a portrait of the pain and misunderstanding. This was the Hughes way.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A CLASSIC,"Everyone compromises that The Breakfast Club has and its own atmosphere and ideas to tell. Movie has well written characters, especially John Bender. At the beginning of the movie, he is so complicated and incomprehensible. But when he explains his family, everything becomes more meaningful.

Yes, its true that he was trying to make a teen movie. But was he not also trying to make a statement about our society at large? Like Edward Albe's controversial play Zoo Story, through the Breakfast Club John Hughes is trying to make a statement about the mixing of social classes. However Hughes and Albe seem to go two different ways. Albe is saying that two classes can't merge without violent contact, but Hughes is suggesting that everything turns out alright.

Not all it's cracked up to be,"I remember when this movie came out and everyone thought it was the greatest thing...it just ""spoke"" to our generation so much.  I never understood all that.  Rather than appealing to audiences because it was interesting and made sense, it just seemed to me like it capitalized on every teenager's hidden fantasies about fitting in.  Girls liked it because it let them imagine for a minute that they too could suddenly get the star quarterback or the standoffish rebel.  And guys must have liked it because it let them think that dating them was the ultimate goal for every teenage girl, and girls would be willing to fundamentally change themselves to be with them. The message of this film is terrible for teenagers.  It shows one guy who doesn't even notice the girl until she radically changes her appearance to fit into his own model of beauty, and another guy who shows his affection by being verbally insulting and abusive until the very end.  I just don't understand what's so great about this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Way We Were,"There are certain works of literature, cinema, and even television that have to be viewed at a certain crucial point to truly engage on the level they were intended. My first viewing of ""The Breakfast Club"" came when I was a high-school senior (at the insistence of my then-girlfriend), and while I didn't see the film as an accurate reflection of any experiences I had had, I certainly liked it. I viewed the film several months later as part of a psychology class I was taking. And now, with high school 8 years in the past, ""The Breakfast Club"" plays better than ever. While this quintessential John Hughes snapshot of '80s teens can veer into corny, outdated lingo and other dubious asides (the 'whistling' interlude), the overall effect is no less potent or genuinely intended. The premise is simple: 5 seemingly disparate teens, identifiable by one distinguishing trait (Athlete, Criminal, Princess, Brain, Basket Case), are stuck in an 8-hour Saturday detention session, during which they reveal themselves as uniquely layered individuals. The performances are the stuff of legend--each actor brings a vulnerable edge to their deceptively cliché titles (and, of course, part of the film's charm is seeing which characters we can most closely relate to). Hughes is as good at staging goofy comic moments (such as a hallway chase set to synthesizer percussion) as he is at the more quietly emotional and raw scenes. The adult characters (represented primarily by Paul Gleason's bitter principal) are somewhat problematic, coming across as short-fused boogeymen...yet still, this seems to be part of Hughes' (mostly accurate) teenage perception, where the notion of 'adult' remains an elusive, mysterious concept. ""The Breakfast Club"" is a mix of comedy, drama, and nostalgia that is by turns hilarious, affecting, and wrought with the kind of naive complexity that makes youth at once joyful and painful.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A product of the 80's,"Often regarded as something of a minor 80's classic, The Breakfast Club still stands up today as a decent, and fun drama. The Breakfast Club tells a simple story of five kids at high school being put into detention. The premise is simple, but it's what's behind the premise that's more important to the film as we learn about the different characters. This film will always be remembered for it's casting of 'the brat pack' over it's portrayal of teenagers coming of age, but that's not to say that it's deeper side should be ignored. The way that the characters are presented initially is very much two dimensional - with them all fitting into set teen groups. We've got a nerd, a prom queen, a tearaway, a 'jock' and a basket case and it all seems very convenient that five such different people should end up in detention together. However, this is how the film portrays it's point, as it shows that the kids are more similar than their exteriors would suggest, and that is explored through their innermost hopes and fears; which is actually done quite well.The film cuts music (mainly 80's style heavy metal) into the drama, which works at times but at other times is extremely annoying. It can be hip and cool, but it also becomes annoying fast and this isn't good when you're trying to watch a low concept movie that relies on it's dialogue and characters rather than any kind of razzle-dazzle. The acting in the movie is a mixed bag, with different actors being really realistic at times, and then really out of place at other times. Emilo Estivez trying to make himself look hard being a case for the latter. The film does feature many extremely unlikely occurrences, such as our protagonists smoking illegal substances in a school library, and one of them making a trek through the school roof; but the script always keeps it afloat and it's kept interesting by the way that the characters are varied and different to one another. After what the film has been building for it's duration, it fitters out with a damp squib ending that appears to be tacked on just to make the audience feel good and it's a real shame. Still, up until the ending the movie is a lot of fun so I still give it a thumbs up.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
great film,"The film "" The Breakfast Club"" is a movie that besides be funny and entertaining the public, talks about a important matter, the stereotype, and has a good message in the end. If we compare the way how the high school students judgmental in the film is a little different from today, because though there are some stereotype today, is not as apparent as in 1985. This movie have a perfectly cast, acting, direction. the great landmark of this film is the excellent development of the characters, all very worked and and balanced. The best scene is when the characters begin to tell why they are in detention, because is really exciting and fun. The evolution of the each characters is very well set up, which makes the film even more incredible and I think that Alison is the biggest highlight of this.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Classic of the 80's that aged bad 7/10,"""The Breakfast Club"" is one of those 80's movies that you probably never heard of unless your parents grew upon it and told you about. The story is pretty simple: 5 teenagers are sent to detention on saturday and are forced to stay at the library all day while they are being watched by their teacher. along the way they find out they have much in common than what they tought. So the movie doesn't have where to fail, but keep in mind that the whole plot is happening at school on saturday and so to keep the plot moving and interesting is a big challenge. Unfortunately this is where the movie disappoints. Though the chemistry between the characters is wonderful, I think the fact that all 5 characters are trapped in a building with no twist or turn of events is where the movie fails in impressing the viewers. The characters are well written with each of them having to face their emotions and fears and allowing themselves to be more open to strangers. Bender and Allison are the more weird and bizarre characters in this film, Brian is the one who gives a closure to the film with the note he leaves to the teacher, thus making him a leader of the club. Overall this movie may have been a hit back in the 80's but became forgettable as time passed, John Hughes has proved before that he can do better than that take ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" for example.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

High school fantasy...,"Group of cynical teenagers spend a day's detention together in their high school library. When ""The Breakfast Club"" hit theaters in 1985, I was just a few years older than these kids and I still didn't relate to them... Their slang is meant to get laughs (it's on a broad scale), but most of the regular dialogue is over-the-top as well--such as Emilio Estevez's embarrassing monologue about covering some nerdy, naked kid with tape. The students are extremely bitter (even Molly Ringwald's girl from the popular clique, whom we never get to know); writer-director John Hughes hopes to fill in the gaps with shock-laughs, some of which register and some don't (Ally Sheedy's loner at one point says she wants vodka, but never again gives any hint that she's an alkie; Hughes tries to cover by making her a compulsive liar). There's a laughable built-in apologia for the kids' problems (blame it on their folks), and a ""romantic"" wrap-up that smacks of commercialism. The young cast is colorful and wiseass funny (with the exception of Judd Nelson, over-doing the schoolyard bully shtick); they make the sketchy material seem better than it is, for ""The Breakfast Club"" is just a high school fantasy that only pretends to be based in a recognizable reality. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Breakfast club is a pretty good movie for teenagers,"First,I really liked The Breakfast club,it describes successfully the several kind of people you can find in High school,it contains as well a lot of stereotypes,for example, the sporty guy or the girl with who nobody speak,but more the film goes, more you begin to know better each character. Unfortunately,the fact they had to say all the Saturday at school did not change nothing about the director authority,but it allowed them to meet different kind of people. Moreover, this movie is more for young people. As far as I am concerned,the movie wants to have as message, do not judge when you do not know well the people.

Iconic '80s teen movie,"Five high school kids arrive for detention on a Saturday morning.

It captures well the spirit of the times, the issues teens face and how these problems unite them.The arc of them going from strangers with different personalities, seemingly nothing in common and how this alienates them from each other to how they discover common ground and move forward forms the backbone of the film and is quite well done.Not perfect though: some aspects feel overly stylised, Judd Nelson overacts as the rebellious Bender and some plot developments feel a bit contrived.Still, overall a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Number 1 Movie of All Time - 'The Breakfast Club',"Ratings : 10/10 stars There's this movie which i would gladly concur as the best movie of all time in my list. This movie is entitled 'The Breakfast Club'. I had the chance to stumble on this movie on a hallmark channel, and I was astounded on how perfect this movie is. The storyline, the characters and most importantly the script or dialogue that was perfectly written to make this a great movie.This movie is basically, about 5 people who comes from different cliché' in school. One is a criminal, another is a sporty-kid, the other is a basketcase, one is a miss popular and the last is the brain. The story line goes where these 5 people who spend detention on a Saturday. That is it, the simplicity of the story goes as simple as that. 5 people in the library spending detention on a Saturday.So here it gets really really interesting, amidst all their differences, they start learning about each other, bit by bit and becoming friends on that single day. Who can't relate to this movie? I believe every single person could relate to this movie because of almost everyone been to school before.My words won't be enough to describe this great movie. However, I never get bored watching this from time to time because the feelings and expressions that these people make, all leads to one thing. Their parents.Hope you guys will watch this movie.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Five high school pricks in detention submit to intellectual mutiny,"The Breakfast Club (1985) :
Brief Review -Five high school pricks in detention submit to intellectual mutiny. The Breakfast Club depicts the story of failed American culture through the eyes of teenagers. Five teenagers come together in detention on a Saturday for screwing things up. Socially awkward Brian (Hall), jock Andrew, shy loner Allison, popular girl Claire, and rebellious delinquent Bender report to school for detention under the supervision of Vice Principal Richard Vernon, who gives them a task to complete an essay on ""Who do you think you are"" during those 8 hours. Bender starts with his insulting remarks, immediately becoming the most hated guy in the group. However, his brutal theories begin to make sense after a while, and they start to get along. At first, they all hide their true selves and believe that they can't be friends now or later when they see each other on Monday. After some self-reflective realizations and admitting that they are all victims of their parents' pressure or discipline, they join forces for an intellectual mutiny against those who don't understand, namely the Vice Principal and their parents. During these conversations, they exchange secrets about their lives, sex, virginity, pressure, future plans, and ambitions. The film is wild at times and vulgar too. In one scene, Bender hides underneath the bench where Claire is sitting and tries to do something crazy, calling it an accident. That's when you realize that these two are going to develop some sexual interest in each other soon. Claire gives Allison a makeover, making her the sexiest girl in the room, which immediately causes Andrew to fall for her. As they bid goodbye, with two couples formed, Brian is left alone but is given the biggest responsibility of writing a letter to the Vice Principal. That letter is what I call ""intellectual mutiny."" Overall, it is a fun and meaningful film for youth, and others can enjoy it too.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The most enjoyable high school movie,"John Hughes' *The Breakfast Club* is a timeless coming-of-age film that remains as relevant today as it was in the 1980s. Set almost entirely within the confines of a high school library, the film focuses on five high school students from vastly different social backgrounds who find themselves stuck in Saturday detention. Over the course of the day, they discover they have more in common than they initially thought.Each character is a recognizable archetype: there's the brain (Anthony Michael Hall), the athlete (Emilio Estevez), the basket case (Ally Sheedy), the princess (Molly Ringwald), and the criminal (Judd Nelson). At first, they embody these stereotypes to a T, keeping their distance from each other. However, as the day unfolds, their walls come down and they open up about their fears, struggles, and insecurities.What makes *The Breakfast Club* stand out is its authenticity. Hughes taps into the emotional turbulence of adolescence with a sharp understanding of how teenagers feel misunderstood, pressured by expectations, and isolated by societal labels. The conversations the characters have are raw and honest, exploring themes like parental pressure, self-identity, and the facades they put on to fit in. These moments of vulnerability help them see each other as individuals rather than stereotypes.The film is also buoyed by memorable performances, particularly from Judd Nelson as Bender, the rebellious outsider who challenges authority and pushes the boundaries of the group's comfort zones. Molly Ringwald as Claire, the popular girl, brings depth to a role that could have easily been one-dimensional, showing the cracks beneath her polished surface. The chemistry between the cast is undeniable, with their interactions feeling genuine and spontaneous.Hughes' dialogue is witty, sharp, and heartfelt, making the film both poignant and funny. The iconic soundtrack, highlighted by Simple Minds' *""Don't You (Forget About Me)""*, further embeds the movie in pop culture history. The final scene, with Bender raising his fist in the air, has become one of the most iconic moments in film.Although *The Breakfast Club* is set in a particular time and place, its themes of self-acceptance, breaking down stereotypes, and the pressures of growing up are universal. It's a film that speaks to every generation, reminding us that while we may be labeled, we are all much more than our labels suggest.**Rating:** 9 /10A heartfelt, funny, and enduring classic that explores the struggles of adolescence with depth and sincerity. Perfect for anyone who has ever felt like they don't quite fit in.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Cool Movie,"Not sure why this is such a good movie because it practically has no story to it, but it is. Couple of teenagers meet in a Saturday morning detention class, and does some crazy things. They are all anti authority, but they all can understand each other in their own ways.The stars of this movie reads like who's who of the teen stars of the '80s. They all went on to have successful careers during the '80s. They did have charisma, and were entertaining to watch. The movie might have not worked well if it wasn't for the stellar acting by Judd Nelson.This is an interesting movie that the whole movie happens within the school. It captures the social mood of the 80s well. Kids back then definitely had more peaceful outlook towards their life than now.The movie is an interesting concept movie that the likes were never made again.If there was a ""cult"" movie of the '80s, this one is it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

As everyone remembers being a teenager and the personal problems you face at this time, the film touches you on one level or another. The script is so pure and simple that the characters have to carry the story which is exactly what the cast does. The character development in this film is incredible and you empathise with each of them, especially Jude Nelson as 'bender' (the criminal) who's attention-seeking angry behaviour unravels throughout the film and we see him as the vulnerable character he is.

A 'Brat Pack' movie from just before 'Brat Pack' became an insult.,"I can't separate this film from how I first saw it - in a cinema in San Francisco in 1985, after a 14 hour flight from Sydney. I mainly went there to keep myself awake and get over jet lag. Well, it kept me awake all right: I liked it so much that 4 weeks later, the night before flying back to Australia, I saw it again in the same cinema.I was 23 when I saw it: no longer a teen (though the same age as some of the stars!) but my  memories of being a teen were still fresh. Few teenagers are that articulate, but so what? It's true to what teenagers experience.Apparently Ally Sheedy was originally going to play the Molly Ringwald role. The one thing that could have improved TBC would have been Judd Nelson and Emilio Estevez swapping roles.",,Anonymous,Comedy
What a delight,"When I first watched BC I was about 9 years old and was engrossed. Then, I watched it when I was a teen and liked it, but, thought it was cheesy, especially in one scene with stoned Emilio. Then, I watched in my 20s and saw it, again, in another perspective, retrospective, no cheese, just raw 80s, coming of age, engrossing, calm, funny, extremely well directed and scripted.That's the magic of this movie, it hits a different sweet spot as you age, it ages with you and its so delightful to watch. I can't tell you how much I love the end scene with that particular song and the romance.Being Scottish and listening to 80s legends Simple Minds , makes my heart drop to an emotional beat!There are plenty of coming of age movies out there and lots of fantastic ones (maybe) but in my opinion none have the depth and insular captivating resonance as BC has.

Whiny brat stereotypes classmates,"The Breakfast Club is a movie people put in to view to make their guests leave. It is undoubtedly the greatest waste of great music since The Graduate. Like the Graduate, it has non believable characters who aren't interesting and a lame expository plot line. Two things make this movie remarkably bad. First, it takes what should have been a good idea, showing the ideas of a group of characters, and instead using a whole movie to turn them into ridiculous stereotypes. It becomes evident early on, however, that this is told from the point of view of the one character who is too tough for that (if you ever notice, when someone recounts an event, the one constant is that the narrator is always tough and decisive), which brings us to the second major flaw. The character who tells the story is a whiny brat with an unbelievable superiority complex which most teenagers certainly can't relate to, who gets everything his own way or else, and does nothing but belittle and mock everyone else. Probably the worst script ever.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"""Breakfast Club"" classic","John Hughes has cemented himself as a legend with this masterpiece, from the start all the way to the finish this movie is amazing. Its setting of the bright vibrant 80s along with the eat-your-heart-out soundtrack make for beautiful scenery. We are then Blessed by Molly Ringwald, and Judd Nelson acts in my eyes as the lead characters. Both of them are complete opposites but still the same deep down.At the core of this movie is about opposite people who really shouldn't have anything in common finding common ground. We have a princess who gets everything she could want, a lowlife who only cares about himself, a geek, a wrestler, and a girl with some loose screws. Thing gang of misfits makes for the most exciting hour and a half. As they spend this detention together, they begin peeling back their mask and showing who they really are. This journey of self-discovery is inspiring and freeing seeing the students lie to the principal as to why their door won't stay open this friendship isn't ever stated but is heavily implied throughout the movie. This along with the ability of the movie to tackle real-world issues, within the first 20 minutes is jaw-dropping. The movie speaks on social pressure, family dances, and the quest to find out who you are. Each other character is dealing with something in their lives, and they are all different but when left alone they being to shine light on these problems allowing us to see them at face value.In Conclusion ""The Breakfast Club"" stands the lasting test of time. It's 80's nostalgia, memorable performance, star-studded cast, and profound exploration of the adolescent experience. All allow for the narrative depth far beyond the film, cementing itself as a powerful exploration of the human experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Breakfast Club: Movie review,"'The Breakfast Club' is a 1985 teen dramedy. John Hughes is not only a director of this movie but also a scriptwriter. John Hughes later started to be even more popular because of such of his pictures as: ""Home Alone"" (1990), ""Curly Sue"" (1991), ""Beethoven"" (1992) and other movies that became cult hits. Emilio Estevez, Paul Gleason, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy played six main roles. This movie earned $51.5 million, whereas its budget was $1 million.When five high school students once stayed at school on Saturday morning as a school punishment, they didn't realize that they would get closer to each other by speaking about their lives.This is an emotional movie about teenagers' lives with addictive plot twists. The life stories of the main characters open up to moviegoers gradually, provoking strong feelings. The movie raises and discloses many social topics. Teenagers deal with these topics and many others that have an impact on their lives and they cope with problems in their own ways. Even though the movie was released in 1985, the topics that were revealed in the movie are actual for the contemporary society and for current generations too.Written by Anastasiia Shystovska",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
timeless movie,"""The Breakfast Club"" deals with five different high school students, who meet in Saturday detention. During the detention the Criminal, Basketcase, Princess, Athlete and the Brain discover how they have a lot more in common than they thought. Today the stereotypes would be a bit different. The stereotypes would be the gamer, the athlete, the princess, the criminal, a weird person, the brain and the shy person. More over, the high school society changed a bit, because the detention isn't really popular anymore. Instead of the detention the high school students have to write essays or help to tidy up the classroom. My favorite quote of the movie is "" we are friends"", because it changed the whole atmosphere from tense and desperately to cheerfully. I think the characters would speak to one another when they see each other in school, because they learned how important real friendship is. The basic message of the movie still holds up because high school students are still clique-ish with their friends. Also, everyone still has problems so students are not that different today as they were in the 80's. I really enjoyed ""The Breakfast Club"" because it is a timeless movie, which deals with typical problems of teenagers.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Troubling Gender Double Standards,"John Hughes' The Breakfast Club remains one of the most iconic coming-of-age films, capturing the turbulence and introspection of adolescence through its portrayal of five vastly different high school students stuck together in Saturday detention. With its memorable dialogue, engaging character dynamics, and the universal theme of self-discovery, the film has earned a lasting spot in pop culture. However, beneath its charm and emotional resonance, The Breakfast Club reveals troubling gender double standards and problematic representations that merit examination.The film explores the pressures and stereotypes each character faces, but its treatment of female characters is uneven and often unfair. Claire (Molly Ringwald), labeled the ""princess,"" is subjected to relentless criticism for her femininity, wealth, and perceived privilege. Much of this judgment comes from Bender, whose antagonism frequently crosses into harassment, yet he faces little accountability. Despite his sexually charged advances, some of which border on assault, Claire ends up romantically paired with him-a decision that normalizes harassment as an acceptable form of courtship.Similarly, Allison, the ""basket case,"" undergoes a complete transformation to gain acceptance. Her individuality is stripped away in a makeover scene where Claire redefines her appearance to fit traditional feminine standards. Only after this does Andy, the ""athlete,"" express interest in her, reinforcing the message that women must conform to societal norms to be deemed desirable.The film also perpetuates harmful double standards between male and female characters. While Bender's rebelliousness is romanticized, Allison's eccentricities are dismissed as flaws. Andy, the ""jock,"" escapes critique for his conformity, unlike Claire, whose social status is constantly scrutinized. These disparities highlight the film's tendency to judge its female characters more harshly than its male ones.Though The Breakfast Club is often celebrated for breaking stereotypes, it frequently reinforces them in ways that undermine its central message of understanding and acceptance. While its exploration of teenage struggles and relationships still resonates, its outdated attitudes toward gender and consent require a critical eye. By revisiting classics like this with awareness, audiences can appreciate their cultural impact while recognizing the need for more inclusive and respectful storytelling moving forward.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Breakfast Club,"My all time favourite school type film is Grease however although BC is set in different times it still has the same message. It's tough to be different but it can work. I am English and went to a Catholic all girls school in the 1970's of which I have great memories and without wishing to make it sound perfect there was practically none of the 'you are different so it's OK to pick on you"" type mentality. What was taught was tolerance which the five characters in this film eventually learn as well as four falling in love a little. Also for me as a lady who appreciates individual type actors I wasn't looking at anyone but Judd Nelson all the way through. I like him in New Jack City as well an equally fine film with a fine cast.

"""And each year, these kids get more and more arrogant.""","I wasn't yet born when this movie came out and so therefore I could hardly say whether or not high school life was portrayed correctly. All the same, it's definitely an enjoyable film. There are five students, each symbolizing a certain stereotype as indicated in the movie (athlete, nerd, princess, criminal, and basket-case) and a supervisor who I would personally hate to have in or around my school. Throughout the film, the characters become more than characters; they become someone you know or have seen in your own classes; which is a great tribute to John Hughes. The development of these characters allowed an insight into the troubles of teenagers (which I think are grossly underestimated nowadays). It shows that although a teenager can seem like a lunatic, or snobby, or as a rebel, it is not entirely their own doing. The Breakfast Club perfectly suits the saying ""You should never judge a book by its cover.""-- Spoiler --The plot is actually debatable among some. Some of my friends think that it's a twisted comedy with a bit of romance thrown in there, others think that it's a teenage drama. I personally believe it to be about the character development and the idea that there is more to someone than just an outer appearance and a label. Some think that there are parts of this movie that are cliché, such as the angelic girl falling for the rough ""bad boy"" but these types of clichés probably weren't clichés back then. >.o-- End of Spoiler --In any case, the acting is amazing on everyone's part. Judd Nelson is fantastic as John Bender and Emilio Estavez is equally impressive in his role as Andrew Clark. The movie ends at a point so that you're left wondering what will happen when they meet up again, if they meet up at all. There are a lot of conflicts, some of which are cleverly left to the viewer's imagination and perspective, and overall it's just a well-done, well-acted, insightful, and thought-provoking film.

Saturday is det time!,"Watching this seminal 1980s movie certainly stirs feelings of nostalgia: I'm roughly the same age as the film's central characters, and my school also had Saturday detention (although not quite in the form depicted here). With its archetypal characters, essentially static, dialogue-driven scenes, and internal dance routines, 'The Breakfast Club' is actually quite theatrical; but not without merit. On the downside, there's a dreadful period soundtrack (Simple Minds, anyone?) and some of the incidents are a bit obvious and ploddingly handled. But offsetting this, there are also plenty of genuinely funny and true to life moments. What is a pity the film is somewhat overbalanced by Judd Nelson's character; for sure, he's meant to be an attention seeker, but Nelson just seems too old for the part, more like a man pretending to be a boy than a real angsty teen. In the movie's second half, the character is quieter and the benefits are clear. The film has a crowd-pleasing bias towards the pupils in detention (as opposed to their teacher), and it ends with one of those make-overs beloved of Hollywood teen-movies, where the plain girl becomes beautiful (but only if you have a certain aesthetic preference). However, there's still more to think about about than in the average movie of this genre, not least the idea that the power of one human over another is always (in some sense) applied through consent. And compared to the likes of modern successors like 'American Pie', there's a sweetness here lost in the last 20 years.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"The ""Talky"" Hughes movie","I was in high school when this came out and at the time I adored this movie. However, and this is not a strong criticism, I watch it today and I realize it's not much apart from almost 2 hours of talking. I love the jokes and the characters are outstanding but the ""bull session"" towards the end goes on way too long. I know that scene is meant to define each character and their stereotypes but Hughes didn't normally rely on so much dialogue to define characters. I also have to admit that your normal high school students don't have that much ""depth"". Teen angst is one thing but these characters are drawn out to the point of being in a Greek tragedy. It is an 80's Hughes teen classic but the drama in this particular movie tends to weigh it down at times.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Average Flick,"Child of the 70s and a teen in the 80s, I recently captured the ""Breakfast Club"" on DvD. I had not had the pleasure to see this picture when it came out in theatre in 1985. Yes, the 80s is omnipresent, especially in fashion and music. The script is excellent. And so is the acting. But this is all too US-centric. And somewhat clichéd. In fact, over in Europe, most notably in the UK, it was a flop and failed to compete with the likes of ""Witness"" and ""Police Academy 2"". Most of my american friends should know that Ally Sheedy aside from ""Wargames"" fame, the ""Brat Pack"" was literally unheard of in Europe.

Setting the film in Chicago, as opposed to New York (although who would notice as it's all indoors) was, in my opinion a good idea. Having a representative from all the groups of typical school life (even those in Britain)is pure genius - the jock, the pretty princess, the geek/boff, the guy-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks, and the loner (the one who never seemed to have any friends and always seemed odd). What made this particularly good to watch is that everyone knows that these people would never engage in conversation outside of the Saturday detention, and it gave each of them a chance to see each others' lives from a different perspective. Who knew that a Jock would actually admit that they hated the Jock Life??? An all round great film, that can be watched again and again, without getting boring.",,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best movies about teenagers,"It's hard for me to review a classic movie like this one. Even though it's not a perfect movie, it did an excellent job at explaining what being in high school is all about. I've been a child and a teenager in the 90's so I never had the chance to watch this great movie when it came out. I also had to endure all of the painful and unrealistic teen movies and soap operas of the 90's that were often set on glamorizing high school life or preaching to teenagers about serious topics such as teen pregnancy. I'm not saying that any of these movies or TV series were bad. They just weren't about teenagers. They were about models in their 20's who acted like idiots. Or they were written by adults in order to pass certain messages to teenagers.What is so great about The Breakfast Club is that it brings to life many characters that are completely different. The ""high school stereotypes"" is something that's still present even today. The stereotypes might be a little different, but after watching this movie, we realize it was this way even in the 80's. This is an aspect of high school life that was never discussed in movies. As a teenager, when I first saw this movie, I immediately thought that it probably helped teens in the 80's understand their peers better. It can also help adults understand why teenagers can act certain ways.But this movie does not preach to us. A proof of this is that the parents are accused for putting so much pressure on their children and making them become the stereotypes that they are now. In fact, all adults in this movie have a negative image, which is something I liked. In most modern teen TV series, there is always a teacher or a parental figure who makes the teenagers learn something. The adults are ""always right"". However, in real life, it's not necessarily like this. Parents and other adults can also be a negative influence to their children and sometimes mistreat them. John Hughes understood that.It wasn't a perfect movie, of course. By example, certain scenes were silly and over the top, and the acting wasn't perfect. But isn't this what made the charm of this movie?",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best of the Brat Pack movies......,"It has been almost 20 years since I first saw this film as a 15 year old kid in 1985. Since then I've developed interests in directors far more intellectual than John Hughes. Assuredly, if I became a film director I would want to cite Akira Kurosawa as a main influence as opposed to John Hughes, but like Kevin Smith, I would have to give credit for the impact Hughes' films had on my adolescence. He was one of the few directors who focused on mostly teen films, though ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" and ""Natl. Lampoon's Vacation"" drew larger audiences. Among his films about teens, ""Breakfast Club"" is by far the best. It's central characters, played by Molly Ringwald and company, represented a cross section of teenage America. In an odd way, it resembles the Turkish film ""Yol"" by director Yilmaz Guney which came out in 1982, in this regard. ""The Breakfast Club"" fully examines the plight of these characters during the Reagan years which were difficult for many of us who grew up then. This film may not stand up to ""Rebel Without a Clause,"" perhaps the best teen film ever made, but it captures its' generation, its' period, and the secluded isolation which was teenage America in the 80s. I am not surprised it has become popular with teens today. It may not be ""Rahsomon,"" but it is a crowning achievement for commerical films of this period, and its' title song ""Don't You Forget About Me"" still hauntingly helps this film capture the loneliness and fear of rejection which always seems to loom over teeangers whichever generations hey find themselves in.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Unlike most of us, this film ages well","I *love* this film. I am not originally from Chicago, so I was never a big John Hughes fan, although settling here 20 years ago to raise a family definitely deepened my appreciation for his films. Even from my East Coast POV where I lived when the film debuted, and from a West Coast POV where I lived when I first saw it, this is not only Mr. Hughes' masterwork but a ""best in class"" exemplar of the ""teen drama"" genre. I made sure that both my kids saw it before they started high school. US High Schools (when I was coming up at least) were so Balkanized then; they seem to be less so today, maybe in-part because we all made our kids watch The Breakfast Club! Yet we (at least I) watch it with a certain nostalgia for the eighties. On one level, it's one long music video. On another, a there act Greek drama (set in a school library, no less, albeit a very cool one). On another, a kitschy Hollywood comedy. One of my favorite films.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

But this movie was on another level, I love how sad and intense it is. I have never watched a movie that made me laugh, cry and feel happy as much as this one, which is just wonderful.There are some scenes that haven't aged properly and aren't appropriate as much anore, but that is another bit that makes this one of the most iconic movies of all time!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I spiked the 9 to pull for a higher than 8...,"By happenstance I am fan of film since I was small so finding myself working in a video store { that could be hard to explain to much younger people } in 1986 after seeing this film in old-school, 1000-seat auditoriums -- and then recommending it to customers was an easy win for me.At the time I told folks all of us need to see this every ten years or so just to be reminded of the feeling.Nearly forty years later I am thinking that this will be, for its time, analogous to The Importance of Being Earnest in an entirely differently glib way.Hughes, for pop cinema shows much of the same insightful attributes as the Victorian interpretations of their own time of Wilde, et.al, in theater.This extends into wider themes high-pointed by the ruminations starting in the time of Mary Wollenstone Shelley and our many interpretations of THAT work since the original.The Breakfast Club will be in the same sense timeless while of a different time -- still discussing how we feel *today* -- and yet each time feels that same way for those who lived it.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Breakfast Club,"The Breakfast Club, directed by John Hughes, touches base on popular stereotypes that can be found in any typical American high school. The film follows five students of very different backgrounds on one day in detention. During a regular school day this particular group of teens would never be seen talking to each other or dare to associate with one another. When they see who they are ""stuck with"" for their detention, none of them are pleased, to say the least. The students are John Bender (Judd Nelson), Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy) and Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), who are the bad boy, the jock, the popular rich girl, the emo, and the nerd of the school. The teacher in charge of their detention is Mr. Vernon (Paul Gleason), who is also the principal of their school. The only thing that the students notice they share in common right away is their hatred for Mr. Vernon. Mr. Vernon assigns them to all write a paper about ""Who you think you are"". During the course of the detention and through actually speaking to one another, the students find out that the misconceptions they each had of one another were extremely wrong. I believe the Breakfast Club did a good job introducing all of the characters and began in the right direction allowing the viewer to see each of the students as the other students saw them. We as the audience were introduced to who they ""really"" were right along with the other class mates. John Hughes also did the movie Ferris Beulers Day Off. Both of these movies seem similar to me. In one movie it focuses on a larger group of teens and the differences they thought they had in turn to find out how similar they are. Ferris Buelers Day Off focuses more on one student, his sister, and one of his friends. Again there was a hatred for the principal by Ferris and his friend. Ferris' sister was the nerd sucking up to the principal trying to help him bust Ferris for skipping school. Ferris and his friend were the ""bad boys"" trying to have a day of fun by skipping school. I think the Breakfast Club was more of a drama for Hughes where Ferris Buelers Day Off was to be more comical. However both films focused on stereotypes of teens. Overall I really enjoyed this film and watching each of the characters take on the ""real them"". It shows how high school can really be for teens and how it is to be okay with displaying who you really are.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A classic for all the right reasons.,"I had heard of the The Breakfast Club before this year, but never got the chance to watch it. And when i did watch it, and finally got what the long-time hype was about.The plot is the really simple to explain,5 kids from a high school have to go to an all day detention. and that's it. But all theses kids are from different places and high school groups and would never talk to each other by choice.The Jock, the Princess, the Nerd, the Basket- case and the future Criminal.But the main focus is all about that their all so much more than that one characteristic. And they all have a lot more in common than they seem. Just because their labelled doesn't mean there not so much more. And as the movie goes on, they do become friends because they have some things in common doesn't mean they also have differences and clash.All the performances are very good, every actor fully understands their character. All the characters are like-able for different reasons, but my personal favourite is Bender. He's honest, doesn't care what people think about him , he knows how everyone works and can figure them out a person just by looking at them and also is a great s**t talker.i was honestly shocked when i found this film had only won 1 award, when it deserves more. Although the story may seen cliché now with things like Glee and Perks of being a wallflower etc. But still is a 80's classic, story telling at it's best and still relate-able to this day.",,Anonymous,Comedy
School and students,"Five main characters appear in this movie. They are high school students in USA. Their nicknames are Princess, Athlete, Brain, Criminal and Basket Case. Their nicknames reflect their personality and characteristics. Everyone has each kind of troubles and problems. One day, a teacher gathers them at the library because he gives them the work. The work is that boys and girls write the essay. The essay's theme is what they think about themselves. At first, they are loath to be gathered and get the works; however, they begin to gradually talk to each other. Moreover, they think about their friends and themselves, then, they change themselves. This film is made in USA. The location of story are in USA too. However, what teenager has many problems maybe be not different around the world. All around the worlds, most junior high school students and high school students have many troubles and problems each other, though the kind of problems are different each students. Of course, the kinds are different from characters of this film too. However, it is not different that students of this age have a lot of troubles. I recommend the film to people who have problems.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Can the Breakfast Club still depict life in school nearly 40 years later?,"For me, a teenager attending 11th grade in a high school in Canada, it is kind of hard to decide whether The Breakfast Club still depicts what high school is like in 2022.As far as school and the process of learning are concerned, it still is very accurate what already makes this movie a timeless piece. However, when we look at it from a social point of view, I think that The Breakfast Club is a bit outdated. Especially the way the ""students"" interact with each other and the way they behave will most likely not be seen nearly 40 years later.This feeling is probably caused by the actual age of the actors which ranges from 16 to 25. Speaking of the actors actual age, this fact makes it a bit hard for me to connect or identify with the ""pupils"" as they look much older than what real students would at this point. Letting grown-ups portray teenagers distracts from the message the movie wants to convey, which in my opinion is the best part of it as it really was deep and made me think about the film even days later.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"I teach in a High School, and it ain't like this","I remember I watched this a long time ago before I was a teacher. For some reason this movie was insanely popular at the time. I don't know why.

First they hate each other, and in the end they love each other.The writing is horrible, the actors are not likable, and the movie is not realistic. Here is a realistic movie script. 5 high school kids serve Saturday detention from different social groups. Teacher stays in the room and tells the kids to be quiet, or they will serve the detention again. Kids read or more likely sleep for 5 hours and then leave. On Monday they resume their lives in their separate cliques in their schools.Oh but my script doesn't make any money because most morons aka the public don't like reality.Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this turd, you'll never get it back.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I really liked the Breakfast Club,"Breakfast Club Review By:Iona McAllenI think that this film has stood the test of time because so many people are able to relate to the characters, the issues the characters are going through; their parents, peer pressure, pressure to succeed and more. I really like this film and can relate to it because as a teenager I have lots of stress and pressures to do well in school, sports, and maintain a social life. In the film every character had something they had to deal with; Andy his dad and not being able to think for himself, Claire her parents and having to do what her friends say, Alison being alone, Brian his grades and pressure from his family, and John his parents. This film portrays the lives of teenagers very accurate; because of this many people can relate to the characters and the issues they have.The mood the director was trying to set was that no matter who you are, what social group you belong to, who your family is, and no matter how different you are, everyone has pressures and issues they have to deal with.This movie is directed to mainly teens, but because so many people are able to relate to the movie anyone from teenagers to adults are able to watch the movie and relate to the characters and their situations.I think that the Breakfast club is a movie because it is for leisure entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Ode To Teen Spirit,"I remember hearing about The Breakfast Club for years before I actually got around to watching it. As soon as I graduated from elementary school and started on my way to high school, I had people constantly telling to watch The Breakfast Club because it's ""amazing"". They would then tell me they love the movie and I could never seem to get a word out of them past that. No one would tell me what the plot was or why it was so amazing, until one day I straight up asked my mom what this ""amazing"" movie is about. She replied with, ""It's about a bunch of teenagers."" I wasn't sure what to do with all of this new information, so I finally sat myself down and watched it. I have to say, I can certainly see why everyone recommended this movie for my then excited soon-to-be eighth grade self. Despite the fact that this movie is set around 30 years ago, the ideas and issues they cover in this movie are timeless. While the focus is teens' issues, they also give us a glimpse into the world of those who are growing older. They show us how alarming it can be to watch as the younger generations stumble in, seemingly destroying everything they can, while the adults change unknowingly into the people they'd hoped they'd never be.There isn't anything I really dislike about this movie. Normally, I would have a whole list of things that I think could be tweaked in a movie. There's something about this movie that feels different. Every time I find something that could be considered a ""flaw,"" I consider the context and I realize that it is not in fact a ""flaw,"" it is simply something that adds to the story and tone of the film. This film almost feels untouchable; it is still so famous and well-loved so many years later. Despite the fact that it's set in a sketchy, nearly unoccupied high school, this movie somehow contributes to the romanticized fantasy all eighth graders have about high school. High school is a place for the big kids: it's where you find your clique and look cool. No matter what is happening in your life, there's always going to be at least one more person who knows what you're going through, which is an idea that is relevant for people of all ages. I really love the fact that John Hughes took characters that you can see in everyday aspects of high school life and broke them down to show that they are multifaceted and more than the image they project.All of the adults in this movie are shown as stubborn, insensitive fools who refuse to bother listening or paying attention to the kids who's live they're messing up. One of the most memorable adults in this film is the looming presence of authority, Principal Vernon. The students seem to view him as a bad guy and I can certainly see why. When I look at him as a character, I see an unhappy, afraid, old man who feels like he's tripping over his feet trying to keep up with the rest of the world. He believes that he is a victim of injustice: the kids are just getting brattier and brattier and he's just a guy trying to knock some sense back into them. He receives a strong, cold glass of reality when Carl (the janitor) tells him bluntly and without malice that it's not the kids who are changing, it's him. Yes, I do agree that a lot of young people are brats: it's what we do. We're too inexperienced and new to the world to see beyond our problems. What Vernon needs to understand is that he is the one who is changing. Yes, parents can't get away with the same punishment they did a few decades ago and yes, there is a surplus of new technology that is changing the way people experience their lives. But Vernon is changing himself. Nothing seems bright and shiny and new anymore. He's seen every kind of kid you could see, he knows the tricks, and his life has fallen into a sad routine. He expects respect for his experience in the world, while all he does is throw his weight around and pretend that he understands every kid he meets because he's probably met at least three others like them. He can't remember why he chose to do this. He watches bright eyed kids graduate every year to experience new adventures and start their lives. All of these kids are passionate and ready to live and learn new things, but he has no more adventures left.This movie is a cult classic because it has aspects that appeal to both the young and old. Both sides are provided with an insight into the other. We learn about each other's struggles and find that appearances can indeed be misleading. Despite all of the images and airs people may put on, we are all complex humans with valid feelings and thoughts. All we want is to find empathy and belonging. Decades may pass, but we all still have basic, common struggles. I think one of the reasons this movie is so loved is because it's so easy to connect with: no matter who you are, if you're a human, you'll probably be able to relate to at least one aspect of this move. This movie helps remind the audience that it's okay if you don't have everything figured out, no matter what age you are. It's hard when you don't know who you are or can't remember.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Child of The 80's with an honest review,"I am typical Gen X. Born in 1968, this movie came out during the winter of my junior year of high school. Did I see this movie in the theaters when it came out? Duh. Everyone my age did. Did I think it was fantastic or one of the best films ever at the time? No. I enjoyed it, but it was an above-average teenage angst movie that was all the rage in the 1980s. I would give it a 7.5 or 8 out of 10. This rating may be my own bias because, by my admission, I don't like ""deep"" or ""meaningful"" movies. I save that for reading novels. I view movies strictly as an escape from reality and pretty much want fluff. Fast cars and explosions are all the rage for me.However, I think the romantic nostalgia of the 1980s era has boosted this film. The reality is that while there were clicks like the stereotypes featured in this movie, they would not interact with one another on this deep of a level back in 1985. The reality is that if a brain, athlete, basket case, princess, and a criminal were placed in an all-day Saturday detention back in 1985, they would probably not interact at all. Certainly, the teacher wouldn't go off for hours on end, leaving them alone. However, I know that reality doesn't sometimes make a good Hollywood movie.The truth is that not every teenager in the 1980s was having an existential crisis, and even back in 1985, my friends and I thought this movie was kind of ""preachy"" at times. Of course, John Hughes's movies were well done and entertaining, so we liked the film, but I think if you asked most teenagers back in 1985 whether or not this was an all-time great movie, most of us would have honestly said it wasn't.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A forgotten gem of a teen movie,"This teen movie actually comes across more like a theatrical play, which is no bad thing. It is a purely dialogue driven film, and in the hands of a lesser writer, could have turned out to be utter drivel, but luckily it didn't and this is an intriguing character drama.The Breakfast Club is simply a comical study of the 5 different stereotypes that are present in most high schools, and while this doesn't call for any major plot, the setting of the library as the detention hall fits in perfectly. The writing is really out of the top drawer, and the young cast pull it off remarkably well, in particular Judd Nelson, who really should have carved a career for himself; he has a rare knack for knowing how to deliver one liners.At times the film does drag on a bit; the scene where Estevez gets high and dances about is pretty embarrassing, and the overlong 20 minute chat towards the end could have been trimmed down a bit. However, this is one of the few teen comedies that manages to hit the mark more often than it misses. Oh, and it contains that great song by Simple Minds as the perfect bookend: ""Don't you, forget about me ...""7/10.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"An effective film that works pleasantly, despite its flaws.","I had pretty low expectations for this movie, as I don't really like teen movies. However, I must admit that the film is good and well-made. It's not perfect or exceptional, but it works and entertains without our time being wasted. I can understand why so many people consider this movie a classic, but I don't agree. It's not such a good movie to have that designation, and it has maintained a certain aura to this day, this is due to a certain cult status it has acquired over the years. The film takes place in a school on a Saturday, in which five students who do not know each other will be grounded, each for their own reasons. The teacher, however, is an idiot, and they will end up enjoying the day, listening to music, talking and discovering that they are not so different from each other.The film has weaknesses, starting with the thin script it presents. In fact, there is no story or action here. If the movie didn't have so many humorous scenes or where the characters escape and walk around the school, we would have an hour and a half of dialogue. Another problem is the use of all the most common stereotypes in high school movies: we have an idiotic teacher with no authority, a rebellious student with problems at home, a good student under pressure to have good grades, a beautiful and smug student from a wealthy family, an athletic student with anger issues, and a lonely, weird student. The only thing that saves them is, deep down, the way they gain depth and personality as the dialogues flow. And could I still speak of the illogicality of this punishment, in which five troubled students are left alone in a deserted school?Regardless of the script's weaknesses and other issues, the film has a young cast that does a very committed and interesting job. Of them all, the one who impressed me the most was Judd Nelson, who managed to impart a genuine rebelliousness and irreverence to his character. I also really liked Ally Sheedy. She starts the film almost silently, letting her pose, and bizarre costume dominate our attention, but then she presents us with an intense, intelligent and pleasantly unpleasant and sarcastic character. Anthony Hall has a more palatable and emotional character, which he plays satisfactorily, as do Molly Ringwald and Emilio Estevez, and they also worked well in their respective characters. A word, more, for Paul Gleason, and the impeccable way in which he played a mediocre teacher.Technically, it's a low-key film. It has good cinematography and was very well shot, with sharpness and good colors. It doesn't feature great visual or special effects, but what it brings us is well done and works pleasantly. The library set was well-built, and the school is credible. But what amazes us is, clearly, the soundtrack, and particularly the theme song ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"", which is heard in the credits and which became one of the biggest hits of that decade, in that many were young or (like me) born.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Breakfast Club,"This film's theme relates to an array of issues that revolves around the development of the characters; influence, acceptance, diversity, prejudice, tolerance, family issues and how to just survive high school. ""The Breakfast Club"" is about a group of five teenagers who have very little in common and don't care much for each other. They come from different walks of life and are reluctant to accept each other. But when sentenced to serve a detention in the high school library on a Saturday morning for eight hours, they end up revealing their inner secrets (with the help of a little pot session) and realize they have more things in common than they first thought; by the end of the day they become friends. ""Somewhat"" supervised by the Principal Richard Vernon played by Paul Gleason who ironically is also doing detention in his office and knocking back a few beers. The outcome is very predictable, which could be an understatement, but the cast was very effective as their characters opened up to their emotions. The main characters were the typical students in most high schools in the 1980's and to some extent are still the same today; Andrew the jock played by Emillo Estevez, Brian the brain played by Anthony Michael Hall, Bender the jerk played by Judd Nelson, Claire the popular princess played by Molly Ringwald, and Allison the introverted basket case played by Ally Sheedy. Written and directed by John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off; Sixteen Candles) has the ability to tap into the minds of teenagers and show them as adolescents trying to find a place in a culture that is sometimes hardened and unsympathetic or unable to understand the dilemma of survival in high school and society. The sound track used in the film was typical 1980's music which had various artists including Simple Minds ""Don't You (Forget about me) and a main feature point in the film, without the sound track this movie would have been lifeless. Brian played by Anthony Michael Hall opens and ends the movie with a short voice-over narration. The inside/out editing technique is apparent in the very first shot where the scene ""breaks"" away (looks like glass shattering) and the focus moves on to the beginning of the movie. Overall this movie was dead on in the 80's; influential and controversial at the same time and although I preferred John Hughes' movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off much better this movie was Hughes' most successful.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Shows how adolescence feels,"This film reflects what adolescence means.The film is a portrait of everything that encompasses adolescence, such as hiding our emotions and our feelings from others, sudden significant mood swings, the difficulty of opening our hearts to other people, the constant search to fit in with the others, and the similar feelings that we all have at that age. The film also exposes the damage that stereotypes do to our society where almost all social interaction is based on this concept and shows us that our future is decided by us, not by our parents. The development of the characters is very complete, being able to see the depth in the feelings of each one of them, there are very good performances, the musicalization is adequate and very good, and despite being very deep, it also manages to be fun by showing us the two faces of the currency of this life stage.This film manages to adequately portray what it means to be a teenager and go through that stage, exposing all the emotions and feelings that most of us experience, as well as alluding to the importance of forming our personality at that stage, as well as raising the importance of being ourselves and not judging without knowing the person, definitely one of the most faithful portraits of what it is to be a teenager.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Prepare to hate me.,"I just don't get it.  I am a teenager, but I can't imagine why anyone would like the Breakfast Club.  This movie treats humanity and high school like a series of social stereotypes that play themselves out to a happy ending. This was, I believe, my least favorite film of the 80s...and one of my 5 least favorite of all time.  Let's examine what is really being said in this film...OK, every high school has a boring jock, a mean and boring bully, a mean and boring prom queen, an interesting-but-flawed ""basket case,"" and a nice nerd. That's the set-up, right?  Now, add a completely one-dimensional principal and an overly sympathetic janitor...shake...and serve...The kids will eat it up, but what are we really eating?As far as I can tell, this film has three messages.  Even if a person has a very interesting personality, they must abandon their individuality and date a complete jerk.  Ally Sheedy's ""basket case,"" one of the film's two interesting characters, is forced at the end to lose her personality so that she can be an acceptable partner for the jock.  Molly Ringwald's ""princess,"" one of the film's five bad characters, is forced to ignore how awfully Judd Nelson treated her, just because he is an abused child.  While it is true that Sheedy's character wasn't completely noble or realistic at first, when she put on the make-up and became a Ringwald, she lost every ounce of credibility that she might have kept.  I felt awful that someone who had such character would lose it so quickly.The second message seems to be the fact that adults are stupid and evil, unless they are on the kids' side.  The principal and the parents are bad, the janitor is good.  Very realistic...The third message is that even if prom queens can get together with bullies and jocks can get together with basket cases, there is no chance that anyone would ever be interested in the nerd...who happens to be the only nice guy in the movie.This film is supposed to be the greatest of all American teen angst films, but by stripping away the credibility of its already stereotypical characters, and by promoting other teen stereotypes (the nerd, the adults...), it is actually doing a disservice to the American teen.  If you want a good film about teens, throw BC in the garbage where it belongs and watch another Hughes...Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  Or better yet, watch a foreign film.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Pretty Decent with some flaws,"The cast really does a good job with their roles. The movie explores the struggle of adolescents from different cliques trying to find their place in the world. It shows how being taken outside your comfort zone and norm can help you understand others better.The movie also has some pretty entertaining comedy sprinkled throughout, although I thought the ending really spoiled a lot of things the movie worked to build. It took what was a very realistic circumstance and made it unbelievable with how they all exited. A shot of them on the Monday following detention and seeing how they chose to interact would have been pretty cool. Seeing whether the bond they built would last or was just a one day superficial thing, as teens are susceptible to, would have been very interesting. I suppose we are left to extrapolate ourselves on what would have happened which I suppose isn't the worst thing either.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"All different, yet so similar.","This movie was a great example of how people can set their differences aside, despite their backgrounds, everyone can find a way to relate to each other in one way or another.The movie depicted 5 very different people with a lot of free time on their hands, that made them interact with each other no matter what. Even the biggest asshole can become your friend at the end, and despite his inappropriate and obnoxious behaviour.A great glimpse of the 80's, nothing too fancy, just a good movie about life and how important it is to be an individual, yet have the ability to express your opinions and feelings to others, maybe people not so close to you, because the people close to you can put too much pressure on you and maybe sometimes it is just easier to share your troubles with strangers, than to keep it to yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Disappointing,"This film was obviously ground-breaking in its time. However, it is not comparable to the quality of film-making today. I only sat through this film because it's a classic. I understand it touched on revolutionary themes at the time and I can appreciate that, but a lot less was needed for a film to qualify as ""good"" in the 80s than is needed now, and this film has made that evident to me. It includes several clichés that would be unacceptable to today's audiences. As well as this there a holes in the characters stories which allow for poor character development.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Good movie,"This movie is a really funny tale of a handful of teens trapped in a detention session late in the afternoon while the school is only maintained by its vengeful principle and a Janitor. The principal paces around the school barking orders at them. Meanwhile one of the kids terrorizes him and the other kids too. They all ignore him and give him the cold shoulder while he wanders around the classroom. They have a lot of fights and bickers but throughout the movie they slowly form a tentative bond, and towards the end this bond deepens.

You won't get enough of it.,"A timeless masterpiece all comedies should strive for.Probably my favorite comedy of all time at the moment.Smart but remains accessible to anyone. It's not esoteric, doesn't reference anything obscure, doesn't use convoluted jokes, but as soon as you start to analyze it - you understand just how smart it can be.The dialogue is phenomenal, every actor is special, they definitely bring life to every scene, their impact is similar to a Brad Pitt in his prime in something like ""Fight Club"" or ""Twelve Monkeys"". Their performance is mesmerizing, and maybe, most importantly - relatable.Timeless on all aspects. It proves that a human excrement covered in even a million vfx still remains such at its core. Nothing will beat a good script, smart dialogue, good directing, superb acting. Today's blockbusters could learn a thing or two from this movie. I'd take one movie like this over 100 tasteless and pointless remakes.It shines even In a world of bite-sized media where people's attention span doesn't extend past the current meme or tik-tok.

An insight on what it's like to be a teen,"Although I wasn't around in the 80s, this film still sums up a lot of what teenagers go through and how everything is much more emotional when you are that age. Those who say this film is too ""overrated"" and ""too emotional"" or ""does not say anything"" you are completely wrong. This film will show you everything it is like to be a teen and I bet if you look back you can see that. 
They take things very seriously and the breakfast club sums up that and also how their whole life is a popularity contest or trying to make your parents proud. 
It's all about how five totally different teenagers are chucked together and changes each other's life. I bet if you went into a school today you would see the exact same people just with different clothes and phones shoved in their hands. This film teaches about teenagers and how they are not really those horrible teens making all that noise on the end of your road, no it shows you that they will take things too seriously and they think that they're life's are hopless.

pretty good movie,"""The Breakfast Club"" is a 1985 American coming-of-age comedy-drama film written, produced, and directed by John Hughes, the same filmmaker of ""home lost"". the famous film of 1990. Critics consider it one of the greatest high school films of all time. the film plot is pretty easy, the story take place on a normal spring Saturday in America, at 8.00 am when five pour guys are forced to join in a special high school detention for students who didn't follow the rules. Detention consist in stay into the school library writing a 1000 words essay speaking about the reason of their detention. hours passing and the library starts to be boring and oppressive as Vernon, the teacher who have fun in molesting the students, so, finally the tough kid can't resist picking on the prom queen, and then there is a series of exchanges. they discovered that, in their self difference they are so similar,and only put away every prejudice they can show to others their real behavior.It begins so an original story where the most difference guys create a strong relation with each others during the whole period of their detention. i think that this movie probably was so innovative for the '80s period when nobody cared about teenager mentality and their behavior, with this film the filmmaker create a original and addictive plot for young guys. With this movie i think the filmmaker'd represent the short period of childhood that will be destroyed by overcome of adulthood. Why? You will discover your own by watching this pretty nice film! enjoy yourself",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An Intergenerational Club,"This is another movie I saw as a teenager, I liked it, but I never thought it would become a classic and that future generations would watch it and cite it as a reference.It is true that it was one of the pioneers of what would come to be called a ""coming of age"". At the time, for lack of any other designation, it was called a teen movie. It was of particular interest to teens who saw themselves in those neurotic characters. But it was also of interest to pedagogues and sociologists, who wanted to understand the problems and motivations of the new generations.Today it certainly appeals to nostalgic people, but also to a new generation that wants to understand the previous one and is even capable of being surprised by some intergenerational points of contact.The film remains interesting and reasonably up to date, which demonstrates that it managed to capture a bit of the teenage psychology. Maybe that's why it continues to attract new generations of viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

As Good As the Brat Pack Could Be,"""The Breakfast Club"" is almost a good film, but it becomes a bit too serious in the film's final acts.  Or you could say it messes up early by trying to pass as a comedy.  As can be seen, the film's focus is disjointed and never clear.  Five young people at a Chicago high school have to serve a Saturday of detention.  Of course all are from different backgrounds, and immediately show their distaste for each other.  However, they learn about each other and figure out that they are not that different after all.  Judd Nelson is super, he is the film's greatest asset.  Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, and Molly Ringwald are all adequate.  Ally Sheedy is definitely the weakest link as she is quiet the first half of the movie and is then really annoying when she actually starts talking.  Paul Gleason is also on hand as the principal, but his part is never really explored as thoroughly as it should have been.  Once again John Hughes shows his shortcomings as a director and screenwriter with this one.  Above average, but not as good as some people think.  3.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Like a middle-finger to adults,"I was an adult when I first watched ""The Breakfast Club"", and it spoke to the high-schooler in me. A real head-turner, this one. What makes it so resonant is the authentic depiction of high school teenagers - five disparate archetypes brought together during detention. I say archetypes, but I think everyone in the audience can relate to (at least) one of the characters. Hughes' writing is the blood that courses through the movie's veins, but it's got a cast that really makes the whole thing work (especially Paul Gleason). Also a pretty good soundtrack (not just for ""Don't You Forget About Me"", but also ""Fire in the Twilight"", easily my favorite). And there's something about the locations in a John Hughes movie. His choice of high school is both something that feels close to where I went, and a place I want to visit one of these days (his forte wasn't just writing and soundtracks; the man really knew where to shoot).This is a movie with real staying power. And the only thing I have to say against(?) this movie is Ally Sheedy's makeover near the end. It never sat well with me, and it's an unnecessary perpetuation of the importance of looks (just before we hear Anthony Michael Hall reading their rebellious letter to the principal, at that).I dunno, that's just me.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A classic...in spite of itself,"I'll fess up: I enjoy this movie. Or rather I should say, I enjoy the first half or so of this movie. As is typical of John Hughes 2-3 year golden period in the 80s, this movie kind of peters out for me about midway through, probably around the time they all get high. That said, I am under no illusions about the quality of this film. The cast, all young actors who became bastions of the decade's films but struggled outside of the eighties, are as laboured as ever in these stereotyped roles. Each one is, admittedly, being expected to play up to their 'title' in the movie to a certain degree. However, when given an emotional range to portray, each one of these kids flubs it (does anyone buy for a second the 'tender side' of Judd Nelson's character?). The direction is typical Hughes, for the time and beyond. It's hard to imagine he does much more than set up the camera and say 'Action!' most of the time, because those rare occasions he tries anything inventive it goes awry (e.g., the pan shot around the stoned circle that gets obscured for several seconds by the rail). But he's never needed to stretch his directorial muscle and nobody's ever wanted him to: we see his movies to be entertained by quirky, endearing characters, not to be stunned by his camera work. And that's what he does here. This is, likewise, a typical Hughes story. A group of kids are thrust together in an unlikely circumstance (in-school suspension is typical to teenhood, sure, but at least three of these kids effectively chose to be there). They find a little bit of themselves in each other, and vice versa. All come out (perhaps) changed by the experience. This is what Hughes does...or did, anyway: he designs likable characters, in spite of their flaws, who you want to see pull it together by the end of the film. We do, and they kind of do. I'd like to believe that it's just that this movie came out when I was their age that makes this a more poignant and precise picture of teenage mentality. I don't think, however, that there has been another movie that attempts to draw a broadly outlined picture of the teenage personality and does it sympathetically. Most teen pictures within the past 15 years do, of course, specialise in the broadly drawn characters...but you as a viewer are rarely expected to sympathise with any but the 'hero.' Unfortunately, this movie has grown extremely dated in the time since its release, and I'd be surprised if most teenagers today could find any reason to watch it. A shame, truly, because a film like this becomes a significant pop-cultural milestone for its generation, and every generation should have one.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Flawed, but fairly watchable","It's a great movie for teenage wannabee serious film buffs. However, it's trivial for anyone who's seen more than a few films to start picking holes in it.

I have to say that the scene with the broken glass was just pants. However, it could be seen as a 'trainer' movie, and as such it's quite a good one.If you're ~15 years old - see this movie.

Although the movie is very old, the issues being brought up are timeless and the message conveyed here is very powerful.

Perhaps it appeals to its own generation most and so continues to appeal to them as the get older. It's about a group of white teenagers in Middle America but it still reaches to the viewer wherever they are as it addresses some of the issues all teenagers face to a greater or lesser degree.

Over-rated film,"""The Breakfast Club"" is an altogether mediocre film, that could have  been a lot better, except that its major flaws tainted the rest of the movie`s good quality.  This supposedly teen classic has a pretty basic but interesting plot that intrigued me; five very different teens stuck in a library for a whole day, serving detention. After I viewed the film, I was let down. The beginning of the film was quite slow, it took quite a long time for the ""heart pouring"" near the end, which felt kind of rushed and forced.  Practically all the characters were one-dimensional and stereotypical, (the jock, the princess, the tough guy, the nerd, etc). The only exception was the basket-case girl, whom I admit, left me cracking up every second with her scathingingly funny remarks.  The biggest problem of the film though, is the ending. For some strange reason, the princess and tough guy magically fall in love, even though they were at each other`s throats before. That fraction of the film just irritated me.

A day of figuring oneself out!,"The breakfast club is a buildungsroman of five high school stereotypes who figure themselves out that dull Saturday when they meet each other in detention. Brilliant acting by the star cast; the last scene where they are sitting on the floor and discussing what they did to get in here is pretty interesting. Good work in showing how family and parental influence affects children; the peer and parental pressure and ""image"" that directs their lives, and others'. Sexuality, grades, friends, fighting parents- everyone's life juggles between these and they come out of the detention room with an essay telling 'who they are'. It is not an emotional or nostalgic movie, and is a fine watch, but won't make you reaching out for tissues, reminding you of your school times. Written and directed by John Hughes, it is a clichéd story, but a good critical reading into the mindset of children.

Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy and Judd Nelson are the highlights of the cast, particulary Sheedy who says almost nothing during the film and still manages to make an impact. Emilio Estevez and Molly Ringwald are a litle bland, but so are their characters. Paul Gleason comes off as stupid and unrealistic as the principal.Despite the odd corny lines, the script is truthful enough, and sometimes quite witty.

Breakfast Club,"""The Breakfast Club"" is simply a story about a few teenagers who spend a whole day in detention and talk to each other. The beginning of the movie struck me as a bit ordinary, because I felt that these students embodied caricatures of the prom queen, the jock, the nerd, the goth girl, and the rebel without a cause rather than three dimensional human beings. At the early stages of the film, only Judd Nelson was able to inject new life with a fresh performance as a troubled, aggressive young man with so much anger building up inside him and occasionally rising to this surface.Yet as the film entered its second act, a strange thing happened to me. I found myself becoming absorbed in the lives of all its young characters. These students, away from the teacher's glare, were sharing their deep personal pain and this was fascinating to watch. Lastly the final act was really a metaphor for healing as these young people consoled and healed each other with love. This psychological portrait not only makes for very good entertainment, but is quite touching.

Empathic and Honest; a Classic Teen Discovery Piece,"The most timeless film of the Hughes / Ringwald / Brat Pack era, and clearly the most serious, personal work of the director's career. The Breakfast Club is an up-close, introspective look at five essentially disparate souls who share one cramped Saturday together in detention and, along the way, discover there's much more to their peers than what they wear and who they hang with. Reminiscent of theater, much like the closed-room classic 12 Angry Men, this isn't a flashy picture but it really doesn't need to be. This film rides entirely on the strength of its authentic, revealing dialog and the astonishingly mature, resounding performances of its cast, who contribute many of the sharpest, most memorable lines via ad-lib. It's about trust (or lack thereof), pushing others' buttons, being honest with oneself, testing new boundaries and revealing a shared, deep-seated uneasiness about the perilous approach of adulthood and its inherent responsibilities. Emotions run high at this age, and they respect no class distinctions. The cast may be extremely small, but it delivers across the board; Judd Nelson's damaged loner, Ally Sheedy's bashful antisocial, Anthony Michael Hall's over-stressed bookworm, Emilio Estevez's high-strung jock, Molly Ringwald's pretentious priss. Each role a potential career-maker, and not a missed note in the bunch. It's an existential essential, a notice to uncertain adolescents that somebody understands, and a reminder to their grown-up counterparts that they, too, were once just as troubled.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Breakfast Club (Maybe overrated but still worth it),"This film has always been trashed ever since it was made which really is a shame since it's obvious that those who trash it must have skimmed through their teen years with little to no problems.This film starts with a few teens who for whatever reasons (which you learn as you go through the film)have been put in Saturday detention , It is basically about learning to deal with yourself and whatever problems that present themselves throughout your teen years (learning to deal with peoples differences being the main target here) It is basically set in the school library as they serve their time (do their detention) , I loved the idea of a teen film with just the one set and with them dealing with problems that are only associated with teens , Lets face it it's too easy to make a film like American Pie and Road Trip where there is no real need to concentrate on the dialogue or the characters it takes real genius to make a teen movie where the characters and the dialogue is all there is.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Stands up as just a genuinely GOOD movie.,"I like all types of movies but growing up of coarse I loved the teen movies that all kids my age watched. As I got older many of these movies remained timeless and this is one of them. A must see for any kid though I would really say a must see for ANYBODY.What kid growing up didn't identify with this movie, this movie was for any ""type"" of kid because that was the movie's central theme-all ""types"" coming together. I'd go so far as to call Breakfast Club a classic, it's heartwarming, funny, and completely original. The movie differs from teen comedies (that are just as good)in one major way, it manages to be witty, create unforgettable characters while still getting a message across, somehow through all this completely avoiding falling into cheeziness.There will always be those teen classics that stand proud as being truly just GOOD movies-and Breakfast Club is about as good as it gets.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I only have good things to say about this movie.,the breakfast club was a great movie! i enjoyed watching it. i have to say john bender-played by judd nelson- was my favorite character. he was by far the most interesting. he was the only one i thought that was actually going through difficult times in his life as opposed to the others who were just going through every day run-of-the-mill type stuff. i give the movie a 8/10....i enjoyed it a lot...i have an obsession with movies made in the 80's.,,Anonymous,Comedy
An intelligent look beyond high school stereotypes,"Ah, high school. The best of times? Or the worst? This film gives you a picture of a little bit of both as it intelligently explores five of the people behind the stereotypes.Five students - Andy (Emilio Estevez), the jock; Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), the brain; Bender (Judd Nelson), the hood; Claire (Molly Ringwald), the princess; and Allison (Ally Sheedy), the basket case - are assigned an all day detention on a Saturday. We are given a glimpse of their relationships with their parents as they are dropped off, and then they are greeted by their principal (Paul Gleason), a somewhat belligerent man who occasionally crosses the line into abuse. Their assignment for the day is to write an essay for the principal, who comes back periodically with the intent to do little else other than abuse them some more. While the five distinctive personalities clash in the beginning, with almost violent results, eventually, boredom and a little pot get them talking with each other, and we see how each of them feels the pressure of their assigned role, and what it's doing to them.It's a talky movie, so there's little action, although there is a rather amusing - and exciting - ""chase scene."" The high school it's set in looks depressing enough to suck the life out of anyone, which helps add to the feelings of being trapped that everyone in the movie seems to have. This is used very effectively to tell the story.What is interesting about this movie is the character portrayal. The characters are distinctive, moving beyond the stereotype to the real person underneath. While these students are perhaps more self aware than we would expect of students that age at that time, they do articulate their angst about life in a believable way. With them, we come to see the similarities in the pressures that their peers and parents put on them, and that they put on themselves. We see how much they dislike the inauthenticity of their lives, and how powerless they feel to stop it. Their powerlessness even relates to their new friendships, as Claire articulates just how hard it would be for them to move beyond their defined boundaries to maintain their friendships with each other. This lack of sugar coating makes for a much more powerful message in the end.The acting in the film is generally quite good. John Kapelos gives a scene stealing performance as the worldly wise janitor, while Paul Gleason goes way over the top as the principal (to the occasional detriment of the scenes he's in). The leads all give solid performances. Anthony Michael Hall plays the high school nerd to perfection, unable to comprehend that things are not necessarily how he thinks they should be. Molly Ringwald gives enough depth to her performance that you like Claire even though she is spoiled. Emilio Estevez gives us a sense of the anger of someone who has been pushed to bring misery to someone else in order to cover his own insecurities. Ally Sheedy plays her character's strangeness to perfection. But Judd Nelson arguably gives the strongest performance as a disadvantaged teen who knows a lot more than he lets on.If you don't like psycho babble, this film may not be for you. On the other hand, if you're intrigued by a portrait of teens just beginning to realize who they really are, you will probably enjoy this movie immensely, and you may even learn a little about yourself in the process.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
5 different teens finding themselves,"The main theme of the film is the constant struggle of the American teenager to be understood, by adults and by themselves. It explores the pressure put on teenagers to fit into their own realms of high school social constructs, as well as the lofty expectations of their parents, teachers, and other authority figures. On the surface, the students have little in common with each other. However, as the day rolls on, they eventually bond over a common disdain for the aforementioned issues of peer pressure and parental expectations.Stereotyping is another theme. Once the obvious stereotypes are broken down, the characters empathize with each other's struggles, dismiss some of the inaccuracies of their first impressions, and discover that they are more similar than different.The beginning and some middle parts where teens are killing time, yamming, etc. Are kind of boring. The later part is good when they reveal their true characters, their bonds, their commonness.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Simply an 80's Classic,"I find it hard to believe that anyone who grew up in the 80's hasn't seen this movie. So, I guess this review is for generations after then, that may be looking for a ""classic"" movie to watch which gives an idea of life during the 80's. This movie will fit the high school life part of the 80's nicely.The premise is simple - 5 completely different high schoolers all do something to be punished with a Saturday detention session. You've got Emilio Estevez as the jock, Ally Sheedy as the ""weird"" girl, Molly Ringwald as the prom queen, Judd Nelson as the burnout and Anthony Michael Hall as the nerd. At the start, they don't know each other, but that all changes after they spend the day together, talking life and delving further into the hearts of each kid.The humor is great. The acting is better. Anthony Michael Hall and Judd Nelson each give fantastic performances, but Paul Gleason as the principal is truly wonderful casting. He's the perfect personality to sit thru this Saturday and watch these 5 ""punks"". The exchanges between him and Judd Nelson throughout the film are some of the most underrated acting performances of the 80's. They play so well off each other and it shows.This is probably my favorite of the John Hughes movies and I highly recommend to anyone who may not have ever had the chance to see this classic",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Moments of silliness are offset by moments of truth,"The career of John Hughes has been marked mostly by lots of silliness and a lot of fluff. This is the most truthful and insightful film he has ever made. The Breakfast Club presents different walks of adolescent life in such a way that it respects its subject matter and is not disrespectful toward teenagers or adult authority. Hughes cares about each of his characters and presents his film in an original method. Original and insightful, with a large cult following that it deserves. The only flaws are a bit too much melodrama and some unrealistic dance scenes. Overall, a worthwhile Hughes film with a wholly original craft.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
John Hughes Masterpiece,"I love this movie so much, both for reasons peculiar to me and because it is just beautifully made.The basic idea is simple; five high schoolers who fit into archetypes like nerd or popular girl spend a Saturday in detention and begin to connect outside of the normal high school paradigms.The movie is, to a great degree, about the traps we make for ourselves, and the movie is clever for making you think you know exactly who these characters are in the first 20 minutes and then showing you the more complex reality.The movie is well acted and nicely structured. It mainly goes for a reasonably realistic approach, although at times it goes a little crazy, as in a scene in the halls that is reminiscent of the musical sequences in The Monkees.I didn't see this movie as a teenager; I was actually 30 the first time. In part, I like high school movies because they give me the school I would have liked to have (my school experience was closer to Welcome to the Dollhouse). The movie also gave me a revelation about my own tendency to see people (myself and others) as types; the movie let me, to some extent, let go of that. So my experience of the film is very personal. But watching it last week, decades later, afraid that it would turn out to be a dumb movie overinflated in my head, I was still impressed by what an amazing film this is.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best teen movies,"I admit it. I must have seen ""the Breakfast Club"" at least fifty times since i first saw it about ten years ago. But what is the fascination (for me) with this movie? After all my teenage years were spent in Denmark during the mid-nineties, where the whole jock/prom queen (they don't exist here!)/ brain etc. thing isn't that apparent. Still the characters are like people we all know, their parental problems are similar to what most of us have experienced and the boredom of being stuck at school when you'd rather be anywhere else is certainly something i remember. It's a strange period of your life because the real life is waiting right around the corner, and you can't wait to get there.It certainly helps that good part of the cast actually were teenagers, who knew (maybe were like?) their characters. Big credits to John Hughes for having the balls to use a a script that left a lot up it's young performers. Let's face it, if the acting had been any less good than it is, it wouldn't have worked and you'd quickly get bored, since apart from a little running in the halls, Bender crashing through the ceiling and the ""So 80's"" dance scene, nothing much happens apart from talking.All in all it's arguably the best of it's genre, and it certainly stands the test of time. It's got it's goofs (like Bender's sneakers changing from black to white in every other scene) and that infamous dance scene is the only reason it doesn't get a ten, but i guess you can chuck it down to being a sign of the times. None of the cast members became ""big"" stars after wards, and for some (Nelson and Ringwald mainly) this was their crowning achievement. At least they didn't end up like fellow ""Brat packer"" Robert Downey. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Great movie,"The Breakfast Club is an exceptional comedy drama featuring some masterful moments and wonderful performances from the entire cast. It portrays the challenging existence of adolescence by peeling away the veneer of each of the five main characters as they are forced to spend a Saturday together in detention. It's a portrayal that is crafted with a deft touch, and well timed lighter moments. It's just a really great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Being honest,"A group of teenagers, each from a different school social strata, end up on Saturday at detention for various shenanigans. Fitting seamlessly into certain stereotypes the five misfits consist of meek geek Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), the jock-type wrestler Andrew (Emilio Estevez), the rebellious nihilist Bender (Judd Nelson), the popular in-girl Claire (Molly Ringwald) and the reclusive loner Allison (Ally Sheedy). Captivated by their societal roles the separate individuals initially feed off everyday school structures copying the relations and attitudes carried around classrooms. However through conflict and subsequent revelations the group starts taking on a different dynamic, revealing that the roles attached to each person does not exclude mutual understanding.Arguably John Hughes most artistically accomplished film, ""The Breakfast Club"" ventures through well-tread territory to bring a still omnipresent feeling of purpose. Although the frisky dialogues don't achieve boundless heights, they carry enough wit and substance to make for a cognitive piece, still however troubled by oversimplification. What however comes off worst in the movie is the forced humour, which blends sourly with the more cerebral plotting and interaction of characters. So hopelessly out of sync the impact is severely deflated leaving several confrontational scenes still relevant, while the rest fails to be as brisk and influential, as back when the movie was first released.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Its all about a group of five teenagers stuck in a Saturday detention which all have different personalities and lives. It has a sport who is the best athlete in the school, a beauty queen who is the most popular girl in the school, a hard rock badboy who doesn't care less about anyone but himself, not forgetting a silent girl who never speaks and who is just strange and mysterious.

Still works as the dysfunctional teen movie,"Yes it's dated in many ways but equally still holds that mirror up to we are all different in childhood, no nothing of others' circumstances and will ignore and be cruel to people who could be friends just to ""save face"" in front of our crowd of friends.
The simple bleakness of the empty Saturday school provides a previously unnoticed desolation - and the connection between preposterous titmangle Judd Nelson and Ringwald seemed believable. The Cinderella/princess conversion of Sheedy less so, and we must excuse the rock video montage as fist pump climax as de rigeur for the genre",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

80s in a nutshell,"I truly don't believe there ever has been a better-made movie that captures so precisely what high school in the 80s (and now, probably) was like. The perfect representatives of each group, the struggle for popularity if not acceptance, finding the painful things that make us common, and the striking differences that drive us apart.Hughes gets a bad rap for many of his movies, but this really is his finest work, IMO. It has everything - humor, drama, fight scenes, conflict, and resolution. More to the point, it has characters that everyone over 17 can identify with. If not, they at least recognize what makes up and drives the other characters since we basically grew up with all of them at our own high schools.I'm certainly not going to say this was Emmy-worthy, but on a personal level this movie has been and will always be in my top 5 of all time.

A Brat Pack classic,"There are those of you who have a hard time understanding this movie, and I can't really understand how that is when this is a film that many have a hard time switching off.You see, it's not only a great drama; a tale of teen angst if you will... this is also a classic 80's cult film.Now, according to my knowledge, cult films have withstood the test of time very well. The reason this one in particular is up there with the likes of 16 Candles, Weird Science, and Say Anything (by the way, I'm aware that Say Anything was not a Brat Pack movie) is because it shows that those perceived as one type of person are really just trying to find their real self... that's the basis of this movie: finding oneself.I know I said that this was a drama, but all great dramas have humor in them... this is one of them.Everybody has their favorite scene or line. Mine just happens to be a bunch of separate scenes... when everyone reveals why they're in detention.All who have never seen this movie, please do yourself a favor and see it.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A timeless classic.,"I decided to review this film mainly as an excuse to see the film again (although it's only a few months since I last saw it).The description of the film sounds awful. Five students get a detention! Seriously what kind of film is that and what strings did the director, producer and writer, the late John Hughes, have to pull the get it made? Most of the cast were relative unknowns, up and coming stars including Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy and Paul Gleason. The film is set almost in one location over the course of one Saturday. It is hardly the formula for a great movie. But for some reason the film turns out to be amazing. It went on to become the 16th highest grossing film of 1985 (the top film that year was Back to the Future). It is a true master class in film making. It shows what you can accomplish with the right script and the actors who can bring the characters to life. The cast is perfect, every one of them brings something great to the film from the teacher in charge of the detention, to the janitor. But for me the stand out performance is from Judd Nelson's performance as John Bender. At the time Judd Nelson was 25 playing a 17/18 year old, but it took the maturity of age to play such a troubled and messed up character. A character who's tough exterior hides the anguish of abuse. His is the most interesting journey in the film.The performances in it are so good because of the rest of the cast. Each actor feeds off the other actors performances and every one of them is better for it. This is what many films are missing, a great young talented cast putting it all out there. Other films that use this include The Outsiders, Young Guns, Red Dawn and St. Elmo's Fire (coincidentally all apart from Red Dawn star Emilio Estevez but it does star his brother Charlie Sheen so I guess it must be in their genes!).I absolutely love this film. It is in my top movies of all time and I never get bored watching it.If you haven't seen this film please give it a go. It is a true love it or hate it film. A film that can be watched over and over. A timeless classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

a good movie with a good ideas sometimes a little bit boring,"THE BREAKFAST CLUB MOVIE REVIEW:The movie 'The Breakfast club' is written and directed by John Hughes and entered the cinemas in 1985. The movie is about five high school students, which have detention on Saturday. They are 5 different characters 1.The criminal 2.The princess 3.The athlete 4.The brain 5. The basket-case. During the detention the students discover that they have a lot more common than they expected. If the breakfast club would made again today the 5 characters would be so different. The time changed and the interests of the youth changed. The stereo types would be 1.Criminal 2. The flirt 3.The gamer. 4The shy one. 7.The normal 8.The weird one. My favorite scene was where they all sat on the ground and talked like normal people or friends they just talked and didn't offense themselves the hole time.i liked the scene because it showed how it could be if people don't judge from their prejudges and just talk. The basic of the movie still holds up that every student has problems and they always have something in common. Compared to the students today it changed a little bit. There are still cliques and prejudges under the students but I think its more mixed now of different people and interests. Through the time some things changed in high school society like there is no more detention the teachers are more friendly and are like your friend .I think a big point that changed is that the cool ones are not anymore the ones which go with the mainstream its more the people which are going against it.In total liked the film it showed a little bit more of the life of an high school students and problems and that prejudges are often wrong.

Maybe The Greatest High School Movie Ever Made,"In the grand scheme of things, there are relatively few films made that contain almost zero wasted time/scenes. The Breakfast Club is one of those rare exceptions to the rule, as director/writer John Hughes crafts a film that utilizes every single moment.For a very basic overview, this film centers on a group of five high-schoolers serving a Saturday detention sentence. They come from all walks of life: The Rebel (Judd Nelson), The Jock (Emilio Estevez), The Princess (Molly Ringwald), The Wierdo (Ally Sheedy) and The Nerd (Anthony Michael Hall). While being lorded over by Principal Vernon (Paul Gleason), the self-dubbed ""Breakfast Club"" start to get to know each other a little bit and ultimately come to the realization that they may actually be more alike than different.This film is an absolute treatise on the life/struggles of high school students. Ostensibly driven by Nelson's hard-edged Bender, each stereotype is carefully picked apart and laid bare for the world to see. For example: Is Claire truly a good girl, or just fooling herself? Is Andrew happy with his high status, or just playing the role to conform to parental expectations? Is the instigator--Bender-- a legitimate jerk, or simply extremely misunderstood? These psychosocial quandaries are deconstructed so expertly (and quickly--it's only a 97 minute runtime) that you won't know what to believe by the end. Which is exactly how Hughes wants it. He leaves it up to the viewer to decide who ""The Breakfast Club"" members really are. You can view them as Mr. Vernon does, or have the opportunity to delve in deeper if you so choose.Lest you get the sense that this movie is super-serious, it is also filled with moments of hilarious screwball comedy. From the now-infamous hallway chase scene to more subtle touches like a comparison of detention lunches, you'll be chuckling more than you think.Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give The Breakfast Club, however, is that the scenes in the final 15-20 minutes are some of the most ""earned"" in cinema history. The writing, acting, and directing all set the scene for an equal parts insightful and fun final act.This is about the easiest 10/10 ranking I'll ever give a film, seeing as how it is so mesmerizing from literally beginning to end. It remains the standard for high school films 30+ years after its 1985 release.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I love all 5 of the members of the Breakfast Club and I think the actors/actresses all did very well portraying them.

How powerful could this have been in 1985?,"Usually, a movie that isn't an artistic achievement at the time wouldn't age much differently in the future. I think the story and performances age well, but none of the filmmaking is anything special. The filmmaking isn't bad, just ordinary. This isn't the type of movie that looks like art, but I do enjoy the personalities of the characters and their conversations. Since the movie takes place entirely at school for detention, nothing will be groundbreaking even back in 1985 when it was released. It is surprising that there's almost an hour of deleted scenes for this kind of movie. Don't know why they needed that much filming.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It's nice to see that in 2015, people are more conscious of how ridiculous our little life problems are.

still rocks after 450 times,"This movie is my all-time favorite.  Surprisingly enough it still doesn't bore me, though I have seen it over 450 times. Anthony-Michael Hall as the brain, showing why most brains in school are brains - mostly because of parental pressure. Emilio Estevez as the athlete shows us much the same thing. Most of us still excel in something because we're afraid of being a disappointment to our parents. Ally Sheedy not only looks her cutest (well, wargames excepted here), but portrays a basket case if I ever saw one.  She reminds me so much of a girl in my high school classroom it's unbelievable. Molly Ringwald as the stuck-up, self-righteous princess torn between her basically gentle character and her stuck-up friends and last, but certainly not least, Judd Nelson as the criminal. Abusive parents and all.This movie is a classic from beginning to end.  Dump 5 kids in a school library for a day and they WILL end up friends, even if it is just for that day.  In that lies the realism. Take a person away from his environment (be that the 'popular clique' or the 'bad kids' and they set all prejudice aside. This movie shows that no matter in what layer of society you are) everyone is essentially the same with the same problems. Sadly enough the truth is that although they end up friends, they will only be friends for that one day.Personally I think it's a shame that John Hughes went on to make crap like home alone.. He should have stuck with what he knows best. brain, athlete, basket case, princess and criminal.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

wonderful John Hughes film,"John Hughes wrote and directed this '80s film, ""The Breakfast Club,"" starring some young up and comings: Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, John Kapelos, and Paul Gleason.The story concerns five high school students who are forced by the principal (Gleason) to serve detention for eight hours on a Saturday and to write an essay on who they think they are. There's the troublemaker/big mouth, John Bender (Nelson) who manages to end up with something like two months of Saturday's worth of detention by the time he's done; the rich, pretty girl, Claire Standish (Ringwald), a strange girl who makes noises but doesn't speak, Allison (Sheedy), a nerd, Brian (Hall), and and the sports star (Estevez).They're not supposed to talk but of course they do, and at first, this takes the form of insults. Then they start sneaking around, smoking dope, talking about their families, their problems, and their secrets, and before you know it, they have all formed some sort of a connection.This is such a wonderful film, about kids who for one reason or another, feel like outcasts and find out that just about everyone does feel like an outcast in high school. The things they hide behind are stripped away and the real people are exposed.The acting is wonderful, with top honors going to Nelson, who without a doubt has the showiest role, and Estevez, who delivers a powerful monologue at the end. You could have knocked me over with a feather when I realized that this young blond kid was Anthony Michael Hall, whom I only knew from Dead Zone - but there was no mistaking that face. Paul Gleason is a riot as the harried principal, who feels totally out of touch with the students.Highly recommended - The Breakfast Club is one of the best youth films of the '80s or ever probably, with the great John Hughes touches that help make it a remarkable experience for the viewer.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Classic,"""Breakfast Club"" (1985) is a professionally produced comedic drama about five stereotypical teenagers that find they have more in common then just going to the same school after serving a day in detention. Keeping in mind when this film was produced, I feel slightly unsatisfied because there was no diversity in the film. The film storyline is still mostly relevant today through the character portrayals, but I find it hard to believe there were no other ethnic groups is the school besides possibly the janitor. Outside of this fact, this film is very good and mostly sound.John Hughes did a masterful job in his simplicity. I am led to believe he had the whole school and surrounding areas to go crazy with shooting, especially after they departed the library, but maintained one key location to focus on the story. There were a handful of technical issues within the film with either continuity or audio and at times there felt a bit of over acting. I think this film will continue to be relatable for many years to come even though the problems will change. The stereotypes are still current, and popularity is still a fixture in high school, but the problems have evolved. Overall, this film is a classic, even if it isn't for my personal pallet. I would recommend this film to anyone based on its storyline and minimalist approach.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
They are stupid and contagious,"I like John Hughes movies - Planes, Trains And Automobiles is one of my all-time favourites comedy, Ferris Bueller's Day Off was great, Uncle Buck and Sixteen Candles were OK so I was thinking that Breakfast Club which got such high rating on IMDb should be at least no worse than his Weird Science or Curly Sue. But it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I suspect that it got above average rating from damsels who liked Estevez. The movie is about nothing, no plot, no story, no emotions - just a bunch of stupid teenagers pretending that they have something to say not only to themselves but to us too. I was a teenager too but I fully understood that I have to learn a lot and I was reading A LOT of books, visiting art museums, concerts etc. I don't understand why someone has decided that this is a comedy. It's so pointless and dull that I can't say this is a movie at all. The speeches of Mr. Brezhnev in his late days when he had a lot of problems with brain functioning were much more exciting and dynamic than this worthless monument of American teenage stupidity. After vwatching this crap I now understand why there was no sequel - according to this movie all these teenage dimwits should blow their brains or become junkies in a year or two. The ""experience"" of watching this is just like eating and digesting a NY telephone directory.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I won't be forgetting them anytime soon.,"In the last few weeks, I have been watching all the John Hughes films again, like Sweet Sixteen, Ferris Bueller, Some Kind Of Wonderful (he wrote it) - and it seems that The Breakfast Club provides the most thoughtful insight out of all of them.The story is simple, about 6 kids in detention on a Saturday. What ensues is a film about bonding, the fragile nature of these kids and what it means to be a teenager. In the hands of other directors, this film would have probably focused on comedy too much, to sacrifice for the lack of a ""house party"" scene. But Hughes handles the pacing well, and the film never rushes the development.The characters are all stock - at least we think. As the film progresses, the vulnerability of these kids becomes more apparent. I don't wanna ramble on too much, but this film is the best teenage comedy made in the 80's...with Ferris Bueller.Estevez, Nelson, Hall, Sheedy and Ringwald are all wonderful in this film. Sometimes too much emphasis is on Nelson, but who cares when th rest is so good.Watch it, love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Correction.....,"I love this movie, and because of that, I have a correction to make. The quote is not, ""Oh yeah? How much vodka do you drink?"" It is in fact, Andy: ""Vodka.... when do you drink vodka?"" And Allison replies snidely, ""Whenever."" And then Andy says, ""A lot?"" Allison: ""Tons."" And so on and so forth...... I came to this page and was saddened by this mistake. It was a correction that I felt needed to be made. The Breakfast Club has been my favorite movie for some years now, even though I am only 20. I almost have every line that Judd Nelson says memorized. I drive my friends absolutely crazy when they watch this amazing flick with me. John Hughes is awesome. Judd Nelson is one of my heroes.

John Hughes' finest.,"John Hughes has been responsible for many entertaining movies but none better than this one, in my opinion. It works well as a teen comedy but there are a few curves thrown in that take it to another level.When a group of five disparate students arrives at their high school on a Saturday morning for an all-day detention session they represent five archetypes, one of which almost any viewer can personally relate to. There's Claire (Molly Ringwald), the high school princess who can't believe she's actually to be included in this motley crew. Andrew (Emelio Estevez) is a jock who's traveling down the straight and narrow path that athletics takes him, a path prescribed by his father. Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) is one of the school's brains. His very intelligence is the thing that diminishes in the eyes of others. John Bender (Judd Nelson) comes swaggering in like the top con in the yard. This is his turf. He works hard as portraying himself as an outlaw and an outsider but he's desperate for understanding and attention just like anyone else. Finally Allison (Ally Sheedy) comes scurrying in looking like a junior bag lady-in-training. She sits in the back, hiding behind her hair, apparently terrified to speak or to be spoken to.It promises to be a dull day but Bender will have none of that, as he seeks to make everyone as uncomfortable as possible. Over the course of the next several hours he leads the group on a series of adventures right under the nose of their principal, played by Paul Gleason in the film's only other substantial role. (One is required to suspend reality here to believe they get away with some of the stuff they do.)The first big surprise for me came when Bender pulled out his stash of marijuana and convinces the others, after initial reluctance, to join him in smoking some. Coming as the movie did in the middle of the Reagan years, one expects the kids to just say no. It's a brave stance for the movie to take, but it's also a completely believable turn of events.The real surprise, and the segment that makes the movie great, is when the five youngsters settle down on the floor and discuss who they are and how they came to this point. Andrew reveals he's in detention for pulling some horseplay only because he thought it was expected of him by his father. On the verge of tears he tells of the relentless pressure put on him to succeed. When he says of his dad,""God, I f*****g hate him!"", the viewer is shocked, not by the language, but by the sudden seriousness the film has acquired. This leads to a series of cathartic confessions and confrontations among the group that are angry, tearful and emotionally draining, but in the end it leads to a bond between the five that just a few hours earlier they never would have expected could be forged.This movie is best seen on cassette or on a premium channel, as the broadcast version cuts out all references to pot-smoking and also prudishly censors the dialog to a ridiculous extent. For example, ""Oh my God!"" is dubbed to become, ""Oh my lord!"" But if you're a real fan you might want to see this TV version since it contains a minute or two of action not included in the theatrical release.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Classic 80's Teen Melodrama,"I know, it could never happen. Let's just say that in a perfect world it could. That five students from different backgrounds and cliques could come together and become friends. Being real. Only in Hollywood people.John Hughes makes his second teen film about kids coming together by way of a Saturday detention. They HAVE to be together. First they cut each other down as normal, then as time passes they begin to open up. Next thing you know they're all crying! I know to other viewers the subject matter that upset these kids doesn't seem so major, but THEY ARE KIDS! When you are younger, little things seem so important. With age we see how silly all this is. That's why I feel differently about this film now than when it first came out. When I watch it now, it's like relieving my high school days, but I won't say which character I was like most :]Most of the Brat Pack are here for this one. I enjoyed the soundtrack featuring Karla DeVito's ""We Are Not Alone"" (played during the dancing scene) and Wang Chung's ""Fire In The Twilight"" (played during the breakout scene). Enjoy a blast from the past and watch the unedited version and don't be a Neo Max Zoomdweebee.",,Anonymous,Comedy
A Pinnacle of Teenage Cinema,"There aren't many films which have emotionally affected me as much as 'The Breakfast Club' has. The story John Hughes was able to craft with a foundation as simple as 5 teenagers in detention, is timeless.'The Breakfast Club' is like a footprint in the snow of your forgotten memories. You're able to instantly remember your high school years as you watch the characters in the film interact with each other. I remember when i was in high school, no worries, an imperishable, carefree life. Once upon a time, i got up to no good with the boys too, cracking jokes, laughing our way through a period of time we'd never thought we'd cherish so much down the line. Not only are the more innocent aspects of life are played on, but The Breakfast Club also portrays the harsh aspects of life we may not be comfortable discussing or thinking about. Home troubles as many of us have been through, troubles me and my friends have been through, but with the ups and downs, it was enough to keep us happy go lucky for the most part. The talks about sex were played on for humour for the most part, but there was something about the dialogue which may have reminded us of our experiences, our first kiss, our first relationships..You'll laugh and you'll tear up as you watch this classic. It's a movie that was made at a time which it perfectly suited, out of every decade you could have ever made this gem, the 80's was a goldmine. No social media, minimal distractions, but friendships, romances, and honest work to be done through human interaction in the outside world. It's a quintessential piece of cinema, and a movie that i will most definitely always highly regard.An ode to childhood 💖",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Yet it still works.This was the 80s. I'm sure public schools are mostly like the Bender character nowadays. Even in the 1980s this was to represent an upper middle class area on the north shore. Can you imagine a film made about students at the south side of that city?Rural or urban - I went to school in both. Kids can be neglected, abused and abusive themselves.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Different Backgrounds Being Brought Together!,"When people talk about teen movies, most minds stray to John Hughes's 1985 classic, The Breakfast Club. Like his previous feature Sixteen Candles, Hughes attempts to explore the teenage mind. Just like that film, this film is a relatable teenage character study. Each of the main characters are vastly different in terms of image and personality, but they eventually share a common interest; a seething anger for adults, mainly their Principal Vernon. The film is a little on the talky, philosophical side but John Hughes made every word count with his screenplay and style of direction. Hughes made each one of the characters relatable for the people who have been through high school, even downright likable at times.Believe it or not, Universal was highly skeptical of the film. When shooting began, Sixteen Candles was not released yet, so the studio was still dealing with an unproven director. Hughes was able to calm the film's investors. After all, his feature had a very small budget of a million dollars, and it was shot in one location. Hughes, being the efficient director he is, was able to concurrently shoot this film and his next one, Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Universal definitely made a bang for their buck. I think the film made forty times its budget domestically. Profitable it was! That definitely proves how the younger generation related to its teenage characters. Maybe the adult characters are one-dimensional, but does that really matter?The film's beginning is awesome. As the great 80's anthem from Simple Minds, ""Don't Forget About Me,"" is playing, the teenagers are introduced one at a time. Each of the teenagers are in for a special treat: an eight-hour-long Saturday detention under the supervision of their mean principal, Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason). The five personalities are the jock Andrew (Emilio Estevez), the brain Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), the criminal John (Judd Nelson), the princess and prom queen Claire (Molly Ringwald), and the insecure basket case Allison (Ally Sheedy). These five have nothing in common and do not associate with each other outside of class. Vernon makes each teen write an essay about what do they think of themselves. In the beginning, they may have thought they knew. As the day progresses, maybe they will learn more about themselves...and each other.The performances are all excellent. They deliver Hughes's dialogue in their own unique way. Judd Nelson was the least known cast member, but he was the glue that anchored the characters together. He was fantastic as John Bender. With Sixteen Candles in production, Hughes wanted Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall to appear in this film and they obviously agreed. Their characters here are a bit reminiscent of their characters from the aforementioned film, but Hughes did make subtle differences to give their new characters fresh air. Ally Sheedy as Allison is my favorite character though as she is the most relatable. She hid herself behind her hair and clothes...in a way not unlike myself. The adult characters are one-dimensional, but the actual performances are great. Richard Vernon is not shown in a positive light and Paul Gleason embraced that. John Kapelos plays the school custodian and philosophical dude.This film is heralded as one of the best teenage films of the 1980's and the reason is the relatable characters that John Hughes created, and the actors brought to life. Yeah there is a bunch of talk and philosophy, but its very important to hear what is said. These are five different personas and backgrounds that are brought together. Although there was not a sniff of curiosity in the beginning, they started to grow closer and closer. A universal theme that is very important, especially in today's world. Hughes did a wonderful job bring that theme to the screen. This is a well-acted and well-directed movie. The majority of the soundtrack may be forgettable, but not the Simple Minds theme song. Don't forget about this movie, folks!My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Excellent, enduring movie that represents an era/age","Note: Recommended to have seen filmThe Breakfast Club, a movie about 5 dissimilar teenagers who get stuck together on a saturday because of detention, was just not about some inner-discovery-developing-plot or even necessarily the humor (though I found that a very vital part of the film). But before I display my perspective, I'd like to address those of a few other people. For those of you who criticize The Breakfast Club, you're obviously not looking at it for the right reasons. If you see the characters as flat and the plot and its issues as mundane, you're analyzing the movie in an incorrect way. Maybe in viewing the movie you seem to have lapsed over the fact that the movie was a Teen movie dealing with Teen issues. (For the few who might suddenly think that this label turns all the characters into Alicia Silverstone look-a-likes talking about their hair, think of such movies as Rebel Without a Cause or even Cameron Crowe's older films, for example). The Breakfast Club manages to combine all it's character's into one setting (Shermer High School/Shermer High School Library), without any major change in setting, character addition, or sudden abrupt plot twist and yet still manages to stay interesting. In such situation, one must assume the dialogue would hold the movie together, and for the most part, I'd say this is the case in The Breakfast Club. The steady humor (usually good) was very important for leveling out the (countering) occasional seriousness of the film. Some of the dialogue was filled with some rough phrasing; however, in my opinion, it could almost be considered intentional. When a group of teenagers, seemingly cast in completely different molds, are thrown together and suddenly find themselves talking about their own appropriate, deepest problems to these (formerly) strangers, would it honestly come out in the most articulate of speech? This is why I feel you shouldn't blame The Breakfast Club for its ""amateur psychology"" (as some have phrased it), or more more appropriately, I think it should be awarded for managing to deal with some issues of high school and teenage life that it did without creating some ludicrous, unbelievable situation inorder to achieve it. Even so, one should not dissect and scrutinize every single line; you can only appreciate the movie by absorbing it as a whole of its parts. To me, the gift of the The Breakfast Club is not one certain thing, but surely through it all we can find positive. The movie was very well acted by everyone of its characters and if one of them had gone astray it easily could have failed. However it was teenagers addressing their issues on their own terms, supplemented by laughs, that made The Breakfast Club into a great 80s movie, a great teen movie, and just a plain, great movie as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The film that started The Brat Pack craz.,"This film started it, St, Elmo's Fire made it higher. Out of all of John Hughes movies, this one really stands out. It's a teen classic. Great performances by Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall, and Emilo Estevez. The story is about five different teenagers are forced to spend an all day Saturday detention. For some you may think it's about kids in detention, dive deeper into the story, you'll see a story of abuse, neglect, and the pressure to be perfect. What you see is what everyday teens go through. Thats what made the movie a hit. Although it was well acted by everyone, it's clearly Judd Nelson steals the picture, has the bad boy John Bender. Paul Gleason is also good has Richard Vernon, the not so likeable principal. He later went on to play characters we love to hate. This movie is funny and touching.

Outstanding and timeless.,"This movie includes one of my favorite songs (Don't you -Simple minds) and my absolute all time high favorite actor, Judd Nelson.The first time I can remember seeing this movie was when I was about 14 years old. It had me astonished from the very start. The first 15 minutes or so I was wondering if they would ever get their asses out of that school and go hit the streets, doing some rebellious stuff and living as this was their last day on earth. Clearly I had no idea. I soon forgot all about that and instead I was completely blown away with these young actors amazing performances. They had me glued to the screen, almost in cramp, devouring every move and word they expressed. Never once did I doubt them or in any way was I reminded that this was just a flick, not real people sitting in front of me. They were real! Of course they were. They are! Especially Bender and Alison cause I was able to identify myself by them. I was as weird, rebellious and left out as they were. In a lot of ways, I still am.Still to this day (I'm almost 22 now) this is my absolute favorite movie. Sorry to say, they don't make movies like this one any more.

"Featuring a star-filled cast, excellent plot and dialogue, this is one of the greatest eighties movies.","""The Breakfast Club"" will forever be remembered as one of the greatest films for many reasons.  This seemingly simple plot thickens as the story unfolds. ""The Breakfast Club"" displays many popular features that most 80's teen movies possess.  For example, all of the young main characters are full of an attribute that seemed so often confronted in 80's movies that it defined many characters in movies from that decade.  Angst.  That simple word describes a feeling that every main character experienced for reasons not too diverse.  Angst is felt in this film's characters and is directed primarily towards teachers, school, and, of course, parents.  As each character explained their troubles to each other they realized how similar they were.  With a star-studded cast including Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael hall, Emilio Esteves, and, of course, Judd Nelson, this movie is easily summarized as magnificent.  Judd Nelson is featured in his most famous role as a bully, criminal, and typical high-school punk which every adult, young or old, can easily relate to.  With his seemingly simple personality he is used as the comic-relief as well as the individual who triggers character conversations.  These hilarious and somewhat immature conversations are really the glue which holds together this fabulous movie. The deep explanation of these multifaceted characters is exceptional.  The audience could easily relate to the troubles and pain that each character experienced. The main individuals featured in this picture each developed to understand each other and to think differently of themselves.  To truly experience the 80's, see this film and be amazed.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Brilliant,","Just now came back from watching it in the theater and I loved it again. Very funny and touching at times as well. When I first saw this movie as a teenager from about Anthony Michael Hall's age, it gave me the feeling that I wasn't the only one who was misunderstood by his parents (even though my parent's are great, unlike the parents from the characters in the movie). After just coming home from this film, I started remembering what it was like in school, what I loved and loathed about it and what it was like being a teenager, making friends and belonging (or not..) to a certain crowd.There were a few people commenting that the movie was bad and it was too simple, with the parents being blamed for all the problems. As far as I can see they missed the point entirely. Yes, the parents get a bad rep, but that is not the main point. The very obvious point is that despite their differences in background/social circles, their problems (and teenagers problems anywhere) and more importantly themselves are more alike than they imagined...

She managed to be the comic relief and give a highly convincing dramatic performance all in the same movie. I think that every teen should see this movie because it shows high school in such a raw and real way without being melodramatic. Although it is unlikely that a princess, brain, jock, criminal, and basket case would really put aside their differences and become friends, it looks very convincing on screen. The Breakfast Club really isn't ""just another teen movie"" because it is one that everyone can relate to and is so raw and real without being melodramatic.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Doesn't stand the test of time...,"I saw this when it premiered, and liked it a lot better then.  This has not aged well.  Of course, I am almost 40, but these issues seem slight to me now.  The situations one now faces as an adult are Olympian in proportion to what these kids whine about.  So, here is an essential fact to remember when looking at this film:  Most teenagers think their parents don't care, don't listen, and don't know anything.  They're wrong.  The truth is, the world doesn't revolve around post-puberty teenagers.  The issues raised here most often occur because of poor communication (which is not necessarily always the fault of either parents or teens).  No one, not even grown-ups, have all the answers.  Deal with it.  And yes, sometimes bad stuff happens to kids like the Judd Nelson character, but if it ain't you, get over it.  (This does NOT mean I condone that behavior, or encourage people to ignore it if they see it.  It is here for drama.)  Think I'm full of s**t?  Look at the high school these kids ""go"" to...I went to one ""like"" it, and last time I checked, the people I graduated with were pretty much okay.  The problems they face now sure aren't ""high school"" in nature.Hughes does a lot of damage demonizing parents here.  The Estevez character may dislike his father, but he would thank him in the ""grown-up"" sequel (which could still be made...it's not like any of these actors went anywhere.  They're available).Some good scenes, b.s. ending.  A ""3"" out of ""10.""

"Saturday morning detention was never this funny, moving, or heartfelt","""The Breakfast Club"" is arguably the best movie ever made about teenagers that it's no wonder that it's such an essential piece of 1980s teen fanfare/nostalgia. This movie is all of funny (sometimes hilariously so), moving, and heartfelt. The most authentic thing about this film is that regardless of the blatant stereotyping of high school cliques (honestly, not a whole lot has changed since 1985) and melodrama, this movie pulls at the heart-strings in ways you never would have thought were possible for a film such as this. And this heart-string-pulling is sincere and honest, making my assertion that it's authentic correct.For early Saturday morning detention, five suburban Chicago high school students have showed up as punishment, with Principal Richard Vernon (the late Paul Gleason) presiding over the festivities. They've all done something to land here this morning, and they each represent the various cliques in their school: Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez) is the stereotypical jock, Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald) is the stereotypical beauty/princess, Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall) is the stereotypical nerd/brain, Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy) is the stereotypical shy-quiet girl/weirdo/outsider, and John Bender (Judd Nelson) is the stereotypical rebel. As an aside, when I was in high school, I fell into three of the five categories here: nerd/brain, shy-quiet guy/weirdo/outsider, and rebel - in that order.As I said before, they all have their reasons for being there, and on another day in another world they would have absolutely nothing to do with each other. But this is not the normal world. This is writer-director John Hughes's teen world, and in his teen world, anything goes. Of course these kids don't like each other; Hughes makes sure of that, but as the day goes on, barriers are broken, alliances are made, and each of these kids discovers that they have more in common with each other than they think - of course after having gone through a lot of pain to get there. They have sincere heart-to-hearts with each other that are not like anything seen in another film of this genre. Spliced in with the drama, Hughes's flawless screen-writing does give these kids some time to have some fun and stave off the boredom and mess with Vernon, with well-placed scenes of comedy, even slapstick comedy, that get as much laughs from the comedy as the tears we shed from the heart-string drama.""The Breakfast Club"" is a first-rate teen comedy/drama with some first-rate performances from some of the top ""Brat Packers"" from the time. Estevez, Ringwald, Hall, Sheedy, and Nelson are a brave, once-in-a-lifetime cast that do their characters plenty of justice. These kids may be stereotypes, but they're three-dimensional stereotypes, and real people with real feelings and real troubles. (These former Brat Packers, now fully-grown adults, would reunite 20 years later at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards to receive a special honor.)John Hughes never quite repeated the success of ""The Breakfast Club,"" and his career began to decline toward the '80s and into the '90s. But ""The Breakfast Club"" is unquestionably Hughes's masterstroke of teen comedy/drama. He was able to give teenagers a three-dimensional gloss and show us that these teens are indeed real people with real feelings and real troubles.Saturday morning detention was never this fun.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The variety of characters made it fun,"It wasn't bad. It went by fast. Even though it's in one place most of the time, I had fun. I enjoyed how the characters interacted with each other. Each had something and was interesting in a different way. It went by quickly and was a nice break for me. Not great for me, but not bad either. I think it's good. A nice show. For comedy fans? Hard to say. Probably most appealing to teenagers. I don't know. I had a good time, and like I said, it went by fast, so it's a good movie. It's just the characters that pull it off. Everyone was a little different. Maybe that made it that much more interesting.

"If you're going to see one '80s teen movie ever, make it this one.","I suspect everything that needs to be said about this movie has been said, but believe me when I tell you if you think a lot of '80s teen movies have not aged well, this is indeed an expception.It's so simple that if I described the movie to you you'd probably scoff at me but hear me out: this story with limited settings, set over a single day and with limited characters is one of the most revilatizing pictures I've ever seen. I know I well rewatch it one day.There's something elemental in it. Bunch of teens who would never hang out with each other learn to work together and see eye to eye.I know that sounds cheesy because we've seen it so often and most movies and books do not earn the moments where characters have a change of heart. But this is an unsentimental movie that lets you guess how things might be different.It manages to be bitter truth and wish fulfilment at the same time.Also, every character is a gem that could star in the own show so easily, I mean it.Please do not pass up this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
good but overrated,"The whole film takes place in one location. To me it seemed slightly boring, but the focus is on clearly on the characters.In my opinion the main strength of the film is how well the development between the different characters is presented. In the beginning, they don't even know each other but when they leave the school there is a connection between them.Even though the film was produced a long time ago, I still think that it represents being a teenager in 2022. Becoming friends with people you don't know through experiences together is still relevant for teenagers today. This is why i think the film is timeless. Still, because of the setting, music and clothes, it is also a glimpse into another time.If the film was released today you could probably see many influences from our reality of today. For example, smartphones would be much more present and the clothes would be different.Overall I think the film is well made, has some funny moments and discusses relevant topics but is actually not that entertaining to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I loved this movie,"If I were to tell you to think of an 80's high school movie, you would probably think of this movie. But really even if I took out the 80's part, this movie should still be the film that pops into your head. If you went to high school, then you probably know these kids. It isn't just 1985 teenagers that can relate to this, I was a high school student from 2008-2011, and I knew a each of these kids, and even related to some of them myself.OK first my negatives. The shift from comedy to drama could have been a little smoother. It just seems to go from jokes to talking about suicide. Maybe that's just me. Also the Principal was played a little to over the top. I know this is what we all thought our teachers and principles wanted to say to us, but if they really threatened me, I would be probably think it was a joke. He should have been fired.But overall this movie was really really good. If I had to pick a character I was most like it would be part of Allison and part of Brian. I was just that kid in school who was just there. I wan't a jock, geek, or criminal, I was just there. So I thought I wouldn't relate to this movie, but it turns out I did. The reason the movie works is because of it's characters, because the plot on paper sounds really boring. Really it's hard to explain why the film works so well, you just need to watch it.Sorry this review isn't that great, but really there isn't much to say, it just does a really good job of portraying teenagers. If you haven't seen it yet go watch it, especially if you're still in high school.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A gem made when the Brat Pack had passion for acting.,"When I first started watching this movie about five students (each a different type) spending a Saturday in detention, I was thinking this won't be nearly as good as Fast Times at Ridgemont High. It is all taking place in the school library and Fast Times had so many multiple settings. I ended up liking it slightly better (both were very good).This movie starred many members of a group known as the Brat Pack in 1985. It was early in most of their acting careers and you could tell their passion for acting was very high. I think it was Anthony Michael Hall's first film and he delivered a great performance. There were some movies in the late '80's/early 90's that had performances that were not as good by some of these actors. I usually check the date on a Brat Pack movie...early to mid '80's and the odds are it was good. Late '80's to early '90's and it is less likely.The actor that played the disciplinarian that supervised them and made threats to have them spend more Saturdays there was perfect for his role. His conflict with Judd Nelson's character was very well acted by both actors. There was a solid rock music soundtrack as well. It shows how these students clash at first and then slowly realize that it will be a very long day if they do not try to achieve a small measure of civility.The first part of the movie shows a dysfunctional environment that then transforms to at least some respect among the students. It reminded me of the first time I had jury duty(and that was with older adults..albeit 12 people instead of five. Ha!).There is also a romantic connection that perhaps was a bit forced and not plausible, but this was common in the eighties. Most of us knew people that were very similar to some of these students in high school and the performances are very good or better with some good messages provided. It is about 60% drama and 40% comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Hey Son!"" ""Yeah Dad?...""","When I first saw this movie I was fourteen and loved it. I still do. Even though I realized that all the characters in the movie were your classic stereotypical categorizations of people. Not only did this movie have me laughing. I felt bad that they were portrayed as such harsh sterotypes. Is this supposed to be funny. In high school, I was more like Allison than anything. But I had a bit of Brian personality as well. I didn't dress in all black, granted. I knew I was an outsider, but come on. Some of the scenes are just too fake as well. The one where Brian cries about having a gun in his locker. That is definitely not Anthony Michael Hall's best performance. If you really want to see him act, check out "" The Dead Zone"" television series on the USA network. He really stretches big time. I give him a lot of credit. Molly Ringwald is the Prom Queen? OK, so it was her decade, but come on. I love the movie and the dialogue, but the acting is just bad. Maybe I love it 'cuz it's soooo cheezy and unrealistic. How many people do you know actually tell you their life story in a day?  Still this is a great pickme up movie. If you want something that's unrealistic and will take you attention off the stresses of your life.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Good entertainment from the 80s,"The Breakfast Club is a film about teens searching for their identities during a Saturday detention. The cast represents stereotypical characters from all the major high school cliques. Andrew Clark is the athlete portrayed by Emilio Estevez, Claire Standish is the princess as portrayed by Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall plays the brain Brian Johnson. The ""Club"" is rounded out with Judd Nelson as the criminal John Bender, and Ally Sheedy as basket case Allison Reynolds. The Club's chief rival and on-screen antagonist is Principal Richard Vernon played by Paul Gleason.The Breakfast Club is the name the group gives themselves in a thesis written by Johnson. The film is primarily a comedy, but differs from other teen comedies of the1980s such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off, in the depth that the film delves into the teenager's perceived angst. Ferris Bueller was sure of himself and the only angst he suffered was the fear of getting caught in one of his schemes. As mentioned before the Club's on screen adversary is Principal Vernon, but as the Club members get to know one another and search for common ground they all point their fingers toward their parents as the source of all their maladies. I interpreted their revelation as a mechanism to show that no matter how different we appear, we are all the same in fundamental ways, and what teen doesn't blame their parents for their problems? The movie opens with all the Club members arriving at the school on Saturday morning and interacting with their parents as is the case with Andrew, Claire, and Brian, however Allison is ""ditched"" at school while John comes wandering in on his own. Detention starts with Principal Vernon laying down the rules; you will not talk, you will not move from these seats, and you will not sleep, the last command being aimed at John in a way that shows Vernon's familiarity with John's tactics then the students are left on their own.All of the club members try to do their own thing to while away the time but John is at unease with the peace. He initiates confrontation with all of the others except Allison, whom he identifies as a fellow misfit, and ultimately has a showdown with Vernon. It is through John's persistent annoyances that the Club eventually come together to find common ground.The film constantly reaffirms each Club member's stereotypical persona, through dialogue, dress, and actions. The film also uses popular music of the era to help set the tone. There is even an impromptu music video with each member letting their hair down in a manner that fits their individual persona.The film succeeds as a comedy, but it also brings a little something extra to the table as the teens reveal their angst to one another and find common ground despite their differences.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
7.5/10,"A Saturday detention, five students, and an empty school, cinema has rarely been so still yet so loud. The Breakfast Club is less about what happens and more about the coalescing of identities, an experiment in human connection where the setting is static but the characters shift. This is a film where narrative takes a backseat to chemistry, where rebellion is expressed not through action but conversation. Not the greatest, but a foundation for films where nothing really happens, and so from a cinematic history perspective, I can appreciate it.John Hughes crafts a social microcosm, letting stereotypes unravel until they resemble something human. The jock, the nerd, the outcast, the princess, the delinquent: initially caricatures, but by the final freeze-frame, something deeper. The film thrives on its dialogue, its unspoken glances, and its 80s essence. There's a raw simplicity to its execution; no grand plot twists, no external stakes, just five people realising they are more alike than different. Teenagers talking for an hour and a half; it shouldn't work, yet it does.Of course, not everything lands. The film meanders, circling its own themes without fully escaping them. There's a certain inevitability to the friendships formed, predictable, but no less satisfying. And yet, what lingers is not the individual moments, but the collective warmth, the fleeting intimacy of strangers who share a day and perhaps nothing more. For its time it's great, 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
awesome 80's flick!,"This drama/comedy/semi-romantic teen coming-of-age movie is one of my ALL time favorites. Hands down.

"Feel Good, Realistic Film.","Review:
'The Breakfast Club' is an American comedy-drama film written, produced, and directed by John Hughes. I've seen this movie more times than I can count. I just love it so much, mostly because it's so relatable to me. We all remember being a teenager. A crazy, intense time when your highs were higher and your lows were lower, and every experience was that much more significant. This movie really captured what high school is like no matter what year you attend.
The movie starts with five teenagers getting dropped off at school for detention on a Saturday. None are well known to each other, and even start off with not liking each other's different personalities. As the day goes on it seems like one kid, Bender (Judd Nelson) starts to push the others out of their comfort zones and seeing who they really are. See if they're all more than just a ""criminal"", a ""jock"", a ""princess"", a ""nerd"", and a ""basket case"".
This is definitely an 80's film in all aspects, including the acting. I try hard to not judge acting when it comes from the 80's and prior because we just live in a different world now. I will say though, that the acting from this ensemble is equal all throughout, nobody was a true standout good or bad, and that's refreshing to see. I think everybody did a killer job for the decade it was released.
What I like the most about this movie, other than the entire concept of the movie itself, must be how relatable it is. I was in detention a lot as kid and when I was with a group we always messed around and made it more difficult for the teachers because we all thought life was hardest for us. Its how kids are, and this movie expressed that in a way that my generation and even generations to come will still relate to. After re-watching this movie over and over I thought I would notice some things that stand out in a not so good way, but the whole movie has a solid story and was executed smartly. I will say however that the acting is subpar, even for an 80's film. It's not bad by any means, but there are times throughout where it seems like they knew they weren't going to get the right take, so they just kept one they weren't' happy with.
Overall, I strongly believe that everybody will find something to love with this movie and I strongly recommend it if you haven't seen it. If you haven't seen in it a long time, give it a watch again to remind yourself of how amazing it is.

An 80's classic that I know by heart. It proves growing up is tough as your judged by your peers.,"1985's ""The Breakfast Club"" is a classic I now know by heart having seen many times it's a classic 80's film that never gets old and it captures the times of youth so well as many people remember people they went to high school with that are just like the film's characters. It's a memorable classic from John Hughes as it was nice to see he really showed what teens went thru.Anyway four high school kids spend a Saturday afternoon of detention together at an area Chicago high school for their apparent misdeeds and misunderstandings among peers. It began at 7AM and was to last until 4PM in which they were to write an essay telling who they think they are. Yet none of them had anything to say, at least nothing to say on paper! Interesting and very thought provoking along the way is how they find out facts and info about one another by communication and it turns out to be quite different from each one's perceived stereotype about one or the other.The performances are stellar and memorable you have your typical cast of characters that you come to know in any high school first the prom queen sweetheart Claire(Molly Ringwald), the odd basket case(Ally Sheedy), the brain Brian(Anthony Michael Hall), the jock(Emilio Estevez)and the criminal and most memorable performance was from the delinquent John(Judd Nelson). Each deal with the typical teen problems of peer pressure, acceptance, drugs, sex, and parent issues yet each along the way learn they are a special person as they were meant to be the way they were. A notable performance that was standout was the now late Paul Gleason who was tough and cocky as the school principal who monitored the afternoon stay.Overall great film one of the best and most remembered from the 80's that really showed what growing up in high school was like as each character of the film could be memorable to someone that you probably remembered in school. As the film ends each go their separate ways leaving you as the viewer to form your own take of how each one's life turned out. One thing was learned without writing an essay their was a princess, a jock, a basket case, brain, and criminal and each accepted their stereotype. One thing to remember and one message to take from this film is everyone is different, everyone was meant to be different, and everyone will be different always remember that. As you will cheer for ""The Breakfast Club"" time and time again.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An excellent dramatic film that dives deep inside the teenage spirit,"In one of John Hughes' most critically acclaimed films, 5 teenagers are in detention on a Saturday and are forced to interact under the watchful eye of Principal Vernon.After seeing Ferris Bueller's day Off and hearing friends discuss this 1985 drama, I was very eager to give it a watch, and was spoilt in one, if not the, best teenage dramas ever made.Estevez, Hall, Nelson, Ringwald and Sheedy are today big stars in Hollywood and it's fair to say that this film pushed them towards that status in a marvellous display of teenage emotions and antics in a great enjoyable and interesting drama.John Hughes has done it again with sharp writing, jokes and a great character driven plot that justifies the ideology of how parents can have bad effects on children.And this ideology of being brought up is very interesting to watch, and is portrayed well by all actors, and how the characters are all effected in different ways by their parents attitudes towards them.Though not designed to be funny, there are a few quirks in the plot that adds a delightful depth to the narrative and keeps the interest alive, and an ideology of what detention is like, and how it can affect your own mood.Though taking a while to get into, once the characters start interacting more does the plot really come together and capture the true essence of what goes on inside a teenage mind.Having an open question to the story will keep you watching to the very end, why is everyone in detention on a Saturday? This technique is well used and the final scenes are very dramatic and are worth hanging on for.The Breakfast Club is a sharply written, intense and intriguing drama that questions the whole concept of how children and teenagers should be raised. Hughes has brought this ideology to a dramatic light to create one of the best teenage dramas ever, not over doing it with unnecessary jokes and focusing on the characters and heir personalities which makes it an essential watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Here's one for the memory books!,"Meeting total strangers for the first time will not only make an impact for themselves, but for the rest of their lives.

Each one has their way of life, how things run in the house, and furthermore, they build a bond. At first, everyone except Allison are getting to know one another, however John always being the ""bad seed"", seems to love trouble. I like the part where he tried to escape, only to fall through the ceiling and into the men's room. Then I liked the part where John looked up Claire's skirt while he was trying to hide from Principal Vernon(Paul Gleason). When Allison is made over, she gets the jock, and John gets Claire, too bad for Brian, however, I bet he's too busy for girls. When John gets one of Claire's earrings, the question is, Will he change his ways? I love this movie and the ""Brat Pack"" put an impact in the 80's. The music is the tops in my opinion. 5 stars.

Teen film making at it's best.,"This movie has tons of flaws. Hughes' characters are stereotyped a little, the ending is pretty bad, the rock video in the middle of the movie is a bit random, and it seems like this was a screw you from John Hughes to parents everywhere. But when you get past all that, this movie is a moving, funny, innovative and influentail teen drama.The movie takes place on a Saturday where 5 teens-""A brain (Anthony Michael Hall), a basketcase(Ally Sheedy), a princess (Molly Ringwald), an athlete (Emilio Estevez), and a criminal (Judd Nelson)"" are serving a detention. They are not allowed to talk to one another, and are forced to write an essay on why they're here and who they think they are. Nelson and the principal of the school hate each other, and throughout the film they are given good interaction. Eventually, Nelson makes the door slam shut, and he forces the 5 of them to talk. They eat their lunches, and you can see the style of the 5 of them. Then they begin to discuss why they are all here.By the end of this movie, you will have been erased of the idea that any teen, whatsoever, has a perfect life.

I think I loved this movie before I even saw it.,"I usually detest ""high school movies,"" where the cliches run rampant and a huge deal is made out of the Prom or the Big Game. That's why my first viewing of ""The Breakfast Club"" yesterday was such a nice experience.  This is the ultimate teenaged angst film, one that rings much truer to life than such pale attempts as ""Cruel Intentions"" or ""Varsity Blues.""  The story is so simple, it's amazing how deep it goes.  Five kids in clearly delineated roles, the brain, the athlete, the basket case, the princess, and the criminal, find themselves stuck together in Saturday detention, and figure out they're all really pretty much the same.The mood of the film feel right, the isolation, the funny feeling of promise and doom mixed together.  I must have seen television ads for this a hundred times when I was younger, but never watched it.  I'm glad my first viewing was of the video version with all the swearing and marijuana left in. These elements may not be pretty, but they keep the film grounded and realistic.

The Must-See Film for 80's Youth Is More a Character Study than a Story: Good But Not Great,"If there was ever a Hollywood-backed film personifying the anxiety of Generation X, it was ""The Breakfast Club"". If you were a teen in suburban America in the 1980's (as I was), this was your film, or at least it was supposed to be. The Boomers had ""The Graduate"" and ""Easy Rider"", the Silent Generation had ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""American Graffiti"". We have ""The Breakfast Club"". Or do we? Is it a cinematic masterpiece or overrated? Let's take a second look at this cult classic because as of this writing, the 30th anniversary of its release is coming up in 2015 with theatrical viewings scheduled around the country. Generation X'ers will be lining up to relive their teenage years.While in his 30's, John Hughes had a brief directing career making films targeted to Generation X'ers. Hughes offerings were considered the fresh new voice speaking both to and from the point of view of Generation X, offspring of the sons and daughters of those who were children during and just after World War II, a.k.a the Silent and Baby Boom Generations. Hughes also directed ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""Sixteen Candles"", and ""Pretty in Pink"". Many of Hughes' films used the same talent. These youthful upstarts of our generation were fondly known as ""The Brat Pack"". (Some of the ""brat"" actors transitioned into adult careers while others fell off the radar.) Among Hughes' favorite talent were Molly Ringwold, Anthony Michael Hall, and Ally Sheedy, all present and accounted for in ""Breakfast Club"". By 1991, the Generation X'ers were becoming young adults, graduating from college and beginning careers and families. The voice of 80's teen angst was becoming passé. Hughes directed his last film in 1991, ""Curly Sue"", which paired a Boomer and a Millennial with disastrous results. It ultimately bombed at the box office.So does ""Breakfast Club"" uphold today? Well sort of yes sort of no. There is no plot per se, only a setting. The setting is the high school library where five teenagers are being held in a day-long detention on a Saturday for wrong-doings which are never made completely clear. The real story is about each character and how they get to know one another. The film's strength is also its weakness, depending upon your point of view. Each student comes from a different aspect of the student body of the fictional high school. They are in essence, prototypes, maybe even stereotypes, of each of the different faces of the school. Molly Ringwold is from the ""popular"" and chic crowd of girls who wear makeup and nice clothes. Judd Nelson is the rule-breaker, who we imagine never does his homework and goofs off at the back of the classes he takes if he's not cutting school altogether. Even from the get-go, we predict that this is not Nelson's first time in detention. Emilio Estevez is the jock, probably a football player and wrestler. Ally Sheedy is the loser loner female, who at first grosses out Ringwold. Anthony Michael Hall plays ""the brain"", a kid who gets straight A's, especially in science classes, but who is otherwise not part of the ""popular"" crowd.The idea is that these kids would never have even said hello to one another during a typical school day because they are all worlds apart. However, because they're in detention for various infractions, they are forced to meet and interact with one another. The main crux of the story is how the kids learn about each other and how they both fit and don't fit into their own stereotypes. They also begin engaging in behavior of their opposite counterparts, such as when Estevez smokes and does cart wheels on the upper floor of the library, similar to what Nelson's character usually does. This aspect of the film succeeds in spades. As a character study, it works very well. It could almost be a play.Where the story lags slightly is in its lack of a storyline. When I first saw it, I had high-expectations because it was already becoming the ""must-see"" film for my generation. After viewing, I found I generally enjoyed it, but seeing kids simply talking and having some fun for 90 minutes is not exactly why I want to see a film. Near the end, is the famous ""dance scene"" where the characters let loose and let it all hang out. Hall being the brain is the DJ. Dance scenes like this were very popular with Generation X films of this sort, but now they seem rather dated. I want to see characters deal with and overcome dilemmas, not just talk about themselves and dance around. Of course the subtlety is to see the characters change slightly by interacting with kids they never otherwise would have. While I believe it's a nice beginning of an idea, I don't think it's enough to carry through an entire film.""The Breakfast Club"" may be more important in terms of what it represents, the angst of Generation X, rather than it being a masterpiece of filmmaking and storytelling in its own right. The mark of a great film is when it speaks to later generations. I have seen ""The Graduate"", ""American Graffiti"", and ""Rebel Without a Cause"" many times, and they never seem dated, even though these were targeted to previous generations. Does ""The Breakfast Club"" do this for me? Not quite. It may have spoken more to me during that time, but it says less to me now. Maybe I wanted the cast to rip away the ridiculous sculpture in the middle of the library in the way that Dustin Hoffman steals away the bride at the end of the Graduate. Or for the kids to engage in something together, like the race at the end of American Graffiti. For all its honesty, even by the end of their detention, the Breakfast Clubbers were still in their own prison, the 1980's.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Ending ruined it,"The Bowie Quote gave it more seriousness then it deserved-this movie wanted to be something great from the beginning.  Well, by the end of it I realized that what it wanted was not what it was.Yes, I knew kids like everyone of the leads.  My class (of'97) was made up of them.  But as far as realism goes-the buck stopped here.  The Sheedy character was used to show transformation at the sake of keeping her core being, the only character who was sacrificed as not good enough as she is.Each of us probably would have seen the end a bit different, but thanks to John ""Home Alone"" Hughes we all ""see"" it the same. I felt so manipulated to feel the way Hughes wanted me to by the essay it ruined the movie forever for me.

Judd Nelson & Molly Ringwald Made this A Classic Film !,"Happened to be in the neighborhood of Glenbrook H.S. in Illinois where the high school filming location was being completed and it sort of made me want to see this film over and over again.  We all know that such events in high school are quite mild and not very realistic compared to the high school killings throughout the country.   Judd Nelson (John Bender) ""The Cabin By the Lake"" 2000"" gave an outstanding performance which launched his great acting career, I was always amazed by his great style of acting, he can do almost anything he is given to perform.   Molly Ringwald (Claire Standish) ""Cut"" 2000, gave a great supporting role, with all kinds of sexual abuse being directed to her by John Bender, even looking up her skirt and making demeaning slander to her character for being a Virgin.   This is truly a classic film by today's standards and should never be put under a microscope and picked apart.

Holds up surprisingly well,"I saw this movie when it was first released and I enjoyed it quite alot.  I saw it for the second time last week and I was surprised how well it held up - probably because the actors are so good at portraying actual human beings, unlike most 'teen' comedies.  I liked the dramatic sections better - Ally Sheedy and Emilio Estevez share a very heartfelt scene that is very well done.  The end of the movie drags it down slightly, as the movie stretches the credibility of the relationships that have developed.  But it is still a very good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Greatest Teen Film Of All Time And John Hughes' (RIP)Greatest Film. A Landmark Classic.,"The Breakfast Club is the greatest Teen film of all time and is not only a Teen classic of the 80s,but a film Classic for all times. With a great balance of Comedy,Drama,Great Direction,excellent performances and an well-written screenplay,The Breakfast Club is John Hughes' greatest film and is a landmark in Teen Films,High School Films and Coming Of Age films.Set on March 24,1984 in Shermer High School in Shermer,Illinois,The Breakfast Club tells the story of five High School students Brian Johnson,The Brain(Anthony Michael Hall),Andrew Clark,The Athlete(Emilio Estevez),Allison Reynolds,The Basketcase(Ally Sheedy),Claire Standish,The Princess(Molly Ringwald)and John Bender,The Criminal(Judd Nelson)who are from different social backgrounds and have to serve detention on a Saturday under the watchful eye of teacher Richard Vernon(Paul Gleason). While there in detention,the five students talk to each other and realize they have a lot in common beyond their stereotypes and social classes and the experience changes their lives forever making them known forever as...The Breakfast Club.What can be said about The Breakfast Club that hasn't been said already,it's a classic that revolutionized Teen films at the time and has a style and influence that has been imitated,but never duplicated. The reason,I think TBC works do well is because of the five teen characters and how we can relate to each of them in different ways discussing their fears,desires and problems with their parents. The Teenage years can be a funny,strange and confusing time for many people and Hughes puts it on full display with this film giving us three dimensional characters that are lifted beyond their stereotypes and showing true emotions and feelings and no matter what race,color or class you are you'll identify with each character. While the fashions and music are of the 80s,the feelings and emotions are truly timeless and heartfelt and one of the reasons TBC has stood the test of time. The screenplay by John Hughes(which Hughes wrote in 2 days)is excellent and well-written balancing Comedy and Drama and giving the characters memorable dialog,while they're laughs and funny moments,they're moments of great drama and truth in some of the scenes. Hughes was a true master of the teenage language and the dialog in TBC feels real and authentic almost like you're next to the characters hearing the dialog. I don't think that Hughes was trying reinvent or revolutionize the Teen genre,but unintentionally he did with this film and his other films as well bringing a depth and excellence that hadn't been seen in Teen films since Rebel Without A Cause and American Graffiti. The only 80s Teen films that can match TBC's honesty and truth is Hughes' other films and Fast Times At Ridgemont High. While Hughes' other films Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Sixteen Candles,Pretty In Pink,Some Kind Of Wonderful and Weird Science are also classics of the Teen film genre,TBC in my opinion will remain his most enduring and most powerful. What I also love about the film is the setting being in one location which is a High School library which is used to great effect and adds to the film. Making a Teen movie set in one location with no sex,nudity,parties or drinking(although the characters do use drugs in the film)seemed like a risky gamble at the time,but Hughes makes use of his one location and still keeps the film entertaining and interesting. The one location gives the film a feeling or style of stage play or an small independent film and Hughes in his own way made a film like 12 Angry Men or Glengarry Glen Ross,where instead of 12 jurors and real estate office workers,it's teenagers in High School. Despite the film being set in one location Hughes keeps the film moving at a quick pace and a lot of energy and as a viewer you are glued to the screen. The ending of the film is a great ending and makes the viewers asks a lot of questions and gives us no answers. It's a masterful ending that will make us the viewers put together the dots and answers and have us wondering what happened to the characters and is one of the reasons TBC is brilliant.The whole cast does a great job. Emilio Estevez is excellent as Andrew,the Wrestling jock who's pressured to succeed and win. Judd Nelson is brilliant in his career defining performance as John Bender,a rebel who is cynical,irritating,yet likable. Anthony Michael Hall is great as Brian,the smart kid who has to have high grades or will fail in life. Molly Ringwald is wonderful as Claire,the popular girl who is the target of Bender's irritation. Ally Sheedy is effective as Allison,the outcast who doesn't say much,but talks as times rolls on. Paul Gleason(RIP)is great as John Vernon,cynical teacher who hates the students at the school,especially Bender. John Kapelos does a fine and funny job as Carl The Janitor who offers words of wisdom to the kids and Vernon.The direction by John Hughes is simple,but great,with Hughes bringing a lot of energy to the film with his writing and direction. Great Job,John. Thank you John Hughes for giving viewers great Teen films that are timeless classics that will live on and be loved and cherished forever. RIP,John.Keith Forsey's score in the film is seldom used,but works and fits with film's tone. The film has a great soundtrack as well,especially with the film iconic theme song Don't You(Forget About Me)by Simple Minds and other great songs Fire In The Twilight(Wang Chung)and We Are Not Alone(Karla DeVito). Hughes' films always had great soundtracks and TBC is no exception.In final word,if you love John Hughes,Teen Films,High School Films,Coming Of Age films or films in general,I suggest you see The Breakfast Club,a true classic that will stand the test of time and will live forever in cinema and with audiences. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Want Some Strange to Go With That?,"We all know school could either be a time of fun or pure hell. IT's especially hell if you're a victim of a stereotype which what all five of these kids are by their nicknames listed above. The only thing all five have in common is that they share a room for an entire Saturday because of some bad thing they did. It's eight hours with people that go to the same school, but simultaneously are completely different because of their social standing in school. But they come out with a life changing experience. Its absolutely a feel good movie and a movie that no one can hate.It's Saturday March 24, 1984 at Shermer High School in Shermer, IL which is where five teens need to spend their entire day. Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), John Bender (Judd Nelson), Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), and Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy) are the victims and although go to the same school, they are all from different cliques or groups in the school. They are secluded in the school library from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM, they can't talk, they can only sit and think about what they've done, and write their 1,000 word essay. They are occasionally visited by Principal Vernon (Paul Gleason). Though when he isn't in the room, they do the exact opposite of what they are supposed to.As time passes the kids learn about one another and know they each have a struggle to overcome and they need to rise above their stereotype. By looking at these kids you can tell who is who. Stereotypes have been around forever and though most are true can be hurtful and humorous. This film focuses and says to look past your stereotype and be who you can be. Let people see you as they want to see you. In my opinion the most deepest and heartfelt John Hughes film to date.Some kids my age would think it's a boring, lackluster film that isn't funny. I find it extremely fun and it only gets funnier every time you watch it. The movie is more than half dialogue which is why kids would be bored by it. But what else is there to do in detention on a Saturday? A kids moral to the film is be yourself, look past your bad quality, pick out the positives, and be who you are. A teacher's moral should be when you place five high school students in a room and expect them to keep quiet for eight hours, they will talk eventually.Starring: Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, and Paul Gleason.

The embodiment of an 80s film,"This film was obviously ground-breaking in its time. However, it is not comparable to the quality of film-making today. I only sat through this film because it's a classic. I understand it touched on revolutionary themes at the time and I can appreciate that, but a lot less was needed for a film to qualify as ""good"" in the 80s than is needed now, and this film has made that evident to me.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Any teenager should watch this at some point,"This came on the TV just as I was writing my review of Little Nicky, right after aforementioned title had ended. The title seemed familiar, so I decided to give it a chance. I hadn't expected the great film that I got out of it. This should be viewed by any teenager, at least once, at some point. The premise is as simple as this: put five typical but very different high school kids in detention the same day at the same place. The film follows them, as they spend the whole day at the school, and eventually warm up to each other, open up to each other and finally, grow to like and accept each other. This is one of the only John Hughes films(of the ones he directed himself, at least) that I've seen, so I'm not entirely familiar with his directing style, but I like what I've seen so far. The plot is very good, and a lot less pretentious than most teen comedies. It doesn't try too hard to be funny... it just is. The acting performances are all top-notch. The characters are well-written, credible and most importantly, interesting. The film keeps your interest better than most teen flicks. The humor is very good, not overly crude or offensive, but still teen-oriented. The dialog is well-written and equally well-delivered. A great film which should be seen by any teenager. I recommend it to anyone that is or has been a teenager. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Maybe a Little Outdated,"The Breakfast Club is obviously an 80's classic, but for teenagers in the 2020's, it's a little less classic. The comedy was on point, but there was just too much talking for me to enjoy. It holds up somewhat well, but a remake in the 20's would be so much more enjoyable. The assortment of outcasts finding common ground is always relevant, but the binding factor between the 5 delinquents and teenagers today is their distaste against The Man (the teacher). And of course, ""Don't you forget about me"" is always nostalgic. TBC isn't as enjoyable now as it was in the 80's, but people who grew up with TBC in their childhood know how much they love it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Legendary but Not Great,"Here goes the ""Brat Pack"". There are reasons why ""The Breakfast Club"" is iconic. The cast is packed with 80's teen stars, the director is legendary and there are memorable moments scattered throughout the film.I hate to be this guy, but I was a little disappointed in the finale, mostly because of the character arcs. For the most part, all the characters are exactly the same at the end, and those that change (like Allison) are too abrupt. The film is building to the right place, but then it's all wrapped up. I would have liked to see another 20 minutes of real character development and (more importantly) redemption.The whole movie feels like a bottle episode of a sitcom, which is a good thing. The dancing scene is legendary, the lunch scene is hilarious and there are some moments that truly have heart. I just would have liked a little more unity between the group.Best Character: Allison (except for what they do to her at the end)

Empty at the end,"The Breakfast Club is one of those films that gains cult status, and seems to be brought up fondly quite often, so I thought I'd sit down and watch it, just to see what it was like, and I'm afraid to say it left me feeling disappointed at the end.There's great interaction between the cast which adds a lot to the humour of the film, along with some more touching moments later on. Their journey from knowing nothing about each other to becoming great friends seems like a natural progression, as we really get a sense of each character's personalities. However, after a while the film seems to just smash straight through these barriers that the kids have put up and suddenly, almost without warning, the end arrives leaving everyone friends for life. It's a little disorientating, especially as two characters who are screaming and shouting at each other all the way through the film, one even reducing the other to tears, start sharing one of those romantic moments with *absolutely nothing* to lead them to it. It seems completely unnecessary.Much is made of the experience the characters have changing their lives forever, but it's hard to see just why this is from the film, with little more than a five minute talk about themselves to distinguish this from any group of teens hanging out somewhere. Yes, it's good to get your problems off your chest, but I hardly see anything during this as life-changing. It really let down the film for me, because (aside from a completely patronising ""put on make-up, do your hair and all your problems disappear!"" makeover) nothing really changes in these kids, while the ending implies something huge.But, having said that, the rest of the film is fun, and the interaction between all the characters works really well. I enjoyed it, but the ending just left me wanting something a little more satisfying.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

One of the most memorable 80s high school films...,"I was one year from graduation when this film came out. I don't remember seeing it at the movies but I did watch it on cable numerous times. It is probably the best John Hughes film. The premise of the film was a group of students in detention on Saturday. The Breakfast Club was comprised of the full spectrum of high school going species. There was the jock, the popular girl, the stoner, the nerd and that weird girl that kept to herself and nobody talked to. These kids from different walks of life who should never be friends bonded and became friends at least for that day. It was moving to see them talk to each other about their problems and bond. It was cool the way they all banded together against the biggest ass of a teacher in the school. One of the most memorable things about the movie was the song. Simple Mind's `Don't You Forget About Me' was perfect and I can't hear that song without thinking of `The Breakfast Club'.Though I totally like the movie they did leave it somewhat incomplete. The question of whether they would still be friends on Monday or would they just stick to their own group. I wish they had made a sequel or just answered that question.`The Breakfast Club' is truly an American classic. I'm buying the DVD.Rayvyn",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Certain things don't really stand the test of time but the acting definitely makes up for it.

It shows different perspectives of very well-written characters, and reminds you that there's usually an explanation when you judge someone. It assumes nothing, and levels the field for adults and kids. Not only does it strike at popularity and age discrimination, but also has a humanistic charm which instills a little more faith in people in general.There is also an aura of idealism from the characters, and it's that sort of mentality that keeps people productive and optimistic.

"""Five strangers with nothing in common, except each other""","I'm finally reviewing one of my favorite films, The Breakfast Club. Now I've always been a fan of John Hughes films. He has created heartwarming teenage-comedies that are fortunately not really teenage at all, and it actually hits you without being contrived. So the story starts when I got done finished Ferris Bueller's Day Off. I liked the movie, but found it a bit overrated. So I started researching more of Hughes movies, finding out that the fan favorite was Breakfast Club. I started to watch it, and when it finally finished, I didn't really like it at all. I was only ten at the time, and I'm sure that comes into the equation, but the movie didn't come off as it was all cracked up to be. The characters were so stereotypical it was painful, and when I was ten I found it to be completely boring as most of the film is dialog-heavy. So I passed the film off all these years, looking back and saying I would give it another chance, but never really happened. Yesterday night, I saw it playing on HBO. This was the perfect chance, as I was in the mood for a movie and there was nothing really else to do. So I watched it.. And here's the truth:It became one of my favorite films. I finally realized the characters were set up to be stereotypical because, by the end, you realize that each of these characters are hiding something. And that was really nice. The movie never even came across boring because the dialog was real and sometimes even a bit funny. You're never even going to think of it being boring, it was possibly one of the greatest dialog-heavy movies ever. And then the message contained was seriously grateful and miraculous. And the acting was really great. My favorite scene is where the group sits in a circle, and tells each other how they got into detention. It became one of my favorite scenes in cinematic history. It was real, truthful, and uplifting. I recommend this film for all people looking for something new and different. If you can't take more than five minutes of dialog, this film will bore you to death. But this movie always reserves itself a special place in my heart while watching it. It is a classic 80's film that dismembers clichés and then becomes one of the greatest films of all time.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
For a movie that has like one location it is really good.,"I actually enjoyed this movie though it is definitely a movie I would usually not care all that much for. Most of the time movies about people in high school or have such a limited amount of locations are not my thing. I like a movie that goes all over the place as a movie for me is an escape and the more locations the more locales I escape to. This film takes place in a library at a high school and focuses on five teens who are stuck with detention on a Saturday. Four of the five are not used to this type of situation, but one is quite used to it. I don't know, for some reason it works, it is by far the only Brat Pack movie that I really enjoy and I think it works for a lot of reasons. The humor is pretty good, the serious situations are realistic and the movie does a nice job of turning this five virtual strangers into friends. Granted, I still hate the fact the one person ended up with no gal at the end, but it is only a minor complaint to be sure. The cast does a very good job with their roles as they have to for this movie to be a success because it is sort of a character study. They only leave from the library briefly, so yes the movie does for the most part takes place entirely in that place so that scenery can be a bit boring. The guy playing the principal does a rather good job here too and like I said a lot of funny exchanges occur between him and the more delinquent student played wonderfully by Judd Nelson. I also really enjoy Ally Sheedy's performance as the shy, kind of weird girl. Molly Ringwald can do the character she played in her sleep and Emilio is rather good as the football player. Anthony Michael Hall plays the nerd and rounds out the cast very nicely. Good movie if not really heavy on the locations, heck it could be a stage play.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Damn good,"When I saw this film in the 80's as a teenager I totaly identified with it. I enjoyed the humor and the characters.  It was a riot and very real.  I knew many 'Benders' in my school (one I knew even killed himself) as with all the other characters.  It even meant more to me cause so many people liked to remark how much I looked like Anthony Michael Hall back then (who was in all these movies playing the same stereotyped character).Looking back the film is still great.  However, my only criticism with the movie now was that it didn't go far enough in letting the characters vent. I think that just reflects the time it was made. THe movie wasn't ready to handle HARD ISSUES not because it couldn't but because the time it was made no one was doing that.Kids now are faced with harder issues and are forced to grow up faster. Also kids are more accepting I think of other cliques compared to back then.. Except the geeks I guess...Anyway...  A film that will stand the test of time.Rating 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It made me want to go home and have dinner,"A JH gold.The movie is about weird, cool, jock and plain Jane students stuck at school on a weekend for detention. Their goal is to get through the day in 1 piece.The whole production was mellow and marvelous. I cannot find a flaw in this movie. It was such a nice ride.
It has drama, misfit, misadventure and developing relationships.Overall a perfect movie. A John Hughes Classic.What can be learned? Make the best of your time anywhere you are.Verdict: Dinner time.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""You just bought yourself another Saturday""","John Hughes's 'quintessential' '80s film is still as relevant today as it was thirty-odd years ago. A film that really gets to the heart of the teenage characters as they languish together in Saturday detention with the highly-strung Mr. Vernon, who seems to hate them all. The four kids are representatives of four distinctive cliques; there's the weird girl Allison, the athlete Andrew, the prim-and-proper Claire who looks down on everyone, the nerd Brian and finally, the wild, rebel-without-a-case bad boy John. None of them would be caught dead in the other's company usually, but as their sentence in detention stretches from 7am - 4pm and they are virtually left their own devices in the library, their initial hostility towards one another eventually dissipates as they bond and realise they actually have a lot in common. But at the end of the day, the question is asked and we are left to wonder, What will happen Monday?""The Breakfast Club"" is well-deserving of its status as a classic 80s film but it also holds up to be more than that. It's undeniable charm and the excellent performances from the small cast make it one to remember. Hughes did not have much experience when he made this, and I believe he was under some pressure from the studio and producers, but he did a tremendous job, essentially filming a stage-production with the action all taking place (mostly) in the one room. This always serves to add a more personal feel to a film. ending, with the famous song by Simple Minds playing to Judd Nelson raising his fist triumphantly in the air, is one of the most iconic in cinema history, and is one of my all-time favourites.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Remember when Woody Allen went serious?,"It feels the same here. Mr. Hughes turns his back on his fans with a desperate stab at legitimacy, and the results are mixed. The cast is game, but saddled with portentious monologues about 'fitting in' that are obviously all about John Hughes. Only Ally Sheedy comes off great, she seems to be playing a character that is unrecognizable in the Hughes Cannon- perhaps distantly related to 'Drummer Girl' from SKOW. This is a film that takes itself SERIOUSLY and begs you too as well. Very much of it's time- it feels dated- but the interesting thing is watching Hughes grow as a film maker. It's beautifully shot and edited, and he is clearly coming into his own. If only his cast had been better",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Children and adults can enjoy this film in different way,"Three boys and two girls come to their high school, even though it's Saturday because of some reasons. They are shut in the library and must write an essay. They are not friends and start fighting. However, through the communication in which they talk about their difficulties, they understand each other. This is about just one day. However, they grow up and confront their problems. It's really simple, but we don't get bored as their changes are described in good rhythm. Also I love its 80's atmosphere. I want to watch it again when I have a child. Maybe I can enjoy this film in different way. I'm looking forward to it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A great film of the 80's,"I loved this film from the first time that I saw it. I like the whole idea of the kids sitting around for a whole day and talking about anything and everything that comes to their mind and how their situation in life is reflected in how they come to their very distinct and separate ideas and opinions. I felt I identified with Judd Nelson's character of Bender, being that I was the pain in the butt that he was, at that time. I'd like to think that if there was a second part to update us on what happened to the members of ""The Breakfast Club,"" that the character of Bender would have grown up to a better vision of life than he displayed in the movie. A fantastic movie of not coming of age, but becoming aware.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The next screw that  falls out is going to be you!,"The Breakfast club is one of the best teen movies ever made. Although this film is low budget, I found this film to be very precise and realistic to what high school environments are all about. Its about five high school students that attend a high school detention session one Saturday and all became good friends by the end of the session.What I found realistic about this film is how the director John Hughes managed to include every social class that children have in the high school environment. You've got Brian Johnson (Michael Anthony Hall) the nerd, John Bender(Judd Nelson) as the rebel punk, Claire Standish(Molly Ringwold) as the prude, Allison Reynolds(Ally Sheely) as the weirdo and Andrew Clarke (Emilio Estevez) as the jock. You even have Richard Vernon as the strict angry teacher(Paul Gleason) which stereotypes a typical example of an American teacher. What I also liked about this film was the brilliant acting, especially Judd Nelson who played John Bender for without him this film wouldn't have been half as good as it was. Although he was a punk, I found his persona quite cool and yet funny in the ways he behaved with his piers and his teacher Richard Vernon. Even though John Bender was in the wrong with Mr. Vernon and how Mr. Vernon got the best of him, I did respect John for standing up for himself against his teacher and for getting the best of Mr. Vernon by escaping from the room he was locked up in by Mr. Vernon and without Mr. Vernon knowing about it. I loved the scene when he yelled out to Mr. Vernon f**k you when Mr.Vernon left the room.Anyway, if you haven't seen this film then you should definitely watch it, for I believe the moral of this film is that whatever social class your apart of whether your a nerd, a jock, a prude, a weirdo or a rebel, we're all the same, no persons better than the next.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Classic 80's teen movie by John Hughes.  The Breakfast Club appeals to almost every body in its target audience,"The Breakfast Club is a movie that most teens hold deep inside their hearts. Why? Simple. The Breakfast Club deals with some problems teens hold within themselves: Insecurity, hormones, trouble with parents, trying to be popular, bullies, etc. This allows the target audience to relate to it very well. The Breakfast Club takes these problems and sets them in each and every one of our characters. Andy Clark is a jock dealing with parents. Brian Johnson is a nerd dealing with bullies. John Bender is one of those bullies who spend every weekend in detention. Clare is an insecure girl trying to be popular. Allison she's just weird. (She has a sandwich with sugar from pixie sticks and Captain Crunch cereal. Yum.) These five students unite during one detention; each one of them did something wrong or broke a rule. This is how the film starts out. John Bender (the bully) starts up a conversation, and pretty soon secrets are revealed, and character development takes place. That is pretty much what happens during one day in detention.This movie is not only a well-made drama, but also makes a decent comedy. This film, of course is by John Hughes, who has made many comedies, such as Home Alone, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation and Planes, Trains & Automobiles. There are many scenes of humor. One of them is when the principal emerges quickly from the bathroom and tells the students: ""I will not be made a fool of"" and leaves with some toilet paper hanging from the back of his pants. So much for not being a fool.The Breakfast Club isn't complex or too inventive: It's just a drama made for teens; a drama with acting, comedy and fair realism; a drama that you will love, especially if you're a teenager.In short: The Breakfast Club's target audience is teenagers, and works well for them. Ask any teenager who has seen this movie, and they will most likely tell you that they love it. (Well, probably)Note: The film doesn't deserve the R rating. It's rated R for language, but the characters don't cuss as much as they would nowadays. They just use a couple of ""hells"" and ""damns."" Well, that goes for the version I saw on AMC.9/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Maybe it's the nostalgia talkin or just maybe....,"....it's a damn good movie for any generation. I haven't watched it since I was a teenager, and it meant everything to me at the time, but now as an adult it still rings true as we all lived that period in our lives. What it really comes down to is the simplicity of the characters: they're not trying to act in calculated ways, they made mistakes and they didn't have agendas other than getting through the day.My fellow high schoolers said I looked like Anthony M. Hall which was likely an insult considering he portrayed the nerd in the movie. I took it as a compliment as I at least looked like a movie star at the time. Mr. Hall didn't go onto major success but Estevez, Nelson and Ringwald did: this was a springboard for them.The detention teacher sees the accused as ""A brain, an athlete, a basket case, princess and a criminal""; labels to be sure. The whole idea is not to judge one another by their shoes (Dylan). Good job.As they settle down the criminal accentuates his aggression, the athlete stands his ground, the princess remains pretty, the nerd does mostly calculations and the basketcase retreats. Everyone was supposed to be grounded in their pre-defined characters till it all got f**ked up.The f**ked up part is they all started to mix. The jock and bascketcase intertwined while the princess and criminal became intrigued. They admit to their guilt and push each others buttons but mostly they concede their faults. And as you may have noticed my character, the nerd, was left without a date; took me years to get over that.I believe the 80s as a coming of age for movies (the 70s were too slow paced) where this was one of them. And with the Simple Minds song for the movie, which has resonated in my psyche for 37 years, it goes like: ""don't you...forget about me...don't, don't, don't.... don't you...forget about me..."" I never forgot it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Don't bother - utter shog dite,"So this one had been on my watchlist for a while, due to hype it received and it being a 'classic'.

An excellent movie from the 80.s,"To put it in context, im 51 years old. I grew up during the 80;s so maybe Im biased. but I prefer these kind of character driven movies over the crappy Marvel movies produced nowadays. The characters are excellent, the dialog are trustworthy and the setting is perfect. This movie could easily been a caricature but astounding performance of the young actor and excellent direction avoids this trap. it portrays the stereotype characters, the jock, the nerd, the outcast, the pram queen character in a believable context. confined in the library of the school they have to confront each other with the preconceptions they have. and the finale is fantastic.think back to when you where a teenager, all the struggles you had finding your identity, all the existential questions,the intense love and hate feelings. this movie captures this in a fantastic way (without CGI effects)",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Why is this movie amazing?,"Simple, it's about bringing people together. It paved the way for millions of movies, while teaching the world that it is possible for everyone to just get along. We conducted character studies in a Psycology class at my high school. It revolved around this movie. We analyzed the characters. I took the class just because of that assignment. However, I learned more about myself in one semester, than I have in my entire life. I'm not sure if all that is relevant. The point is...The Breakfast Club is a versatile movie that will stand the test of time. Every person on Earth can identify with at least one of the characters. After all, aren't we all a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, or a criminal?",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
High School Blues,"In high school I've always passed by a lot of people and even some of the clichés there in. I've always wondered even to this day, who was that person that passed by, what were they thinking, or what did that person think about when she looked at me.This film is one of my favorite movies in general and it's my favorite teen film from one of my favorite script writers John Hughes. John Hughes just always knew how to mix both humor and humanity very well, most of it from the dialog they delivered which felt like something any everyday person would say. Or even the amount of depth each of the characters had and that they were all in some amount of pain that most of use everyday deal with.Watching this film as a teenager it really blew me away because it really talked to me. Looking at this film now as an adult it's like reading a journal passage, I'm able to say yeah that happened to me.The whole film is pretty much like one big bottle episode, this film I feel executes it well, despite it being a film where nothing really happens it has an energy that just keeps things moving so you don't feel like you've been in there too long. And due to the dialog, depth and what each of the characters due in their time in a confined space, it keeps itself interesting.I even like how they use the school library which I'll admit is probably the most impressive library I've ever seen, it looks more like a collage library. But I like how spacious it is and really induces a positive atmosphere and freedom of movement which works to the characters advantage because here they have total freedom to do and be whatever they want.The humor is great from the suttle to big jokes. One of my favorite jokes no down is seeing Andrew as he is a bit stoned he is dancing and doing some gymnastics to some rock music on the second floor of the library and we see that moment when he breaks the glass door by just screaming at it. That always cracked me up, this guy has superhuman vocals. But also that's just something I'd love to do if I ever had the library or a mall to myself.The characters are all great, because their all three dimensional their not the steriotyipcial teen you might see in one crappy TV teen drama too many, but in a way actually feel like people that actually can exist.Bender played well by Judd Nelson is a lot of fun. He's a so called rebel that is a blow hole that you love to dislike or like depending on the time. Yes the guy is a bit guilty of anti social behavior, there are times he can really be antagonizing from his attention getting complex and comes really close to pressing that wrong button with everyone.However my favorite character is Alison played by Ally Sheedy. I'll admit when I was a kid I actually did have a crush on this actress, yeah I know there was Molly Ringwold but I was just attracted to Ally more. This is my favorite role from her as she plays a shy girl, her character literally doesn't say a whole lot in the film but to me she doesn't need to, sometimes you say a lot by not saying anything at all.This character in a way is a lot like myself in real life, OK not entirely but there are some thing about her I can relate to. The fact that she doesn't talk much, and it's not always because she's shy it's just that she doesn't feel a need to talk and when she talks she feels like it or there actually is something to talk about.Other things I like is the fact that she's an introvert, this girl is just constantly full of surprises from her quaky need to take random things for no particular reason but we also see that she's an talented artist as she was able to draw a really detailed landscape sketch. Even like some of her chemistry with Andrew, despite there being not many interaction scenes between the two I really felt both made a connection.I really love it when we finally get down to the really serious stuff when finally everyone just opens up. One issue I can really relate to is Brian's when he talks about the pressure he has to go though everyday to maintain being a A student and to never get an F because his family can't have it. This really made me feel for Brian not just the fact I was also like him but that it really gets an issue about our education system how they've set the bar too high. I know there is such a think as challenging intelligent minds but there is such a thing as being too challenging, which to me always messes me up and depletes morale. I do believe in success but you also have to let people be people.The ending is interesting because it's open ended and sort of left to your interpretation because after their time is over you can't help but wonder what's going to happen Monday morning, or if all or any of them will remain friends. But so it goes with life itself, they all got though today but tomorrow is a new day. However it also has a sense of hope as each of them in that short span of time have all grown a little and because what they all truly are people.The real education is outside the classroom.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Finally, although they have a quarrel, they can understand each other and finish the lecture on Saturday. There are five protagonists in the film. I think all these actors and actresses act very well. Especially, an actress who acts a mysterious character is great. This is because she plays a difficult character to act well and succeeds in expressing the atmosphere which the mysterious character has.

Just a classic - the birth of the teen/school genre,"I always feel a little apprehensive going into older movies that are so universally loved like the very, very popular The Breakfast Club. Films of this type instill in me all manner of preconceived notions because they are so engrained in the pop culture consciousness and as a result, though I have not seen them, I feel as though I already have. Even though this movie was before my time, I felt optimistic that I would most likely enjoy it to some degree but would also somehow be unable to fully embrace it without the luxury of the added nostalgic good will that often comes from seeing these things in one's youth. It turns out that The Breakfast Club was able to transcend all of this baggage I brought with me and prove to be the real deal. I loved this film.The dork, the jock, the rebel, the beauty queen and the eccentric artist are all forced to coexist in the same situation together, a High School weekend detention. Though these five individuals would never interact in their day to day routines, here they are forced to learn about and understand each other for the common purpose of making the best of their oppressive situation and their mutual hate of the hypocritical and authoritative Vice Principal who rules the day with an iron fist. Initially they show hostility to each other, still programed to focus on their differences, even the ways they eat lunch are vastly different, but through some well-written conversations and the more they explore each other's personal lives, the closer they come to realization that they are all the same. All of this sounds extremely cliché and it's a story we have seen in many different manifestations over the years yet somehow, miraculously, everything that transpires in The Breakfast Club feels completely believable, honest and most importantly, original. It is a common phenomenon, usually seen in war situations or prison, where different walks of life are able to work together to ameliorate the time spent together. Friendships are formed hard and fast because there is really no alternative. John Hughes brilliantly applies this concept to an environment that we can all be familiar with. All of the cliques and characters' social images become irrelevant when removed from the harsh gazes of their judgmental and petty peer base. The entire cast is magnificent and I even liked the mysterious and omniscient janitor character that really has no basis for being there other than just an added bonus to appreciate.The film ends with new relationships formed and the five come out the other side as their own new clique. One of the things I like best about The Breakfast Club in retrospect is that there was never a sequel. That would have ruined the ending. We the audience are left with the choice to wonder that, when Monday rolls around, will these 5 be walking into school together proudly hand in hand, or will they snap right back into the preassigned social niches to avoid all of the explaining that would surely need to follow. That's going to tell you about your own outlook on life how you choose to imagine it. I don't feel that this experience is going to seep into their Monday-Friday school days but I like to think that when Bender is sitting in his next two months of detention by himself, he can look forward to some visitors stopping by to keep him company, if only through a window. Or maybe Bender has always been there and always will be, a sort of grungy spirit guide, waiting to shepard each new group that filters through.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Second was a tie between Andy and Brian played by Emilio Estevez and Anthony Michael Hall, but every character was great -even the janitor was great, and Paul Gleason playing Mr. Vernen was good too.

The most realistic (and best) teen movies.,"Based on the lives of five teenagers in high school detention, The Breakfast Club is known to be one of the top movies to come out in the 80s (1985). This drama by John Hughes became a big hit for teenagers as it touched on many real issues teenagers deal with such as mental illness, bullying, and stereotypes to name a few.The character development in this movie is what hits it out of the park. The movie starts off with cookie-cutter stereotypes as characters, but the characters talk and help each other overcome their fears and eventually learn to express themselves how they want to rather than worrying about how they should.The cinematography is so well done in this movie. John Hughes changes the angles constantly during the fast-paced parts but when it comes to parts where the characters are just sitting around, the camera mostly just gets set up in one spot. He does this so watchers understand how the characters are seeing things and so they can be more focused on the dialogue in the important parts where the cameras slow down. This is truly very smart as one of the most important things John Hughes was trying to accomplish was a relatable movie and to do so, the dialogue must be written very well-which it was.My favourite aspect of this movie is the character's clothing. The clothing is very on-brand for the character stereotypes (jock, outcast, prep, etc.) and they have become very iconic looks that have been recreated by many people as Halloween costumes and such. The costumes are also a big visual factor of the characters overcoming themselves and their problems. Because the costumes are very stereotypical of the clique each of them is in, changing clothes is an easy way to show how the characters break from their stereotype.Overall, this is an amazing, quintessential coming-of-age movie for all ages but is especially important and impactful on teenagers who can easily relate to the many issues covered. Both the aesthetic and the script raised the bar for future teen movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Excellent examination of high school social groups,"The Breakfast Club is a look into the social classes of High Schools; it's not another one of those ""main stream teen movies"" that have cheesy comedy scenes and out of the blue romantics.This film shows us the real deal. The side of adolescences that is rarely shared with the world. The characters come from all different back rounds and show us that they are rational, intelligent, and caring. That they are human.Bottom Line: A must see, true to life classic that will make you rethink teens. I would recommend it for anyone who is going into high school, or currently in high school. But it can also be a reminder for those who have long sensed passed the great wasteland that is public schooling.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
