A modern day classic of the western genre,"The western genre is all but dead in Hollywood these days but every now and then a film comes along that reminds us of the genre's potential. The last one was Costner's OPEN RANGE, and this one manages to be even better than that thanks to the central pairing of Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. 3:10 TO YUMA is an actor's film from the off, a powerhouse pairing of two Hollywood stars at the top of their game, who can actually act.Although the rest of the movie is excellent it's these two guys who make it unmissable. Clearly, this isn't some kind of B-movie with black and white characters; Crowe is introduced as the chief villain yet ends up showing a lot more humanity and character than many of the good guys. Bale takes his flawed hero role and runs away with it, turning what could have been a caricature – what with his crippled leg and everything – into a deeply human guy who you just can't stop watching.The plot works really well because it's fast paced. The story is told through action, which is a very difficult thing to achieve – off the top of my head only the BOURNE films and the TERMINATOR films are similarly successful. There are dozens of shoot-outs, things exploding, showdowns and more – all you could expect from a hi-tech western and all expertly choreographed. Yet it's the script, too, which makes the film, creating thoroughly engaging 'quiet' moments just as riveting as all the chases and shooting. My favourite scene is in the run-up to the showdown, set in a hotel's bridal suite, where the assorted characters ponder their fate and decide their futures. It's tremendously suspenseful and edge-of-the-seat viewing material.The supporting cast does a very good job – from an almost unrecognisable Peter Fonda as a grizzled cowboy to Ben Foster as another creepy, hateable bad guy. Director James Mangold has proved himself in the past with the likes of COP LAND and he once again shows that he's a master of his craft, able to deliver a solid, exciting and highly entertaining movie despite the familiarity of both the setting and the set-up. 3:10 TO YUMA is a masterful film and one to be enjoyed over and over.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Seven/Noon,"""The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss. They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than President of the United States forever."" Mark Twain's Adventures of Tom SawyerIn 3:10 to Yuma, a few references to The Magnificent Seven and the idea of a train arriving at a specific time when good and bad guys converge, as in High Noon, made viewing this Glenn Ford remake from 1957 a pleasant one. And right I was but for even more good reasons.Not since Unforgiven and The Quick and the Dead have I been as excited about seeing a Western in its heroic and revisionist forms. 3:10 to Yuma is a true Western in the American film tradition about the 19th-century American West: It has clear heroes and villains (and a mixture of those), wide prairies, dirty towns, fast guns, weak lawmen, cunning murderers, kids on the cusp, and women marginalized, just for starters.Then ratchet up to the philosophical/post modern/post Eastwood reflections on the profession of being a gunman juxtaposed with being a responsible father, and you have an classic angst-filled clash where villain has a wee bit of heart and hero an equal measure of cowardice. Delightfully mix in a certifiable baddie in the Lee Van Cleef/Jack Palance tradition, Ben Foster (Alpha Dog) as Wade's amoral lieutenant Charlie Prince (as in ""of darkness""). Best of all, it is nail-bitingly suspenseful and beautifully photographed.In order to pickup some home-saving cash, poor crippled farmer Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is helping transport murderer Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to court via the 3:10 to Yuma from Bisbee, Arizona. Getting Wade to the station is no easy task, even for the several deputies, because Wade's evil gang is in hot pursuit and more importantly, Wade is psychologically working on them from within, alternately charming and brutal; just imagine his roguish smile behind an extremely fast gun and unscrupulous conscience.It's hard to believe a studio could dump such a winner in the dog days of summer. I will say only that if you have even a modicum of respect for this genre, see 3:10 to Yuma and relive the golden days of straight-up shoot-em ups with rough-hewn characters, electric plot, and revisionist attitude about the romance of being an outlaw or a farmer. Get there on time because that movie train goes fast from the get go.",,Anonymous,Crime
"No western, with courageous sacrifice, can be stunning by accident!","Christian Bale (Dan Evans) holds the screen as an honest rancher who volunteers for two hundred dollars to be part of a doomed group of guards to take the enigmatic bandit and killer Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to a train, the 3:10, leaving Bisbee, Arizona for Yuma prison to trialBeaten down by an old Civil War injury, and unable to protect his farm and his family from Wade's ruthless gang and humiliated by his teenage son (Logan Lerman) who makes no efforts to hide his disappointment in his impoverished father, and who doesn't try to hide the fact that he admires the charismatic criminal, Dan finds a great quantity of reasons to undertake the perilous trip to Contention City to fight back like a real man and regain his son's respect The story concentrates on Evans whose unknown destiny tries to paint to his son an unforgettable picture turning up poignant and endearingWadeleader of a murderous band of robbershad great respect for Dan throughout the film and develops a kind of understanding and appreciation for him Their short scenes in the hotel room celebrate the virtues of two opposite men who stand up for what they believe stopping on issues in relation with family, dignity, virtue, and admirable integrity The best scenes are those in which Wade teases Dan: ""Your conscience is sensitive, Dan.

Don't Miss This Movie,"It's one of the best westerns and best all-around movies I've seen in a long time. That's largely due to the outstanding performances by the cast, ably led by the alpha male, bad guy, Russell Crowe. His protagonist is Christian Bale who turns in a nuanced performance as the down-on-his luck rancher. The scenes between these two men are riveting and a display of acting at its best. The supporting cast are all wonderful and in particular, Ben Foster, Fonda and Logan Lerman as Bale's oldest son.The action is virtually non-stop which makes for a compelling, exciting story. But what really drew me in were the stellar performances, particularly that of Crowe. He is the bad guy you actually might end up rooting for. He goes from charming to deadly and back again all in the blink of an eye. He carries the film on his very able shoulders, but Bale gives him a good run for his money in the acting department.This is one movie that any lover of westerns or anyone simply longing for a good movie with good acting will not want to miss. The two hours will go by in the blink of an eye and you'll be wishing there was more.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Shades of gray.  The measure of a man and what price he is willing to pay for justice,"Being a fan of westerns from a young age, I really wanted to like this movie and I did. I just didn't love it because of a few too many plot holes and inconsistencies. If you are willing to suspend belief and enjoy the ride, it is a very satisfying movie filled with action, suspense and terrific acting showcasing the intricacies of complicated men.As most westerns ultimately are, this was a movie about the measure of a man. When faced with extraordinary circumstances how far will a man go to do the right thing and what price separates good and evil. It is a story of youth with a riveting performance by a young Logan Lerman as a rancher's son who doubts his father's worth and struggles to come to terms with his expectations of what makes a man great and who he will idolize. Being a fan of the TV series Jack and Bobby, it was great seeing Logan again and enjoying his work. He gives a sensitive, nuanced performance and holds his own against some powerhouse acting from Russell Crowe and Christian Bale.Russell is the perfect actor to play Ben Wade bringing a depth and humanity to a character who is established early on as a dangerous, ruthless outlaw. There are indications from the start that Ben isn't your standard villain, and Russell does a great job at showing the shadings in this character while maintaining the threatening nature of Ben Wade. There is a hint of gentleness and sensitivity and even though you suspect childhood damage might have produced a man capable of such evil, you never doubt the viciousness this character is capable of.Christian Bale turns in another intricate portrayal as the rancher, Dan Evans. Slowly the layers and truths of Dan are revealed until he is laid bare, with all his regrets and failings threatening to define him. As a man trying to provide for his family and gain the respect of his older son, he gives a captivating performance as an average man struggling to do what is right while faced with overwhelming obstacles.The interaction between these two fine actors and how their characters end up on the continuum between good and evil is the focus of the movie. 3:10 to Yuma is an interesting merging between the old-fashioned westerns of long ago and the new psychological metaphors of modern movie-making. There are lots of dead bodies littering up the landscape, but the blood and guts movie style of Peckinpah is thankfully missing and we are left with a character study wrapped up in an action, chase flick.Peter Fonda has a wonderful role as a grizzled old bounty hunter and even though I knew he was in the movie it took me forever to recognize him. I kept thinking the character reminded me of Richard Widmark, but perhaps there was a touch of Henry in there too. Alan Tudyk has a nice turn as a quirky doctor and Ben Foster is mesmerizing as the big bad sidekick of Ben Wade. Many will think Ben goes overboard on the characterization, but it was difficult to not watch him as the crazy, vicious killer, Charlie Prince. I think he held back just enough to make the character believable, in an intensely crazed, vicious old-west world.Ultimately the bad guys were more believable to me than the good guys. There were several instances where I wanted to yell at the screen and tell the good guys they were doomed because of their inept actions, but perhaps they just haven't seen as many westerns as I have and didn't realize these bad guys were truly vicious animals and no mercy would be offered.Towards the end is when the stretches of believability most disturbed me and the movie lost some of its sheen. I just didn't buy all the contrivances they threw at me and for me, that made the ending less than satisfying. My sister, on the other hand, loved the ending and was actually crying, but don't let the crying scare you off. She tends to get overly emotional when she buys into the story and she had no problem suspending belief and taking the ride they offered.If you love westerns as I do, then you owe it to yourself to support this western at the theater in hopes the box office receipts will encourage more westerns to be produced. If you enjoy great acting and character development and the wider framework of what makes a man a hero and what forces drive a man to despair then this movie provides ample fuel for further discussion.3:10 to Yuma could have been a great movie if they would have cleaned up some of the plot holes and reined in the ending, but all in all, it was a nice time at the movies and it certainly offered up some lively discussion afterward. The entire cast was stunningly good, the movie was beautifully photographed and the direction kept it moving at a good pace with no lulls or boring moments.It offers a glance back at the old-time westerns with a few nice improvements. Even if you don't normally appreciate westerns, the acting and action should be enough to make the time spent enjoyable. And if you never appreciated westerns before then maybe it will be enough to make you want to check out some of the greats like High Noon and The Searchers. Westerns have always been a fertile ground for examining the complexities of man, what makes a man great, and the shades of gray that resides in all of us.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Let's be real...,"OK so no one in this entire group of Pinkertons thinks to gag and restrain/ tie up Villain Ben the most dangerous outlaw in the area? He starts playing psychological warfare at a campfire the first night they have him and he continues it all the way to Yuma. Nobody gags him. Come on, let's be real.

A Modern Classic,"This is the best western since Unforgiven. Every aspect of this film is great.The acting was superb. Russell Crowe continues to give great and much overlooked performances. He delivers a great performance as outlaw Ben Wade. Crowe just keeps on putting me in shock with his spectacular performances. Crowe brought a mystique to his role that would of fit in with the old westerns. He seems as if he play anything and was a joy to watch here. He needs to be given much more and was definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination. Christain Bale also gives as a surprise to me a great performance as Dan Evans. He is on the verge of losing everything he's got. Bale displays his desperation and his willingness to feel that he has a purpose in life. He is definitely turning into a very good all around actor. I think he also deserved an Oscar nomination. Peter Fonda and Ben Foster also give very solid performances in their supporting roles.I have heard some people say that this western was to talky but I don't believe so. I think this was filled with great dialog and was engaging for the length of the movie.The directing by James Mangold was probably the best I have seen from him. He was able to bring back the old western style but yet mix it together with a modern effects and etc. He did not fall into the trap of making it boring or to violent. He carried the movie all the way through keeping the viewer entertained. The cinematography was amazing. The sceneries were spectacular and many of the shooting scenes were delivered with such excellence with the acting, directing but the cinematography brought those scenes and this movie to another level. The music was great as well. It did not become cliché but instead made you feel like you were back watching Clint Eastwood, Gary Cooper or John Wayne. It just captured me like no other western has in a while.This movie is truly a modern classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Thoroughly Enjoyable Remake of a Classic Western,"Long ago, I saw the original 3:10 to Yuma featuring Van Heflin and Glen Ford, but I don't remember it well enough to compare it with James Mangold's new remake. Instead, my review will focus exclusively on the new film.Mangold's film is a tense, traditional western based on an Elmore Leonard story. Leonard is a solid writer, and gave the material upon which the film is based enough background and characterization to permit willful suspension of disbelief. Mangold's film does the same. Our protagonist and antagonist are, respectively, Dan Evans (Bale) and Ben Wade (Crowe). Evans is a would-be rancher and family-man whose family is suffering from a drought and a merciless landlord. Evans and his boys cross paths with notorious outlaw Ben Wade and his gang on their way into town to confront their landlord, and Wade whimsically lets them go. But the connection between these two men and Dan's eldest son is far from over. Eventually Dan will accept an offer made by a railroad agent to help escort Wade to a train headed to Yuma prison, while Wade's crew of murderers dogs their every step.Two performances stood out for me - Bale and Ben Foster (Charlie Prince). Crowe was good, but it's not clear that he engaged with his role with his usual intensity. There are several very talented actors in supporting roles, and they each pull off the transition to the western genre quite nicely (Alan Tudyk, Logan Lerman, Gretchen Mol, Peter Fonda and others). The film showcases the acting talent very well without losing sight of its straightforward but interesting story.More often than not, good westerns are at least as much character studies as they are 'shoot-em-ups'. After all, it pretty close to impossible to enjoy a film in which anybody might drop dead at any given time without caring about the people you are watching die, or those doing the killing. Mangold achieves this by drawing on the simple strengths of the original material and allowing relationships to dominate both the story's development and the cinematography. For a western, there is a tremendous amount of dialog in this film, coupled with the usual meaningful stares. Wade is so wily and unpredictable that you really never know what to expect out of him, and his crew is headed up by his loyal and equally nihilistic protégé Charlie Prince. Dan Evans is his polar opposite, and Dan's son is an unusually accurate and complex Hollywood portrayal of a teenager. These and other relationships are the strengths and the medium of the film. When the camera isn't being used to build tension before a battle or showing us a gun-fight, it is establishing relationships and character. And many of the characters and relationships we see are surprising, ambiguous and more than a little ironic.Highly recommended for western fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great film,"Just saw a screening of this movie in New York. Amazing. Bale continues to prove that he is quickly becoming one of the best lead actors out there. Crowe exudes cool throughout the movie as a heartless, smooth talking, Bible quoting killer. Of course...Ben Foster. Yes. Ben Foster. Welcome him to the bigtime, cause he made this movie. There hasn't been a western with a character so badass as the one Ben Foster plays in this movie. Story-wise, the movie is an opposite Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, with the good guys trying to run away from the bad guys in order to make a 3:10 train to Yuma. What ensues is an awesome movie you wanna watch till the last battle.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Who knew that an Austrailian and a Brit can make such great cowboys?,"I know this has been brought up before, but it was such a question with me on how they picked Russell Crowe and Christian Bale to be American cowboys? But then I saw 3:10 to Yuma this afternoon, to be honest, I don't know who could have done a better job! Christian and Russell clicked so well and brought together an awesome western film, probably the best since Unforgiven. James Mangold captured the perfect feeling of a classic western film and brought together this great cast. This is one of the first films of the summer that I'm giving a perfect 10 rating, I couldn't find one complaint about 3:10 to Yuma. The casting, the picture, the whole surrounding of the film was just incredible. To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if this is going to be nominated for a couple Oscars.Ben Wade is an outlaw killer/thief who is on the run with his gang, but he is captured one day. The problem is that he has a reputation for being the fastest gun swinger in the West, so the policemen ask a man, Dan Evans if he brings him to the 3:10 prisoner train to Yuma for two hundred dollars. One problem, Ben's gang wants him back and will chase him, his son, Doc, and Butterfield throughout the West. Ben is just charming his way through the journey, Dan's son, William, is convinced that maybe Ben isn't all that bad, but Dan knows better and is willing to do anything to get Ben onto that train.3:10 to Yuma is one of the year's best, to be honest, I'm thinking about the films this past year, and I would probably rank this as the number one movie. I was never really into western movies, except for the good, the bad, and the ugly, and unforgiven, but 3:10 to Yuma is a guaranteed classic. I am very much recommending this film to anyone, even those who are not into the Western films, because this is just all together a terrific film. The script, the acting, the picture, the look, 3:10 to Yuma is a fantastic film that should not be missed.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
James Mangold's only western and it rules,"They don't make a lot of different types of films anymore but 3:10 to Yuma is the kind of star driven, R rated, old fashioned western that's sorely missed these days. All the tropes are executed brilliantly and infused with a more modern technical craft. Even if a lot of the film shows the extreme lengths people will go to for money it's still a very earnest film overall, believing that there are truly good people who will do what's right no matter the odds.Everyone here is on top form. Christian Bale brings so much empathy and resilience with an unwavering heroism so you understand why he never backs down, made better because it's not for selfish reasons. Russell Crowe has an endless supply of charisma and the conversations he has with Bale are so good because they're clearly discovering a muted respect for each other even as they disagree on so much.Considering the archetype he's playing, you'd expect Logan Lerman to be a lot more annoying than he is and it's a testament to the writing and his performance that he never becomes grating even as he puts himself in danger. This is one of the best uses of Alan Tudyk in live action as well as a prime example of how good Ben Foster can be in one of his many extremely villainous supporting roles.As someone who has spent a significant portion of their career making metaphorical westerns, James Mangold is the perfect director to make an actual one. His direction is fantastic, starting with the biggest action sequence almost instantly and then never letting up afterwards. Marco Beltrami's music is a quintessential western score. It pings, twangs and whistles through the film and then culminates with a real sense of triumph.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Western,"I, too, saw a preview (at a press screening) and truly enjoyed the film. The performances ooze class, charisma and depth and for someone who is not so into Westerns I found myself lured into this tale of complex morality. Crowe is especially dashing in the film as a truly bad man who we want to believe to ultimately be good. He is really quite incredible and delivers such a complex performance, with complete ease. However none of the performances lack, not Bale's, not Foster's, not Fonda's. There is really an old school Western here, with a modern edge to it. 3:10 to Yuma is also quite stunning when it comes to cinematography and set design, but these elements merely help tell the story, they do not distract from it. It's definitely worth seeing. James Mangold (Walk the Line) is definitely a very talented director. I have this a 7 because I'm a film critic and am tough, but I think fans of the genre will likely rate it higher.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
really really great story and awesome casting.,"This movie was done so well. It felt like you were actually part of this culture and brought back into time. I love the realism. Sometimes these movies makes shooting again and hitting target so easy lots and lots of misses which is reality especially when you're shooting from something moving or trying to shoot someone who's running, etc. The story was really, really neat, and it really defines the definition of an outlaw.

High Noon,"This is a solid western start-to-finish.James Mangold delivers an intense and well-paced tale with a talented cast, and though the story doesn't reinvent the genre (or break out of any tropes) it delivers the story beats well, with excellent payoffs and a grittiness powered by the acting of an A-list class.Christian Bale and Russel Crowe are the show-stealers as Dan Evans and Ben Wade respectively. Two men that are on polar opposites of the morality spectrum, yet are brought together by the film's circumstance and discover there may be more to each other than they initially thought.The movie is good throughout, with little downtime and plenty of character work, action, set pieces, and moments for the actors to shine. This isn't a film that will have you yawning or waiting for the next big action scene. Mangold makes sure of that.But he also allows the characters to breathe, and we get a glimpse into the minds of someone like Ben Wade. What drives him. What makes him tick.It's an easy recommend, and that comes from someone who isn't a huge western fan.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
How I Miss Frankie Laine,"It seems as though back in the fifties every other western seemed to have Frankie Laine singing the theme song. The 1957 version of 3:10 to Yuma is one of my favorite westerns. Part of the reason is that theme which echoed through out the film.What I liked about 3:10 to Yuma is that the hero/protagonist is an ordinary man trying to support his wife and two sons through some very hard times. When a killer is caught and because he needs the money he agrees to help transport him to Yuma State Prison on the 3:10 train from Contention. A lot happens between the capture and the boarding of that fateful train.Russell Crowe and Christian Bale make admirable updated substitutes for Glenn Ford and Van Heflin. Though Ford's performance as the sly rogue of a gunman is good, the previous film was driven by what I always considered Van Heflin's greatest screen role.The original holdup was hardly the violent affair that this one was. Only one shot was fired and that was by Ford when the shotgun guard momentarily overpowered one of the gang. That's here too, but the holdup itself was taken from The War Wagon.One part was totally eliminated and that was the part of the town drunk, played by Henry Jones in the original version, who was the only other man to volunteer his services. Jones was killed in a gut wrenching scene then, but in fact my favorite scene from the original was when Heflin's wife Leora Dana pleads with him to let Ford go, he responds with a heartfelt speech about how he couldn't look himself in the face after the sacrifice the town drunk made. I've seen the 1957 version dozens of times and am never failed to be moved by that scene.In its place the part of the oldest son is built up and conversely the wife's part is cut down. Young Logan Lerman plays the older son who tags along after the group taking Crowe to Contention. Lerman is 14 and he and Bale have the usual father/son issues. Lerman feels his Dad to be a failure with things going so wrong against them. Bale and he bond during the shared experience and you know no matter what the outcome of things, he'll leave a good legacy for his children.The usual tension between Bale and Crowe is present as it was in the original when Ford kept trying to bribe Heflin. Added to this is a whole lot of violence, most of it started by Ben Foster who's part as the young punk outlaw in the original was played by Richard Jaeckel. Foster is one murderous thug in this film, only Crowe is able to keep him somewhat in line.The characterization is still there, the violence is expected in this day and age even though a lot of it is gratuitous. This version of 3:10 to Yuma is fine, but it can never take the place of the original in my affections.This review is dedicated to young Harve Stewart of Stephenville, Texas and one of the Professional Bull Riders best young stars. I saw an interview with him where he mentions this is a film he likes. I liked it too, but I would commend him to watch the original 3:10 To Yuma which is just one of the best western dramas ever made. It was out in 1957 and I was 10 years old at the time. I'm old enough to be Harve's grandfather and I'm sure back in the day 3:10 To Yuma was enjoyed by his real grandparents in the theater.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Doesn't totally play to all its potential strengths but is still a very good modern western with solid delivery across the board,"Dan Evans is a struggling rancher being pushed off his land by men he dare not stand up to. An amputee from his part in the war, Evans longs for the respect of his sons, but all they see is his refusal to take up arms for his land. Evans is in town to try and reason with the landowner for more time to pay off his debts when he stumbles across outlaw Ben Wade in a bar with his guard down. Wade is captured and a posse is put together to transport Wade while a decoy draws off his gang. With the money and the moral aspect, Evans joins the posse and sets out, with the time pressure on them from the very start.I missed this film at the cinema but I did want to see it as I had greatly enjoyed the original and had indeed commented in that review that the film would work if done well in any setting, so I figured the remake could work as well. The simplicity attracted me to the original and this remake, for all its Hollywood production values, is still a solid and simple tale. The heart of the film is the battle between good and evil as it occurs both between Evans and Wade but also within Evans himself. This comes out best in the final scenes (the waiting for the train is a smaller part of the film than the original) and it did make me wish that more had been made of this. However, what makes up the majority of the film does still mine this theme, albeit not as effectively because of the sense of space and action tending to take away from the pressure cooker of the hotel room with the ticking clock.IMDb currently has this within the top 250 films ever made, which needless to say I disagree with but will say that it is a strong modern western and a very engaging film all round. Director Mangold does a sterling job of keeping the material the focus and succeeds in making the climax very tense, even if he cannot drag it across the whole film. I did like the way that the film is restrained in regards the cinematography; too often westerns will feel obligated to have sweeping landscapes and make the most of them just because it is what the genre does. Here though the locations are impressive without ever being forced onto the viewer as if they were the focus  Mangold and his crew keep the focus tighter and the characters don't get lost in wide shots.The cast is one of the main draws for the modern viewer, with the star pairing being a big selling point. Crowe is a solid Wade but I never felt like he was doing more than playing the character rather than totally being it. Bale on the other hand is much more convincing and this did make it work very well. The two men do play off one another really well and again it just added to my desire that the film had allowed them more time with just the two of them and a ticking clock. Lerman is a device character but he works well within the demands of the script. Foster enjoys a simple but memorable character by being simply evil throughout. Support is solid as well with some good turns from people such as Mol, Fonda and others.Overall then a solid and enjoyable western. The things that made the original so strong are not quite as well delivered here but they are still present, with strong delivery across all aspects making for a very good, but not brilliant film.",,Anonymous,Crime

"A Solid Modern Western With Incredible Performances By Russell Crowe And Christian Bale, But It Suffers From Wayward Screenplay","Pros:
1. The score, specifically the violin plucking and the acoustic guitar strumming, helps to harden the tension.
2. Russell Crowe (Ben Wade), as a cold, calculating serial killer and Christian Bale (Dan Evans) as a stoic and determined husband and father, deliver fantastic performances.
3. The violence is gritty and uncompromising, particularly as the unwavering close-ups force you to take it all in.
4. The editing adds a lot of vibrancy and kinetic energy to the action scenes.
5. The brilliant costume design mirrors the differing personalities and socio-economic statuses. For example, Ben Wades' illustrates his darkness and proclivity for style and flashiness, whilst Dan Evans' demonstrates his poor, dogged and plain sensibilities.
6. The cinematography, especially for the action scenes, is great. It does a good job of mixing between close-ups and shaky cam to slow and quicken the pace when needed.Cons:
1. There are a couple plot inconsistencies and illogical happenings: A) In the beginning heist scene, why does Ben Wade send four of his men to die, when he could have just used the cattle - as he ended up doing? B) After the heist, Ben Wade and his gang leave Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda) alive even though it's established that they hate having loose ends.
2. Most of the characters are not well fleshed out at all, so a lot of their deaths feel empty and hollow.
3. The score is at times needlessly overused.
4. The film never explains why Ben Wade was so careless in the beginning by getting himself caught, or why he only tried to escape once on the trek to the 3:10 train to Yuma.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A solid western remake,"This western, a remake of a 1957 film, is centred on two men. One is honest rancher, Dan Evans, a man who is in financial trouble and fears losing his ranch and letting down his family. The second is Ben Wade, the leader of a band of gangsters, who is captured after a raid on a stagecoach carrying railway wages. Needing the money, Evans volunteers to be part of the group escorting Wade to the town of Contention where he is to be put on the 3:10 train to Yuma. It won't be an easy journey; they will pass through territory occupied by renegade Apaches and have to face members of Wade's well-armed gang who are determined to set him free.Having enjoyed the 1957 version of the film I was interested to see how this would compare... I think it compares well. The story might be relatively simple but that doesn't lessen the film. It provides several impressive action set pieces; from the stage coach robbery at the start to the gunfight in Contention as Wade's gang try to stop Evans getting him to the train. Despite the impressive action it often feels character driven as we learn more about Evans and Wade. Both are interesting although Wade is slightly more so as there is a degree of ambiguity about the character... he is an unapologetic villain but can be kind at times. The cast is impressive; particularly Russell Crowe and Cristian Bale who are on great form as Wade and Evans. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody who enjoys westerns.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Russell Crowe's fine western flick that i was blown away,"3:10 to Yuma (2007) it is a fine western film from Russell Crowe and Christian Bale directed by James Mangold. It is a remake of the 1957 film of the same name, making it the second adaptation of Elmore Leonard's short story ""Three-Ten to Yuma"". Filming took place in various locations in New Mexico. 3:10 to Yuma opened September 7, 2007, in the United States and received positive reviews from critics.I am big fan of Russell Crowe and I love his movies and this was his second western film he did. The first one was in 1995 The Quick and the Dead with Sharon Stone which is definitely one of my favorite western films. I love Clint Eastwood western films such a: A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Pale Rider, High Plains Drifter, The Outlaw Josey Wales. I love Young Guns, Tombstone, I already mentioned The Quick and the Dead, 3:10 to Yuma is also one of my favorite western films today.This movie is about so many things. Good and Evil (or right and wrong) and the blurry line that sometimes separates them, what drives a man toward one or the other. It's about desperation and self-preservation. Ben Wade is a criminal who from the first moment in the story we see has redeeming qualities, and as many criminals, he is also charming. Dan Evans is a good man, who comes close more than once to crossing that blurry line, out of desperation. There is Evan's boy, who is in a position to choose a hero (there are no heroes in this film). There is a lot at stake for both ""sides"" in this movie. While there are some negative opinions about the ending, I don't think it would have been satisfactory any other way.The pacing is good, the movie goes fast around it is not boring or overlong, the acting from everyone is solid, the action is good. I like the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. I must say Russell Crow is a talented actor and his movies are really good of course he is not great like is Keanu Reeves but he is way better than fat pig Arnold today. I love the characters in this movie and the chemistry between two leads (Crowe and Bale).3:10 to Yuma is a good western movie some say it is a classic I don't think it is, but it is close to a classic. We have a lots of shootouts and of course a real explosions. Ben Wade and Dan Evens are fine characters to watch, we have Peter Fonda as a bounty hunter Byron McElroy. This was a damn good western movie and I wish they would make more movies like are this one today. I hated Django Unchained to death I thought that movie sucked a hairy dick but this movie was a fine western that I was blown away.I had no clue this was even up for Oscar nominations. But, I can certainly see why with such a competent script, great storytelling, and even greater characters played impeccably by Bale and Crowe. I particularly enjoyed watching the chemistry that grew between them as the film progressed, which was elaborated upon even better due to their opposing personalities (Evans being the giver, and Wade being the taker). In fact, there were many a scene that I'd like to say I found thoroughly heroic and almost inspiring, in a sort of bittersweet retrospect, but at the expense of not ruining some of the more dramatic plot twists, I'll leave the viewing to you, the audience. The film presents a terrific balance of action, drama, and character development, all while being very realistic to the old west in terms of design and production. Aesthetically speaking, I'd probably go so far as to call it the best looking Western to date. Critically, I'd almost put it as one of my all-time favorite films, but I thought the overall length was just a tad too short for all the material to really stick with me by film's end.The rating I give to this film is 8/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD western film (it is sure as hell better than all the remakes like Django Unchained that get high scores) needs their head examined. I give it another point because what it does attempt to do it accomplishes so easily and perfectly. (For reference, I gave Eastwood movies a ten.) Any true weakness it has is simply that it's just an western movie, and that's it. It's hard to say anything bad (other than nitpicks) about the film itself.3:10 to Yuma is a 2007 American Western film directed by James Mangold and produced by Cathy Konrad, and starring Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in the lead roles, with supporting performances by Peter Fonda, Gretchen Mol, Ben Foster, Dallas Roberts, Alan Tudyk, Vinessa Shaw, and Logan Lerman.

Watch this if you love Crowe. Don't if you value good film.,"This film represents how lifeless contemporary film is, and shows Crowe as an idol for the foolish male viewer wanting to feel in control.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
The original story is fairly straightforward, where this decides to perform an upgrade. It fails. Terribly.I was nearly sick when Crowe just seduces a woman without a whim, like the way he just utters one liners and shoots fast. Empty. Hollow.I won't fault the goal of adding (meaningful) sub-plots, personal details, and even a better viewing experience.But Hollowood only know how to do one thing - sell tickets - money. Crowe and guns with a little ""hanky panky."" People will buy anything.Was it any different in 1940's - 1960's? Yes (and no), because actors weren't worth billions upon billions AND the advertising industry
had yet to sink its poison into story. Money and the making of actors into gods has ruined good storytelling through film. This is a model.ACTING:
I have a strong bias against Crowe but towards Bale, the former always portrayed as the tough-guy hunk (sans ""A Beautiful Mind"").The latter, capable of a wide range of roles, some of which are not always the macho man, e.g. ""Vice.""But the whole cast (including kids) were lacking in authentic expression and creative human behavior. Everyone's costume just too
clean and good looking. The cliche characters, the meaningless lines, and the endless drumbeat of testosterone were just empty.TEMPO:
OK, but it's like a stop / start pace.CINEMATOGRAPHY:
They did a decent job, but the emphasis was probably on guns and explosions - not the beauty of the geography.DIRECTING / WRITING:
""Made-for-TV"" was a central criterion for being hired onto this production crew, or so it would seem given the resumes.Even if it were not so, this smells of the usual formulaic silliness (yes, that was present even in the 1940's and 50's).It's just that contemporary films don't feel like the product of human effort, but more the outcome of a digital algorithm.Is it a good film? No.Should you watch this once? Yes, if you like Crowe, and guns.Rating: 6.0.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A so-so movie elevated by the fine performances of Christian Bale and Russell Crowe.,"I haven't seen the original 1957 version, but this movie is okay.James Mangold's direction is sometimes good, sometimes bad, but it works well enough. It reminded me of Antoine Fuqua's remake of The Magnificent Seven: action scenes with lots of shaky cam, but at least it's more comprehensible than Michael Bay.Christian Bale is by far the best part of the movie, his character is complex and flawed, which makes him charismatic. Russell Crowe, on the other hand, starts off a bit generic, but gains layers as the movie goes on. The chemistry between the two is literally the pillar that sustains this movie from start to finish.By far the worst thing about the movie is the script. The characters are complete idiots and make the kind of choices that make us curse the protagonists of horror movies... however, unlike most people, I liked the ending. I thought it was basically the only genuinely original and memorable thing in the whole movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
I LOVE WESTERNS and this one didn't disappoint.,"This film, 3:10 to Yuma, is a classic. It is a remake of a 1957 film of the same name. I saw the 1957 version as a kid and haven't seen it in many, many years. This remake is about a gang of stagecoach & bank robbers. The leader, Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) gets captured, and his gang are determined to free him. The lawmen are outnumbered and offer a reward to get Wade on the 3:10 train to Yuma, which is a jail train. Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is a small-time rancher who is on the verge of losing his ranch to the railroad. He is desperately in need of the reward money, so he signs up for the job. The ending is sad and that is the only thing wrong with the film. There is limited foul language, NO sex scenes, and the bang, bang, shoot-em ups are limited. Those are the 3 things wrong with most films today. This film got it right!It seems that many of the films out now feel the need to ""F... you"" at least once a minute, if not more often. They also use nudity and sex scenes that don't do anything for the story lines. And they try to out-do each other in shock-value, with outlandish blow-ups or shoot-outs. I just turn these types of films off. I am interested in films that capture character and develop their characters well. Great scenery is a plus. If I wanted foul language and nudity, I would order porn.This film is very well made. Without the 3 things that make for bad films, in my opinion. I'm a 65+ Y/O female who spent 24 years in the military so I'm no prude, I just feel that those things make for poor films. Directors who use those things in their films are not very good filmmakers. They have no imagination, don't know how to develop a story so they pack it with shock-value of sex, foul language, and big bangs so they don't have to try to develop characters.Thanks for a great western film. Please make more like this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Formidable remake full of action , violence  and fabulous performances","This first-rate adult Western draws its fascinating drama and power from the interaction of fine drawn characters as well as the gun-blazing action. It concerns about a needy farmer (Christian Bale in the role of Van Heflin )with wife (Gretchen Mol in the Felicia Far's character ) and two sons. He's witness as a dangerous gang (Ben Foster, among others) led by notorious gunfighter named Ben Wade ( Russell Crowe in the character of Glenn Ford) attacks a stagecoach and killing the passengers. Later Ben separates from his band and he goes to a Saloon where meet with gorgeous Emma (Vinessa Shaw). But the sheriff immediately surrounds the parlour and captures Ben. Railroad official(Dallas Roberts) asks for paid volunteers to join a posse to transport Ben Wade towards Yuma and Dan accepts. Other volunteers who unite posse are Doc Potter( Alan Tudyk), Tucker (Kevin Durand) and a veteran(Peter Fonda). After that and numerous dangers Dan Evans must hole up in a Motel while waiting for the train to take them to Yuma prison and overcome the murderer's several ploys to gain his freedom.Good modern Western with exciting battle of wits between an obstinate farmer and an astute killer who begins to psych him out. Stylish, fast paced , solid, meticulous and violent look with several shootouts. This well acted movie is gripping every step of the way and recalls the classic directed by Delmer Daves though contains various changes, as excessive violence and a little bit overlong because the runtime first version is only 92 minutes. Based on a short story by Elmore Leonard. He's a veteran novelist and screenwriter , specialist on noir plot and Western and working from ¨Tall T¨, ¨Hombre¨, continuing with ¨Rosemary murders¨, ¨Get shorty¨, ¨Jackie Brown¨ until nowadays. Colorful and evocative cinematography by Papamichael. Memorable musical score fitting rightly to action Western by Marco Beltrani. The motion picture is stunningly directed by James Mangold (Walk the line, Identity, Cop land) who is preparing another Western-remake titled ¨Wichita¨in pre-production.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not always logical or probable, but the acting makes it a must see.","This modernized second adaptation of the Elmore Leonard short story stars the reliable pair of Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. Bale plays Dan Evans, a Civil War veteran turned rancher who's going through some difficult times. He's deeply in debt, so he seizes upon a chance to make some money. The job is to watch over a notorious outlaw, Ben Wade (Crowe), and eventually help to escort him through the desert, so he can make it to a train depot and thus be transported to prison. The outlaw, however, has other ideas in mind, and does his best to mess with the ranchers' head, while his scruffy gang relentlessly pursues the posse.The 2007 version of ""3:10 to Yuma"" may not always make sense (some reviews have pointed out admitted holes in the plot), but technically it's wonderfully made, and in some ways it has the feel of a classic Western. The widescreen photography is beautiful, and the location shooting (mostly in New Mexico) likewise impresses. Director James Mangold does a fine job telling an entertaining and riveting story, succeeding at maintaining viewer interest for the better part of two hours.The primary asset is a well chosen and exemplary cast. A charismatic Crowe and sincere Bale offer low key, nicely nuanced performances; Wade may be a bad man, but you can't help but like him to some degree. Evans, who's stuck with a sullen teenage son (Logan Lerman) who doesn't respect him, feels the need to prove himself worthy. The women, Gretchen Mol and Vinessa Shaw, end up with very little to do, unfortunately, but actors such as Peter Fonda, Dallas Roberts, Kevin Durand, and Alan Tudyk are a pleasure to watch. But it's Ben Foster who tends to steal the show in his role & performance as Charlie Prince, the most ruthless member of Wades' gang.Best recommended to fans of the actors involved.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Anyone else find this story impossible to buy???,"Well, I have never seen the original version of this film, but I trust it was more convincing than this. As a true western lover, I may have had expectations that were too high, but this movie didn't manage to win me over. The action is very well done, particularly the early stage robbery, and the characters are initially good, though Crowe's scripture-spouting evil superman-like outlaw leader never really rang true for me. This started out as a mild, nagging irritant that grew as the story unfolded. Crowe and Bale's performances are very good, and Ben Foster is good as 'Hand of God' (Great name) gunslinger, Charlie Prince, though his character is never developed beyond the superficial level. The story starts out strong but gradually lost me until its ending turned ludicrous and had me looking around to see the reaction of the rest of the crowd, but they appeared to be surprisingly engrossed in the silliness on screen.The story is about two men, the first of whom is Dan Evans (Christian Bale), whose ranch is being strangled by a greedy businessman. the second is an arrogant outlaw leader named Ben Wade, who Evans sees leading an attack on a heavily armed stagecoach. Shortly, the stunningly reckless Wade is easily captured. A plan is hatched to move him to a nearby railroad town and send him to Yuma Penitentiary, but Wade's gang presents a problem. Evans offers to join the transporting posse, in return for much-needed cash and the story is set. Some kind of Old West-style Stockholm Syndrome sets in and the rest....well, i don't want to blow the rest, but be careful not to give it any sort of thought.There is some excellent, and original (particularly impressive in this genre) action and this backed up by some interesting characters, but Crowe's characters' actions are so far-fetched, that the whole story collapses and will likely leave all, but the action crowd unsatisfied.This work was first published on realmoviereview.com",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

How great is it to have a movie with financial backing because holy cow the views in this movie are phenomenal. Stage designs, character, outfits, everything was top-tier.

A solid western.,"It's a remake of a 50s classic, so the overdramatic theme and plot were to be expected. There are some pretty interesting scenes and plenty of well-written characters (although the bit with Luke Wilson seemed a bit too goofy in my opinion). The theme is somewhat stupid; it seems like the main character is destined to lose in life because of old war injuries and has trouble making his ranch work. This leads to his wife and son openly despising him and his son respecting a murdering outlaw more than his own father. That aspect is mostly annoying, with a whiny teenager weighing down the better tracking and gunslinging parts.

Crowe needs slightly more menace. Foster is also terrific. The great thing about this movie is the murky morality of everybody. It's not just simple good and bad. Wade is not the stereotypical villain. Dan Evans is not just a straight forward white hat. He's stubborn but he's no hero in his regular life.

A Western Worth Watching,"Based on ""Three-Ten to Yuma"": 1953, A Short Story by Elmore Leonard as well as inspired by Delmer Daves 1957 film adaptation 3:10 to Yuma, James Mangold re-sets the western scene, to tell the 21st Century's version of the story.Civil War veteran and small-time rancher Dan Evans decides to escort Ben Wade, an outlaw, for a paltry sum of 200 dollars to regain his lost honour and retrieve his barn from Glen Hollander.Nominated twice at the 2008 Academy Awards for its sound mixing and original score, director James Mangold ensured thrill, suspense and ever-growing tension were implemented into 2007's 3:10 to Yuma as core values of the spectacle, to entice its audience through the slow-building 122 minutes. Minimal dialogue focusses attention on finer details such as: the classy application of music, the use of setting in recreating a flawless image of 19th century Arizona and, most importantly, the skill of Mangold's camerawork, in pioneering scenes of grit and violence to contribute to the ruthless and brutal plot of the film.Russell Crowe stars alongside Christian Bale as protagonist and antagonist in what proves to display the pair's sensational acting versatility, as well as their ability to manipulate spectators. Crowe's character Ben Wade is monstrous, a man who has murdered numerous innocent people, though we, as viewers, find ourselves unintentionally rooting for his freedom, in-turn, exposing our guilt. Equally, Bale's portrayal of Dan Evans radiates the desperation of a man determined and willing to do anything to provide for his family. Though we should only sympathise with the one character, we begrudgingly see both as likeable.A film that keeps you on edge throughout, its exceptional cinematography, intelligent writing and incredible acting performances rank 3:10 to Yuma as one of the all time Western greats.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"When you think about it, which I have been lately, is they weren't paying me to walk away. They were paying me so they could walk away.","3:10 to Yuma is directed by James Mangold and co-adapted to screenplay by Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas. A remake of Delmer Daves' 1957 film of the same name, it's based on a story written by Elmore Leonard. It stars Russell Crowe, Christian Bale, Peter Fonda, Ben Foster and Logan Lerman. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Phedon Papamichael.After the capture of notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe), a posse is put together to escort him to the town of Contention from where he will be put on the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. Joining this posse is broke rancher Dan Evans (Bale), disabled in the Civil War, Dan is struggling to keep hold of his land and to support his family. Seen as a flop in the eyes of his eldest son William (Lerman), Dan sees this opportunity as a way out of his problems. But with Wade an intelligent foe, and the outlaw boss' gang on their trail, Evans and the posse will do well to make it to Contention alive...Daves' original film is a fine effort, very much pulsing with psychological beats and cloaked in claustrophobic atmospherics. Backed up by two excellent Western performers in Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, there is many a Western fan who cherish it and never felt it was a genre piece ripe for a remake; myself included. But the logic behind the reasons Mangold and his team put forward for remaking it made sense. A story of great thematics for the adults, and action a go-go for the younger modern film fan. Thus putting a Western back in the headlines at yet another time when the genre was gasping for air. All that was left to do was get two of the modern era's biggest stars to play Wade and Evans - which of course they duly did - and it was good to go. Just don't mess it up was all that was asked of the makers.Running at nearly half an hour longer than the original, Mangold's movie slots in a new mid-section and changes the ending. The former works a treat as the posse venture through hostile Apache country, meet some ne'er-do-well railroad ruffians, while Wade's gang, led by the supremely fiendish Charlie Prince (Foster), are on the bloody trail. The latter is a huge misstep, both in execution and character development. Most film fans are happy to suspend disbelief in the name of good entertainment, but here we are asked to ignore some impossible athletics while also being asked to swallow a character turn around that beggars belief. Such a shame because up till then the blend of traditional Western character themes such as morality and redemption had dovetailed nicely with the pistol banging and all round breezy action construction. While the father and son axis also gives the narrative some extra bite.Even bad guys love their mothers.The performances are also of a high standard. In the support slots Fonda, Foster and Lerman are top dollar. Fonda is all leather faced and gruff as bounty hunter McElroy, Foster does a quality line in sneering villainy, and Lerman, in a tricky role, utterly convinces as the conflicted boy breaking out into a man. But this is Crowe and Bale's movie. Crowe has Wade as an intelligent dandy, a man who loves and understands women, an artist who also has a tongue as quick as his hands are on his guns. We know that Wade is callous, but Crowe ensures that we never know what is around the corner or truly on his mind. Bale puts much dignity into Evans, he's a put upon man, tortured by his failings on the home front, but there is stoic nobility there and as he and Wade venture further on their journey, a grudging respect begins to form and Bale and Crowe really start to put credibility into their characters. And then that last quarter nearly undoes all their excellent work...In spite of this, 3:10 to Yuma is a good time to be had as a modern Western production with old traditional values. Energetic and never dull from first frame to last, it's recommended on proviso you don't mind unscrewing your head and taking out your brain for the last 15 minutes. 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Magnetically Wicked,"Crowe's portrayal of the wicked protagonist Ben Wade intrigues the viewer with the intensity of his evil deeds, the provocativeness of his philosophical musings, and later in the film, with some glimmering traces of human compassion and justice. Christian Bale gives a gritty and sympathetic performance as always. It should surprise no one to see Crowe get another nomination for best actor for this Brando-level performance that brings to mind the likes of ""One-Eyed Jacks"" and ""The Appaloosa"". You see some interesting themes such as Ben Wade's sexist views of women and the Father-son conflicts of Christian Bale and his 14 year old son for whom he yearns to win back respect and dignity. But, ultimately the film is about atonement --- about men who fail miserably in life yet are given one last chance to atone.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

That ending!!!!!!! (NO SPOILERS),"At first I was thinking that it might not be as good as I was hoping for. The opening scene contained way to many close ups for my taste as well, but by the time the end credits rolled I was thinking it was even better than I had expected.If you've seen the original, things are pretty much the same except this one is a bit more violent and darker overall, and lets just say the ending isn't the same lolBut what a ending it is!There's good performances all around, though I'm not sure Ben Foster(is that his name) is as good as a lot of the reviews are claiming. Or maybe its just that he didn't play the part like I pictured it from the reviews. I pictured a crazed quick talking madman but instead got a slow soft spoken killer. He's still very good though.Crowe was good as well but I have to be honest he's never been an actor that blows me away, I like him and he's given some great performances which this is one of but his name alone for one reason or another doesn't make me want to see a movie. AFter this one it might though.Like I said he does a great job, I actually Think he was pretty bad-ass, Still I think Bale gives the best performance of the film. I used to think Bale wasn't a very good actor but that has changed(long before this film). He ma not give the coolest performance of have the coolest part, but it's the best performance acting wise IMO, it's subtle and doesn't draw attention to it self yet you can feel what he's feeling. You Cant ask for much more than that. Then again you can't ask for much better acting all around including the smaller roles like Fonda for instance.In terms of camera work and the cinematography, I have to say there's nothing that really stands out. The Browns and grays of the old west look fine but there's nothing that really catches you. Same goes for the camera work, the film is shot very simply. Im not taking anything away from the film because of these facts though. For what it is the cinematography and camera works just fine.Its honestly the ending that makes this film though. It would still be a really good film without it but the ending makes it a great film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A bad western with decent acting and an inferior remake,"The 2007 ""3:10 to Yuma"" is one of those movies loved by general audience and critics alike. I suspect it would be hard to convince anyone in the opposite – that the 2007 movie is a bad western and an inferior remake, but I will try.The 2007 remake tries to impress at all costs, but despite (or maybe because) of that it ends up being a shallow disappointment. It is more concerned with being entertaining than with making the story concise and whole. The shocking extremes and the sharp contrasts make the movie showy, but disconnected from reality on many levels – from the questionable plot twists to the impossible in the real world characters.As a result, instead of a serious, solid western the 2007 remake ends up being a flashy gimmick with a strong artificial aftertaste and a severe lack of insight into human nature. In addition, the 2007 ""3:10 to Yuma"" is so preoccupied with being witty, original, and shocking that it almost completely leaves humor out of the storyThe original 1957 film, on the other hand, features some simple, but tasteful humor, appropriate for a western. It wins us over by genuinely and thoughtfully telling a simple, naturally and smoothly unfolding story. As a result, several important plot elements are better thought- out in the older movie than in its ""younger"" counterpart.That definitely includes the final confrontation scene that wraps up the 1957 movie very elegantly without any significant damage to the believability. The 2007 version, on the other hand, has a disastrous ending that cancels out most of the groundwork that had been painstakingly laid throughout the movie.Overall, unlike the original ""3:10 to Yuma"", the 2007 remake focuses more on the action and adventure elements and on the gun battles than on the battle of wits and wills between the ordinary rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale) and the gang leader Ben Wade (Russell Crowe).In the 2007 version the characters of Ben Wade and his gang of outlaws are grotesquely overdone to the point of being a caricature, more appropriate for a horror or an action movie than for a western. According to the official movie description, they are ""vicious gang of thieves and murderers"". Ben Wade and his ""outfit"" are portrayed as ultimate villains - extremely disgusting, aggressively inhumane, scary monsters and heartless killing machines, full of horrific cruelty.As of Ben Wade himself, in the 2007 remake he is portrayed as a confusing mess, an artistic and narcissistic Hamlet with a gun, a puzzling, artificially constructed hybrid of Hannibal Lecter and Prince Charming. This modern Frankenstein's monster, a product (or should I say a by-product?) of the rich imagination of the movie authors, absolutely does not belong to the simple world of American Old West.He does not have much in common with anyone in the movie, including Dan Evans. Therefore, the unique bond slowly developing between Dan Evans and Ben Wade looks unconvincing and artificial in the 2007 movie. It is hard to believe that being so strikingly different from Dan Evans, Ben Wade suddenly starts to respectfully appreciate something about Dan, and even somewhat envy his humble life. In the key scene in the hotel room Ben Wade unconvincingly tries to negotiate with Dan by employing melodramatic childhood stories as well as a large dose of pseudo- intellectual philosophizing that the authors had recklessly put in his mouth.In the 1957 version, Ben Wade with his down to earth, very human character is flesh and blood of American Old West. There is no unnecessary complexity or confusing mystery involved. Ben is a confident leader of the gang and definitely not a simpleton. At the same time, unlike his colleague from the remake, he does not show any weirdly peculiar miracles of cleverness and deceitfulness. He is flawed, but not hopeless.Most importantly, Ben Wade has surprisingly a lot in common with Dan Evans and the rest of the small town folk. Even having gone different life paths, even having made different life choices, they all still remain children of American Frontier. They speak the same language, they are haunted by similar thoughts, and their value systems are more compatible than it seems at first. All of that makes the unlikely bond that develops between Dave Evans and Ben Wade in the original ""3:10 to Yuma"" both plausible and believable.Ben Wade's arch-rival Dan Evans in the 2007 ""3:10 to Yuma"" for some reason is portrayed as the ultimate victim and the ultimate loser. He is a victim of the Civil War where he lost his leg, a victim of the bureaucratic indifference of the government, a victim of the hostile, powerful, wealthy neighbor who want so seize Dan's land and sell to the railroad, and even a victim of the weather conditions (drought). In addition, one of Dan's kids is seriously sick.Unlike the extreme character from the 2007 remake, in the 1957 film Dan is just an ordinary, somewhat conservative and stubborn rancher whose life naturally happens to be hard. He courageously fought in the Civil War and was known as a sharp-shooter. He is loved and respected by his wife and his two healthy kids adore him.I hope by now you see that the original 1957 ""3:10 to Yuma"" and the relatively recent 2007 ""3:10 to Yuma"" are two very different animals. Watching both films and then drawing your own conclusions is perhaps the best way to determine the ""winner"".Here is what I think: the 2007 ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a watchable entertaining show with some good acting by Christian Bale, Russell Crowe, Ben Foster, Peter Fonda, Gretchen Mol, and others. However, those after a true western experience might be far more satisfied by the solid 1957 classic.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"as solid, violent, and sophisticated a Western you'll see this year","The best western I've seen since the Proposition - which might not mean a lot since it's been a year since that film came out. But while Mangold's film may not have the existential resonance and eerie quality of the Aussie feature, we do have a better-than-average feat of genre film-making, loaded with great machismo presence (and heart), and a feat of storytelling uncompromised by muddled metaphors or Leone copycatting. It's very violent and without too much hope for the characters on the surface by film's end. It looks as though things have suddenly, surprisingly turned against the conventions (whether this is different from the original I can't say having not seen the 1957 film version yet). But underneath, there's a moral code that is evoked brilliantly.The premise is as simple as they come for a story based on a short- originally written by Elmore Leonard early in his career- for a pulp western magazine. Gang outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe, his best performance in quite a few years, even if he could potentially play it in his sleep) is captured without the help of his posse (with icy fast-shooter Ben Foster as second in command), and is sent to be hung for numerous crimes and murders in Yuma. Dan Evans (Christian Bale, terrific as always, usually in silence) is a rancher who is in danger of losing his land if he doesn't get enough money together, and so takes the job of being part of the group (among them an old and weary and hard-ass Peter Fonda as Bryon McElroy). It's a tale where good versus evil should be well defined, but this where the conventions sort of get muddled, which is really what starts to make 3:10 to Yuma more than just a star vehicle or blockbuster of the week.Beneath the veneer of each man lies truths that haunt them, and have made either one into how they are in the present. Wade is calculating and evil, but somehow has a level of honor beneath his countless sins; watch him tell of reading the bible cover to cover as a kid after getting it from his mother, and then never seeing her again. Or how Evans got his war wound, how he hides that simple fact from his children, even from his son (William Lerman, maybe the most limited performance as his sole motivation is 'I'll go with you', though still does it well enough to act with the best of them). There's some level of understanding that forms between Wade and Evans, and amid the countless gun battles and wounds faced against Apaches, train workers, and the whole town of Contention, loaded with gun power, as the train is soon on its way, neither man can ever quite give in, aside from what the end goal entails.Mangold directs this picture like a pro in the tradition of someone like Howard Hawks- a few really good scenes (the climactic battle through the town, a dinner scene between captured Wade and the Evans family, and maybe the scene between Wade and Evans in the hotel room, among maybe one other I can't pin down), no bad ones. It's interesting to read the only substantial criticism of this 2007 version of 3:10 to Yuma being too long, where the original was just right in length. But nothing seems to be fattening to the storyline here, and the script keeps things moving along at a very tense pace while never stopping for a moment of characterization, like one of the campfire scenes. And giving enough breathing room for actors like Crowe and Bale allow for them to do what they do best.In this near-classic feature that works as a very respecting throwback to tragic tales of doomed men in the guise of typical Hollywood product, while working finitely as a pure action movie for today's audiences, 3:10 to Yuma is taut, precise and superlative as a ""guy"" flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
flawed but generally compelling Western drama,"Set in the years immediately following the Civil War, ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a rip-snortin', old-fashioned Western whose characterizations and performances compensate for an occasionally muddled plot line and a tendency towards implausibility.Christian Bale stars as Dan Evans, a struggling rancher who, for a $200 fee, agrees to help escort a cold-blooded killer to the train that will take him to prison in Yuma, Arizona (at that time a territory, not a state). Russell Crowe is Ben Wade, the gang-leading outlaw whose very name strikes terror in the hearts of the local populace. Based on the short story by Elmore Leonard ( as well as the 1957 movie derived therefrom), ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a thoughtful Western drama that nicely balances its requisite shootouts and tough-guy posturing with just enough psychological insight to make the whole thing interesting and worthwhile.The two stars bring a great deal of intelligence and conviction to the roles they've been assigned to play. Bale's reticent stoicism is placed in direct opposition to Crowe's world weary cynicism and outward charm - and the match-up is a good one. The men they are portraying may have an entirely different view of morality and of what it takes to be a man, but they are still able to establish a genuine, if somewhat shaky, rapport on the common ground of mutual respect and understanding. The climax of the story may feel a trifle contrived and artificial - we really don't believe that Wade would do what he does at the end - but it isn't enough to spoil the overall effectiveness of the film.James Mangold (""Cop Land, ""Walk the Line"") has directed the movie with sufficient gusto and energy to counteract some of the verbosity of the screenplay. Fortunately, the dialogue generally avoids platitudes and clichés - although the action itself is frequently confusing and often geographically inconsistent (i.e. characters who don't have horses seem to arrive at destinations almost as quickly as those who do).In addition to Bale and Crowe, Mangold has elicited excellent performances from Ben Foster as Wade's wiry but creepily bloodthirsty henchman, Charlie; Logan Lerman as Evans' too-big-for-his-britches older son, William; and screen legend Peter Fonda as the hard-bitten bounty hunter, Byron McElroy, who may finally have met his match in the wily Mr. Wade.On a final sour note, the cinematography by Phedon Papamichael is surprisingly dull, muddy and lifeless, an especial disappointment considering the gorgeous Southwestern landscape with which he was given to work.All in all, however, a very fine Western.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Train Has Left the Station,"A down-on-his-luck rancher (Christian Bale) attempts to restore some honor to his name, regain the respect of his young sons, and put some money in his pocket by escorting a murderous criminal (Russell Crowe) to the 3:10 train to Yuma prison in James Mangold's update of the 1950's Western of the same name based on a short story by Elmore Leonard.Westerns are a hard sell these days. Unless taking the radical deconstructionist route like the neoclassic ""Unforgiven"" or the bold avante-garde take of last year's vastly underrated ""The Proposition,"" the genre often comes across as stale and unwelcome. The only other film to play it straight recently was Kevin Costner's ""Open Range"" in 2003, and that movie was only a moderate success. ""3:10 to Yuma"" lacks the reverent and epic scope of Costner's piece, but makes up for it in grittiness and a valiant attempt at psychological complexity.Unfortunately ""3:10 to Yuma"" is awash in genre clichés from the robbing of a stagecoach, to the stoic wife/mother at the homestead (Gretchen Mol), to the depiction of Native Americans as mythical phantom threats ready to scalp and kill anyone in their path. Also distracting are the ""cameos"" that range from a welcome Peter Fonda as a morally questionable bounty hunter to an unwelcome Luke Wilson complete with green teeth as an unnecessary mining posse leader. Likewise the supporting cast is hit or miss with Logan Lerman showing some decent range as Bale's eldest son while Ben Foster fails miserably at being method as the insane sharp-shooter hellbent on rescuing Crowe from the gallows.The film's saving graces are director Mangold's traditionalist leanings in pacing and Western iconography and the lead performances from Bale and Crowe--two great actors who sometimes resort to scenery-chewing and are shockingly subdued and nuanced here in their multiple physical and mental face-offs. ""3:10 to Yuma"" culminates in a fantastic finale at the train station that is entertaining enough to forgive the cattle cars of clichés, buy not enough to make the audience wish they would resurrect the genre more often.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Modern Western Unleashed,"I love it when I can leave a movie theatre and really feel like I got my $11 worth. Trust me, with 3:10 To Yuma you leave feeling like you got at least $22 out of the experience. Everything from the acting to the cinematography, to the score were superb. Many, many, accolades to both Christain Bale and Russell Crowe, both did an outstanding job playing opposite each other. Also, my hats off to Peter Fonda as well for playing a righteously despicable bounty hunter. 3:10 is a perfect rendition of an old western short story, that's brought into the modern age by it's amazing ability to capture the imagery and setting of the 'old west' time period. The shots and the quality of the film create an aesthetic this genre's predecessors from the 1950's and 60's were not able to capture. This element helps the audience to more realistically than ever be able to pit themselves in the untamed west, see the sunsets, feel the snow and the cold, taste the dirt, and smell the gun powder.

I didn't get into the film,"I never really got into Westerns because everyone just shoots each other in thinly disguised plot. This film is no different.

So what if its a remake?,"Of course I can't say anything about the original, because I haven't seen it yet. But I saw this movie/gem and was mesmerized by it. Surely one of the best westerns (if not the best) in the last decade! A shame it didn't win an Oscar (2 nominations though).From the leading men to the supporting cast, the performances are more than stellar. The story is told very raw and with an experienced director (Mangold) steering the wheel, everything moves along just in the right pace. Not too fast and not too slow. Although you can say it's more like the old school western, than a new style western (even the editing). If there's just a little love for western in you, than you have to watch this!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A lot to Crowe about,"Don't generally get no westerns no more so I guess, when one rides into town, I'm gonna mosey on down and check it out.Now there have been so many westerns in the history of the cinema that it's impossible for a new one not to be derivative and ""3:10"" is self evidently so, both in being based on a 1953 short story by Elmore Leonard and being a remake of the 1957 movie of the same title starring Glenn Ford in the lead role. There are obvious echoes of ""High Noon"" in the cowardice of all but one man to do the right thing and of ""Shane"" in a boy finding inspiration in a cowboy's courage.So, if the trail is so well-trodden, why go there? It's partly the joy of the western itself: those terrains, those outfits and - above all - those guns (and here, when shots ring out, they RING out). It's partly the more nuanced character of the main protagonist: the outlaw Ben Wade who is cunning, ruthless and real fast with a pistol, but knows his Bible, can sketch a sensitive drawing, and is polite to the women folk. Above all it's the fine acting, mainly from the charismatic Russell Crowe as the leader of the gang and Christian Bale as the rancher Dan Evans who is determined to get him on that train, but also from various support performances including the veteran Peter Fonda as a bounty hunter endlessly on Wade's trail and Ben Foster as Wade's psychopathic second-in-command.The very final sequence is too light-hearted for the 122 minutes that have preceded it but, that apart, this is a fine western that manages to combine both exciting action and character delineation in a work that will further enhance the reputation of director James Mangold who did so well with ""Walk The Line"".",,Anonymous,Crime
the stars are pretty good,"Having watched a second time the original film made in 1957, I thought I would have a look at the 2017 one with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. Unfortunately I'm afraid that it is just a bit too long and even if the stars are pretty good, they are just not Glenn Ford and Van Heflin. The story is more or less the same but just padded out and with an extra scene of the miners that is not needed. I thought the first one brilliant and I just hope that this one doesn't spoil my memory of the first. Certainly although the dialogue seems okay I miss the splendid big skies all the time and although there is a train in this one, the original was just amazing and the steam just added to the clouds. Also, of course, the end with this one is just a bit disappointing although the first one is really clever and gives us a little more to wonder.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

I enjoyed it a lot,"I didn't know what to expect, because I didn't watch the original film. It's a very good story about valor and honor. I liked a lot the strange bunch that takes the journey, and all the encounters they have: the movie does a great job in making you feel how wild the west was. It was enjoyable from the start, but it's in the last 10 minutes that it gains all of its value. The ending is by far the best part, I strongly disagree with those who didn't like it. I think that if somebody didn't liked it, was probably following a preconcieved path about how characters should behave and how the movie should end. Instead, the power of this story is all in the possibility of change.Russel Crowe is outstanding. I don't like him much usually because I think he seems always out of place in every movie he does, but this role really fits him perfectly, and he acted great.That being said, Christian Bale is the main reason of the success of this movie, and by far the main reason to watch it.

logically disjointed but gripping western,"3:10 to Yuma always had an interesting moral ambiguity to it with an honest financially desperate rancher trying to salvage his life and family and his pride by delivering an infamous outlaw to a coming train while fighting off his gang in order to earn an honest $200.00 and save his ranch. This version has terrific editing of the action, a lot of which has been added on, including a fantastic stage coach robbery. The outlaw himself is as bad as can be and yet has his own sense of justice and fairness which is in the best tradition of famous American outlaws. If anything this film is maybe too reliant on its action and the great acting while letting a few holes mangle the plot. Why didn't Ben Wade just ride out of Bisby in the first place? Lets get captured so that we can introduce him to failing and disabled Dan Evans (Christian Bale).

The best scenes are arguably those featuring only Crowe and Bale; the back and forth and the mental as much as physical struggle between the two is very interesting.

Best Western movie and story in this decade,"3:10 to Yuma. What a great Western. I was interviewed on some show after I saw it and it was almost too soon for a complete reaction. Oscar worthy, yes: for story, for costume, editing, and maybe even one for acting. Christian Bale and Russel Crowe are in a really worthy battle for the best man on and off screen.The story is so great. The pieces fell into place like a mortise lock. Unique, chambers of steel, contradicting shapes that distinctly turn from one contradiction to another. It was so contrasted from the bad to good and came together in a dance between characters that found respect and humanity in battle.What is an enemy? When did paths go apart? The subtext of family vs. outlaw & Fatherhood vs. orphan fill me up with their individual parts, essential is the parallel and the rough setting. Everyone struggles to survive and defend the deepest core values. These outcasts with these values that made them come together. Words took on deeper meaning as they were few enough in an action filled western. Fascinating ideas rolled together seamlessly into this movie.It was like a song really, with a harmony and haunting melody that allowed you to drift into identification with either main character. I was on the edge of my seat wanting, rooting for a wonderful outcome. I got it in parts, in spades and with a huge dose of loss. How can I describe a great movie without giving any of it away? Just to say go see it. It is entertaining and a great body of work. The eyes have it. They have made this a really wonderful movie. It will leave you thinking.

The cinematography is quite ok and I appreciate the fact that it was filmed it in an actual desert because with the rising popularity of green screens we get less and less great landscape shots.

Make More Please,"Another classic western please. Every portion of this film was a work of art. Personally the only disappointment is knowing that there isn't a part two. Movies today rely too much on special effects. Don't get me wrong, they have their place but I feel like I'm stuck in the 90's (as in watching oldies) where directors actually had to have a compelling story that captivates an audience like a novel. That's the charm of a western, you just need a handful of great actors that carry conviction in their role.An example: One of my favorite books of all times 'The Count of Monte Cristo'... whenever I tell new friends that its my favorite read they think its a story about revenge. For me if you threw away the second half of the book, I would say its a work of art, because the relationship he formed with the old man in prison was deep.

the mild/wild/gnarly West,"So, there arrives another addition to a movie genre believed by some people to be practically extinct. I, for one, didn't even know that ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a remake until I read IMDb's description; westerns from the '40s and '50s are the types of movies that I usually avoid.As for this movie. The most interesting aspect is that, as was the case with David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"", I ended up wondering whether or not the son is headed down the same direction as his father. But for the most part, I can't see much difference between this western and the average one. You see, ""High Noon"" was very likely an allusion to McCarthyism kowtowing; ""Shane"" was the original story of a total stranger defending a family from thugs; the spaghetti westerns gave the first accurate portrayal of life in the old west (gritty and dismal); and ""Little Big Man"" was the first movie to side with the Indians (and of course ""Blazing Saddles"" totally trashed the genre). But to this movie's credit, it does show the Chinese working on the railroad, which is what really happened.Overall, it's worth seeing, but I wouldn't recommend it above most other movies. Starring Russell Crowe, Christian Bale, Gretchen Mol and Peter Fonda. Imagine that: Peter Fonda went from ""Easy Rider"" to a remake of a western.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very Good Remake,"I do not know whether to call this western a true remake as it is based on a story by Elmore Leonard and therefore it may be better to be called an adaptation of that story, just as the previous film version was its own adaptation of the same.

There have been a few westerns like this that have come out over the past couple of decades which we will call newer adaptations of earlier works, and this one is my favorite.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best modern western EVER,I was on the edge of my seat when I first saw this movie. I was not expecting it to be this good. Ben Foster deserves a raise for this movie. He look so menacing.

I loved it,"I'm aware that this film is a remake, but I never saw the original. For me, this story was brand-new. And I liked it. I admit that the movie has a ton of implausible details: Russell Crowe's character could have escaped so many times, for example; a touching development that occurs at the end (which I won't spoil) becomes really far-fetched when you think about it.But the visuals are nice, and both Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are great. I love the costumes, imagery, and setting. Russell Crowe never looked more handsome. He had great hair in this movie, and the cowboy get-up really suits him.The supporting cast delivers too, especially Ben Foster as a psycho henchman . Some of the scenes where Christian Bale discusses his character's past are touching, and there is a nice father-son theme mixed in the movie.9.0/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"There are two 3:10s to Yuma, 1957 & 2007........","There are two and both are excellent and both are worth watching. Both are completely different from the other. You should watch both because they are completely different exercises in story telling. Both are examples of stories well told. Both are also great examples of good acting.Although B&W, the first has better cinematography. The second has better character development. The evil in the second Wade is more convincing than the first Wade. This is a good reason to watch both, one after the other - to make your own judgements. Especially if you are a student of cinema.The writing is worth noting as well. Compare how the the writers approached the same material yet each story has a decidedly different tone.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Promising Start & Strong Middle Ruined By A Final Misstep,"A sturdily crafted, sharply directed & strongly acted western drama that comes jam-packed with plenty of gunslinging action & dynamic interplay between its characters, 3:10 to Yuma exhibits ample depth in plot & characterisation and offers a thoroughly engaging ride for the most part, only to throw it all away in its final moments.Directed by James Mangold (Logan & Ford v Ferrari), the period setting is recreated in fine detail but what drives this film are its well-rounded leads, each bestowed with an interesting arc while consistent dose of action keeps things alive n kicking as plot progresses. The finale is where Mangold loses his grip and is unable to wrap it up in a satisfying manner.The issue I have with the final showdown is that it isn't refined enough for us to buy such sudden change of heart. It betrays the character definition established prior to the third act and isn't convincing at all. Nonetheless, both Russel Crowe & Christian Bale bring their A-game to the table and deliver solid inputs in their respective roles, yet it is Ben Foster who steals the show.Overall, 3:10 to Yuma impresses in several aspects, both individually & collectively, and properly utilises all its ingredients to finish as a worthy example of its genre but the final step brings such an unexpected sudden halt to its momentum that it leaves behind an underwhelming aftertaste in its wake. I doubt many will mind the ending it settles for but after such promising start & middle, I expected a better conclusion.",,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent,"Oh how time flies.... it seems like just a few years ago I saw this at the theater. That was almost 20 years ago. Anyways 310 To Yuma is a remake, I have not seen the original,so I can't compare the two films. However, I really did enjoy 2007's 310 To Yuma. It is a sharp looking, nicely scored ,shot, tightly directed and action packed western. The pace is pretty brisk, but still has enough time to pay attention to the storyline and character development. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are seriously talented actors and their chemistry is very strong in this film, bringing to mind John Woo's The Killer. Overall I like this a lot and holds up extremely well from the time I originally saw this. 310 To Yuma is a very good western.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Defines difference between quality & entertainment,"It seems that Russel Crowe has been trying to dig himself out of a hole ever since he threw that telephone at a hotel worker....Alas this remake of a relatively minor film from the 50's is a great example of a film that is extremely well made but lets be honest, not a great deal of fun.Everything about the film is a downer. I don't mean that in a bad way but potential film-goers need to know what they are getting in for. While the cast is uniformly excellent the question that is begged here is why was this film remade? They have lifted whole sections of dialog from Delmer's film and have really done nothing more than add realism to the violence. Sure, it is in color but to what end? Every bit of vibrancy in the image has been drained out as if they wanted to do it in black and white but didn't have the guts.I really wanted to enjoy this movie but found myself checking my watch on more than one occasion particularly in the last half hour. Mangold has made some great films (""Identity"" comes to mind even more than ""Walk The Line"") but all that he really proves here is that given two of the finest actors working today that he can do as well as Delmer Daves did 50 years ago.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
I can't and can believe this movie isn't more popular,"Great movie. Great Western. I'll be hated for saying this, all respect due, but I enjoyed this film much more than Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid, which I just watched through its entirety last night for the first time. Butch and Sundance is a great film. No complaints. But what I saw between Christian Bale and Russell Crowe was a chess match. Not only did they play aggressively for each scene, but they also were willing to sacrifice a pawn . And only to make the game better. Their give and take makes De Niro and Pacino in Heat look mailed in.
Most Westerns nowadays will always be measured by Tombstone. It was great entertainment. It was quotable. I loved it and always will. Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday, forever Oscar worthy, and Kurt Russell's Wyatt Earp were seamless. This movie has nearly none of that. But it delivers an awesome crooked stitch.

3:10 To Yuma succumbs to the slow pace of classic westerns but its conclusion is satisfyingly gripping.,"A remake of the 1957 classic heist western with a modern visualisation that allows a new generation to enjoy the thrills. Y'all know westerns are one of my least favourite genres, and unfortunately this film includes typical traits that add to my dislike. An outlaw who goes by the name of Ben Wade is captured, to which the father of a ranch family bravely steps in to escort the prisoner to Contention (for some gold ofcourse) so that he can be brought to trial. Hot on their tail though is Wade's gang, who's loyalty result in them doing anything to get him back. As with most modern westerns (and classics for that matter) the production design is top notch. Small rural towns, desolate wastelands and ominous canyon passes. Everything looked great and director James Mangold ensured the natural environment took ownership. However, it's the screenplay that really stood out. The dialogue actually created the characters. Sure, both Christian Bale and Russell Crowe were electric, heck even Ben Foster's sinister antagonising characteristics were well portrayed. But the dialogue created them. The script allowed Ben Wade to be an ominous enigma. The script enabled Dan Evans to be a courageous veteran who would do anything for his family. The dialogue between these two lead characters manifested a rivalry that gradually transforms into mutual respect. In fact, it was the only critical element that the film had going for it during its first two acts. They. Were. So. Slow! Maybe the genre isn't for me, but I just can't get onboard with a glacial paced narrative. Fortunately it's third act was tight, the shootout was utterly gripping. The gritty tension that was built up just completely unleashed itself, and it was oh so satisfying. It saved the film for me, and it goes to show that the conclusion to a story is the most important factor. One of the better modern westerns I've seen, but that's not saying much from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""For God's sake, he's killed more men than the drought!""","FILM: 8.5
Rewatching 3:10 to Yuma, I find myself impressed by how well James Mangold handles his first remake. I've been a fan of his earlier work, so when he teamed up with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, it felt like a must-see. Both Crowe and Bale bring understated performances that really allow the film to stand on its own. It's a simple story, but Mangold unfolds it with excellent pacing, showcasing his talent for taking on different genres.Ben Foster, though, is a standout. He had already built up quite the resume by then, but this performance in particular really solidifies his credentials. He plays the role with such intensity, and I find myself drawn to every scene he's in. The bond that forms between Crowe's outlaw, Wade, and Bale's rancher, Evans, is fascinating to watch. The way the characters evolve as the story progresses gives the film a deeper emotional weight than you might expect.The finale, while thrilling, does stretch believability a bit. I couldn't help but feel like it undermines some of the film's more grounded moments. That said, it doesn't take away from my overall enjoyment of the movie. Mangold's direction keeps everything tightly focused, and the chemistry between the leads, along with Foster's brilliant supporting turn, makes this a solid watch.Overall, 3:10 to Yuma holds up well for me on rewatch. It's a well-paced, character-driven Western that shows Mangold's skill at handling established material while still making it feel fresh. It's definitely one of the better remakes out there.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

"Simple, Predictable, Sometimes boring","The sound mixing was great and the actors performances were great.
The writing was kinda lame and predictable. You know exectly what was going to happen to the main characters and plot. I also didn't create any emotional connection to any of the characters.
The main guys were also bulletproof or the ""badguys"" were stormtroopers. And that makes modern movies boring in my opinion.
There were alot of angles of close ups that i liked but the gunfight choreography was just awful.
James Mangold shouldn't have chosen to direct this script. Sorry but i really don't get why so many people think this movie is great. As a whole it ain't a great movie. Not only performances make a movie great.

Russell Crowe is always an excellent choice as he is one of my favorite actors but he has a supporting cast that does a phenomenal job even though he was the bad guy in the movie.

This is one of those movies that will be in my DVD library when it is released...but please; watch it on a big screen first for the full effect of all the action.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Be on Time to 3:10 to Yuma,"The Western has been somewhat non existent in the last 5 years, with the exception of ""Open Range,"" in 2003, and HBO's series ""Deadwood,"" the genre has moved into extinction in movie goers' minds, as many Westerns nowadays focus on shootouts and blood and leave out the humanistic themes that the genre is built around.These humanistic themes are exemplified through stories of men who bring anarchy to places where law and morality are hard to find on the new frontier, which give rise to bold hearted men who stand up for justice when it is no where to be found. In ""3:10 to Yuma"" you find such a moral story line as criminal Ben Wade comes across rancher Dan Evans.Dan Evans is a maimed Civil War solider who fought for the North and has come to Arizona to seek refuge and peace for his family, but he has come to find nothing but pain and misery as his crops and cattle are deprived from drought, the town's businessman threaten Evans to pay off his land, and his wife and oldest son look at him like he is a coward. As Evan's barn is burnt to the ground by the businessmen and his posse, Evans decides to head into town to tell the businessman off. When he confronts him, he's told to pay up or his cattle and home will be burnt to the ground, how's that for your landlord? Now, the only way to compensate for his grievances and to pay off his debts, Evans decides to take up a job that will give him enough money to pay off the shrewd businessman. The job is to escort captured outlaw Ben Wade through perilous desert so Wade can get aboard the Yuma train and await certain execution. Wade is the leader of a band of criminals who bring down stagecoaches and rob anything on the Southern railroad. Wade is wanted for countless murders and over $400,000 stolen.Wade is brought into Evan's home, where they wait to ride out any of Wade's posse who are certainly looking for him. There Wade brews the interest of Evan's oldest son, William, and begins to flirt with Evan's wife. William has the mentality to go out and do violence to avenge their families burnt down barn, which you can say is the Wade part of the boy. But Daniel tells his son that a man must get by with his words and not his actions.The quiet and authoritative way of Dan Evans played expertly by Christian Bale, becomes a character that stands with Shane from ""Shane,"" or Gary Cooper's Marshal Will Kane from ""High Noon,"" They are regular, vulnerable men who stand up to injustice when no one else will, and are prime role models for children and young men who need to lead honest lives when there is much temptation and room to be lead astray.What's captivating about James Mangold's crisp, authentic morality play is how it circles around the characters stories and the dichotomy between the righteous man, Evans, and the outlaw, Wade. Ben Wade is a cunning, charming, and heartless criminal who perfectly manipulates and torments his captures as they travel through deadly wilderness swarming with Apace Indians, brewing tensions, and Wade's gang of criminals on there tale. Wade however is revealed to have a humane side to him as we realize he isn't too far from Dan Evans, its just the choices the pair has made set them apart. Wade and Evans begin to bond, as the pair begin to understand one another. Many shades of Wade's character are revealed as well as he cites passages from the Bible, and takes to draw sketches in times of solitude. Russell Crowe maybe plays one of his most entertaining performances as Ben Wade in this film. Wade and Evans keep working off each other as they both force the other to question their subsequent livelihoods. Evans leads an honest and clean life, Wade points out to him, but he still suffers for it. Isn't it better to lead a life like his, Wade tries to confide to Evans. Evans though thinks different, and speaks of always doing what is hard and right when many choose the easier path. By the end of the film Evan's example rubs off on Wade, and the story calls to mind that the wildest of dogs can be tamed.In the most stirring scene in the film, when Dan Evans is alone with outlaw Ben Wade in a hotel room, battered, tired and bruised from a hellish odyssey through sand and rolling tumbleweeds, Wade's posse circles the hotel, where Evans and Wade await certain death. All of Wade's captures leave him in fear of their own lives, but only Evans stands by Wade and promises that justice must be served and that whatever happens, he'll get him on the 3:10 to Yuma. It's almost homage to Butch and Sundance's last stand in front of the Bolivian army, but Evans sleekly leads Wade past bullets and swarming gun men, in a shoot out that will be remembered forever.This film is surprisingly a remake but it stands alone as its own film, and also up there with my favorite Western films. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe have called for the genre's immediate revival.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
For a one-leg rancher... he's one tough son of a bitch.,"I really hate remakes. They take a good foreign film and put in some WB stars and it is never as good as the original. Even The Departed, with a stellar cast list. was not as good as Infernal Affairs. So, I really didn't expect a lot from a remake of a great western, even though I am a Christian Bale fan and really wanted this to be good.It was not only, good, but it was spectacular and I expect to watch it several times. Bale was in the best form of his career as a farmer trying to keep things together for his family. I could easily see everyman in his character, and he played it masterfully.Russell Crowe was also the best I have seen him since Gladiator. He really played a much more nuanced character than I could have imagined, and I really enjoyed the ending where this nuance came out strongly.Ben Foster was born for the role of Charlie Prince. He was as evil as evil gets and made you cringe every time he appeared to see what he would do next.All of this suggests that director James Mangold had a tight rein on this film and delivered what will go down as a western classic.The screenwriters, Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt, and Derek Haas brilliantly turned Elmore Leonard's story into a compelling tale that had a lot of the flavor of the original, but was different in areas that mattered. They really did remake a film that was as good, if not better that the 1957 version.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Breathes new life into a dying genre,"I'm yet to see the original version of this film, but 2007's version of '3:10 to Yuma' is good enough to stand alone, without drawing any comparisons to the 1957 original. I thought this film was excellent in just about every area. From the plot to the acting and the cinematography and visuals, everything was as good as I've seen in a any modern Western film.This film breathes new life into a dying genre. It's 10 years old now but we haven't had many Western films as big and bold as this one released since. In many ways it's a shame that Hollywood doesn't invest in making more modern Westerns like this one. There's definitely a market for more films like this, and part of the reason '3:10 to Yuma' stands out so much is that there is a severe lack of competition in its field.

Crowe and Bale are absolutely astounding in the way that their characters develop and mirror each other. It's as if they are shadowy reflections of each other. Where each falls short the other stands up...this becomes extremely relevant as the movie progresses. As amazing as the two of them are Ben Foster dazzles the viewer in the role of Charlie Prince.

He is really quite incredible and delivers such a complex performance, with complete ease.Christian Bale is absolutely a actor to watch in near future.The start of this movie grabs your attention.The cinematography is also very great.Very few picked up on the ending to be a complete cop-out. I think the writers just gave up and said to themselves ""we got to end this sucker, let's do it real fast and and pick up our checks"".

Riveting performances compensate for implausibilities,"A compelling story lead by two of the most talented and charismatic actors working in film (Christian Bale and Russell Crowe) is kept from achieving the level of a great film because of plot points that are implausible. If the viewer can let go of the need for logic and enjoy fine acting and entertaining dialogue, it should not be too difficult to appreciate the characters brought to life by Crowe, Bale, and the supporting cast. What the script lacks in consistent believability, it makes up for with humor and chemistry. Crowe, as the hardened, life-long (yet charming) criminal searching for something decent in himself, and Bale as the beleaguered, beaten down rancher desperate to hold onto his land and last shred of self-respect make a memorable screen duo who square off against each other (and themselves) physically and psychologically.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Inexcusably awful,"I'm no film expert/nut/whatever. But I do like good movies and I LOVE good westerns. 90% of the movies I rent are westerns and this is the worst one I've ever seen, hands down. This is my first and perhaps last comment on IMDb, but I just had to say something.It's easy to pick on just about any western, from the earliest ones thru Leone and late-Eastwood. Let's face it, every western features fantastic silliness on one level or another; many are ridiculous on several levels. Historical inaccuracies, physical impossibilities, absurd caricatures of archetypes, you betcha, westerns have got 'em. I'm more than fine with all these things; handled skillfully, such silliness adds to a good western's appeal.But in the hands of this guy (i.e., some director of whom I'm too disdainful to even look up his name), we have a movie in which the concept of suspension of disbelief is abused. It is taken by the director to mean carte blanche for him to play in the sandbox of ""take this, stupid movie watcher! Look at handsome Russel Crowe! Let me create characters with motives so stupidly incongruous that we shall agree to call them complex. Let me spend millions of somebody else's money on this piece of s*** and call it a feather in my cap when I go begging for millions more to spew forth my next 'oeuvre'.""Watch any other movie but this one.

Good remake,"I've never watched the original version of ""3:10 to Yuma"", but this one really surprised me so I'm gonna say that this is a good remake. Mangold managed to hold my attention right till the end and there aren't any boring parts in this movie. Everything is made on high level of professionalism but what really puts life in this story are actors. I will extract only two names from this great cast list: Russell Crowe and Ben Foster. Crowe is excellent, so cold and strong acting. He's great as bad guy. But Foster surprised me, his ability of portraying Charlie Prince is stunning, cause I've never seen him in this kind of role. Christian Bale, young Logan Lerman and legendary Peter Fonda are also good, but Crowe mostly steals the show.This western is somehow different then all the others. Because westerns are made so people would enjoy themselves (especially for males); there are lots of shootings with plot that is always very easy to follow. But Yuma (and westerns like ""The Searchers"" and others) takes a turn there. Yuma is not just a western, cause it has great story and great character development. Both, Ben Wade and Dan Evans are talking about their lives. How did parents treat Wade when he was child, what happened to Evans in the war, relationship between Evans and his older son and every conversation between Wade and Evans is great. There are so many topics to discuss about that this movie goes beyond normally western and makes my favorite ""western"" movie. If you don't like westerns just watch it because of Crowe and Foster. Highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Return to the Old West,"When watching 3:10 to Yuma, it's hard to believe it all started with a short story by Elmore Leonard. This exceedingly well told story with it's rich characters and beautiful cinematography ranks right up there with some of the best Westerns in history: The Magnificent 7, A Fistful of Dollars, The Good, The Bad & The Ugly.Russell Crowe's Ben Wade and Christian Bale's Dan Evans seem like polar opposites when the movie opens, but as their story unfolds we find there is much more to these men than meets the eye.The very best villains are ones you can love, and Wade is most certainly a charmer. His earnest face and smiling eyes belie the masterful mind working nonstop within. In Evans, he finds the perfect foil.But I would be remiss if I didn't mention Ben Foster's portrayal or Charlie Prince. Loyal follower to Wade, Charlie is the type of guy who'd kill you with a smile and never lose a minute's sleep over it. Ben does an outstanding job of creating an intoxicating mixture of adoration, loyalty, viciousness and outright lunacy.As if this weren't enough, there are several other characters represented outstandingly by some very talented folks: Logan Lerman's William Evans, and Kevin Durand's brief role as Tucker to name but a few. Everyone in this cast does an excellent job of bringing this story to life.My only caveat would be the ending. You will either love it or hate it, but either way you won't be bored by it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"great music by Marco Beltrami, and Bales and Crowe are as cool as ice","Funny how the elements of this western, a quintessentially North American genre, that really stood out to me--the composer's score, and the leads' acting--were supplied by foreigners. Another foreigner was responsible for the excellent cinematography.While funny, it's not surprising given the rich Italian spaghetti western tradition (Beltrami's score definitely has some of its flavor) and the rugged geography, and perhaps personalities, of much of Wales and Australia (where Bales and Crowe, respectively, hail from). And pretty much all European cinematographers have great eyes for sweeping landscapes and sensual lighting.The movie overall was very good, never boring, but never quite splendid in either emotion or action. There is something frustrating about watching characters risk life and limb to escort a cold-blooded killer to some far-off train station just so he can get shuttled off to some kangaroo court to be sentenced to death, when they could (and should) just shoot him in the head immediately and save themselves inordinate trouble and expense. But the characters have to learn valuable life lessons, of course, and that takes time and effort and unimaginable sacrifice. At least their suffering was entertaining, thanks to the aforementioned elements. But whenever a plot feels somewhat unnecessary, as this one did, it's hard to feel true sympathy for the plight of its characters, and that's why the movie seemed to fall short of its ambitions as a tale of morality and redemption.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The power of silence,"I don't know much about westerns, but I do know about emotion. I also don't know if it's because of James Mangold's gift to generate it or because its impeccable and flawless cast, but ""3:10 to Yuma"" has emotion to spare. Not every day silence touches deep inside in a world surrounded by gunshots and blood.The movie tells the story of outlaw Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) and his gang; and the story of Dan Evans (Christian Bale), the man who took him to the train that would send him to prison. Two men so different but somehow very much alike, two men full of secrets but also filled with honesty; one walking all by himself, another one with a family to support.Why did Mangold shoot this remake? I rather not ask him, and I haven't seen the original but I can understand. I can understand and appreciate the delicate work the director has taken under his hands; the calculation of beautiful close ups and long shots; the management of a perfect production design (Andrew Menzies); the quiet observation and the precise control of his actors.Talk about acting duos. If ""The Machinist"" wasn't proof enough, Christian Bale's character study and commitment can be seen in several facets here: in the way he talks to his wife (Gretchen Mol), with care but with the silent suffering that what he has is not enough for her; how he talks to his son (better every day, Logan Lerman), with pride because he's almost a man but with preoccupation because he's still his kid.These are sad characters involved in desperate situations. Situations that lead to well-based confrontations that are well structured and that serve the storyNo gun here is shot without a purpose, write it down; and it fills me with joy. The other big star? Russell Crowe, whose look says everything. The most intense look I've witnessed since Leonardo DiCaprio's in ""The Departed"".It's a good screenplay, this one by Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Hass, but it hasn't got many words. It takes an actor of complete mastery to transmit a thousand feelings through the look of an eye. Yes, it has been done millions of time and it's not so difficult; but this is a whole different context. It's a Western; Crowe plays an outlaw who is not allowed to show feelings and succeeds in staying that way. What he feels, you can see it in his look; if you sense it, you'll understand his great performance.Only a few times the main characters give long speeches; they are not so long and they explain who they are and the reason of their personalities. You have to pay attention, because you may get lost in the tension of the action. However, I think Mangold is very clever in managing the moments, supported by Marco Beltrami's best score yet, and with a performance by Ben Foster that shows he's between the best actors of his generation.There are things we say many times and they start to loose their true meanings, I want this to be true: ""Silence hurts; silence speaks"". Do an exercise and try to figure out what each character says to another when they look at him in silenceYou'll find plenty of those moments.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Even bad men love they mommas3:10 to Yuma,"It is interesting how having an Oscar nominated director and actor, along with an Oscar winning actor can make a film garner award season buzz rather than the backlash of being a remake. The stigma of remake usually spells the kiss of death for most films, but it seems almost an afterthought with James Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. Based on an Elmore Leonard short story, the original is somewhat highly touted, so it is not as though people don't know of it to have forgotten. Either way, I believe a film should be looked upon individually and not necessarily compared to what came before it. Sure, that will never happen, as comparisons are too easy to not be made, but if a remake works, it works on its own. As far as this one goes, hot on the heels of two remakes I did not enjoyThe Invasion and Halloweenwe finally have a winner. I have not seen its predecessor, however, the Western genre has been seeing somewhat of a revival lately. As far as those go, this does not quite match the brilliance of The Proposition from last year, it does ultimately warrant a look.By far, it's the acting that really shines. Between the Oscar winner in Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, (no he isn't the nominated actor here, that's Peter Fonda, Bale still surprisingly hasn't been so honored), you have an acting clinic. These two are phenomenal as the outlaw being taken to his death and the rancher who volunteers to do it. Bale has shown that he is fantastic as the honest, hardworking, moral figure trying to do right by his family, but rarely have we seen Crowe as a complete villain. Even his L.A. Confidential badass was at heart a good guy that was working for bad men. Here he is great as the cocky, fast-talking, charismatic, psychopathic killer. Bale's character's son says, he is not all bad, when actually, Crowe says, he is. No matter how affable he can appear, it is always for his own devices in order to get close and pull the trigger. While this aspect is wonderful on the whole, it is also the one main flaw of the film. We are shown this dark side of Crowe for the entire duration, and, as a result, the evolution of the relationship between he and Bale becomes implausible. I just truly didn't believe that they would have opened up to each other as they do.Those two leads are by far the reasons to check out the film. It's like the buzz surrounding Righteous Kill which all culminates to the fact that we will be able to see DeNiro and Pacino on screen together; these two have that same dynamic and possibly are a tad better at that. There are more good actors here tooAlan Tudyk plays a rendition of his usual persona, Gretchen Mol is a welcome sight having been away from the scene for awhile, and Ben Foster again shows why he is the actor of choice for crazed lunatics. The one bad casting call is Luke Wilson in a bit part. Being Luke Wilson is a detriment because all the audience does is laugh at him trying to be serious. He might have been spot-on in the performance, but I'll never know; you really can't get past who he is to actually find out.There is a plot involved here too, and it isn't that bad of one. The tension and wonder at whether they will make the train weighs heavy throughout the film and the interactions between the characters help create the interest. Aesthetically, the filmmakers do a good job showing the grime and filth of the time period as well as the carnage and selfishness that was prevalent. Were it two lesser actors, however, I have to believe I might have been bored by the length of the journey. It is Bale and Crowe chewing scenery that keeps the film from falling into a slow, plodding pace. The finale saves everything with the action amped up fully, the shootout is orchestrated to perfection. Again, though, I didn't quite believe why Crowe does what he does during it. I understand his ego and him thinking he had the ability to help Bale's psyche while still not hurting himself, but it was a bit too convenient. The bittersweet ending did help save any problems I had with it and in the end I will say I had a real good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
does a realistic western exist?,"i've read many complaints on IMDb about how this movie is not realistic, and how lots of silly things happen. so what is so peculiar about that? just about every western i have ever seen has been vastly unrealistic, but thats part of the genre isn't it?most of the direction of this movie has a deeper significance which goes beyond superficial notions of realism. and essentially centres around a quest for redemption. bale acting as crowes guiding light and to an extent vice versa. both performances are excellent, and actually there really isn't a bad performance in this filmthe deeper storyline is accompanied by some wonderful action sequences. although these get ear splittingly noisy toward the endthe film has some lovely sound overall though. really good use of gunshot reverb in the surrounds. with only the odd distracting moment with the sound of coyotes(?). loved the sound of the horse/cart rattling along, the sound of the steam train pulling in etc. overall excellent layering of sounds. loved it.i also really liked the costumes, esp the wonderful coats/jacketsi don't have a bad thing to say about this film. it was the most entertaining 'modern' western that i have seen to date",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Overrated, Unrealistic but Entertaining","Overrated is the first word that comes to mind. I don't know, I remember hearing such wonderful and shockingly positive things about this movie from critics. For god sakes, Roger Ebert gave it a '4-star' rave review. Critics said it was the best western since Clint Eastwood's 1992 Best Picture Oscar Winner 'Unforgiven'. After having finally viewed '3:10 to Yuma' I realized that most of what the critics said was pure bullshit. I mean, it was a good movie, don't get me wrong, but it's a seriously flawed Western and calling it the ""best Western since 'Unforgiven'"" isn't ridiculous, it's unforgivable. Christian Bale stars as a down-on-his-luck rancher/family man who is struggling to get by and getting run out of town. When gun-slinging bad-ass Russell Crowe comes to town and gets arrested, it's up to Christian Bale who is appointed to take him as a prisoner to the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. After that it's a wild but uneven ride rittled with clichés and poorly-crafted dialogue. When guns are a-blazin' in '3:10 to Yuma' it's absolutely incredible. Both the cinematography and directing (from the highly underrated James Mangold -- Identity, Walk the Line) of the film are absolutely sensational. The dialogue is another story. When the movie relies upon the dialogue and character development it's tedious, drawn-out and uninteresting. Also, while entertaining the gun-slinging is completely unrealistic and unlike what many morons want to compare it to ""Unforgiven"", which was one of the most realistic and gritty westerns I've ever had the privilege of seeing. As far as the acting goes, the two leads are very good. Russell Crowe is very effective and likable as the bad-ass bad guy, but it's Christian Bale who outshines him with a much more subtle and better crafted performance which boils to an emotional and brilliant peak in the film's final minutes. The supporting cast is filled with solid performers -- Gretchen Mol (The Shape of Things), Peter Fonda, Luke Wilson, Alan Tudyk (FOX's Firefly, Serenity) and especially Ben Foster (Alpha Dog), who for some reason seems to only being playing a hyper-active sociopath these days. All in all, I recommend '3:10 to Yuma' for anyone looking for a good time. Just don't be expecting anything Oscar-worthy. Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Terrible movie - poorly directed and poorly written,"This movie is terrible. One of the most important qualities that makes a movie good or not is whether the story, characters and plots are believable and realistic based upon what we know of the story.Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are two phenomenal actors and I'm surprised they signed on for such a pathetic script.How many times did Russell Crowe almost get away? They just kept giving him chance after chance after chance. These guys were not idiots. He was cold blooded killer. The way to transport him is to tie him up, gag him, and lead his horse for him. Not give him every chance to escape that they could.And CB sitting RC at his dinner table to eat dinner with him family!!! C'mon, how cheesy is that. The guy can't be trusted and he knows it. Has he got rocks in his head. Sit him in a corner or in another room, with a gun to his head and then give him food.All throughout the movie they treat him like he's their buddy, not their prisoner. It's poorly done. Letting him sit in the window of the hotel in Yuma and talk to his gang! That's ridiculous! This movie is poorly, poorly done and I was very disappointed in paying money to see it.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"3:10 and all is well, DAMN WELL!","When a western is made, it seems a wind blows by carrying whispers of discontent and doubt. Words you hear will be like, ""Why?"", ""Who cares?"", ""So what?"", etc.In my mind, any doubt was definitely blown away. What a great movie! It is not that I like westerns, but I love good movies. As movies go, this western will go down as one of the best made.Why great? Bale and Crowe for one thing. These two fantastic actors got a chance to show their stuff and spared no bullets in the process. The chemistry worked as good as any chemistry can. Everyone worked as well together as expected from any great movie. Well enough that you may want to take your favorite hanky.You get the best of good and the best of evil. The writing was done well enough to make good and evil become like a dust storm clouding the obvious.The type of action you get is not going to surprise you at all - it's what all westerns are made with. But the way that it is done is hard to match. I never saw the original version so I cannot compare this to that. But when it comes to violence and action you can compare this to any of the best westerns out there.I give it 8 out of 10 and will definitely see this one again.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Over the Top,"This movie begs comparisons with the original. It overcomes the slow pace of the 1957 version, but if you value any realism in this genre, you'll be disappointed. The gun violence is way, way over the top. Much too Hollywood, as they say. The acting is excellent and there is thoughtful devotion to those things that make great westerns -- scenery, dialog, music, and plenty of livestock and authentic weaponry -- but the spent cartridges (even excluding a Gatling gun) and body count strain belief. Anyone who merely likes westerns should see it and will probably enjoy it, but if you love westerns, keep your expectations in check.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very impressive film on all fronts,"3:10 to Yuma is easily one of the finest films I've had the privilege to see this year, and one of the best westerns to come along in quite a while. The film shines in all aspects, performances particularly, but the direction, cinematography, music, sound design (really startling gun shots, much more realistic than most films, sounds like a small detail but I found it made a big difference), and writing are all excellent.I was genuinely surprised at how great the dialog was throughout the film, and its made all the better by the excellent actors delivering it. Doc Potter (played by the brilliant and hilarious Alan Tudyk) gets some of the best lines in the film in terms of humor, Wade (Crowe) has some great bad ass moments as well, but I was most impressed by Evan's (Bale) dialog throughout the film. It has a really wonderful way of cutting through to some really brutal truths that most films barely touch on or avoid altogether, and Bale's delivery is really, truly astounding. While I am a huge fan of Christian Bale, he's been on my bad side after Harsh Times (which I really, really, hated), but with this, he's back in my good graces, and I have a higher opinion of him than ever before. His intensity in this role is unbelievable. He doesn't have a great deal of dialog really, but he uses his silences to his advantage and really conveys an amazing amount of emotion through the desperate look on his face for most of the film. He has a short conversation with his wife before leaving to deliver Wade to the train station that is one of the finest pieces of acting I've seen in quite a while. I can't even describe the depths of Bale's performance, especially after seeing the film only once. This is certainly a film that requires multiple viewings, and I can only imagine how much better it would be on a second viewing.Russel Crowe also turns out a really incredible performance, and this is coming from someone who is not much of fan of his. I have only really liked about half of what I've seen of Crowe's work, and while he obviously has talent, I always considered him rather overrated. This is the first time that I have really seen what other people have apparently been seeing in him for years. There is a certain simplicity and straight forwardness in his performance, he just is Ben Wade. The character is actually quite charming, in fact some of my favorite moments in the film were the stories he tells to his captors over the course of the journey about his visits to Dodge City, people he's killed, women he's been with , and the like. Watching the interactions between Wade and Evans is always fascinating as well.While I have only recently gotten into watching westerns after seeing Once Upon a Time in the West not quite a year ago (I've been hooked since then), this is one of the finest I've yet to see. It evokes all the things one associates with classic westerns, but at the same time, it transcends them in some way which I hope to understand more once I am able to see it a few more times. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Solid Remake With the Bale-Crowe Combo,"A notorious bandit (Russell Crowe) is witnessed in the act by a local rancher (Christian Bale). After meeting up later in town, an agreement is made between the police, the rancher and the bandit for the rancher to escort the bandit to the prison train to Yuma. Along the way, they begin to learn and respect each other's life views.What sold this film was clearly the cast -- Crowe and Bale. Westerns do not easily sell themselves anymore, and this one probably wouldn't have made a dent in the box office without the stars. Its value as a remake was most likely minimal. And what interests me about this is how Crowe takes the lead as an actor, leaving Bale to catch up. Bale is often a powerful actor (perhaps among the best in the business, along with Edward Norton) but this is probably his weakest role to date. Crowe dominates, being both an intimidating villain but also somehow lovable.Luke Wilson makes a brief appearance. While he really isn't the best casting choice (his presence always carries a subtle ""comedy"" vibe), he does alright. The best support is Ben Foster with the memorable role as right-hand man Charlie Prince. Foster has an unusual voice that made him seem silly in ""30 Days of Night"", but in this film it works for him to a point. If Foster becomes a bigger actor, it's this film he has to thank for it.The drawback to ""3:10"" is that there is precious little action for a Western, at least until near the end. So those looking for action are going to receive drama and that may be a disappointment. Personally, I found much of it to drag (though the last third really does improve the action as well as the story overall). If you like westerns, check it out. Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere. Bale fans are going to be let down.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
3:10 to Awesome,"Wow is this film amazing I've never seen something like this in a long time for westerns. Now I like westerns haven't seen too many but this is my favorite of them all it just does everything you want to see from a action packed western.It starts out with Dan Evans (Christian Bale) being a poor rancher and owing money to the rail road company so they stay away from his land. Then they show you Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) being this bad-ass outlaw that is robbing a armed wagon. Well when these two characters paths meet that is when the story goes from OK to just amazing that is in the first 20 minutes of the movie. But the main plot is a group of people a bounty hunter, rancher, doctor, and a guy who owns the rail road and his lackey are having to take Ben Wade to a prison jail called the Yuma.Acting wise everyone does great my personal favorite was Ben Foster who played Russell Crowe's right hand man.Overall this is almost a perfect movie but it is the reason I love film. Honestly I never saw the original but if it is half as good as this remake then you got one hell of a film. I give this a BUY you will want to watch this again.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Every way of man is right in his own eyes""","Ah, the Western. The mere mention of that genre evokes thoughts of heroic sheriffs, quick-drawing gunslingers, and villainous outlaws. That is the traditional version. James Mangold's remake of ""3:10 to Yuma"" delivers a Western that is not merely a shoot 'em up but also a great study of its characters. It is Mangold's masterful storytelling and direction that draws in the audience more deeply into the story and characters. This is accompanied by the fantastic performances of Russell Crowe and Christian Bale who prove that heroes and villains have more underlying reasons for their actions than simply money or vengeance.Former Civil War soldier Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is a down-on-his-luck farmer. He has only one leg, his children don't respect him, and he is heavily in debt. While rounding up his cattle, he comes across notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) who has just finished his latest holdup. Their destinies intertwine in the local saloon where Evans volunteers to accompany a posse to ensure Wade gets on the 3:10 train to Yuma where he'll be sent to prison and hanged. The group must survive the vicious loyalty Wade's men have for their leader and other vigilantes looking for vengeance against the outlaw if they are going to make their goal.The film would have been ordinary and average if it not for the masterful storytelling ability of James Mangold. When he introduces the characters, Evans is shown trying to live a just life and do things the right way whereas Wade is carefree and cavalier about his life. It is a great dichotomy of the honest man who struggles through life and the evil man who breaks the rules and lives free and easy. Mangold's timing is perfect in setting up the characters before he connects their fates. There is an imagery of a split screen and the audience experiences everything happening all at once. Mangold's ability to draw in the audience makes them feel as they were right in the picture. This is especially true in his slow close-ups during Evans' and Wade's different monologues. The delivery by the actors is flawless but it is through Mangold that movie goers really feel the experience. His direction makes the audience feel they are being addressed rather than the supporting actors.The terrific screenplay of Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt, and Derek Hass is adapted by Elmore Leonard's short story. Welles, Brandt, and Haas create multidimensional heroes and villains and show the grey areas between black and white. The trio dedicates equal time in introducing Evans and Wade before tying their fates. They have a great sense for how much to divulge to the audience before bringing the hero and villain together. The team also brings out the unique characteristics of Evans and Wade and supplies them with thought-provoking ideas about the thin line between right and wrong.Without a doubt, this is one of Russell Crowe's best performances a he fits so smoothly into the role of outlaw Ben Wade. Crowe does not play Wade as the typical heartless gunslinger that would shoot a man just for being looked at funny. Rather, he is cool-headed and only kills for survival. This is best viewed by reading Crowe's eyes as he moves an entire scene with a simple look. Crowe has a lot of fun with his character's malevolent ways that there is a charisma about Wade that almost makes you cheer him on. Crowe's performance radiates is so well done that audiences have to remind themselves that he is a murderer and a thief. Christian Bale is also outstanding as the long suffering Dan Evans. As with Crowe, he tells his life story with his eyes. Whereas Wade's are shown to be carefree and hopeful, Bale shows Evans' beaten down and ravaged by all he has suffered. Bale is so talented in his role that he truly makes the audience feel his pain and need to do the right thing. He creates the kind of character who becomes a hero not because he wants to but because nobody else can. The film is also filled with several superb supporting roles such as Peter Fonda as bounty hunter Byron McElroy, Ben Foster as Wade's second-in-command Charlie Prince, and Logan Lerman as Evans' son William. Each actor brings something to story and plot no matter how small the role may be. Fonda shows he still has something to offer as the relentless McElroy. But it is the performances of Foster and Lerman that have the most depth. Foster plays Prince as quite the opposite of Wade. He is quick to shoot first and ask questions later before shooting again. But as Foster shows, Prince is not an ordinary sidekick. He has a deep devotion to his leader that Foster brings out in moments of fury and dedication. Lerman's role as William Evans has the most depth and transition of character and it is a task that is expertly handled. As William, Lerman exhibits the rebelliousness attitude that is common among teenagers. But like his father, it is his need to do the right thing that drives him. Lerman uses this to show William's transformation from irritable boy to courageous man.""3:10 to Yuma"" has all the elements of a perfect film. It has a great cast, terrific story, and a director with an eye for action. In a summer where special effects are king, ""Yuma"" offers action and humanity. It truly fires off all the right shots.GRADE: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Understanding why Westerns are a National Treasure,"If there is a truly unique American contribution to film making then that contribution has to be the Western. Though not as popular a theme these days as it was in past decades, it only takes a powerhouse film such as 3:10 TO YUMA to remind us just how pungent storytelling of this type can be. Yes, the story itself (based on a short story by Elmore Leonard) is rather simple: desperate farmer needs money to save his failing farm and family and signs on to escort a powerful outlaw to the train that will take him to prison. But in this screen adaptation by Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt, and Derek Haas the story is fleshed out by sharing with the audience the essence of the pioneer spirit and the sequelae of the Civil War on the minds of the dispossessed who turned to crime against the ruling order - the railroads and the banks represented the conquering North - and the film becomes one of profound understanding about man's plight in the pioneer West.The landscape and atmosphere of Arizona is captured with dusty accuracy by cinematographer Phedon Papamichael and sets the stage for director James Mangold ('Girl, Interrupted', 'Walk the Line', 'Identity', 'Kate and Leopold', 'Cop Land') to work with his talented cast to give a realistic view of life in the hard times of the old West. Russell Crowe is the notorious outlaw Ben Wade whose gang includes such actors as Ben Foster and Rio Alexander and once he is captured during a robbery, the local sheriff promises to pay $200. to destitute, crippled farmer Dan Evans to escort the prisoner to Contention, AZ for catching a ride to the 3:10 to Yuma and prison. The connection between the two disparate men - Wade and Evans - is the message of the story and is beautifully enhanced by allowing the audience to understand both sides of 'the law'. The co-stars of the film include Gretchen Mol as Evans' wife and young Logan Lerman as Evans' impressionable son William, Dallas Roberts as the head of the bank investment at risk, Peter Fonda, Alan Tudyk, Vinessa Shaw and a large cast of the people who interplay in the drama.Both Crowe and Bale give superlative performances, acting so cohesively that it would be difficult to single out either for the Oscar: this is ensemble acting at its finest. For once the added features enhance our appreciation of the tales from the Old West and how they became legends and the comments by the director, producers and cast actually make sense! The film will doubtless become a classic: it deserves the honor. Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Action movie in an unbelievable western setting,"""Unbelievable"" is the key word when it comes to describing ""3:10 To Yuma"". Unfortunately, not in the positive sense. That's not saying James Mangold's movie isn't very entertaining, because it is, but you really have to turn off your brain for it. Firstly, there's a father-son relationship that may be common in this day and age, but not at the period of time in which the movie is set. And secondly, characters behave irrationally all the time to a point where you could only buy their motivations if you were 10 years old.Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are pretty good actors, but they don't get much chance to shine here. After all they're just in another fast paced action movie. For a western this here moves way too quickly and just isn't epic enough. Fair enough, maybe a modern western needs to be loud, fast and chatty. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of the genre, so it suits me fine that Mangold doesn't really play by the rules. One thing is for sure, though: ""3:10 To Yuma"" will neither become a classic, nor does it belong among IMDb's Top 250 movies. Time will tell.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent,"I just got home from a preview of this movie. I have been very excited about this film for quite some time now for a few reasons. One being that it is a western, a genre that hardly ever lights up the silver screen in the modern movie age. I was ready for a change of pace from the CGI/Michael Bay blowemup popcorn flicks, and this nostalgic western seemed like it had the muscle to bring a pure, vintage old west film.Secondly, the cast. Russel Crowe and Christian Bale working together is a movie goers dream; two of the most versatile and consistent front men sharing leading roles on the same big screen. Of course, it seemed almost like too much star power for one film, a mistake that many directors make that usually leads to overacting and unconvincing characters.Apart from the actors and the potential originality of this movie, I had a gut feeling that this movie was special. The first film of 2007 that we could see appearing in several categories for Oscar nominations. It had come to my attention that this film was a remake of the 1957 Glenn Ford classic. Some people shy away from remakes, claiming that they ruin the original movie. I personally did not feel as if this was a movie that would butcher Ford's ""3:10 to Yuma."" It was in the hands of ""Walk the Line's"" James Mangold, Academy Award winner Russel Crowe and Christian Bale, the most talented actor in Hollywood. This movie was not set up to be a modern garbage remake of a classic; 2007's ""3:10 to Yuma"" was destined to merge fifty-year-old classic film-making with what purity is left in present Hollywood.After seeing this film, I have decided that it is indeed my favorite film thus far of 2007. The Old West is recreated vividly with ranches, old railroad towns and the vast frontier. Mangold's attention to detail is prevalent throughout the entirety of the movie, and it pays off immensely with his flawless sets (the railroad construction site was a favorite of mine).Bale and Russel Crowe. It goes without saying  they were fantastic. Crowe plays a perfect Ben Wade, the meanest, most diabolical outlaw in the west. I particularly loved the character of Wade for his multidimensional persona. Crowe's Wade was chillingly evil while subliminally always having an aura of virtuosity looming about him. It was a beautifully developed character, and don't be surprised to see Crowe getting an Oscar nod for him performance.I didn't think the Bale's Dan Evan was up to par with his Dieter Dengler, but he is (as always) great. A stand out performance came from the young Ben Foster as Charlie Prince, Ben Wade's right hand man. His character was menacing, funny and bad-ass. It was probably my favorite character in the film, and I am expecting great things in the future from Foster.This film may be a remake of '57 Glenn Ford classic, but I believe that it has solidified itself as a modern display of classic film-making. The plot line does not drag, the dialogue is smart, the sets are incredible and the acting is first class. Do not shy away from this film over the fact that it is a remake. ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a brilliant film, and deserves a viewing from even the most skeptical of remake-haters. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Exceptional Western film,"Who says the Western is done as a genre? This is a terrific film. There's always some things in any film that make me roll my eyeballs and say ""yeah, right"", and this film was no exception. Like Peter Fonda's character taking a bullet in the belly then having it removed without anesthesia by a veterinarian without letting out hardly a grunt. Then he climbs back on his horse and rides all day. Nobody is *that* tough.Nevertheless, the rest of this film is awesome. It's tough, gritty, and has no silly romantic sub-plots that would've served only to bore the audience. The dynamic between Ben Wade (RCrowe, bad guy) & Dan Evans (CBale, good guy) is terrific. The acting by the entire cast is tremendous. Particularly good is Ben Foster playing one of Ben Wade's henchmen. He's a psychopathic butcher and is very believable in his role as Charlie Prince. Best remake of an old film i've ever seen (I saw the original 1957 film with Glenn Ford & Van Heflin as a kid in the '60's).

Nice post 2000 western,"I rarely look at western movies with high regard since to me there's quite nothing else there is western setting to tell a story from. But this movie proves that we can insert nice drama into the action, even into the age old western base plot of outlaws and lawmen. Although there's simply a huge plot gap whether how did Wade get to be so stupid as in escaping twice already but ending up to recaptured again and again, is quite a flaw for me about this movie. But the ending gives this movie the nice touch it needed to give itself an edge to differentiate it from other westerns. It's very neat to see that finally Wade changed as a character in the end, even that means sacrificing his own gang. The acting overall is good. Russell Crowe is strong as usual in giving life to this type of role he played. Christian Bale did very well in acting up the westerner, yawning up his mouth almost all the entire time. Logan Lerman succeeded in his role and get the attention he needed as a young actor. Having Ben Foster and Kevin Durand nicely completes the whole dangerous aura and mood of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

This Powerful Film Will Give You A Lot To Think About,"Wow! Finally a Western made for the adult mind! Thank you Hollywood for a job well-done!What a delightfully complex film about motivation, relationships and values. It's about a father and a son on the verge of manhood, and another son with an illness; a bad guy who has a strong sense of self and truly knows how to lead; about a society that condones the mass murder of women and children as long as they are Native Americans but not of armed robbers stealing from what was then one of the most powerful corporations on earth - the railroad industry.It's also about a society which tolerates racism towards hardworking Chinese laborers building the railroads; and at the same time allows working-class farmers to be brutally pushed off their land in order to make the powerful even richer. But the only real ""bad"" guy society is organized against is the one who steals from the rich and powerful! How incredibly convenient and ironic!This story is also about pride, self-respect, intelligence, courage and even self-confidence. We are also confronted with senseless violence committed by evil men on one hand and the immediate need for self-defense on the other. What's worth risking your life over?

Alterations and Political Corrrectness,"This will not spoil the ending, but anyone who saw the 1957 version with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin and remembers the stunning drama of that conclusion will probably be disappointed in the remake's alteration. That's a shame. In a way, the entire film sacrificed suspense for melodrama. That, too is a shame.But the big question is whoever decided that the Old West was a tobacco free zone. I mean, here are the rottenest, meanest, whiskey-swillingest outlaws on the frontier, and there's not a stogie, chaw, or home-rolled smoke anywhere to be seen. I think there was a sniff of snuff, but it happened so quick, no one probably saw it. In this period, tobacco was a part of life.

A good Western?,"I must admit I have always loved westerns. So, when I heard that Christian Bale and Russell Crowe were going head to head, I was very exited. I saw the original years back and liked the film. This movie is considerably better. The acting is solid all around. I love seeing Peter Fonda. I wish he was a little more active. His career never got the bounce it deserved after his ""comeback"" film, Ulle's Gold. The two leads are predictably excellent. My main problem with this film is with Crowe's character. His transformation from beginning to end seems forced. There is nothing in the movie which seems to pull him towards his actions at the end of the movie. The bond between him and Bale does not seem authentic. The best Westerns are usually clear cut stories about good and bad. This movie is more about redemption. The rest of the movie is good enough that it's flaws are forgivable. I would recommend this movie to fans of Action movies as opposed to Westerns. It just doesn't feel like a Western.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Interesting Themes, But Very Sparse Acting","In the old heyday of Western films, the 1960s, the genre was categorized by the panache of John Wayne, who came into town with his six-shooters blazing and cleaned up one town after another of evil-doers. Lately, however, with the Western genre on the very fringe of Hollywood, directors tackling this specific art form have taken a different approach. Instead of the ""Duke model"", the focus is shifted towards the gritty realism of the time period.This film continues that realism tradition. When Dan Evans (Christian Bale), a salt-of-the-Earth sharecropper just trying to eek out a decent living for his family, volunteers his services to make sure the seedy criminal Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) catches the 3:10 train to Yuma, the journey turns out to reveal much more about each character. While Evans struggles to uphold the law at all times and still keep some semblance of his manhood, Wade begins to realize that perhaps Ben is fighting for the nobler cause. These themes are slowly and carefully explored over the course of the film, and by and large are very interesting.However, the lack of great acting (or, more specifically, the lack of opportunities for great acting to shine) really bogs this movie down. I know that Bale and Crowe are top-notch actors, but they really aren't given a chance to take center stage. Bale's character is nearly silent the entire film, while Crowe has a few great moments but ultimately isn't fleshed out enough to truly believe/understand the film's conclusion. Only Logan Lerman, playing the part of Dan Evans' son William, truly shines in his role.Thus, while the themes in the film are rather interesting, the action backing them up is extremely lacking. If you are a fan of the new ""minimalist"" Western genre, I would suggest Robert Duvall's ""Broken Trail"" over this film, as you will find it much easier to understand the issues that men in the Old West faced.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Real Western Rides Again!,"And what a great script and performance by Christian Bale and Russell Crowe -- Peter Fonda was perfectly cast. This is a real down to earth blood and guts good guy vs bad guy shoot 'em up! Lots of horse action like a great Western should have and the tempo was great through out, watch out for young actor Logan Lerman -- he stole the show. Finally a decent picture with the sense to do it right. Screenwriters knew exactly where to plant all the right cues and actors delivered-- Mangold's direction showed throughout -- with this cast, just keep it tight on the page. Excellent job and hats off to your cinematographer and production designer-- you could feel the action -- hell, you could taste the action.

Shame of a stupidly quick thought end. Very entertaining rest of film!,"I wanted to see this movie after reading all the good reviews it have and it didn't disappointed me. I'm not a big fan of western although lately there've been a few good ones.As usual, there's the good guy, the bad one and a mission to be done. The fact is the bad guy is not than bad and the good one is strong enough to keep going in his mission under any circumstances. Both actors gives intensity, both can transmit a lot without saying a word plus they deliver good performances. Dialogues are well written, shooting work is brilliant, well done action scenes and outdoors.This remake is more cynic, brutal and faster than its predecessor in 1957.I don't rate it higher cause in my point of view there're 2 things could have been improved: - In the original one (1957) the countdown of the hours till 3:10 train is much better. The tension, the stress to get on time, etc. That is lost it this one, not at least with the same intensity.Shame of a stupidly quick thought end.

Breathtaking and consistently quality modern western,"The Western, a genre often associated with dusty studio sets in the 1950s, had more often than not been considered retired in today's film industry, the last noteworthy effort being Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven back in 1992. With that in mind, it is nothing less than exhilarating to see a modern take on the genre seem so fresh and bursting with life and vitality, making 3:10 to Yuma not only the strongest western in decades, but also one of the most consistently quality films in recent memory.Director James Mangold of Walk the Line fame should be given tremendous credit for extracting a great premise from a mostly unknown film (the original was hardly recognized as a timeless classic, making its remake status a bit suspect...) and translating it into a superb adaptation, nearly unanimously considered superior to the original. Mangold's firm directorial touch, working off the film's near flawless script is a sight to behold indeed. Crafting a nearly airtight blend between introspective musing, slowly festering psychological tension, and good old hardworn Western action tradition, all with enough of a modern spin and injection of energy, the film is made accessible to a contemporary audience, without forgetting its traditional western roots. With pitch perfect cinematography and editing exquisitely drinking in the dusty trails, rickety saloons and lone prairies among other western visual trademarks, complimented by the traditional yet never clichéd score, the audience feels fully immersed in the Old West setting. We feel the bullets tearing past (in some of the most exhilarating shootout sequences in years), feel the sand blowing into our faces and shake from the clamour of approaching horses.The already stellar film is fuelled by its dynamic cast, each giving performances which would normally qualify as ""show stealing"", were it not from the unanimously strong work from all the others. Russell Crowe once again demonstrates his astonishing prowess as an actor, making Ben Wade one of the most compelling villains in years - suave, silver tongued, with a clear sense of honour, yet still unapologetically self serving and malevolent. His antagonist is perfectly complimented by the ever reliable Christian Bale, on top form with yet another brutally affecting performance as beaten down yet proud rancher Dan Evans. Working with a character who could all too easily fall into the mould of the stereotypical ""doing right for the sake of doing right"" hero figure, Bale instead embraces the emotional foibles of Evans, providing a downtrodden charisma complete with a malevolent glint in the eye, making him a consistently intriguing protagonist. The depth the two stars instill their characters with is flooring, and countless accolades should justifiably be bestowed on both.Adding to the immense prowess of the two leads, Ben Foster is a cinematic powder keg as Wade's fiercely loyal and sadistically homicidal right hand man, both genuinely terrifying and incessantly watchable - one would be hard pressed to find a more menacing villainous sidekick. It's also wonderful to see Peter Fonda in the genre made famous by his father, giving his most impressive performance in years as a grizzled, aging bounty hunter, and the always wonderful Alan Tudyk gives a strong and fittingly comedic contribution as an unconventional doctor. Relative newcomer Logan Lerman is impressively powerful as Bale's impressionable yet fiercely rebellious son, easily outshining the usual lack of emotion produced by most young stars. In fact, the only weak link in the cast is Gretchen Mol as Bale's wife, who, while not terrible by any means, comes across as disappointingly flat in a cast full of such immensely capable performers.All things considered, 3:10 to Yuma is not only one of the strongest westerns in the past few decades, but arguably among the most beautifully crafted additions to the genre. With a steady and capable directorial hand throughout, and fuelled by mesmerizing performances from an immensely powerful cast, in particular the dynamic Crowe and Bale,the film excels in showcasing all the traits which made its trademark classics successes, while still accessible and appealing for a contemporary audience. One begins to wish that the title train would never arrive, that the film might continue on immersing its audience in its consistently classy splendour long after the credits roll.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Routine Remake,"In this remake of the 1957 Western, a rancher escorts an outlaw to a train so he can collect a bounty. Bale is pretty good as the rancher determined to complete his mission. Crowe is OK if underwhelming as the outlaw, never quite believable as a man of the West. Fonda is fine as a crusty old bounty hunter. The original was well made but was marred by an unsatisfying ending. The good news is that this remake changes the ending. The bad news is that it is even more unsatisfying. In fact the ending is nonsensical. The plot has also been expanded from the original, losing some of the tension in the process. If nothing else, the filmmakers should be applauded for keeping the genre alive.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Sign noon, when 3:10 to Yuma coming????","James Mangold's ""3:10 to Yuma"" restores the wounded heart of the Western and rescues it from the morass of pointless violence. The Western in its glory days was often a morality play, a story about humanist values penetrating the lawless anarchy of the frontier. It still follows that tradition in films like Eastwood's ""Unforgiven. The plot is so easily told that Elmore Leonard originally wrote it as a short story. A man named Dan Evans (Christian Bale), who lost a leg in the Civil War, has come to the Arizona territory to try his luck at ranching. It's going badly, made worse by a neighboring bully who wants to force him off his land. The territory still fears Indian raids, and just as much the lawless gang led by Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), which sticks up stagecoaches, robs banks, casually murders people and outguns any opposition. Through a series of developments that seem almost dictated by fate, Dan Evans finds himself as part of a posse sworn in to escort Wade, captured and handcuffed, to the nearby town of Contention, where the 3:10 p.m. Train has a cell in its mail car that will transport Wade to the prison in Yuma and a certain death sentence. Both Dan and Ben have elements in their characters that come under test in this adventure. Dan fears he has lost the confidence of wife Alice (Gretchen Mol) and teenage son Will (Logan Lerman), who doubt he can make the ranch work. Still less does Alice see why her transplanted Eastern husband should risk his life as a volunteer. James Mangold first came into view with an extraordinary movie named ""Heavy"" (1995). His ""Walk the Line"" (2005) won an Oscar for Reese Witherspoon. To remake ""3:10 to Yuma"" seems an odd choice after such other modern films as ""Girl, Interrupted,"" but the movie itself proves he had a good reason for choosing it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best movie in the last 10 years,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in the last 10 years.It wasn't overdone or cheesy at all.

My only purpose in posting is to acknowledge that Hollywood is still capable of making good films. It is rare, but it does happen. I have seen Unforgiven and that film was too long and too slow. 3:10 to Yuma had the right amount of action.

"The Good, The Bad, and the Magnificent","In Hollywood, it seems, all good things come in threes. One studio decides to release a vigilante film and two others follow with their own takes on the same theme. Given this, there's no reason why the venerable western, a genre that Hollywood hasn't revisited in years, should be any exception. What's more, if James Mangold's re-envisioning of 3:10 to Yuma is any indication, this year's trio of westerns (soon to be followed by the Brad Pitt vehicle The Assassination of Jesse James, and the Coen brothers' No Country for Old Men) may well yield some of the best entertainment in quite a while.Based on the 1957 Glenn Ford/Van Heflin picture, which was, in turn, based on a 1953 short story by Elmore Leonard (52 Pickup, Get Shorty), Mangold embraces his subject matter with unabashed enthusiasm, along the way paying stylistic homage to oater icons John Ford and Sergio Leone, to deliver a movie that is as complex and character driven as it is packed with lead-spewing action.Russell Crowe brings the same brooding intensity he mined in 2003's Master and Commander to the role of Ben Wade, the ruthless leader of a gang of outlaws that has made their mark robbing stagecoaches while foiling all efforts of the Pinkerton agency to both safeguard their booty and reign in the gang.Crowe's black heart is counterbalanced by the quiet upstanding righteousness of Dan Evans (Christian Bale), who plays a down on his luck rancher trying to eke out a living for his family and avoid foreclosure by an unsympathetic land owner hell bent on selling Evans' land to the railroad. When Wade is finally corralled, Evans seizes the opportunity to hire himself out to the Pinkertons and transport Wade to a nearby town and put him on the 3:10 train to Yuma prison.From there, the story of two men, each centered in a morally different universe, unfolds as Mangold piles layer upon layer of character depth upon each, while at the same time picking away at the bleakness of Wade's fiber to slowly reveal glimmers of humanity.Supported by a top notch cast of veterans and newcomers such as Peter Fonda, Logan Lerman, Gretchen Mol, Alan Tudyk, Luke Wilson, and the impressive Ben Foster (Alpha Dog) as psycho gunslinger and Wade's right hand man Charlie Prince, Mangold delivers a rich tableau that speaks to the true, humble motivations of heroism and the ability for empathy to be found even in the darkest recesses of the self-centered human heart. Rounded off with a twangy score that evokes the spirit of Ennio Morricone, 3:10 to Yuma nicely ensconces itself as one of the great modern westerns, alongside Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, Kevin Costner's Open Range, and the best of Sergio Leone's saddle sagas.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Director James Mangold is finally keeping his promise,"An inspired story packed with action, tension, plot twists, detailed and complex main characters as well as supporting ones that walk the walk and talk the talk, a very clever casting, and here you go: Director James Mangold has finally made good on the promise he gave us with ""Copland"" ten years ago (""Walk The Line"" in 2005, Jonny Cash's biography was the first sign of his redemption). ""3:10 to Yuma"" is one western that doesn't try to pay its respects to the genre or use it as a pretense: it's a bona fide action thriller but at the same time, it is totally modern in the way it poses some of the undying dilemmas humans may face in rough times. It even has an ending that permits the viewer to wonder about the next steps and the ultimate fate of those still standing -something Holywdood usually refrains from these days, preferring to show us everything at the end, so that we don't need to think or imagine about anything afterwards.

Most heart I have ever seen on screen...,"Obviously, redemption to some people is redeeming yourself in the eyes of people you loved - your loved ones, or redeem yourself for some bad things you have done. This is not true. People redeem themselves for themselves. They are in a battle with the other person inside of themselves and don't know how to change it, but they know they want to change it. This was the case for the two leads in this movie. Crowe's character, Ben Wade. And Christian Bale's character Dan Evans. Crowe's character was trying to just escape himself in the beginning. He wanted to get away and try something new. Dan wanted to just be something that, in his heart, he knew he wanted to be and what he SHOULD be. When these two characters finally meet they take themselves through a roller-coaster of change and redemption...atonement...as the plot unfolds. That is what this movie is about, self redemption.

"If you aren't a diehard Westerner, it's probably not for you","Considered an underappreciated gem and the best film James Mangold has directed thus far, this remake of the classic Western is a slow-burner, but not one that compelled me.There is nothing 'wrong' per se, but a dearth of characters to root for, a meandering plot and - yet again - an unexploited environment makes for a frustrating waste of potential.I like both Crowe and Bale as leading men (they star in two of my favourite films ever), but they don't have a massive amount to play with. Westerns are famously understated, talking little and shooting often, but that sort of story falls flat if it isn't backed up by sturdy visual storytelling.Therein lies the problem: nobody is very likeable in this ragtag group of griping, miserable men stuck in pioneering America. I would have been happy if they had all died in one big shootout, but unfortunately that prediction was unlikely to come true.There are moments of interest (the dynamic of Crowe's outlaw against Bale's straight-edge citizen is occasionally engaging), but not enough to carry over the scenes where less is happening. Undeveloped USA is a malleable setting, giving the options of deserts, mountains and forests, but few opportunities are explored; the final scene is a good watch, otherwise, I wasn't much engaged by the settings.I cannot speak for the dedication of this remake to the original's image, but I wasn't taken by ""3:10 to Yuma"" - as far as I could tell, it was an average Western in the place of a potentially great one.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Nutshell Review: 3:10 to Yuma,"It's been a long wait for the remake of 3:10 to Yuma to finally reach our cinemas. In fact, the Code 1 DVD is already out, and I thought it was probably missed opportunity if there are interested folks out there who decide to get the DVD instead of catching it on the big screen. I do not understand why the need for the delay, contrary to the belief that it is a Western movie which might be an unpopular genre to go into, and of course, I can only recall a handful which made it to cinemas here in recent times - Dances with Wolves, Unforgiven, Tombstone and Wyatt Earp - the last 2 being movies about the legendary lawman and the shootout at OK Corral.Some 50 years ago, audiences were introduced to the duo of impoverished rancher Dan Evans (then played by Van Heflin) and the number one outlaw of the land, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford). As the story goes, Evans has to feed a family and the poor harvest and weather aren't doing him any favours. As Wade gets captured, volunteers are immediately called for to escort him to the town of Contention, to put him onboard the 3:10 train to Yuma jail, hence the title. Two powerful actors have now taken over the mantle of the 2 rivals, namely Russell Crowe (who's having a comeback of sorts to our screens with the recently released American Gangster), and Christian Bale in respective roles. And unlike American Gangster which had again 2 high profile actors sharing top billing, Bale and Crowe share a lot of screen time together, thus boosting the appeal of the remake.Even for those who have seen the original, I am glad to say that on the whole, this version ranks far superior than the original version. The earlier version, being made half century ago, will definitely need a decent update for modern audiences, and that aspect did not disappoint, with more in-depth character development, and exciting shootouts. However, in my opinion, the ending of the original packed far more a punch that this one, given that the ending in the 2007 version is likely to be more in line with stories these days - the cynical, non-saccharine sweet ending.If it followed the original closely, then most audiences would have found it trying as most of the movie took place in a hotel room where the duo are waiting for the awaited time to make a run for the train station. Here, director James Mangold and scribes Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas decided to boost the middle section with a detour to Apache land and encountering railroad builders (check out Luke Wilson!), presenting again more threats to the group escorting Ben Wade. Also, Ben Wade is presented in a more menacing manner, constantly probing the group and looking for opportunities to make his escape, rather than the rather subdued original which didn't exhibit any notion of danger. What I also found to be a leg up, was the swapping of importance between Evan's wife Alice (Gretchen Mol) and his son William (Logan Lerman), which eliminated a rather awkward moment in the original where Alice paid Dan a visit whilst holed up in the hotel room. The structure and development otherwise remained about the same, and even some lines from the classic were reused in this remake, in particular in the first half of the movie.Character wise, you can't get any more better than having Crowe and Bale flesh out their characters and giving both a sense of angst, who on a better day, could probably have been good friends. You follow them as the duo gain newfound respect for each other, and the longer running time provided ample chances for the audience to find reason to connect, and understand the characters at a deeper level. Ben Wade was given time to show that he isn't all bad, despite what he tells others and from what he had done to gain his notorious reputation, and in Dan Evans, he finds the kind of life that he yearns for - beautiful wife and family, with sons who look up to the dad - but will probably never get, unless you count the mercenary hoodlums as family (Ben Foster in a truly badass role). And from Evans, learning his true motivations for this suicidal job, could have made any grownup feel sorry, while he exhibits his admirable work ethics in the face of temptation, to just get the job done, to put food on the table for his family, and teaching his sons as well that it's not the size, calibre or speed of the gun that matters, but principles.3:10 to Yuma deserves to be watched on the big screen, and given limited screenings and the crowding of movies this month, do make time for it. It's a perfect balance for those looking for mean gunfights, and powerful drama, and this remake delivers it all where it should matter - adopting the best bits in the original, and plugging the gaps when those portions falter.

A dying breed of film.,"By all means, get yourself to a theater and enjoy this wonderful Western while you still can! Very few quality Westerns are made for the big screen anymore. Every now and then you get a gem like Unforgiven or Open Range, but Hollywood just doesn't churn out quality ""oaters"" like it churns out animated penguin movies and comic book adaptations and things like that. Right now, there is an outstanding film named 3:10 to Yuma playing on the full screen! Go see it! That said, let's take a closer look at the film. This version is a remake of a film by the same name released some fifty years ago. The story is originally based on a short story from Elmore Leonard. The plot deals with a down-on-his-luck honest cattle rancher (Bale) who crosses paths with a dangerous outlaw (Crowe) and his men after a daring stagecoach hold-up. The outlaw, known as Ben Wade, ends up spending a little too much time after the hold-up in town with a beautiful woman. Before he can escape and re-join his gang, he is surrounded and taken into custody by a motley group of town folk and would-be lawmen. The rancher, in town to dispute a debt, also helps hold him. Now, Wade must be taken to a nearby town where he will catch the train of record which will take him to prison and a certain trip to the gallows. The rancher and others sign up for the trip for a price of $200 each. The rest of the film deals with the trip to the railroad town, and the myriad of complications and dangers faced by the men trying to deliver Wade to justice. The action seldom lets up for long, and the conversations that buffer the action are full of intelligent dialog spoken by memorable characters.That is one of the film's biggest strengths. Most of the characters in this film are distinctly drawn and full of color. They aren't simply random guys on horseback who peer out from under big cowboy hats. We learn about these men as individuals, and some of them are absolutely unforgettable. Wade's lieutenant, played by Ben Foster, might in fact be the most memorable character in the film. This is one bad-arsed hombre who keeps the gang right on the good guys' heels. You might think this guy would clearly be able to take over the gang himself, yet he has a strange and unexplained fascination with rescuing Wade. There might well be a lot more going on than we're told, anyway. After a time, we get the sense that Wade might not be all that fond of his old gang. He obviously feels superior to them and perhaps has simply used them for all these years because they are just a bunch of hardened killers who happen to be good at robbing coaches. I'd hate to give too much away, but the film's final scene pretty much confirms this hypothesis. The young man playing Bale's bold son also stands out memorably. We'll be seeing more from that young man over the years.3:10 to Yuma has perhaps the highest body count of any Western since The Outlaw Josey Wales. I have never seen anyone put a Gatling gun on the back of a stagecoach before. Hard to believe it wasn't enough to stop the gang. There are some elements of the plot that may be tough to swallow from a conventional perspective, though. Vinessa Shaw is a hottie, but would she really be worth getting caught over? Maybe! Could a man with a wooden leg be able to outrun dozens of men shooting at him? Nah! But the scene is exciting! Much like the rest of the film. I urge all of you once again to go see it! 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Hard-hitting yet implausible Western,"3:10 to Yuma is a hard-hitting film that pits two equally determined individuals against each other, one a ruthless gang leader played by Russell Crowe and the other a desperate farmer played by Christian Bale. Loaded with plenty of debt, the farmer is forced to escort the captured leader to claim reward money for his family. The rough journey across the wild west pits both men against each other and against the gang members who stop at nothing to get their leader back. The suave nature of the gangster and the desperate nature of the farmer are both brilliantly portrayed by their respective actors, lending a constant strong sense of tension and uncertainty to the plot.

The story has too many flaws and holes in it. 3:10 to Yuma is every bit as uninteresting as The Assassination of Jesse James. It's overwrought, loaded down with the same thing over and over -- long periods of tough talk, followed by shooting their way out of an impossible situation. Then more chatter followed by another implausible escape from death. It has all the cartoonishness of an Indiana Jones movie. If they had just shot Russell Crowe when he first gets arrested, the director could have called it a day and saved us all 2 hours.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
A happy remake that updates and improves many black points from the original story.,"This movie is a welcome remake of another movie, with the same name, dated 1957, and which I saw just before seeing this same movie. The old western films have kept their admirers over the years, but the making of these remakes allows them a new visibility and, thus, the conquest of new audiences. In any case, both the oldest film and this one are individual works that deserve our attention.The script for this film is similar to the older one, but the story has been modified in several points and the feeling it leaves, for those who have seen both, is that a good effort was made to make it more realistic, more credible and believable, taking into account the historical period and the situation itself. In the film, a dangerous bandit, Ben Wade, is captured after assaulting a stagecoach full of money. The local sheriff, unable to guarantee his judgment and aware that Wade's gang will do their utmost to free him, decides to escort him to Contention, a nearby town, where he will put him on the train to Yuma, where he will be tried, and probably executed. Given the lack of deputies, the sheriff recruits Dan Evans, a rancher who takes the job for two hundred dollars, essential to saving his ranch.The film has a lot of quality and the story is excellent. The problems of logic and coherence I had observed in the older film were mostly resolved here by more careful and thoughtful script writing, and a happier development of the main characters' personality and psychology. On the other hand, I feel the beginning of the movie is more abrupt than the older, but I handled it well. The thugs are more ferocious and bloodthirsty, shootings and action scenes are many, more intense and electrifying, and the tension that the first film had to spare, and which made it work reasonably, was partly replaced by action scenes. The final are intense, and can be surprising.The cast is very good, and it's headed by two great actors, both of whom have proven themselves in action movies: Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. They are good enough for their roles, and they manage to carry the film, establishing a good collaboration which is transported to the way they work together. Crowe, however, stands out the most. I feel (and he probably did too) that the character came to the measure of his skills and talent. Logan Lerman is another actor who deserves a praise for the convincing and emotional way he plays the rancher's son. Ben Foster is tough, mischievous and ruthless in the role of Charlie, Ben Wade's main adjutant, with ambitions to lead his gang.Technically, it's a film that knows how to make the best of today's cinematographic technology without allowing it to interfere or obscure the work of the cast or the story it wants to tell us. Cinematography is good and makes an intelligent use of colors and light, the sets are convincing and fit very well in the period, which will be around the year 1884. The costumes are also within what we could expect. I especially liked Crowe's costume, with its dark colors and sober, elegant cut. Bale was also entitled to a very suitable costume: he never looks like a gunslinger, he is an ordinary man, a family man doing a job he doesn't want because he was forced to do so by financial necessity. Finally, a word of praise for the special, visual and sound effects, for a very discreet and well-placed CGI, and for a good and effective soundtrack, composed by Marco Beltrami.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining and decent remake,"Teaming up Christian Bale and Russell Crowe for a high-noon and gunslinging western seems like a good idea, it seems even better when it's Walk the Line-director James Mangold who's operating this. Although Walk the Line suffered from being a straight-faced drama, he knew how to get the best out of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Whiterspoon - and that surely promises good things for Bale and Crowe to come.Russell Crowe plays the gunslinger Ben Wade, a black-hearted villain who (as usually) has got a pounding, charming heart for sketching and women. Christian Bale is the family man Dan Evans, with a heavy debt to pay he decides to lead Wade (together with some other, amateurish men) for the reward of 200 pounds.3:10 to Yuma is a bit of a disappointment, after watching it you get the weird feeling of all the things they could have done different. But after all, while watching it is a enjoyable movie that's got a fine look for down-in-the-dirt Wild West and pulls out believable characters and story. Crowe acts Wade with a professional glee, as soon as Evans' oldest son William gets drawn into the picture, it's obvious that the 14-year-old ""disappointed-over-his-pa"" boy is more fascinated than scared by Wade. And that's not the only thing that gets a bit too calculated, the plot swifts easily throughout without eager to surprise or swagger. By the time Bale and his gang starts heading Crowe for the 3:10 train to Yuma, the movie feels a bit dried up, not very boring, but not all that interesting. However, the movie pulls out a great card by the end, it's a solid, though not thrilling, ending that puts some sparkle into this deserted story. Don't get me wrong; 3:10 to Yuma has got a straight-forward, tight story to tell, but Mangold should have been twirled some pieces and kept the viewers more off-balanced, making it a welcomed western-installment for its originality. Instead Mangold makes some of the same mistakes he did with walk the Line, he plays it too much by the rules.Bale and Crowe are better together on the screen than apart, their dialogs may not blister, but they're just as neatly tied together so actors of their class know how to handle the material, and its especially Bale's Evans, who's at first a bit-of-a-bored character, who shines through as a earnest, struggling man, risking his family security so he can bring justice to a man who keeps him worried about them in the first place. The action set-pieces are decent, they play out like a 2007-version of a Bonanza episode; a bit more brutal, a bit louder and much slicker. 3:10 to Yuma doesn't feel like it finds its place, and does thereby suffer from this; but in the end it's a decent Western.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A solid throwback,"I will fully admit that this movie goes well beyond slightly implausible to fairly ridiculous (especially over the last 20 minutes or so). But here's the thing: it earned the right to do so with great performances, stellar direction, and a perfectly paced story. Everything works. So when it inevitably devolves into a cliché Western shoot em up, you care way too much to be bothered by it. Crowe and Bale alone make this one worth a couple hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
This town's gonna burn!,"First off all, this was amazing. Director James Mangold surprised me once with powerful, dramatic and Oscar winning ""Walk the Line"". I thought that it was all that i can expect from this genius. Lucky, this director has guts, as sure do the cast.Western, faked action in the past created in our days. What do we know about simulating a western? Turns out we have everything. Every detail in its place, every man with his gun, everyone giving away even their family in order to get money. Stubborn farmers, thieves who can shoot you from a mile... Surely, this movie has everything that is needed for our excitement, not forgetting good guys, bad guys and good guys that turn out to be cowards.3:10 to Yuma flushed me few centuries back from the very beginning, and merely after the end, more than anything, i wanted to be flushed again. Actors did a lot of work. Cristian Bale continued his recent success with another powerful and Oscar-worthy acting, Russell Crowe made it clear that he has his own reasons with a fabulous performance as Ben Wade...I think this movie would be one of the years best even with only those two stars in the whole movie, but others really didn't damage the view. Diferently, i would gladly give out Oscar trophy for best supporting actor - Ben Foster in role of Charlie Prince. He is describable only by one world - amazing.Concluding, 3:10 To Yuma IS REALLY A MUST MUST MUST-SEE movie. Amazing, superb, excellent.",,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome film!,"Either Hollywood really hates Westerns, or this movie was just too good for them. How else to explain them completely ignoring this film's performances (Crowe, Bale, Fonda, Foster), story, direction and cinematography with Academy Award nominations? Forget ""Unforgiven"" and ""Dances with Wolves"". This is the best Western to come out in the last twenty years...period! Mangold and company have not only improved on the original, they have surpassed it in overall quality and, sadly, made the original appear dated and irrelevant.This re-imagining of ""3:10 to Yuma"" is truly a classic, hitting all the clichés of previous Westerns, but adding its own modern twists and providing a moral weight I haven't seen in years. This is a ""soft"" R film. Relatively mild and infrequent profanity and graphic but not gratuitous violence.This is truly a bargain at any video store, since it didn't do so well in theaters and, because of this, prices lower than most of the crap Hollywood turns out.

Riveting,"In ""3:10 to Yuma,"" there is a cheeky simplicity to the plot that portends a much greater complexity--by setting up the story of crippled Civil War veteran Dan Evans (Christian Bale), whose last shot at saving his foreclosed ranch and winning his family's respect is by helping transport notorious criminal Ben Wade (the coolly controlled Russell Crowe) to the titular train, it becomes a meditative character study on the always-blurry line between the outlaw and the working man. ""3:10 to Yuma"" reminded me fondly of ""The Proposition,"" another neo-Western founded on a plot that was also deceptively simple, only to have painted a multi-layered portrait of humanity by the film's close. As Evans, Bale evokes a ""stubborn"" demeanor hiding a stronger will, and by the climax, he has persevered in becoming a man bound by a credo of lawful determination; Crowe, who is not quite his opposite, maintains the slithery reptilian charm of an outlaw who has been educated by his trade, but possesses and empathy and morality all his own. The film is at its strongest when these two developing characters share the screen, and the climactic sequence is as cathartic, exhilarating, tragic, and as strangely uplifting as anything I've seen so far this year. Director James Mangold brings an appropriately rustic, washed-out look to this thrice-told tale, and uses the camera as an instrument for putting us within the action. Yet while the violence comes in furious, mean bursts, it ultimately is a sidetrip to the psychological battle of wits taking place in the foreground. ""3:10 to Yuma"" is one of the year's best films.7.5 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a train wreck of a movie !,"Whilst the original adaption of the Elmore Leonard story is a nice B-movie, the re-make is a D-script (if D at all ...) filmed with an A-budget and starring a totally miscast ""hero"" Russel Crowe.My God, what a turkey! I have just seen the re-make on TV out of interest, so I could compare todays filmmaking with the old semi-classic. I didn't expect much, but what I got was even less than I could have expected.I know, yeah, a really good western is probably the toughest movie to make (and the last time Hollywood succeeded in doing so was OPEN RANGE and before that Eastwood did one of his best works with UNFORGIVEN), because the settings of the genre are limited and you can't have that much ""big/expensive scenes"" with explosions, car chases (smile), etc, so you have to rely to a reasonable/good story and some interesting characters, but both is totally lacking here. In fact the makers of this re-make didn't trust the story at all and threw in all kinda over-the-top action-scenes, which just look much too implausible to be taken seriously.The character of Russel Crowe and especially one of his gang-members is despicable, but of course having a leading man like Russel Crowe (who gives the label ""wooden acting"" a new meaning), Hollywood can't show him as filthy criminal, but needs to build a hero out of him. So the movie takes a good time developing that the people he has killed and kills ""deserve"" their fate. It's just ridiculous - and sorry for moralizing - that Crowe/Wade killing a member of the posse with a fork (!) gets him just a medium-severe beating. The same goes for his next victim: in fact the only above average-interesting character in the movie, the Pinkerton-man played by Peter Fonda, is characterized a good half-hour as the most evil person imaginable (by a moralizing (!) Crowe) to be then thrown off a cliff for good sake and what happens to Crowe: nothing again! Come on, I hate it when scriptwriters think I am an idiot, taking sh-- for gold.And Crowe is established as some kinda good (!) anti-hero, about whom the boy fantasizes as being a morale person, not totally evil. That's ludicrous and I don't see how somebody, who kills and destroys merciless, can have a good side or be worshiped?? When LEONE had an evil character in his western, he established that right away, of course with a portion of cynicism, for example like in GOOD, BAD, UGLY (EASTWOOD being ""good"", Lee van Cleef being ""bad""), but this 3:10 TO YUMA re-make does in fact take the good side of Wade indeed seriously.And to ""balance"" that, the movie does of course need somebody really ""evil"" (to establish how ""good"" Wade is in comparison) and introduces a silly-staring gang-member, who lets somebody burn inside a carriage. That scene is especially ludicrous, because that just would not have happened in any decent western, it's totally against the ""rules of the genre"". Near gore-like scenes like this don't fit into a western, and it doesn't have anything to do with ""widening the boundaries"" of the genre to put in repulsive scenes like this one.As I already mentioned, on top of all that Crowe is totally miscast. Not for a second do I believe his ""character"" as an outlaw, he just looks ""too good"", too well-fed with his puffy face (Mr. Crowe, stop eating junk food!) and too contemporary with his ""I don't like fat"" (haha!) eating-habits. Of course somebody like him cites the bible and tries to philosophize, which probably should establish the intellectual side of the evil. Yeah, in ""modern""-day Hollywood it has become kinda ""politcal correct"" to have the bad guy being a misunderstood intellectual with a hard upbringing ... hey, come one, that can't be meant serious (but it indeed is!) ?? Of course, compared to that (the lesser star) C. Bale looks like a stupid farmer, whilst in a good script, if there would be some moralizing, then it would fit (T)HIS character ...And the ending ... well, I think I can skip that, many other posters on the IMDb have already pointed out how silly/stupid/unfitting it is (btw, Elmore Leonard doesn't like the changed ending either).So ... another re-make which should have been avoided. It's sad, but Hollywood can't do any good genre movies anymore. People, who don't understand the western-genre, should simply stay away from it instead of ruining it even further!",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good Not Great,"I had fairly high aspirations for this film due to the acclaim almost everyone that I had spoken to was giving it. The thought that I hadn't seen this movie until it was finally released on DVD irked me in the sense that I would be missing the general theater experience that most movies deserve to be viewed in. I genuinely feel that ""3:10 to Yuma"" was that type of film.It wasn't that this movie was bad by any means, amazing actors such as Christian Bale, Russel Crowe, and Peter Fonda are enough to make any film fairly memorable. The thing that got me about this film however were the overused western themes and lack of complete realism. It sometimes felt hard to believe that characters could be using such profanity in America's early years while managing to dodge every bullet thrown at them.This appeared to me like the type of movie that you go to the theaters to see and really don't do much with it afterward. It's good enough to get the critical acclaim it seeks as a general thriller with lack of a building foundation. This movie is certainly not worth buying but for the casual moviegoer it's something that at least the men in your family will enjoy while it's on.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Russell was good in this,"Crowe should have won the Oscar for this - it's a fine piece of film-making boasting good visuals and a strong central premise - if we draw a discreet veil over the ridiculous ending - back in the thirties you could just about get away with Jimmy Cagney screaming in terror as he went to the chair in Angels With Dirty Faces so that the punks who idolized him might think twice about emulating him; but Russell Crowe walking onto the train voluntarily just so Christian Bale's son will admire his dead father is just a bad joke - and Good versus Evil is, after all, what the Western has always been about but this one wants to have it both ways so that Crowe's Ben Wade is subtly elevated to a Huey Long figure who does bad in order to do good. If they WERE bent on changing the original - and they WERE because the bulk of that took place in the hotel room allowing Ford and Heflin to spark off each other, whereas in this version the hotel room sequence is probably less than ten per cent of the total footage - then they would have been better to give more screen time to Gretchen Mol as Bale's wife and explore their clearly troubled relationship in more depth.

The Western Return to the Big Screen,"This was a Western well worth watching. The genre is not dead after all. The film is full of star power but still gritty enough to be appreciated by the art-house crowd. Christian Bale is Dan Evans, a husband, father, and ex-war veteran with a gimpy leg. Russell Crowe is the villain, an intelligent crook who commits crimes purely to make money he didn't earn. He's not a bad guy. Ben doesn't kill out of spite.In a purely dumb luck encounter, Dan ends up helping to capture Ben. The sheriff is going to play completely by the book. Ben won't be hung. He will given a fair trial in Yuma. But Ben's gang is sure to try and stop them. The local sheriff decides to hire 4 men to get Ben to the train on time, Dan being one of them.Dan's oldest son, William, is so enamored with Ben he can't see straight. On the side, he reads dime store novels about Ben's adventures. He is ashamed of his father and his supposed weakness. After all, his dad hasn't been able to protect the family from fires intended to drive the family out of coveted land. William ends up following Ben against his father's strict orders and joining this band of make-do deputies.Throughout the course of the journey to deliver Ben to the authorities, Dan is wary to get too close to Ben. But whenever a group of men spend time together, a bond of brotherhood is inevitably formed. Dan ends up saving Ben's life on more than one occasion and vice versa. You can't help but like Ben more than any of the ""good guys."" When he starts knocking his captors off one by one, he only goes for the annoying people. One man actually helped burn down Dan's house. This is not a guy we miss. The other casualty is Byron, a man who insults Ben's mother. And he sure knows how to woo the ladies. He talks to them and makes them feel like they are better than their lots in life.The strongest thing about this film is the two lead actors. At first glance, they appear to be two sides of one coin: the wholesome family man and the glamorous criminal. What could they possibly have in common? Ben is constantly surrounded by mindless thugs, especially Charlie Prince, a man who is apparently in love with Russell Crowe, though subconsciously. He kind of enjoys talking to the ethical, rational Dan.In an amazing set of circumstances I can't explain fully, Ben ends up aiding Dan in his attempt to get him on the train. This film is a favorite of the year and is sure to foster awards in the winter.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Surpising and Enjoyable Treat,"The production of traditional cowboy (or more commonly known as Western) movies swiftly ended with the retirement of actors such as John Wayne. The occasional Western film is brought out from time to time such as Dances with Wolves and the Magnificent Seven which still contained elements of their classic forefathers. Yet today, Western films have taken a different turn, amplifying the evil wills of the bad guys and developing character plots far more than the classics, such as ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"". 310 To Yuma is just that, it's another newly produced film of the present breed of Western films. The character development between the ""evil as hell"" Russel Crowe and ""pride wounded"" Christopher Bale is surprising and memorable at the sacrifice of logic. Towards the end the viewer is left with many unanswered questions and left to assume with their own interpretations. The storyline was fairly adequate to a real western story of crime, not blowing the whole thing out of proportion. I personally enjoyed the malevolence of the supporting actors it made the film more memorable. Commendable mentions to Ben Foster who whenever talked had an affect on the audience. There weren't any clear messages of the film, besides looking out for your family and die hard. Just another tale of good vs evil. It's not exactly an instant classic but it's worth seeing on either the big screen or television set. The action certainly won't let you down and you won't be left disappointed. This movie seems to be a building block for new generation audiences and will help guide the path for more Western films in the years to come. Overall, I give it a 3.5 stars and it's worth watching a second time.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Who says all the good guys have all the dignity?,"I watched this movie on a DVD which one of my friends brought. Heres the catch-line that I made after wathcing it -> Who says that all the good guys have all the dignity? The movie starts with Rusell Crowe pulling off a big loot with his nasty and mean gang members by using Chritain Bales cattle (Christian Bale being a ranch owner is on the lookout for his cattle). Crowe is one of the most wanted and famous hoods (outlaw) wanted in almost all the counties. As the movie progresses you get that feeling of hatred for the villainous Crowe, how evil, sadistic and mean he is, Crowe certainly takes the charm over Bale through out the movie. The way Crowe confronts the Bar Girl, Bales wife, the way he keeps drawing all the pictures of everyone he meets or every good thing he sees; that maybe his way of easing the pressure or just relaxing, but believe me CHICKS DIGG THAT! :) So, you wonder why all the bad guys have all the good girls well, start drawing pictures or just need to get witty and bad like Crowe I tell you; Naaaah Im just kidding, but wait there's some truth in there about what Im trying to say. There are some perks in between where Crowe takes care of the Apaches and helps the Crew get out of the tunnel. Then comes the climax where Bale needs to prove himself to his kid that his father ain't a coward, so Bale decides to take Crowe to the train at 3:10 to Yuma singularly. Crowe consistently tries to push Bale over the edge about why he's doing this, why he's going thru all this pain of putting him on the 3:10 to Yuma? but Bale's ignorant answers keeps Crowe thinking. Crowe(Ben Wayed) is a smart, witty and intelligent outlaw he doesn't need all the answers he is smart enough to figure that out on his own. Then comes that gripping moment when Bale has to get Crowe out from the Motel singularly to the train station and while the clock is ticking Crowe tells Bale about his childhood. About how he was casted-away by his own mother at a train station where his mother tells him to wait at the train station while she goes to take the tickets giving a bible in Crowe's hands and telling him to read that. The end of this movie proves everyone wrong! Villains are not born bad, its us who are responsible for that.The movie is nicely pictured, casted and directed. Reincarnates some of the memories of good old Clint Eastwood's wild west movies. All the actors have done very well, in particularly Rusell Crowe, I mean how would you expect a Gladiator to become an evil and witty outlaw from the west in cowboy suits. Crowe is certainly the center-point of the whole movie. And I can bet that no one else could have done it better than Crowe. No offense to Chirstian Bale himself, he's also become a mature actor after his Batman success. Indeed a cheerful story that you can preach to your youglings, or just enjoy it with friends. A definite Oscar nominee should I say it is.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

hard to like and harder to watch,"When a sixgun fires a hundred bullets -- instead of only six -- it should be grounds for firing the director because it proves he doesn't know what he's doing.The original 3:10 to Yuma is an eloquent drama about persevering through hardship, being a good role model to your boys and a hero to your wife, and doing the right thing in the face of life-threatening danger while not giving into the temptation to take the easy way out. It's an American classic and one of the great westerns of the 1950s.I was hoping this remake would make a few adjustments to the original script and stage the story in an artful way, taking advantage of color, authentic costumes and props that are available now, and the beautiful New Mexico scenery. With everything going for it, including big stars and a big budget, this remake is a blown opportunity because the film makers have no idea what a western is supposed to be or do. Instead of telling a simple story we can relate to, this remake is an exercise in misandry (yes, that's a word, coined in the 1970s) that plays out like a spaghetti western made three decades to late, with ridiculous over-the-top action, sadistic violence, bombastic dialog, and vicious, whining, undignified characters who behave in unbelievable ways. It's a cartoon with people. There is not one single realistic or believable moment. There is not one moment that wasn't done better in the original. The new material, consisting mostly of an electrocution, an Indian attack, and various forms of carnage is no improvement. Even New Mexico, still the most pictorial location for westerns, looks better in other movies.Compared to other recent westerns like Appaloosa, The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford, Open Range, and There Will Be Blood, this remake of 3:10 to Yuma simply doesn't measure up. Skip it. Watch one of those or the original if you want to see a quality western.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
The price of redemption -- READ THIS if you had problems with the ending,"This remake involves the capture of a notorious outlaw, Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), who is then escorted to the town of Contention to await the train to Yuma, where he'll be hanged. A desperate rancher, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), hires on for the escort job because he needs the $200 for his family to survive. Wade plays psychological games the entire time trying to corrupt Evans, but things turn out differently.The cast is outstanding (which also features the beautiful Gretchen Mol and Peter Fonda), the New Mexican locations are great and the score ranks with the all-time best. Most importantly the picture is engaging throughout its 2 hour runtime, not to mention the story gives the viewer a lot to chew on.The first hour of the film is realistic but what turned me off during my initial viewing was the second hour's mounting implausibilities. Thankfully, most of these can be explained.One issue is when a man burns to death locked in a wagon carriage. The quibble is that he doesn't scream enough in fiery torment. But watch the scene and you'll clearly hear him yelling in the background. Evan's loss of a limp at the climax is more of an issue, although this can be explained by an adrenaline rush.One problem I had was that Ben Wade (Crowe) came off as super-human. There was seemingly nothing he couldn't do, even while handcuffed. I suppose this could be explained by the fact that there ARE people who are incredibly gifted to the point of being nigh super-human.In any event, this is not a realistic Western like, say, ""Wyatt Earp"" or ""The Long Riders."" No, ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a MYTHIC Western with an potent message. If you can't handle strong mythic elements in Westerns look elsewhere.When I first saw the film I didn't get the ending and it turned me off. But it was clear that there was more to the picture than what first meets the eye so I decided to view it again. It DOES make sense, it's just that you might miss it on your initial viewing because the events flash by so quickly. When you DO see it, it'll blow you away.***SPOILER ALERT*** DO NOT READ FURTHER UNLESS YOU WANT AN EXPLANATION OF THE FILM!Wade is a confident and talented man who smugly looks down on others, acting like a disciple of Nietzsche who has no moral obligation to anyone, least of all God. He senses simple purity in Evans and plays the role of tempter, trying to corrupt Evans and win him to his way of thinking. But as they wait in the hotel room it is Evans who ""converts"" Wade, in a sense. Evans doesn't accomplish this in any type of contrived manner, he accomplishes it simply by being WHO HE IS -- an undefiled, courageous family man who stubbornly refuses to give up on hope, faith, life, righteousness and family.As they're waiting, Wade sketches a picture of Evans in a book. It is later shown that this sketch was made on an opening page of a Bible. This reveals that Wade came to view Evans as a Christ figure, at least subconsciously, and that Evans is clearly a type of Christ in the story.What exactly was it that caused Wade to ""convert"" and support Evans? (1.) He saw in Evans a man that refused to be bought -- a man who refused to be corrupted by filthy lucre, which was something he never experienced before. (2.) Evan's son insisted that there was still some good in Wade despite his wicked history. Regardless of Wade's denial, the kid was right. The idea that SOMEONE saw a glimmer of good in him, that SOMEONE out there BELIEVED in him despite his past evil deeds ultimately moved him and compelled him to support Evans. (3.) Wade turned evil because he was abandoned as a kid. He saw in Evans and his wife a REAL family -- parents who stayed together and refused to abandon faith, hope, righteousness and family come hell or high water. He became convinced that Evans and his family were worth supporting, even perhaps dying for. (4.) Evans made a deal with the Pinkerton that if he successfully got Wade to the train the Pinkerton would make sure Evans' family got $1000, which would bail them out of their hardships. Wade wanted to make sure the family got that money. Somewhere deep inside he wanted to redeem himself of his wicked past and this was the opportunity. This could be the beginning of a new life.(5.) Wade's relationship with Evans lasted only a few days but he found something that was missing in all his other relationships - a friendship based on respect rather than familiarity or shared events. Great friendships like this can happen quickly similar to love-at-first-sight. Such relationships are conducive to transparency, which explains why Evans reveals to Wade the real reason he lost his leg in the war.After Evan's brutal death Wade has an even greater revelation: To see a truly undefiled man -- a simple but GREAT man -- murdered by a group of immoral swine fills him with disgust. You can see it on his face. Yes, he should be thankful that his men remained loyal to him but this was about their only redeeming quality. To truly start a new life he would have to be judge and executioner of the corrupted souls who would pull him back down into the slime.Why did Evans have to die? Because redemption can only be paid via the spilling of blood. It was the price for Wade to live and have a new life.GRADE: A",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
It just works...,"The western is an interesting genre. It can work either as plot driven or character driven. If we look at the 1957 version of 3:10 to Yuma, we can see an excellent example of a plot driven western - the characters are little more than stick figures moving around within the plot - Ben Wade and Dan Evans never really come to life. While the 2007 film retains and even expands the plot, it is the character development of these two that makes this movie great. Russell Crowe's Ben Wade is as complex a character as we're likely to find and Christian Bale's Dan Evans only slightly less so. Others have complained that it drags - and it is 30 minutes longer - but those parts that ""drag"" are part of the character development. Of course, individually, we like what we like and those unable to follow what these two actors are doing should look elsewhere.Just a word about ""based on a short story by Elmore Leonard"". The Elmore Leonard story is about 15 pages and plants only a seed of plot for the movie. That this movie could arise from that seed is masterful writing. It reminds me of ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" which is based on a 39 page short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Again, Fitzgerald's story only plants a seed for what develops into a great story. (And Fitzgerald's short story isn't even one of his better efforts.) For me, movies fall into three categories - those I can't make it through the first time, those I can watch once and enjoy, and those that I can watch again and again, picking up something new each time. This is one of those in that last category.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very good but hoped some more dedication from Bale.,"I really enjoyed this movie. Nowadays it is pretty hard to make a good western but this one surely is. Everyone who hasn't seen it, start thinking about it because believe me, its worth your money and time. But I don't want to talk much about the film, lets talk more about the actors now.Russell Crowe - Well, as always, you can expect a superb performance from him, although he didn't much surprise. He's character wasn't that hard to play either.. but characters in western never are.Ben Foster - I can't begin explaining how amazed I am. He just jumped out of nowhere with hes performance. Although he had a major role in Alpha Dog, it wasn't a big movie. I think he will have a huge acting career.Christian Bale - For a long time, he was one of my favourite actors but that rising sled is falling. He hasn't given a good performance since Prestige. Hes still good, but not as good as he used to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A brilliant character study; an old-fashioned Western with a modern twist,"As beloved as it is, it cannot be denied that the Western is a dead genre, and for justified reasons. The same all-American clear-as-crystal stark morality of good versus evil that attracted us to the comic book superheroes of the second World War period also drew us to the heroic endeavors of the old American frontiersmen who explored and developed the far west. Ethics in the classic Westerns were simple: The good, honest men wore white and always defeated the bad, criminal men who wore black in a showdown. One could almost say that the old Westerns glorified the post-Civil War western frontier, which truly was a dark, difficult, and dangerous life for those who chose to live it. But this kind of morality quickly wore off, and when America turned to more complex super-heroes so the stark good-versus-evil morals of the Western genre began to outstay its welcome. Since then, Westerns saw only one other renaissance in the form of the Spaghetti Westerns of the 60's, whose morals were present but somewhat twisted. Since the 60's the Western genre saw few resurgences, the last one in the turn-of-the-90's with Kevin Costner's epic Dances with Wolves and Clint Eastwood's opus, Unforgiven. And now, we have another resurfacing of the genre with 2005's The Proposition and 2007's 3:10 To Yuma and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.What is so good about these modern-day Westerns is that they are just that; old-fashioned stark morality is replaced by modern-day foggy-lined morals; 3:10 To Yuma provides an exquisite example of these plays on morality. Here is a hero that just wants to scrape by his simple farm life and performs heroic acts for selfish reasons only  erasure of debts, monetary reward, and his family's well being. Here is a villain who is obviously superiorly intelligent than his crew of cutthroats and who seems more preoccupied with bible verses and drawing sketches of nature than a life of crime. It's every man for himself, just like it was in the actual frontier.I must admit, I haven't seen the 1957 original, but James Mangold does an exquisite job in his re-make/re-imagination. Although the film is overall old-fashioned, it still features many modern film-making techniques aside from the blurry morality of the brilliant screenplay and the down-and-dirty depiction of Wild Western life. Hand-held cameras and very modern-styled action photography are wonderfully employed, and in general the cinematography is a wonder to behold; naturalistic while managing to be stimulatingly beautiful. Mangold also directs like a modern director, allowing his brilliant actors to explore their characters and deliver powerhouse performances full of nuance and subtlety.Indeed the entire ensemble cast can be mentioned in good light, especially supporting actors Peter Fonda as the scarred, craggy old bounty hunter who is one of the best examples of blurry morality in the film; in this chapter of his life he is under contract for the ""good guys"", but we learn that he has had no problem in the past murdering women and children; and Ben Foster, who delivers a truly scenery-chewing and brilliant performance as outlaw Ben Wade's clearly deranged right-hand man. But the true wonder lies in the film's two top-billed actors, among the best of their generation: Christian Bale and Russell Crowe.The two plays off one another to absolute, pitch-perfect brilliance, and both manage to find the niches of both of their characters. It's wonderfully fascinating to watch how Crowe plays Wade as enjoying his playful-but-deadly manipulations of the party accompanying him to the train that will take him to Yuma prison to be tried and hanged. Only Bale's Dan Evans can provide the proper contrast to this, as his straight-man routine is coupled with obvious intelligence. He seems out of place in this landscape and we learn that he was originally from Massachusetts but was forced to move to the dry weather of the western frontier due to his young son's illness. For someone with so much to lose, we the audience  and even the characters in the film, including Evans himself  don't know exactly why he is so stubborn in delivering Wade to the train. Is all the trouble really worth the $200 reward? Or is Evans simply trying to prove something to his wayward eldest son who doesn't have faith in his father, who is embarrassed to tell him the tragically un-heroic way he lost his leg in the Civil War. The ""battle of wits"" reaches a climax as the two sit in a hotel room near the end of the film, waiting patiently for the train to arrive. The little conversation they have is rather banal, but we learn so much from the characters just by seeing how Evans is willing to open himself up to the outlaw, and how Wade listens intently to his story.Like the greatest intelligent movies, 3:10 To Yuma is a character study of the kind that the characters don't have one simple trait that identifies them but rather are three-dimensional, fleshed out human beings who fascinate us with their unclear intentions, fears, regrets, mistakes and quirks. The film is incredibly well acted from its ensemble cast in general and its two stars in particular, and Mangold truly delivers the goods on the directing plane with his old-fashioned film-making with a modern twist in terms of the cinematography and action directing. This is a fascinating, realistic and brutally honest portrayal both of the 19th century Western frontier and of the morality of men, and is an extremely satisfying, entertaining and well-made film in general.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
An exhilarating ride elevated by its characters,"I quite loved it. Westerns are the one genre that I always seem to enjoy but are rarely made, and this was a fantastic, old-school, kick-ass genre flick. Not only does it have some exhilarating action scenes and some good 'ol shootouts, but it's got a great story with ample amounts of depth, solid characters, and a terrific ending. Crowe and Bale play off each other perfectly, with the former's charisma and wit contrasting excellently with the latter's subtlety and stoicism. And the finale, while eschewing logic and reason for an adrenaline rush, makes perfect thematic and even narrative sense. It's not overtly stylistic or artistic, but it is a fantastic thrill ride of a movie that's a near-masterpiece of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
High Noon Time with 3:10 to Yuma,"Although the western film recently experienced a brief resurgence with Unforgiven, the number of quality ones has been few like Open Range. With the remake of the 1956 cult western, 3:10 to Yuma, (itself adapted from a short story by Elmore Leonard), the genre is primed for another comeback with this tense, well acted film.Set in the old west not long after the Civil War, a cattle rancher, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), and his family struggle to make a life for themselves as a local businessman threatens to foreclose on his property and make way for a railroad. His cattle are poached by outlaws led by Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his lieutenant, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster in a surly, effective performance). The criminals rob a money wagon (in a scene right out of Heat done western style) and stop at a local town. Wade is captured by local lawmen and is escorted to catch the Yuma prison train, which is hours away from arriving. Evans offers to join the group in return for some valuable reward money that will ultimately help his family's plight. Thus begins a tortuous journey that has potential repercussions for Evans' family and Wade's bid for freedom even as his gang is in pursuit. Will Evans and his motley crew get Wade to the railroad station in time and who will survive? Director James Mangold, fresh from his successful biopic, Walk the Line, again elicits strong performances from his two leads, Crowe and Bale. Crowe is everything we expect him to be, and his role is Oscar worthy. His outlaw is a cultured, Bible-quoting man who effuses an animal magnetism that is appealing to men and women. What is so satisfying here is that Bale is equally up to the task and really shines in a difficult, challenging role. The supporting cast is uniformly sharp with special nod to a grizzled, unrecognizable Peter Fonda as a tough bounty hunter. Logan Lerman is effective as Evans' older son who is ashamed of and gradually realizes a growing respect for his father. Luke Wilson has an amusing bit role as a corrupt railroad hand.The film has a plot similar to the 1950's westerns High Noon and Last Train from Gun Hill, and encompasses elements of the classic western formula, namely the cattleman versus the railroad; only in this case, it is used as a jumping off point to a deeper, more psychological conflict. This is really a movie about what motivates people to do what they do. Most of the dialogue involves Wade's hurling insults and quips at a stoic Evans. We can see that Wade has a respect and growing admiration for Evans' seemingly hopeless quest, and the emerging facts have a strong bearing on what is to come. We learn about Wade's childhood and about what truly guides Evans' reasons for taking such a risky mission. His role in the Union Army during the Civil War comes to the fore. And how did he get his leg maimed? These shades of background and characterization enrich an already tense and interesting plot. The memorable ending, which pushes credibility just a tad, truly tests each man's resolve and sense of justice.Production values are strong with beautiful cinematography by Phedon Papamichael (Walk the Line, The Pursuit of Happiness). The film moves at a deliberate, methodical pace (editor Michael McCusker) and is never boring. It gets to the conflict fairly quickly and reaches its finale, an agonizing chase across town that is quite exciting and riveting right to the startling end.Make no mistake, this is a film that western enthusiasts will love while those who appreciate a strong, tense character study will find much to savor. Although we expect gold performances from Crowe and the ever maturing Bale (hard to believe this was the boy in Spielberg's Empire of the Sun), it is Mangold's prowess in that delicate balance of critically acclaimed, popular film-making, that may become a major force in Hollywood for years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Instant classic,"Just when you think nothing else can be done with this ancient genre, along comes something like this! A simple, simple story, told straightforwardly, with grace and no sentimentality at all -- completely astounding, spot-on psychological portrayals by the main actors, and sure-handed technical expertise from both director and cinematographer. I can't say enough about the beauty of Crowe's and Bale's performances -- these two are gems, surrounded by solid gold supporting actors who managed to exude pure character from every line. Though I'm not really a big fan of westerns, there are a few which I have placed in the pantheon of 'must-see' movies -- The Outlaw Josey Wales, There Was a Crooked Man, True Grit, The Cowboys, Unforgiven, and now 3:10 to Yuma.

Three things make this movie worthwhile....,"Russell Crowe, Christian Bale and Ben Foster. This movie is basically your run of the mill Western but the acting is what brings this movie from just okay to really good. Those that compare this movie to Unforgiven probably need to go give that movie another look because it certainly isn't in that league but it comes close. The direction of James Mangold and the performances of the three leads are clearly what make this film work. Russell Crowe is in his usual top form confirming my belief that he will go down as one of the greatest actors of the last twenty years. And Christian Bale continues to prove that there is virtually no limit to his versatility. But the real surprise of this film is Ben Foster. He looked familiar but I didn't place him as the same guy who played Claire's dysfunctional boyfriend from Six Feet Under until about a third of the way through the film. All I can say is that he pulls of playing a bad guy with ease and he has a magnetic screen presence. This guy is the real deal and I predict great things for him. I don't know that you have to see this in the theater but if you choose too it certainly wont be a waste of your money.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A great film and one of the years best,"Its been a while since I saw this and I'm still trying to find some words.The plot concerns a noted outlaw, Russel Crowe, caught in a small town. He has to be taken to a larger city with a rail connection where he will put him on the titled train. Along for the ride is a rancher, played by Christian Bale, a slightly disgraced man with a family and mounting debts who's trying to do the right thing even though his kids and his wife don't understand him or his choices. As the men get closer to the train the run into several obstacles, not the least of which are Crowe's men who are very intent on freeing their leader, no matter what the cost.A remake of a 1957 ""classic"" western this updated retelling adds some shading and some violence for a creation that is uniquely its own. Violence aside this film seems to belonging more in the classic era of the western. However ""old fashioned"" though it maybe in the telling (as someone said in a review its clear that no one told director James Mangold that the western was dead), the film benefits from the muddying of the moral sensibilities since things are never as clear as the may have been in a by gone time.Why anyone is doing anything is never clear, even the hero played by Bale who is clearly carrying a chip on his shoulder the size of Montana. This grayness helps to make the good guys seem better and the bad guys worse since we know that what ever choice they have made its at great personal expense.Some are hailing the film as a classic, others are liking it but not loving it. I'm really confused about it. To be certain the film is close to being, if not on, the list of best films of the year (I also keep wanting to use the term mythic, especially since it seems to shift into that mode at times). The question for me is whether its a classic or not. I've been going back and forth on the subject for the couple of hours and I still don't have an answer, which is why I can't really write about the film, even though it deserves to deeper discussion.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good old fashion Western,The best part of this western is Russel Crowe. He steals the movie from everyone else. Crowe's performance is enigmatic as he makes it cool to be an outlaw. From his mannerisms to his outfit he personifies a cool bad guy. He also makes his bad guy character intelligent too. Apart from Crowe; here is a terrific story. At the end of the day its about telling a story. This story is paced well and linear. The movie also provides a realness in its use of gun play and explosions. One cannot critique this movie without mentioning the performance of Ben Foster. He plays a more deranged bad guy than Crowe and without the charm but he does so in a mesmerizing fashion. 3:10 To Yuma is a great example of how a great Western can be and illustrates that they still can be made well today. I encourage everyone to see this movie. If you have never seen a Western this movie will make you a fan of the Western genre!,,Anonymous,Crime
Outlaws a la Robin Hood?,"Watched this film with so many great expectations - very few were met. The film started out as a standard tale of heartless monster outlaws and lawful upstanding men that vow to bring one of them, Wade (played by Russel Crowe), to justice. But it rapidly derailed into a politically correct farcical piece that ended most senselessly with the outlaw trying to uplift the honest man, decimating his own gang and voluntarily boarding a train to Yuma prison. What is wrong with that, you ask? Maybe he was ready to do penance for his sins, but the makers were not happy to even throw us that bone - they showed him whistling for his horse and the animal running alongside the train in an implied escape.Along the way the Pinkerton man was shown to be a Bible thumper who killed three year old Apache children, the outlaw had so much appeal for the women, and could charm children too. There were no moments of real tension in the film, no character that pulled me in, the situations were extremely contrived and the last 30 minutes were cobbled together in a laughable manner. Mr. Crowe was his usual suave lady-killer self - no matter if he was supposed to be an outlaw. Mr. Bale was more in character and did do a fine job, but could not salvage the film. Top 250? This one is eminently forgettable. To get the dubious taste of this travesty out of my mouth I will have to watch the modern day Western masterpiece Unforgiven yet again.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Western of the Last Quarter of a Century,"it is by far the best western remake (even if they have not been many)since the the well known classic Unforgiven and in some ways its perfection in acting, direction, music and storytelling surpassed the original that was made in 1957. at first i was one those idiots who were sceptical about this remake as i liked the original a great deal and was not sure of the idea of having 2 non American playing western character, even was angry at the casting inclusion of the newcomer Ben Foster and refused to see at the cinemas for those reason but boy was i very wrong!! i have watched it more than once and still this film doesn't fail to surprise me. its the closest thing you will ever get to the spaghetti movies in terms of style and soundtrack but most of the acting style and dialogue that was so similar to those films i even doubted myself at times that i was watching a 2007 film with Crowe or Batman guy Bale. this film is not about good and evil or doing justice, in fact its about lots of themes and my favourite one was when Bale succeeded in making you believe who and what he was and.. i will not go in-depth because i want you to experience hell of a movie and it is definitely the only Oscar worthy film of this year and it will be a huge disappointment if this instant classic doesn't get nominated and recognised by the awards.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not one of the great epic Westerns,"This is a re-upholstered version of the original. It has great sets, authentic locations and props.The makeup was overdone on most of the actors except Crowe. The costumes were ""costumey"". The official railroad representative looked like a strolling singer on Main Street in Disneyland.There is plenty in the story and characters to hold interest. But, I didn't like the manner in which one key character was rather unceremoniously eliminated from the story at mid point. The scene truly demanded a bit more theater to it. It left a bit of a hole.Also, one brutal scene involved burning a man alive. (I closed my eyes and covered my ears. I don't like recalling those scenes later.) With a little creativity they could have implied the violence and made that scene more memorable and less graphic. That scene is probably a reason for the 'R' rating. The rest of the ""shoot-em-up"" gore is pretty standard.Fans will enjoy Crowe as a smug (underplayed),western outlaw.Overall, the acting is very good (including the hero's son played by young actor Logan Lerman).This film is nowhere near being in the same league as say, 'The Magnificent Seven', 'Legends of the Fall', 'Tombstone', 'Once Upon a Time in the West' etc. This film won't be counted with them.Lastly remember, this is NOT FOR KIDS.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

He wastes a lot of time promoting the politically correct Hollywood agenda of trying to make bad guys look like good guys and good guys look like bad guys.Crowe's gun is called ""The Hand of God"" and has a Crucifix on the handle. Yes Catholics, a Crucifix not just a cross. You're treated to a long camera shot of the handle just to make sure you get it.He quotes scripture like he was vomiting curse words, he verbally spits on Christianity and Christians in general and makes sure that Jesus gets the ""Hollywood Required"" dose of ridicule. What cowardly tripe. The Duke would eat this guy for lunch.The ending of the film is absolutely unbelievable. There was no satisfactory wrap up, just a complete unraveling of any pretense of a sensible story line.P. T. Barnum was right.

not as forceful or fiery as it could be yet a solid showing nonetheless,"Ben Wade and Dan Evans; two men on opposite sides of the law.

The plot nuances between Evans and Ben Wade and Charlie Prince conjures up an existentialist dilemma, that blurs the lines between good and bad ,while at the same time delineating both.

The other reason why I loved this move is that it was such a pleasure to watch professionals enter their characters and refuse to budge even for an instant in front or the camera; such acting forces you to identify with the characters and submerges you deeper into the film.Christian and Crowe were crack a lacking, just taring up the screen; wonderful performances. Mr Lerman can act; has an uncanny ability of putting on an alter ego and reducing his own; hope to see a lot more from him in the future. Peter Fonda gave a certain old school credence to this film.

The perfect pair for a western,Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are both spectacular in this film. A real enjoyable film. Had this movie been made 15 years earlier it'd have had Clint Eastwood in it. Crowe's character was the most interesting and he played it perfectly. Bale was amazing as usual as the complicated rancher. Peter Fonda's character was brief but interesting. Ben Foster stole the show in every scene he was in. This movie kind of reminded me of Unforgiven just with some of the scenery shot and the pace. The clothes they wore in the movie were really cool especially Crowe's. Bale's son in the film did a pretty good job. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good western.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Banal.,"In all fairness,the major portion of the disappointment is associated with the expectations that go with a venture like this.One would expect a thrilling mental bout between Ben Wade(Russel Crowe) and Dan Evans(Christian Bale),instead what we are treated to a very banal western fare.The biggest folly of this film being that it tries to be deeper than it actually is.Much like the recent soporific,monologue-ridden ""The Brave One"".Dan Evans is a troubled rancher,with debts and family problems,the usual,the usual and Ben Wade is a cutthroat bandit(if you can ever call Russel Crowe that!)with a infamous reputation for being ruthless and unmerciful(and still takes a liking towards a nondescript Dan Evans).Not much of a premise,still we'll buy anything for a good narrative.Again there we are disappointed as we endure the main characters going from place to place shooting up stuff and being impervious to bullets,while the unimportant ones get killed on the way.Its not all bad though,the only reason one can sit through this 2-hour long movie is for the charismatic Russel Crowe and the very talented Christian Bale.They really carry off their performances with aplomb.Its really a pity they didn't have a better story to act to.And other characters are hardly noticed,for example,all Ben Foster(Charlie Prince,second-in-command to Ben Wade)does is try to look scary in front of men twice his size and shoot anything moving with his ever accurate aim.He was better off as a junkie in ""Alpha Dog"".Its really disappointing to see a movie with so much potential laid to waste.What could have been a modern western classic with characters foraying into each others' minds is turned into a mediocre action film with an incredulously shallow story line,improbable plot and unnecessary amount of gunfire(most of them not finding their mark on the only two fleeing targets,Obviously Ben and Dan).",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Just as Good as the Original,"3:10 to Yuma is one of those few remakes that's on par with its original. A desperate, down on his luck rancher, Dan Evans, played by a very convincing Christian Bale volunteers to traverse a dangerous outlaw, Ben Wade,(Russell Crowe) to a train that will take Wade to a Yuma prison. Bale and Crowe are two of the best male actors today and they're excellent to watch on screen.Major props should go to screenwriter Michael Brandt(2Fast 2Furious), for weaving a story that has added even more heart to an already excellent original. Ben Wade and Dan Evans aren't stereotypical good vs. evil characters. They're complex leads who have backgrounds that pave the way for the people they have become.The story might get a little too compact in the middle with everything from Native Americans, Ben's gang, and tough train workers put in the story, but it's all made up for in the end where an exceptionally well directed climax is installed.The Acting is superb, the action is top-notch, and the story is original. 3:10 to Yuma is a western that won't be soon forgotten.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A drama of morality and redemption within a Western--superbly done.,"Christian Bales and Russell Crowe are perfectly cast as the protagonists in this Western, as their respective characters seek redemption for their lifetime of failure and evil, respectively. Christian Bale's performance is especially riveting, as you come to know the character portrayed in the very depth of his soul. He finds redemption in his relationship with the villain Wade(Russell Crowe)and in his heroic behavior within the story. So, too, does the villain Wade, who finds his own redemption in his relationship with Dan (Christian Bale) and his final decision to give closure to the elder son. There is sufficient humanity and, indeed, humor in the portrayals by these characters, who are ably supported by the rest of the cast. This is a Western that can be enjoyed by serious film-goers who normally bypass this genre, and these same film-goers will regret missing this one if they do.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A good, but overrated, modern western","I had high hopes for this movie since it was rated high enough to crack the IMDb top 250. Ultimately, however, I concluded that the film is overrated although it is still one of the best westerns in recent memory (which, admittedly, is faint praise).First of all, forget about any artistry in the direction along the lines of Leone et al. Mangold's direction is mostly flavourless. The score and sound were recently nominated for Oscars but neither really stood out for me.The cast is fairly solid with a couple of standout performances in supporting roles, namely Ben Foster's villainous Charlie Prince and Peter Fonda's crotchety Byron McElroy. Headliners Bale & Crowe are solid, if not up to the level of some of their previous performances.My biggest problem with the movie was that it took a while for the story to 'grab' me. Luckily, the film does start to gather steam eventually and the ending even provides some subtle commentary on good guy/bad guy archetypes.Make no mistake, it's a good western, which is a rarity these days.

A Thriller of a Western,"In a genre that has long been dormant comes this film: a passionate, fast-paced, and thrilling adventure. 3:10 to Yuma is a Western with all the classic moments you hope for, and yet enough twists and intelligence to be original.Dan Evans is a rancher at the end of his rope and in need of cash to pay off debts. By chance, he agrees to escort a captured outlaw, Ben Wade, to the 3:10 to Yuma; the train that will take him to court and hanging. Wade's gang is close behind and being led by a murderous sidekick. And there's more to both men than what meets the eye...The character of Ben Wade is played brilliantly by Russell Crowe. Wade seems like a true gentlemen when you talk to him- but then without warning, his violent and deadly outlaw self can come out. And when it does, he becomes truly a thing of terror. Though not quite as terrifying as his sidekick, Charlie Prince, played eerily by Ben Foster in one of the best performances of the year. Christian Bale plays Dan, a rancher who is desperately seeking something to save both himself and his family.With a pulsing bass-driven score and action sequences you won't soon forget, 3:10 to Yuma is well-worth a watch. While staying true to the beloved Western genre it also brought new energy and life into it, creating a film that is not only exciting, but also thought-provoking. That is a great achievement. 7/10 stars!Jay Addison",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Superb use of close-ups, real feel of  the old west","In all great westerns it is the faces that tell the tale, and this excellent remake of the old classic is no exception. The close-ups in this movie are fantastic, and you really sense the pain these men have to endure in order to reach (or not, as the case may be!) their goals, both physical and metaphorical. My one great problem with this movie, and this is true of most westerns, is the role of the women, who are seen as classic examples of the Madonna/whore paradagm. This aside, the movie does capture the atmosphere of the west wonderfully well. You can feel the dust on you face, the snow falling on your clothing, and smell the smoky insides of the saloons. Also, my local cinema has a great sound system, so the shots really do whistle around your head.

3:10 To Yuma- You Can Afford Not to Be On Time for this One **1/2,"Russell Crowe does not exactly sound western here as Ben Wade, an outlaw who is vicious and cunning.The movie becomes preachy at the end when Crowe and Christian Bale, who delivers a great performance, become too friendly. Does Crowe try to show he is a person with a conscience when he reveals at the end that his mother gave him a bible to read and then abandoned him at age 8? Does he become sympathetic to the plight of rancher Bale, who wants to bring him in to face justice so that he can collect money to save his family and ranch.The part where the sheriff and posse abandon Bale and his son represents a complete reversal of the ""High Noon"" concept.Crowe and Bale are natural enemies who come to understand and even aid each other. The ending will sadden but shock you. Nevertheless, the concept that there is good even in the worst of people is cliché here.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Yuma Has Unexpected Depth,"Life has not been easy for Dan Evans. He fought in the Civil War and lost his foot. He settled down on a ranch, then got hit with a drought. He has a family, but one of his sons has tuberculosis, the other seems to hate his guts, and his wife no longer has faith in his ability to provide for them all. And then someone burns his barn down. Evans is a man who is beat down by the world every day. He is a failure in his son's eyes because he is not a war hero and he is not a dashing rogue like he reads about in his dime store novels. This character, played solidly by Christian Bale, has one of the best setups I've seen recently - a guy who is ripe for change in his life.Change comes in the form of Ben Wade (Russel Crowe), a dashing rogue just like the kind Dan's son reads about. Ben and Dan cross paths as the rancher is collecting his cows that were scattered by the barn burners. Ben proves to be a brutal man, but fair. He allows Dan to get his cattle, but relocates his horse so he can't fetch the law. Back in town, after Ben has been cornered in a saloon and placed under arrest, Dan offers to get Ben on the train to prison in exchange for enough money to save his family from all kinds of trouble.This is a thrilling ride, full of shootouts and horse chases through the desert, but it thankfully stays focused on the characters in the story. Ben Wade is a conflicted character from the outset. We first see him drawing a sketch of a hawk - a small hint that maybe he was never meant to be the leader of a gang. (I gather that not many thieves back then had much artistic ability.) After he's caught, he even shows sympathy for Dan's plight, though that doesn't stop him from trying to get away when he can.Like High Noon, this western is a story about a desperate man trying to do the right thing, even if it's also the foolish thing. You can't call Dan a coward and you can't call him stupid, either. Every step he takes to accomplish his mission is thought out and nothing depends on luck. One of the best new westerns in years, up there with Unforgiven, Open Range, and The Quick and the Dead.(Just kidding about that last one...) http://www.movieswithmark.com",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

The western makes a seeping comeback...,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningNotorious outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) finally slips up when he and his men try and highjack a Pacific Western train carrying buckets of money belonging to the treasury. The authorities catch him and want him sent on a 3:10 train to face trial in Yuma. They persuade struggling rancher and former soldier Dan Evans (Christian Bale) to escort him, which he agrees to do to set some things right in his life. But as he learns about Wade on the trip cross-country and his philosophy to life, his loyalties and duties become sorely tested.The western is a genre that's starting to crawl back out of it's cracks recently, what with Tommy Lee Jones's 2005 offering The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada and now this slightly more mainstream offering. No doubt written off by many as a thing of the past, back when Clint Eastwood was a big star, this distinctive type of film is thankfully slowly starting to see the light of day again.Director James Mangold has captured the essence and spirit of the genre wonderfully here, crafting a slow, atmospheric and undeniably tense film with great casting in the shape of Crowe and Bale as the respective villain and hero. The story is engaging and well written and keeps you gripped to the end.It doesn't quite come off as a brilliant film, but on the other hand there's nothing really to complain about with it.

Sometimes the line between good and bad run close together.,"Nobody, from the director and writer, to the actors on the screen, put a foot wrong in this movie. Beautifully shot, with an unobtrusive music score and a deep and powerful story, this is one of the best and most intelligent movies I have seen this year.Crow and Bale are perfectly cast, whereas Bale and Cruise (originally wanted for the part of Ben Wade), would have been a disaster in my opinion. I can't look at Cruise on film without thinking of him jumping up and down on a couch like a performing monkey, so his image has been wrecked in my mind.OK. The story.Bale plays the part of a small time farmer (Dan Evans) caught up in circumstances that overwhelm him but give him a chance to rise above what fate has handed to him. It is a part that Bale plays to perfection. His role is that of the good guy trying to make a honest days living in a corrupt world full of greed. Opposite him is Crow. Rotten, vicious, ruthless, smart and very dangerous, because he is so smart. Yet, each are two sides of the same coin. Were past circumstances different for these men, it would be easy to believe that each of these two characters could have turned out like the other. It is this fascinating and deep idea that makes the story work so well.Watching the interplay between these two main characters is the farmers son (played superbly by Logan Lerman) William Evans and throughout, you get the feeling that whatever happens to his father will determine the way the boy develops. A fact that is as true today as it was in the time of the old west that this story is set in. Barely trying to conceal the contempt the boy feels for his father, he is drawn to the exciting world of thief and killer, Ben Wade (Crow). Though I long for the day when Hollywood will once again portray fathers as decent and hard working men, this movie does not sink to the level of dad bashing that so many other productions do. The boy has a boys understanding and no move is made to comment on it one way or the other. That is a mark of the excellence of the writing. The audience is given the honour of being smart enough to work that out. In Hollywood movies today, that is a rare honour indeed.Into Dan and Williams already hard life crashes Ben Wade and his gang of killers and robbers. Abandoned by his mother as a child and cynical to the point of the near psychopathic, Wade has no time for sentiment. Women are used and discarded. Men are useful if they do what he says, but no use if they do not. As head of his gang, Ben Wade is more a lion tamer than a leader of men and he knows it. He has trained them the way circus people train dangerous animals and they do his will right, or they don't make it. his manipulation skills are finely honed and he uses them well to figure out others and find their weak spots. Yet, despite all of these character flaws, his intelligence and respect for bravery in others manages to make him a likable villain.Almost hidden in the background of this story there is a thread running through it that intelligent viewers will pick up on and hopefully think about. That thread is the vital importance of family life and the need for all of us to make certain we allow space for parents to be able to make a good job of bringing up their kids. Raising children is too important a job to be left to governments and no matter how much they try to take over that role, they should be resisted. If not, what you see in this movie is what you get. Fathers must be cut some slack and mothers supported, not by government alone, but by all of us. We have to end the cynical, hate filled attitudes of many of our young, by teaching them that law abiding parents are good people and not weaklings. We also have to tell governments, in no uncertain terms, to take their grubby hands off of our kids and family life. Stop listening to Oprah, parenting books and tapes and start listening to granny and granddad is my advice.All in all this is a great movie and one that deserves to win Oscars all around. I doubt it will, but I hope I am wrong. Oscars these days tend to be tools of politics and those that are not go to movies that are full of sentimental slush. Rarely, it seems, do films like this get the recognition all deserve.The tension in this movie is wonderfully built up by the director and writer alike. At no point does it have one of those Hollywood moments of sheer idiocy, where one of the characters does something superhuman and instantly kills the believability of the story. No strange camera angles to ruin the flow and jar the mind and no screaming music to distract you from the action on screen. Just plain and simple good craft throughout, with superb supporting roles from the rest of the cast.I give this 9 out ten. Excellent work all round.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

The shootouts are brutal. The tension between the lead characters is sharply edged. But the film for me is not completely satisfying. With character developments and revelations that strike me as being intended to reflect the complexities of today, the makers strive for ambiguity and achieve it, much to my disappointment. To me, westerns, even those that are deeply layered, have a certain simplicity, elegance and an unwavering moral compass.

The Kind of Movie I Thought We Couldn't Make Any more,"""3:10 to Yuma"" is the kind of movie I feared contemporary filmmakers had lost the ability to make: a coherent story, in which rich characters the viewer cares about, portrayed by real movie stars who can act and hold the viewer with their intense charisma, work through life problems the viewer can identify with; intelligently directed, beautifully produced, and so gripping the ending took me by surprise.Some have referred to recent films as ""post-human"" and ""post-star"" and ""post-modern"" in their disregard for narrative. That's all well and good, but every now and then you want the gifts a solid narrative offers, characters you can identify with, and real life issues you can care about. At moments like that, watch ""3:10 to Yuma."" Director James Mangold keeps the tension high. Christian Bale, as Dan Evans, a one-legged Civil War vet trying to keep his struggling Arizona ranch together, gives one of the best performances in recent film. He is always 100% true to the material. He brings Dan Evans to life. While watching Bale convey common decency, desperation, and quiet strength, I kept wondering, ""Where did Bale learn that? Where is he getting that from? What is he calling on?"" Bale's performance is all the more impressive given that he's up against Russell Crowe as the charming, evil outlaw Ben Wade. Small parts are beautifully cast. Ben Foster makes an impact with his depiction of Wade's sartorially dashing underling, Charlie Prince. Gretchen Mol as Dan's wife Alice, Alan Tudyk as a caring veterinarian, Peter Fonda as a Pinkerton man, the great beauty who plays a woman Wade takes up with for a brief assignation, the railroad men who torture Wade  every actor is perfect.""3:10 to Yuma"" is the kind of film that thinking people discuss the next day after seeing it.

An earnest modern Hollywood western; we can all be thankful for that,"When ""3:10 to Yuma"" first came out, I remember hoping it would reignite the genre, make westerns happen again. If a movie with 2 big stars couldn't do that, I dunno what could. Alas, what we've gotten since are ""True Grit"" . . . and ""Jonah Hex"". Mixed results to be sure.On its own, the movie plays out fairly conventionally, but for its two leads. Russell Crowe breezes through with star looks and charm (except for the final scene, which complicates his character . . . actually, the whole movie really comes alive in these final 10 minutes). For his part, Christian Bale's inborn intensity ably conveys his character's burdens, mostly in holding onto his land, but also in his desperation to do the right thing.

Decent,"First off, all the production efforts that went into this were great.And the small parts were good casting.I think the main problem, is the story itself.It's tough to root for a lame protagonist who only survives because the bad guy likes him - for the ENTIRETY of the film.Bale plays the character great, but he needed to do something, at some point to be likeable. Hell, he needed to do something - just so the audience can suspend disbelief. It makes the whole story a fantasy.He never does. Lol
It gets even weirder - because the Wade character and the Charley Prince character are written really cool, but I don't like how they're played by Crowe or Foster, at all.Crowe is too smug through it all, and Foster overacts the whole time.So the cool characters are played by bad casting, and the lame character is played by the actor who fits.And yes, the ending is dumb.It's not bad by the time you're done - it's just ends up very 'meh'.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Western. Updated.,"Everyone's saying it. This is the Western of the 2000s like Unforgiven was for the 90s. I liked Unforgiven, and I liked 3:10.I like 3:10 better, though. I dunno bout those of you who have seen the original of this film, and I dunno if they modified the story for this version, but it seemed to be one of the most original westerns I've seen. Or maybe its that I love Westerns without clichés. The supporting stereotypical characters seemed very grounded and real. The acting by Russel Crowe and Christian Bale is worth paying for alone. And the direction was great. The maturity of this film is priceless, something Hollywood is starting to dish out nowadays. My hat's off to James Mangold and his crew.I will probably have to tame my vote back down to 8 when I've psyched down a bit, cause it is a little slow in the earlier part of the film. This works for character building--and some great dialogue--and tension building, but the tension doesn't really get built until towards the end of the film, so that slower pace is definitely noticeable.Thats my only grovel, though, for a film that is personally a 9.5 out of ten, but I don't wanna build your expectations.

"""Just remember, it's your old man that hauled Ben Wade to that stationwhen nobody else would.""","A good western is hard to come by these days. In the 50's & 60's, guys like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood rose to stardom playing gunslingers in the old west. Over time though, the genre fell victim to endless clichés and schlock. So when a new western is released and manages to impress, I consider that quite an accomplishment. In 2005 I was pleasantly surprised by ""The Proposition"", and this year  I'm happy to say that ""3:10 To Yuma"" is a success.James Mangold's remake of the 1957 film is a crackerjack character piece set amidst deadly circumstances. Christian Bale plays Dan Evans, a down-on-his-luck rancher in danger of losing his land to a draught. As chance has it, he finds himself involved in the capture of famed outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe). The authorities look to Evans to help take Wade to Contention where he will be placed on the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. Evans agrees, as he not only feels morally obligated, but placement of Wade on the train carries a $200 bonus  enough to buy back his farm. Unfortunately for our heroes, Wade's gang is hot on their trail, and plan on getting their leader back by any means necessary.Director James Mangold, hot off his hit ""Walk the Line"", demonstrates a similar touch that he showed in the Cash biopic. While the film is competently shot and paced, it's his ability to work with actors that deserves recognition. ""Walk The Line"" featured Oscar nominated performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, two talented youngsters. With ""Yuma"", we have the privilege of watching two of today's finest actors go toe to toe. Christian Bale is well on his way to becoming the best actor of his generation. Whether playing Batman, Patrick Batemen, or Bob Dylan  Bale has demonstrated a range and depth of performance that is unparalleled in movies today. Russell Crowe is equally multi-talented, going from roles like ""Gladiator"", to ""The Insider"", to ""L.A. Confidential"" with ease. He also has an on screen intensity that is unmatched in Hollywood.In ""Yuma"" both actors are in fine form, and Mangold clearly is having fun watching sparks fly between them. The movie builds as a test of wills between the men. On one side is Evans, a noble man determined to provide for his family through an honest living. Then there's Wade, a cold blooded thief who quotes scripture just as fast as he kills. Their journey together finds them struggling to understand the other man, while trying to stay one step ahead of the other. Amidst the tension is a constant threat of violence. Their trail is filled with the likes of deadly Apache and greedy posses. Not to mention Wade's gang, determined to make it to the train before his captors and set him free. The film features numerous impressive shoot-outs and action sequences, including a nail biting gunfight during the last act. On the downside, it ends a bit too abruptly and asks the viewer to suspend some believe. All that is easily forgivable though. ""3:10 To Yuma"" is a quality western made better thanks to the first rate performances by the brilliant leads.3.5/4",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Solid cast, disappointing product.","2007's remake of '3:10 to Yuma' is a rather minor entry in the western genre, but an enjoyable one at that. Following the recent resurgence of the genre, 'Yuma' is the latest to attract an A-list cast to saddle up and hit the open plains of the west. Exquisite film-making doesn't always reflect its quality, nor does it help a padded running time, but this remains a picture worth hopping onto.Following in the footsteps of its 1957 original, '3:10 to Yuma' follows a poor but honest man's (Christian Bale) quest to deliver a famous criminal (Russell Crowe) to a railroads to catch the soonest jail-bound train to Yuma, Arizona. This is a well-meaning picture that attempts to say something about doing what is right versus what is easy, but 'Yuma' doesn't have enough depth to carry the weight of such a message. The very talented director James Mangold keeps the project together, but at times struggles greatly to keep the whole thing afloat when a bogged down second act tested this viewer's patience. Things reach that high-point payoff in the end that makes the trip worth the slow wait, but a two hour running time becomes excessive when there just isn't enough story to balance with.'3:10 to Yuma' is up to its head in capable and talented actors. From Russell Crowe to Christian Bale facing off in a psychological cat-and-mouse game to Ben Foster and Peter Fonda. Fine performances are delivered across the board, but much like the film itself, very few standout moments are found here. Ben Foster, perhaps proving himself to be a very underrated actor, is the best among the group here. His snide demeanor and piercing accent gives the film a great push whenever he fills the screen, despite how maddening his character may be.'Yuma' is a good film, but I find it far from great. It seems to take Mangold a long time to decide just what he wants this film to be, and by the time he does, it's very possible he's already lost the attention of some. There isn't a great deal to truly criticize here, because this is an undeniably well-made film. But in failing to drive things home in truly memorable fashion, 'Yuma' doesn't define the modern western and doesn't compare to recent efforts. But it's a solid outing for everyone involved, and at the end of the day, '3:10 to Yuma' manages to be an entertaining and at times blood-rushing thrill ride. It's just unfortunate that its attempt at morality doesn't come off as powerful as it would have hoped, because it kept this western from potentially being something much larger than itself.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ridiculous ending,"So Russell Crowe's character, a murderer and thief, deep down has a heart of gold and kills his crew there to rescue him just to save his rival's family?

An exciting and smart western with a contemporary flare,"Westerns might be making a comeback. With Americans' newfound appreciation of independent and more artistic film, such a statement isn't too off-base. ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a hell of a start, showing that great acting is more important than action in making a Western. There's nothing in the action that you can complain about, in fact there's nothing in the whole film that can be complained about, but the acting takes precedence and that's what sets this film apart.""Yuma"" is a remake that centers around a rancher named Dan Evans (Christian Bale) who is struggling to feed his family and beginning to doubt his image as a father and husband. He gets mixed up in the thievery of Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his band of outlaws and after Wade is caught, agrees (for the money) to be a part of a crew that is to escort Wade to a station where he is to take the 3:10 train to Yuma, or ultimately, his death. Of course the rest of Wade's bandits, led by Charles (Ben Foster) want him back and Wade will surely not be very compliant.The premise is simple, but every moment of the film is exciting. If there isn't action carrying the scene, then there are the great talents of this cast that make it interesting. Crowe is very strong in the antagonist role and Bale is great as always. It is amusing how a Welsh and an Australian actor give such believable portrayals of Americans. Ben Foster is also very easy to despise and moviegoers will be sure to see him more in the future.There might not be anything amazing about ""Yuma"" but I challenge anyone to find something bad or off about it. Director James Mangold is certainly credible enough to have all his bases covered. It's simply a clean cut Western with a modern mindset that makes itself clear in the characterization which is more about being real and cool than just being a cool and stereotypical cowboy. The acting gives the characters heart and really brings out the themes and morals of a film thats main intention is the action and excitement.""Yuma"" is the perfect merger of a glitzy Hollywood Western action film with great drama led by great acting: the ideal film in from a money standpoint and from a quality standpoint and arguably those films deserve the most praise.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
This movie blew me away!  One of the Best Westerns ever made!,"To great regrets, I missed this movie in the theaters a few months ago. So I anxiously went out and bought this movie last night on Blu-ray disk at release date, saw it, and loved it instantly! As a big fan of Westerns ranging from classic Leone and Peckinpah to all of the WB/Eastwood productions, my expectations of YUMA was quite high. To my delight, YUMA exceeded my expectations not only as a Western...but it's also just a darn good, kick-a$$ movie about honor and respect amongst both good and bad men.Great performances by Russel Crowe and Christian Bale both as men of strong moral character despite being opposites in ideal, and side of the law were to be expected. What really blew me away was Ben Foster's role as the cunning and ruthless Charlie Prince, Crowe's most loyal gunman. Having seen him in more youthful and down to earth roles in his past films, it was a real treat to see him in such a darker role...and he pulls it off quite well.The action and gun-play in YUMA is also very well done. The key thing is very well paced. The violence in YUMA is not as gratuitous as the Peckinpah films, but it's generous enough where the action and gun-play is evenly paced within the context of the story, which involves the journey of two men being pursued. From the stagecoach robbery at the beginning (with a Gatling Gun too!), to the climatic shootout between Bale, Crowe, and Crowe's Posse...you definitely get more 'bang' in this film than the most of Leone's films and Eastwood's 'Unforgiven'.Bottom Line: If you're a fan of Westerns and/or Action films with honest plot and characterization, then you MUST watch this movie. It has all the ingredients and then-some of a fine Western. Although not as epic as my all-time favorite 'Once Upon a Time in The West', it's definitely up there with other greats made within the last 20 years like 'Unforgiven' and 'Tombstone'.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The original is in general better,"I guess you can't complain too much that they remade 3:10 to Yuma. After all, the original is a pretty shameless rip-off of High Noon. As much as a rip-off as it is, though, I thought it was better than High Noon. And, while Delmer Daves' original is fantastic, it's not like it's perfect or anything. It can be improved upon, I suppose. Unfortunately, James Mangold's remake doesn't improve upon it, except for maybe one bit, which I'll get to in a minute. The remake adds over 20 minutes, but it doesn't bother to flesh out the characters. In fact, the roles are flatter here than they were in the original. The extra plot points are unnecessary. They should especially have excised an entire sequence in which Luke Wilson makes a cameo. Not only does that sequence have the distracting, ""Hey, look! That's Luke Wilson"" factor, it just doesn't add anything. It has been a while since I've seen the original, but, as I recall, it was pretty close to a real-time thriller, with Dan Evans guarding Ben Wade until the 3:10 arrives for most of the film. This is only a short portion of the new one. It is the best portion, though. It doesn't solve the problems of the original, although I don't personally consider the characters' actions too problematic in either version, as many people do. The reason that the remake might be worth seeing is the ending. It's quite a bit different than the original (unless I'm misremembering), and it brings the story to a higher level than the original achieved. As for the acting, it's mostly passable. But again it pales in comparison to the original. Both Van Heflin and Glenn Ford have some great movies and performances to their names, but I think 3:10 to Yuma was the peak of both their careers. I'm not a huge fan of either Christian Bale or Russell Crowe, but they've both done better. Crowe is great in that final sequence, however. As for the other actors, most are not worth remembering. I did really like the kid who played Dan Evans' son, Logan Lerman. Watch for him in the future. And Ben Foster can add his name to the list of the classic superbad henchman characters in Westerns. He was wonderfully evil. I probably sounded like I didn't like the film much. That's not true. It's just that it's not as good as its predecessor, which, to me, means it doesn't have much reason to exist.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not a chick flick!,"I hadn't seen an American western in many years until I watched this beauty several days ago. Thank goodness Cruise turned the project down because Crowe is brilliant and I can't imagine another actor imbuing the role with the nuances of dread and then gentle bon homme masking a sinister nihilism. Crowe very deftly moves from one into the other leaving me slightly tensed wondering which side he will light on and therefore where will the character go now.Movies generally do not imprint themselves in my memory because of the acting but 3:10 to Yuma is the exception that proves the rule. Christian Bale virtually matched Crowe in his portrayal of Dan Evans who carried as much emotional baggage, albeit nuanced and therefore slow to become unmasked as the film progressed. The movie should be seen if only to watch this superb pairing of actors at war with each other throughout the film.Strangely, the one other bit that I noticed immediately was the Confederate officer's coat worn by Ben Foster's character, Charlie Prince (I apologize if I am wrong about the character). My little pet theory revolves around the fact that the American West was so lawless and, dare I use the word monstrous, because the Civil War had just finished ten or twenty years earlier and those thousands of out of work Confederate soldiers descended on primarily Yankee settlers as well as Indians having their land stolen from under them--not a pretty mix. Putting a major outlaw character in a Confederate officer's coat makes, in my opinion, a hugely strong historical statement.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good Flick, Morally Confused","3:10 to Yuma is a great genre picture with superb acting. This combo doesn't happen often. Crowe and Bale offer a weight and subtly that are commonly absent from recent Hollywood films. Because of this craftsmanship, the film is freed to be simple; an essential element to a good Western. 3:10 doesn't need, or attempt, to pad the movie with complicated action scenes or superfluous exposition. Instead it is driven by acting talent and the uncomplicated tale of a wronged ranger trying to do the right thing when no one else will.The ""right thing"", however, is confused by the movie's relativistic moral compass. As a result, the traditional good guys  the noble avenger and the stagecoach escort  are an embittered anti-theist (Bale) and a Bible-reading, hypocrite (Peter Fonda). The moral landscape becomes even bumpier when Crowe's traditional bad guy  the robber  quotes Bible verses and is tacitly labeled the hero by the film's structure and supporting characters. This moral confusion and the film's efforts to compensate with Hollywood star charisma is the most glaring sign of the film's post-modernity and why 3:10 to Yuma sends the very un-western message that virtuous ambiguity can save the day.Ironically, in the film's third act, the broken compass that guides the film is traded for the Judeo-Christian guide -- self-sacrifice and betterment of community -- in order to give the film the true Western treatment. The filmmakers seemed to realize a relativistic world view can only guide one so far. In 3:10's case (and maybe in life), it can get you to the final moments, but no one can successfully ride off into the sunset without absolute Truth.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Otherwise, I haven't a clue what would have justified a remake. I would guess this is just another example of Hollywood having run out of original ideas and failing in the attempt to reclaim past glory. Having long ago lost confidence in the Academy Award selection process, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this film garnered nominations. I consider the two hours spent on this film a complete waste of time.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent Western,"Rancher Dan Evans (Bale) hires on to help escort top outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) to the train station for transport to the prison in Yuma.After seeing this I think many will agree that the Western needs to come back big time.

When you put good dialogue with good actors you get the gold and there is no other way to say it. Hell, I was ready to saddle up and ride with them.One of the best lines in the story has some of the Pinkerton men saying they don't want Wade to know where they are taking him. Wade (Crowe ) says something like - it would be nice to know in case we get separated then we could meet up again. HA! How good is that?Some F-bombs were dropped (only) in the beginning and why they do that is beyond me. To get an R rating?

"Another great performance from Bale, and Crowe's most interesting character yet.","3:10 to Yuma - James Mangold's remake of a Western I haven't seen starring Russell Crowe as Ben Wade and Christian Bale as Dan Evans. Ben Wade (Crowe) is an outlaw seemingly too smart to be an outlaw who, in the celebration of his latest robbery, was apprehended. Dan Evans (Bale) agrees to hold the captured outlaw who's awaiting a train to go to court in Yuma. A battle of wills ensues as the Dan and Ben travel closer to Ben's punishment.Let me just say firstoff, that the performances are captivating. Christian Bale, who I've never known to give a bad performance, brings quiet intensity and a desperateness to his part. He wants his family to have a future, and for his son to be proud of him. Russell Crowe gives possibly my favorite performance of his, as he chews the scenery, kills people (not much new there), and barely lets you know what is going on in his character's mind. His intentions are never clear, and just as muddled is his take on morality. The Western genre has been famous for muddled character desires, though money and the killing of others is usually among them. Ben Wade is famous, has all the money he could desire, and has killed ""more people than the Drought"", so the ambiguity of the character and his chemistry with Dan Evans (whose fate he showed more interest in than his own) made for great viewing.Alan Tudyk (one of my favorite ""that guy"" guys), Peter Fonda and Luke Wilson play small parts. The action is intense, but doesn't overpower the character driven screenplay, as two of this generations' best actors go toe-to-toe. Not everyone will appreciate this film perhaps, but I found it to be very good and quite moving (esp. at the end). The film's is a little over 2 hours, but very well paced. I'd see it again in a heartbeat.I give it an A.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""May Jehovah judge between you and me."" ~ 1 Samuel 24:12","From a Christian viewpoint, Crowe & Bale do not offer any Faith-based acting values, or three-dimensional spiritual character portrayals. Crowe hasn't performed in a half-decent role, reflecting conflicting moral values since 'LA Confidential.' 'Gladiator' was a pseudo-moral conflict from the very beginning scene. As to Bale, his recent arrest for domestic abuse against his mother and sister, and his on-set rant against a Lighting Grip on ""Terminator: Salvation"" speak volumes about how misguided he is not just as a professional actor, but as a human being (God-fearing or not). In my humble opinion, Crowe and Bales are H'wood stars whose acting choices are driven by very bankable massive egos, self-idolatry & the mortal temptation to serve fame. They've cut their deals w/ the Devil and it reflects in their disappointing acting choices. I pray they repent, accept Jesus, and choose roles that seek rewards not handed out by the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences.That aside, this is a passable remake. The screenplay writing, location selections, production design, supporting roles, and direction work. It's just that Crowe's 'I'm playing yet-another-variation of my everyone's-seen-it, bad-tempered, tantrum-throwing self' (thank God this film didn't have a scene in a hotel w/ his character wanting to place an overseas telephone call), and Bale's 'I'm due on the Batman set soon blank stares' ruin the entire effort put forth by the film's commendable production team. It's two hours hours of watching vain egos at combat with one another. There's no performances from either Crowe or Bale. The ending shot of the train with the landscape beyond it is visual magic and the director of photography deserves favorable mention.",,Anonymous,Crime
What a movie?,"Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultra bloody remake of 3:10 to Yuma leads some moviegoers to check out Delmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on ""duty,"" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense. All of the above applies in the new 3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of back story and ""motivations."" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gun play. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.) Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
An action-packed western that keeps you on the edge of your seat.,"A roller coaster ride of flawless action and brilliant dramatic strength. Bale and Crowe are two of the greatest modern actors, in my eyes, and they fail to disappoint in this one. Both of them deliver absolutely exceptional performances and watching them play off one another is one of the most memorable film experiences of my this year in cinema. The supporting performers also turn in some noteworthy work, notably from Ben Foster (who's out of control charismatic brilliance is possibly the highlight of the film for me) and Peter Fonda. It was also great to see Logan Lerman get a meaty part, after the terrible cancellation of the phenomenal television series Jack and Bobby in which he gave a wonderful performance in the title Bobby role. I did feel that Gretchen Mol was pretty underused, though.The story itself also happens to be sensational, consisting of a vast array of beautifully unique and intricate characters. Every character has so many flaws and details provided by the script, making it fascinating to see what happens to them throughout. The action is some of the best I've ever seen. It takes a visceral, gritty and in-your-face look at Western violence. We follow the characters from their point of view as they charge on their horses to rob a bank courier. All of the action is so hard-hitting and intense that it left me hanging onto the edge of my seat. The final battle, as Evans (Bale) and Wade (Crowe) sprint through a town with guns blazing and 30-40 men trying to stop them from reaching the 3:10, is one of the most fascinating and enjoyable rides I've ever experienced.I was, however, quite displeased by the completely unrealistic fact that Evans was sprinting and charging through the town, going just as fast as Wade, when Evans had lost one of his feet during the Civil War and was running on a prosthetic foot. Pretty bizarre that a man with only one actual foot could move that quickly. It's easy to forgive this small displeasure though, due to the sensational work all around. The ending is utterly amazing, as it provides two huge twists that evoked more shock and gasps from the audience than DiCaprio's death in The Departed (which I saw on opening night with a sold out theater, so that's saying a lot). The ending combines an anti-Hollywood, tragic and beautiful death with a very Hollywood (but reasonably so, trust me) decision that I didn't see coming from a mile away. In short, it's definitely one of the best films of the year and more than lived up to all of my great expectations.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Solid piece of work which lets itself down a bit,"The recent revival of the western has been notable, but many of them have been neo-westerns or revisionists. Films such as ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" have begun to drastically re-define the genre for the modern day, but ""3:10 to Yuma"" has not attempted to do so.An adaptation of an Elmore Leonard short story, which was made into a film in the fifties, ""3:10 to Yuma"" concerns a penniless and injured rancher, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), struggling to survive in the drought-ridden Arizona of the late 1800s. In an attempt to raise some much needed money for his family, he agrees to escort the prolific criminal Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to the eponymous train which will take him to his trial and execution. Evans' motives, however, may not be as simple as they seem, as he is haunted by secrets and lies from his past and is quite desperate to gain the respect of his oldest son. As they travel through the wilderness, the honourable Evans and the unscrupulous Wade begin to connect as the small group struggle toward the train, all the while being chased by Wade's gang, led by the vicious Charlie Prince (Ben Foster).This film is not a special western. It is purely a character piece, with no great ideas on the table. However, it is a gripping piece and merits its near two-hour running time completely. It opens with a visually impressive scene and an exciting stagecoach robbery which get the audience's attention, and this high-tempo pace and tone is maintained throughout the film.It is also well acted, and merited its SAG nomination for Best Ensemble. Bale and Crowe are excellent. Bale has the more interesting part and deals with it well, facing up to issues of inadequacy and dissatisfaction that are central to his character with his trademark intensity and complexity. Crowe pulls his part off with his usual charm and charisma but, even in the early scenes, it is clear that the standout turn is from Ben Foster as the sadistic and committed Charlie Prince. But the strong cast, despite their brilliant work, cannot cover up the film's major weaknesses.Director James Mangold does a perfectly solid job here, but he doesn't display any of the flair that he showed in ""Walk the Line"". The film is put together well enough. It is pretty well shot by Phedon Papamichael and the film is supported by an excellent score from Marco Beltrami, but it doesn't strike you as particularly special in any way.The real weakness, however, is the script. It starts well and develops nicely, but for all of its good dialogue and moments of interest, the climax is baffling. One piece of character development is just incomprehensible and makes no sense, perhaps suggesting that the writers felt that they had fleshed out their central characters and their relationship with each other a bit more than they actually had. It is a shame, because this makes the ending a thundering disappointment and after two hours of solid and entertaining film-making you can't help but feel a little let down.Despite the late missteps, this was never going to be an exceptional film. It is however a solid and entertaining film, which makes decent if not necessarily highly recommended viewing.3 Stars out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Remake Has Strong Cast,"The cast of this movie is the main reason to watch it. Christian Bale & Russell Crowe give strong performances. The reason this film does not rise into a stronger rating for me is that the special effects while dramatic are sometimes beyond belief.I understand that special effects can be used to great excess and be very effective from Bales recent The Dark Night outing though what makes them effective there is great acting. The thing is, in the Western genre, if the special effects get over-done, it stretches the imagination beyond the believability factor. That is what happens here.If you buy into the strong acting performances, you don't mind the stretch. If your looking for strong western believability in story, you do. I am in between these on rating this as the effectiveness of the acting does at times make you look beyond the story and more into the character of the men acting it.This film does make Wade, the main bad guy, appear to be a tormented man who does things for reasons other than his main motivation. Bale is very effective as the farmer, civil war vet who is supposed to take him in.The story is exactly the same as the 1957 film of the same name, but I think this one illustrates actors in development, while Van Heflin & Glenn Ford were already mature star actors when they made their version.

This Wild West Belongs to Christian Bale and Russell Crowe,"I went into ""3:10 to Yuma"" with fairly low expectations, given James Mangold's track record as a mediocre director and the fact that I'm not necessarily a fan of westerns. How pleasantly surprised I was, then, to find that this particular western is slick and supremely entertaining.""3:10 to Yuma"" has all the trappings of the traditional western -- outlaws, humble ranchers, gunslingers, salty old-timers, buxom saloon barmaids -- but Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, the outlaw and humble rancher, respectively, bring a contemporary sensibility to the material that feels integrated rather than incongruous. Bale's rancher, Dan Evans, is suffering from feelings of male inadequacy as a result of being on the brink of losing his farm to debt (he's already lost a leg to the Civil War). For two hundred dollars, he joins a group of upright townies who are escorting Ben Wade, vicious bad guy (Crowe), to the train that will take him to Yuma prison. But Wade's loyal band, led by Charlie Price (Ben Foster as the film's one weak link, giving a grating performance), won't let Wade go without a fight. Through clever writing and wonderful performances by Bale and Crowe, the two men almost become allies in making sure Wade gets to the train on time. Wade is so impressed with Evans' integrity, even though he doesn't understand it, that he almost wants to see Evans succeed, even if that means he himself goes to jail. It's really a fascinating relationship, and it's that element of the film that makes it more than just a standard genre exercise.The last quarter of the film is a nailbiter; Mangold falls back on that old reliable convention that westerns practically invented, the real time show down, with clocks placed here and there keeping time for the audience, and he does it well.The film belongs to Bale and Crowe, but there's strong acting throughout by the rest of the cast, notably Gretchen Mol in a few brief scenes as Evans' wife and Peter Fonda as the requisite crusty old-timer.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Bale and Crowe are terrific together,"They really make this movie. I don't know how good it would have been with other actors. In the trivia, I just saw that Cruise and Bana were originally considered for this. Well we dodged a bullet there. Crowe and Bale just seemed so comfortable on screen not really playing against each other, but it was more like playing together, like two guys in a band. Bale, as Dan Evans, would be on bass and Crowe, as Ben Wade, on lead guitar. And I guess in a weird way the frontman would actually be one of the supporting cast members, Ben Foster as Charles Prince. The other members of the cast did a great job too.I don't see this as a real gunslinger type of movie. I mean it has shootouts and action scenes but it's very deliberate and not too showy. I haven't seen the original yet so I can't compare it. But compared to the other westerns I've seen this is one of the good ones. I believe it's rated R but I'm not too sure why. Maybe an 'F' word flew past me that I didn't notice or something, but apart from normal Western type violence (the kind where you see the bullet go in, not the shooter standing there), there wasn't much in it other than that there was a half-naked bum. But that's it. So I'd say it's great for anyone 13 and older. Even maybe a little younger if you have a younger Western fan in the family.edit: I have seen the original now and I have to say this one is better. I'm not a remake fan but this is how remakes should be done. It's different enough to be worth making and it's the still the same story so it's not just an excuse to make money off of a recognizable title. The main differences are the length of it, maybe half an hour more, and the characters are more complex in this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Filmgasm.com's 3:10 to Yuma Review,"By: Jordan AppugliesiThe last WESTERN we've had in recent memory was Bandidas. Yes, the hot spicy Mexican chica's that made that film bearable and cheesy to watch; but its been a while since we've had a rough, fun, old fashioned western film and 3:10 To Yuma was the perfect way to maybe, restart that genre? (wanted or not). From the director of my favorite film of all time, James Mangold, comes 3:10 To Yuma, an old fashioned western that is biting with social commentary on wealth and poverty, full of action and fierce dialogue, and great action with a fantastic score and cinematography to boot. Westerns are films that are cheesy through out, but fitting and never laughable, usually do to its great actors.Russell Crowe hasn't been this good in years and Christian Bale just adds another great film to his resume of already fantastic work. They both have great chemistry, and as all great hero's and arch enemies do, they have this respect for each other and understanding even though they are both at the tipping point of a shoot off between each other. Again, both are just fantastic and you kinda seem to ask were Crowe has been all these years, his last great film was a Beautiful Mind in 2001 or for those who were a fan of it, unlike myself, Master and Commander: Far Side of the World. This seems to be his year too, with this and the highly anticipated gangster drama, American Gangster, with Denzel Washington coming out later this year. (Yes I know he had Cinderella Man but that went missed).Also the supporting cast is fantastic, with Henry Fonda who isn't on screen more than 20 minutes he is maybe the most memorable, Ben Foster is absolutely despicable, in the best way; his character is horrible but he plays him fantastically and this maybe his breakout role that will make him a household name. Everyone else was fantastic, even Luke Wilson; he makes a little cameo and it's great. The action is sparse but when its there it is memorable and thrilling, but to me the dialogue was much more fantastic because again, these two men have respect for each other, while hating each other at the same time, and Crowe and Bale have fantastic chemistry to make it work. We deal with issues of Father/Son relationships, class levels, and just plain ""who kills a guy faster with their gun"" arguments (for your information, Crowe takes the gun award).The score is fantastic, very old fashioned and just classic, from the wardrobe to the dialogue it feels fresh and isn't an outcast in todays Blackberry era but it also feels like it's a classic old fashioned western that we have all seen on TV once or twice, at the least. The ending is fantastic, with again I sound like a broken record but say it with me, a gold OLD FASHIONED shoot out show down that is without a doubt the icing on this fantastic cake. 3:10 To Yuma screams the beginning of award season and it literally makes me want to run out and by my tickets for the other big contenders for the rest of the year, like my highly anticipated The Brave One and the rest of the contenders. So next week, go and take the 3:10 to Award Season because you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Must See for Western Movie Fans,"I loved everything about this movie. Please don't spoil the plot or anything else for those who want to see it. I knew nothing about it before I went in -- only that it was a western. I have watched western movies my entire life and this one ranks up at the top, along with my favorites Unforgiven, Open Range, because they are more realistic. I like Russell Crowe and he lends enough subtle wit to his character to make him you like him, but he is still no doubt a rotten character. The actor who plays Charlie Prince did a great job at playing a psycho with an unusual loyalty to his boss (Crowe). I didn't even realize that Peter Fonda was the stage-driving, bounty hunter until the credits rolled! The movie didn't leave me stunned or shocked, but rather satisfied that I had just seen a wonderful western and wish they would make more like this!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

One of the best western movies ever!,"Now I need to start off by saying that I haven't watched the 1957 movie of the same name, so I am new to this story. This movie was one of two first time watches in James Mangold's filmography that I was looking forward to the most and I am happy to say that 3:10 to Yuma (2007) delivered on my expectations and it's the movie that James Mangold the man that he is today.Positives for 3:10 to Yuma (2007):
For me, it's the story and journey of this movie that had me invested throughout the runtime to where you have this rancher trying to get this outlaw to a train that will take him to court where he will face justice for his crimes and that is amazing. As someone who hasn't watched a lot of western movies, this felt like a unique and fresh take on the genre that I greatly appreciated. Everyone in the cast does a exceptional job in the movie and you have a lot of people including Russell Crowe, Christian Bale, Logan Lerman, Dallas Roberts, Ben Foster, Peter Fonda, Vinessa Shaw, Alan Tudyk, Kevin Durand and Luke Wilson. I loved that James Mangold made this movie an exploration on heroism, villainy and redemption as it makes the story feel more emotional and personal than a lot of other western movies while also having the things that people love about this genre. The movie also spends a lot of time getting to know these characters on their journey and you start to care about them and understand why they act the way they do. The movie also has this very brutal and cynical approach to the story that makes it stand out from other western movies and I many ways this movie is essentially a prototype to what James Mangold would later with Logan (2017). As from as the traditional shootouts that are always present in these western movies, these are among some of the best and most brutal shootouts I've seen in a long time. And finally, I love the way with the movie ends its story to where our band of characters have accomplished their mission while also suffering some loses by the end of their journey and yet it also feels appropriate for what the story that is being told to us.Overall, 3:10 to Yuma (2007) was another banger hit from James Mangold and I highly recommend this to everyone especially if you're a fan of the western genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"OK, but nothing great","Too many historical inaccuracies to ever get my nod as great, as the much too lenient way in which Ben Wade(Crowe) was escorted to justice just never would have happened in the old frontier west. Look at an old west crime history book with photos sometime in your library and see that captured criminals were chain-shackled from head to toe, hardly able to move a finger let alone kill two men en route and still, yes still, be treated with the kid glove leniency and poor security shown in this film. No way this would have ever happened, and the presence of 21st century security and emotional softness toward criminals in a 19th century, hard scrabble, tough-guy western story was laughable to me as a frontier historian.Eastwood did this too with Japanese soldiers in his Letters From Iwo Jima, putting the same 21st century body language and belligerent attitudes towards authority in Asian soldiers who never in a million years would have ever acted that way 65 years ago. I think both of these filmmakers feel that modern movie goers need to relate to speech patterns and attitudes they are familiar with, as honest 19th century speech, manners and social practices would be too foreign for viewers to relate to? I don't think so. Why don't they try it sometime for accuracy, integrity and honesty, and see if we like it? I, for one, would be a lot more happy with truth and realism than with someone's fictionalized tall tale of what sells better to movie goers.The obvious, but never overtly expressed, devoted hero worship angle tending toward homosexual adoration expressed toward Wade by his psychotic #2 in charge was probably missed by most viewers, but that subdued part was possible in real life then even among cold blooded killers, as almost all feelings and emotions in the old west were heavily repressed and thus seldom surfaced except in nuance. It was not an age for touchy feelie sentiment or for being overtly ""queer"" in the manly world of frontier crime.That being said, with all true-to-life story realism put in your pocket and never given a thought again while you watched this film, it was entertaining as pure shoot-em-up escapist fare but was certainly no Shane or Red River or Once Upon A Time In The West. Not even close.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best Western flicks!,"This personally is one of my favorite western flicks and one of my favorite movies of all time as well. The movie is basically about Dan Evans played by bale who volunteers to escort the outlaw Ben Wade played by Crowe to the 3.10 train to Yuma. One of the most important factors in a movie to me, are the quality of the stories and the character and it excels in both. Peter Fonda, Ben Foster, Dallas Roberts all did very well in their roles adding more depth and quality to the story. What comes to mind when i watched this movie is Crimson Tide, Unforgiven and Point Break. Character-Driven stories with a protagonist and an antagonist with protagonis-tic qualities. It's weird but that's how i see it.This movie is filled with characters you'll love or hate because of the opportunities for them to show it. The dialogues are excellent. What i especially love is the chemistry between the characters Dan Evans and Ben Wade. They seem like complete opposites but there's something similar about them. Most likely the conviction they have and their belief that the way each lead their live is the right way and the two continually argues about the subject throughout the movie due to Wade repeatedly bribing his way out; Dan Evans as the good and responsible family man and Wade as the street smart asshole who gets what he wants. The portrayal and the relationship between the two main characters, Its not the cliché good vs evil typeThe other supporting cast are great as well. Ben foster does a particularly good job playing the main antagonist, not crowe but Foster. He's a bad ass with style. The action scenes are good old western style with gunfights on horses and in towns.The whole story proceeds with a smooth pace and it always keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. Great action must always be preceded by great story and characters and that is why the action scenes are marvellous taking you back to the old western shoot'em ups. I highly recommend this movie. Truly one of the best western flicks with great soundtrack.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good rebirth of a dead genre(the western) even though Mangold makes it long and drawn out it's compelling, interesting and tragic.","If you watch movies you know that more and more over the years the western film has slowly and certainly became a thing of the past. Here James Mangold returns to the genre some even though this is a remake it's well done, long and thoughtful and ends like many westerns tragic. It was good to have a rebirth of the genre by having star power here with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe and your typical life struggles and shootouts of the old west make the drama more compelling. Bale stars as Dan Evans a civil war wounded vet who's behind on his ranch payments needing help and hope that comes in somewhat an unexpected form. As Crowe stars as Ben Wade a rugged outlaw who robs a stagecoach, is captured by small town enforcers, so then to earn money Evans promises the law and government he will help transport Wade to the Yuma court for trial and possible prison sentence. And like all good westerns this film is about journey, shootouts, growth, and most of all it touches your emotions and shows just how life can go sometimes and turn out and like many westerns the big showdown turns out to end unexpectedly. Really a good crowd pleasing movie that interest you.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another superb western to add to my collection,"Not many westerns are being made any more, but it seems those that are being made are very good indeed. The last excellent western was Open Range, but this movie is much much better. The acting is excellent with Russell Crowe giving an outstanding performance as a very bad man with a streak of goodness still left in him. I thought Christian Bale was playing the hero but the true hero of this movie was his son played by Logan Lerman. A truly great movie must have a great bad guy, this movie had two of them, one played by Crowe and one played to perfection by Ben Foster(Charlie Prince), you just knew that if he got his way people were gonna die. Lots of action, great dialog, tension, a few twists, and in the end a satisfying conclusion.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not a bad movie but the original was much better,"It's not a bad movie watched in isolation, however, as a remake of a classic it's not feasible to judge it on its own. It has to be compared to the 1957 version and it clearly doesn't stand up to the original.It adds a lot of story arcs and action sequences that don't really add anything to the story and in effect detract from it.The original was elegant and cohesive in its simplicity. The remake is fairly chaotic and doesn't seem to know where it's going.The cinematography was also a lot better in the original, with many scenes reminding of Ansel Adams photographs. The cinematography in the remake is nothing special and misses the epic feel of the better Westerns.The characters aren't as well developed, although Crowe gives a reasonable performance and Bale, though a bit whiny, is doing a decent job as much as the script lets him.Fonda, Foster and Durand stand out well as supporting cast.Overall, it's not a bad movie at all, but it feels like a letdown compared to the original which even after 50+ years seems to have very little flaws and has aged really well.My suggestion - start with the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

As the movie goes on you really start to gain an understanding of the history and mentality of each character.

"The Western is back!!(Well,for now,anyway.)","Since the mid-1970s--I'd say,since about 1976,about the time ""Gunsmoke"" went off the air and John Wayne did his last movie--the Western as a genre(for movies AND TV)has been tapped less and less,with sort of a polar divide between edgy,darker,""anti-OAters""(i.e. Unforgiven,""Deadwood"") and safe,pat,emotionally provocative(""THe Young Riders"",American Outlaws,Young Guns I & II)even Politically Correct(I'm thinking mostly of DAnces With Wolves) being the running link between the occasional horse opera fare that would hit popular culture. I suppose in a growing,more diverse culture of movie making,something a distinctly pre-civil rights and(if you make it right)unapologetically un-P.C. as a Western would find less of an audience now than it might've some,say,forty or fifty years ago.So,I suppose it should come as no surprise that instead of making a new Western,the producers of this film decided to bring back this story,culled off an Elmore Leonard short and scripted by Halstead Welles,Michael Brandt and Derek Haas,directed by JAmes Mangold(the able director of Walk the Line). The story of how the paths of two men--the moral,gimped rancher DAn Evans(Christian BAle,another chameleon-like turn)and the calm,measured,cold-blooded and mostly amoral thief and killer Ben Wade(Russell Crowe,like Bale,just shape-shifting into another distinct and strong character)--cross is something as old as High Noon or Shane(particularly the slow build-up of the confrontation between Evans and the small band of locals who are attempting to take Crow to the eponymous train to prison,and Wade's brutal gang),but the saltier language and the drawn out character study make this as contemporary as any other movie genre in this era.Some strong turns by Ben Foster(getting a little TOO good at playing creepy and scary,as a clearly sociopathic and clever second-in-command to Crowe's Wade),Logan Lerman(As the rancher's son),Gretchen Mol(as the rancher's wife),Peter Fonda(As a grizzled Pinkerton bounty hunter)and Alan Tudyk(as a timid Vet who goes along for the ride) give character to this movie. While I cannot call it5 a great movie or a favorite of mine,I found this movie impressive in its scope,feel and intensity,and can't help but feel like if future Westerns(whether original or remade)are put together like this one,I think the genre may see a new up-tick in viewer-ship. In the meantime,3:10 is mostly a rarity,but to me(and I suspect to many moviegoers),a rare film(or anything in general)is seen as a good thing,and that's how I feel for this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

I felt it fell down in the second act, and got a bit messy there.It did however manage to recover and ended strongly. Seemed to lack direction in the middle, not from the director, but just, as too where it was going.Strong performances from both Crowe and Slater, which when they came together, really picked the film up.

As pure a Western as there's been since 2005's 'The Proposition',"A remade version of the '57 Glen Ford picture of the same name, James Mangold's amped '3:10' is as pure a Western as there's been since 2005's 'The Proposition.' Tacking on an extra 25 minutes to his adaptation, Mangold proves a knack for the Western style, bringing to life a genre that seemed to have been gasping its last breaths, and stylishly retelling a model story for a modern audience.His film, like the original, focuses on two men: Ben Wade (played marvelously by Russell Crowe), the fastest, most feared gun in the West; and Dan Evans (Bale), an unconfident, self-demoralizing rancher and Civil War vet. As Dan and his two sons go looking for their lost cattle, they approach the scene of an overturned armored carriage, which had just been maliciously attacked by Wade and his trusty gang. As it turns out, Wade had taken Dan's cattle and used it as a diversion in the robbery. Subsequently, Dan and his boys head back to the town of Bisbee, after gathering their livestock, to report the incident to town officials and inform them of Wade's intent to arrive there sometime shortly.When Wade is captured off his guard with a woman in Bisbee, railroad director Grayson Butterfield offers a fine reward of $200 to anyone willing to escort Mr. Wade to contention, from where a train will depart to Yuma prison at approximately 3:10. Reluctantly, given the much-needed sum of the reward, Evans  whose unproductive land has been plagued by droughts and harassing attempts to force he and his family out for the sake of the railroad's construction  accepts the task, alongside four other volunteers (including a bounty-hunting Peter Fonda).From then on, the film explodes into one of this year's most exhilarating films  as Wade's grisly right-hand man, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), leads a murderous brigade after the rescue of their leader  and culminates with a blood-bathy, gun-blazing conclusion that will have every hair on your body standing straight. Additionally, the performances are truly absorbing, especially those delivered by specialists Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, who delivers a performance that is heart-breaking, captivating, and uplifting all in the same. In fact, his character's struggles  the burdening thought that he is unable to aptly perform on his land due to an injury he sustained in the war that cost him one of his legs; and the exhausting notion that he's failed his family and himself because he can't provide for them as much as he'd like  are so despairing that we hurt for him on a very real, even physical, level.The summation of all of '3:10''s gleaming aspects is a very big one  a valuable reward we get for the price of admission  and comes without the danger of escorting a vigilante as brooding as Ben Wade. Since the release of his previous film, 'Walk the Line,' James Mangold has been knocking on stardom's door. Well, '3:10 to Yuma' blows that door down  and does so fashionably, with a heap of the Old West's most volatile dynamite.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Riding the Edge,"""3:10 to Yuma,"" directed by James Mangold, is a gripping and intense modern Western that rides on the strength of its character-driven narrative and stellar performances. Set in the rugged landscape of the American West, the film follows Dan Evans, a struggling rancher played by Christian Bale, as he reluctantly agrees to escort the notorious outlaw Ben Wade, portrayed with charismatic menace by Russell Crowe, to the titular train to face justice.Mangold's direction is taut and suspenseful, as he masterfully builds tension and suspense throughout the film's runtime. From the dusty streets of the frontier town to the vast expanses of the open plains, the film's cinematography captures the harsh beauty of the landscape and imbues every frame with a sense of gritty realism.At the heart of ""3:10 to Yuma"" are the powerhouse performances of Bale and Crowe. Bale brings a quiet strength and determination to the role of Dan Evans, capturing the character's moral complexity and inner turmoil with nuance and depth. Crowe, meanwhile, is electrifying as Ben Wade, exuding a mix of charm, menace, and vulnerability that makes him a formidable antagonist.Thematically, ""3:10 to Yuma"" explores concepts of honor, duty, and redemption against the backdrop of the lawless frontier. As Evans and Wade embark on their perilous journey, the film delves into questions of morality and sacrifice, challenging viewers to consider the lengths to which they would go to uphold their principles and protect their loved ones.While ""3:10 to Yuma"" occasionally falls into familiar Western tropes and clichés, particularly in its portrayal of the morally ambiguous outlaw and the stalwart hero, these minor flaws are outweighed by the film's overall strengths. With its compelling characters, thrilling action sequences, and thought-provoking themes, ""3:10 to Yuma"" stands as a worthy addition to the Western genre and a testament to the enduring appeal of tales of honor and redemption in the untamed wilderness of the American West.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Rehash of old tropes,"A remake of the 1957 film of the same name. A poor and struggling rancher (Christian Bale) agrees to join the escort for a big time robber king (Russell Crowe) that is being taken to a prison train in Yuma. While at the same time the robber's gang plot his escape.3:10 to Yuma can be seen as a love letter to old time westerns. Being a remake it of course uses pretty much the same conventions, story lines and characters as those films, but it gives it a new look, a new coat of paint if you will. Higher budget means fancier clothes, more detailed sets and a larger pixel count. Which is of course appreciated.Russell Crowe is also at the top of his game. A fine character and fitting Crowe's usual mannerisms perfectly. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about Bale. I'm usually a fan of his, but he also has certain mannerisms he cannot escape. And here they didn't serve to make the character more interesting. Quite the opposite.There's also the problem that they tried to modernize the values of the story a bit too much. I haven't seen the original, but from what I can surmise, it was pretty typical as far as westerns go. Tough as hide heroes, nefarious villains, strong pioneer women. Whereas this film tries to throw in rebellious teenagers, racial commentary, evil land barons, Native Americans, hidden hearts of gold and a twist ending meant to tug at your heartstrings. Making the whole film feel bloated and disjointed as far as values and themes go.Still, for a remake this ain't half bad and for a modern western it's surprisingly good. Plus I freely admit that the film was mostly ruined for me because I found Bale's character and his son so annoying. That will probably not be the case for most viewers.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
3:10 to Yuma: take the last train to love for a gunslinger,"The year; 1868, the place; Bisbee, Arizona, the time; three years into the reconstruction era post Civil War: where life, living, and love is as savage as a mindless bullet coming out of the end of the barrel of a gun, pointed at you! Every man, woman, and child wears a scar, either visible or in their hearts from the ravages of the War between the States. Ben Wade (Russell Crow) is the man in black, the leader of a ruthless band of cutthroats but an existentialist just the same. As incongruous as this may seem Mr. Wade is a lover as well. Enter Dan Evans (Christian Bale) a down on his luck, poor dirt farmer, and with a wooden leg to boot, compliments of a Union Army Surgon after a battle with a Confederate Army Regiment. Evans and his family are literally standing on their last leg, no pun intended, when after Wade is captured and a reward is offered to transport the bandit to catch the 3:10 train to Yuma Prison. Evans volunteers for the job to save his farm and his family. Wade the 'lover' has this profound effect on most everyone he meets. Either it is hero worship or out and out physical desire, the pheromones of Wade's chemical makeup has the same effect whether you be male or female. Then the existentialist, Wade comes out to play. If Wade cannot have the individual to play with, no one can. I nominate for The Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor of 2007, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) who portrays Ben Wade's sadistic knife-edged sexually undefined Second Lieutenant. Prince brandishes a matched pair of 45. caliber Scofield break-action revolvers as Wade's side-kick and fellow roust-about. Directed by James Mangold and shot on location in New Mexico, the cinematography may well have paid homage to both John Ford and Robert Altman who directed McCabe and Mrs. Miller. Both of these 'giants' created and gave direction to actors, writers, directors, and others of the film industry whose debt was never expected to be repaid. Strange, how a 15 page, short, story, by an unknown copy boy by the name of Elmore Leonard, could influence Hollywood twice, over a span of 60 years and produce two separate and different examples of the western genre. The American Western, often copied, imitated, and mimicked, but never duplicated. The 3:10 to Yuma, best not to miss that train.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

There was a lot of space between action sequences and Bale only is involved in one firefight, but everything was well done, exciting, ACCURATE (as in nobody shot forty bullets from the same gun without reloading), and none of it was mindless gunfighting for the sake of gunfighting (true, that kind of thing can be quite entertaining in a Western, but if there's a purpose for it then it's so much better).Also, the storyline was exceptionally deep for a Western. There is great character interaction and development driving the story along, something you don't get in your typical Western. Impressive.Trust me, YOU WANT to see this movie.

I loved Crowe's character as he was so ruthless but yet we all routed for him. Bale delivered another solid performance as he was the very likable good guy, Ben Foster played the sidekick of Crowe and felt he might of overacted at some parts but that seems to be the only roles that Foster plays these days (11:14, Alpha Dog, Hostage, etc.)This year has been very disappointing compared to last year especially for dramas but 3:10 and The Lookout are the two best I've seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Fine remake of the 1957 original,"This is a very fine remake of the 1957 Van Heflin, Glen Ford version. Director Mangold sustains tension between his characters throughout his film. The acting and editing are top-notch and help this film transcend other works from this genre. Crowe's portrayal of Ben Wade is ruthless, artistic, humorous, and tragic all at once. Bales' Dan Evans is less rich in texture, but he clearly conveys the emotions of someone struggling with definitions of heroism and honor. When all other lawmakers demonstrate cowardice, only Evans and his son, a potential outlaw like Wade, do what's right. Bales' Evans is stoic and relentless, yet his existential doubt about the task at hand is abundantly evident. What motivates him is having to transcend his guilt over how he lost his leg. Next to Wade, Ben Foster's Charlie Prince character is the most interesting. Prince is sinister and darkly comical at the same time. We understand why he feels no remorse gunning down Pinkertons and cheer him when he shoots sadistic railroad bosses, yet we loathe him when his gang and he kill defenseless lawmakers. For these reasons, his brand of violence is easier to swallow than that of sociopathic Richard Widmark, the grinning killer in ""Kiss of Death."" Peter Fonda, Logan Lerman, and Dallas Roberts also perform admirably and leave us with memorable images of their characters' actions. ""Yuma"" is aligned in tone with ""The Unforgiven"" and similar revisionist Westerns, and it carries an underlying social justice motif with contemporary parallels. When Evans finally reveals how he lost his leg, we understand his stubborn drive to deliver Crowe to justice. It's fair to compare his fate to those or our neglected, mentally and physically wounded soldiers from the Iraq War. That's the subtle, universal power of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
3:10 To Yuma,"I am not a huge fan of westerns. Some I really like and other famous westerns just leave me feeling bored. So finally after a long time I sat down to watch 3:10 to Yuma.I really enjoyed it. Christian Bale and Russel Crowe both give great performances as does Ben Foster. The direction is pretty good and keeps you entertained.The movie like all westerns is about men trying to do something beyond themselves. Men dying to prove something to themselves, their wives, their children. It is about a criminal who has lost many things in life. Never had a family or a home and finally gets a chance to do something good. He decides to do it.3:10 to Yuma can be seen as some sort of ode to the human need to be liked and do good for others. Being bad gives one immense pleasures but there is nothing really like doing good because inside we really need to feel happy while going to sleep whatever someone might say.And that is what 3;10 to Yuma is all about.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Western For The New Age,"This was a great film; the acting was amazing, particularly that of Ben Foster; who portrays the ruthless Charlie Prince, and helps carry the film. Christian Bale does what he does best, he's versatile, and more than capable of handling any role thrown his way, and he carries out the character of Dan Evans with emotion and intensity often lost among today's big name actors. Russell Crowe brings masculinity and hardness to the character of Ben Wade, but also shows a sly, cool gunslinger who manages to win our hearts. And not to mention the relationship between Bale And Crowe is absolutely perfect. And we welcome to the big time Logan Lerman. And its always great to see Peter Fonda and Vinessa Shaw. Other westerns may have been before my time, and recent ones have failed, which is why this is a great western for the new age. For any fan of films and superb acting; this is definitely a film not to be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Russel Crowe is great in this one as the killer without conscious Ben Wade,, Christian Bale is a rancher who hires on to help the local law bring Ben to justice, the story is all about there travels and adventures on the way to the 3:10 to Yuma, you gotta love that once scene where they got that gatling gun in the stagecoach,, now that was fun to watch,, and all of the gunplay action in here was pretty darn good,, all in all it was a very good western, not epic,, but pretty darn good.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A gripping and intense Western film,"""3:10 to Yuma"" is elevated by the exceptional performances of Christian Bale and Russell Crowe. Bale brings depth and vulnerability to the role of Dan Evans, portraying him as a morally conflicted and determined man who is trying to do the right thing for his family.Russell Crowe's portrayal of Ben Wade is equally compelling, with a charismatic and dangerous presence that adds complexity to the character of the outlaw.The chemistry between Bale and Crowe drives the film's dynamic, leading to a compelling and tense showdown between their characters.At its core, ""3:10 to Yuma"" explores themes of morality and redemption, as the characters are forced to confront their past actions and make life-altering decisions. The film poses thought-provoking questions about what it means to be a good man and the lengths one would go to uphold their values and protect their loved ones.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good Stuff,"I am not a big western fan. There are a few I like, but several I don't. But honestly, I certainly liked this one. And to make matters more, the acting department was rather good.Russell Crowe puts up an excellent performance. Playing Ben Wade, he is captured with the help of Christian Bale, who is a rancher. Through a long trek to catch a train, Crowe and Bale play off one another. Through many deaths, largely on the law's side, a drama unfolds. And the ending was even better and not your run-of-the-mill type.I do like Crowe, especially from his performance in Gladiator. This only shows how much of the arse-kicking type his is. And Bale, aka Batman, shows he can take a bullet as well. ""B+""",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
First rate Western,"Director James Mangold, participating in great collaboration with cast and crew, has used the classic genre to tell a contemporary story. The result is a gripping and absorbing tale, in which a great script is propelled forward briskly with great performances, most notably by Christian Bale as the down on his luck ex-soldier turned rancher looking at chance to redeem himself in the eyes of his family (and perhaps himself?); Russell Crowe as the charismatic and yet ruthless robber; and Ben Foster has his loyal but psychotic second in command to Russell Crowe's character.Bale plays his role quiet low key and controlled, and the way his character is taken advantage of at the beginning of the film generates considerable sympathy for him and makes his journey through the rest of the story compelling refreshing and not stereotypical. Crowe is particularly impressive as a clever and ruthless leader of his gang of robbers, but his very subtle take that his character is getting tired of his life, and his gradual bonding to Bale's character is genuinely fascinating to watch. Ben Foster portrays a borderline psychotic in a manner that also avoids stereotyping, and also results in an absorbing performance.These actors are ably supported by good supporting turns by Peter Fonda, Alan Tudyk, Dallas Roberts, and Logan Lerman as Bale's character's son. In fact it is the character interplay which is the driving heart of the film, and keeps you transfixed throughout. This interplay is brilliantly facilitated by writer-director Mangold, who sets it in a spectacular environment and embellishes the story well-handled and exciting action sequences. Kudos go to Phedon Papamichael's photography, Michael McCusker's editing, Andrew Menzies's production design, Arriane Phillips costume work and able support from the sound mixing team and the stunt crew. It really makes a difference that the film accomplishes so much in camera rather than relying on digital effects, and is so much better for it.However the most trenchant technical contribution has to be from Marco Beltrami's brilliant score, that creates to terrific mood and helps propel the story along to its interesting and thoughtful conclusion.The film further cements James Mangold's reputation as one of Hollywood most eclectic directors and one of the best for drawing excellent yet accessible performances from his actors.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
MY REVIEW: Ride This Train With Low Expectations!!,"Having Russel Crowe as bad guy and Christian Bale as good guy and putting them in single frame almost whole of the running time does raise your expectations for a western crime thriller but this one leaves you underwhelmed because of few unconvincing twists in the story. Plot is simple, broke Christian Bale gets the paid job of delivering criminal Russel Crowe to a prison train to Yuma while Russel's wild friends are after them . Whole plot revolves around how they influence each other throughout the journey. Tight direction, confident performances, stylish western atmosphere makes for a cinematic treat until in the last half an hour, the change of hearts become unconvincing and director look confused how he should end all this chaos.

3:10 to Yuma,"I knew that this movie was a remake of 1957 classic western movie. I normally do not like re-makes because they are never well made or come anywhere near the patch of the original. But this being a western  I love western movies  and that too released after so long, I was much more than excited to venture out to see this one.Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) is an outlaw - robs money and kills people. He is brutal, but this complex character has also some humane side to him. He has his gang with his deputy as Charlie Prince (Ben Foster). They rob cattle from a ranch of Dan Evans (Christian Bale). Dan goes after Ben to get his cattle back and in process becomes ends up in getting Ben arrested. Their tasks is to put Ben on the train at 3:10 pm to Yuma  where he would be hanged. How they take Ben there becomes the remainder of the story.I liked the moral twist the story brings at the end where Ben helps Dan to take him till the train, so that he can set an example to his son  that his Dad did not take bribe nor he was afraid of the outlaws.All characterization of the movie was absorbing - especially of Ben Wade, and his relationship with Dan Evans; they share a complex form of understanding. Both of the two main protagonist Russel Crowe and Christian Bale have done equal justice to the role  beautifully portrayed. Ben Foster as the deputy was intense and a pleasure to watch.The cinematography of any western movie landscape is mindblowing and so was for this movie. The ruggedness, the dirt, the soil, the horses  I just loved all of it. A treat to watch such movies on a big screen.Director James Mangold did a fantastic job in making this remake. As I have not seen the original I don't have any words to compare with. But this movie is technically excellent and has a larger time space of 122 minutes (compared to 92 minutes of the original)  so that is nice.One observation  why should anyone try to protect an outlaw and take so much pain to take him to a train station; in the process  let soooo many people die and killed anyways the outlaw is going to be hanged. Very stupid and silly  I say of those people and director.But, I overlook this stupidity, otherwise there is no story, no adventure, no action and no pleasure given to audiences to watch two excellent actors in the backdrop of a western setting  on a BIG screen.I thought of writing this review after I saw the original too, but later changed my mind. I will see the original later and write my comparative review covering both the movies  sometime later.(Stars 7.25 out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
3:10 to Yuma is 2 hours wasted,3:10 to Yuma is not an enjoyable film. Script writer didn't do his job properly. The movie wants us to leave our brain outside and just watch Russel Crowe without asking any question. To many improbable scenes. The plot is fine. A criminal is escorted to justice. But the way this is done is just something that that not happen in real life. The film is unrealistic. It should not have been made. It gives bad name to westerns. The only good thing about 3:10 to Yuma is the deputy leader of the bad guys. He steals the show. He is actually the man of the match. The film is too long and boring. Photography is bad. Last one hour is simply rubbish. You wont remember it 3 days later.,2.0,Anonymous,Crime

good story driven by 2 good lead actors,"This movie was pretty good. I wouldn't call it a typical western; it was more about the relationship between cattle rancher, Dan, and outlaw, Ben Wade. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are both good in this and what make the movie better than average. I liked the way they made Ben seem like this cold blooded killer, but for some reason he had some respect for Dan. Maybe he envied Dan for what he had.There were a few things I didn't quite get. Like, why did Ben Wade just let himself be captured? Was he tired of running or was it because he liked a challenge? Maybe he wanted to escape from Yuma a third time. And at the end, why did he decide to try to help Dan succeed in getting him on the train. Did he really not want his gang to rescue him? And why was his gang just shooting randomly when trying to save Ben. They could have just as easily shot him.FINAL VERDICT: I suggest watching it if you like Bale or Crowe.

"A good, honest western","This is not a film that exceeds its Western genre, but it sits so nice and firmly in the saddle of that genre that I give it a solid 8.The script is really pared down and careful. It's written like a 1950s/60s Western - with honesty and a nice lack of fussiness. Russell Crowe's outlaw is the more seductive of the two leads but Christain Bale's scrawny, uncertain wannabe hero is the more interesting.The film almost careens over a cliff of Shane-style cliché surrounding Bale's rebellious son, but does just manage to avoid that fall with good casting of the boy and the downbeat ending, which is nonetheless satisfying.It's a pleasure to watch a Western that doesn't cave in to postmodern winks at itself, inappropriate humour or over-staged violence. Instead, 3.10 to Yuma rides quietly and unpretentiously into town, does its job with honour, and disappears into a well-deserved sunset.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
3:10 To Yuma A Good Western Much Better Than Expected,"Let me first start of by saying I'm not a big fan of westerns but I was impressed with how much I enjoyed this one mostly due to the great performances by the talented cast including Russell Crowe (from Gladiator, Body of Lies, and A Beautiful Mind), Christian Bale (from American Psycho, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight), Ben Foster (from The Punisher, Hostage, and X-Men 3), and Peter Fonda (from Ulees Gold and Ghost Rider). Director James Mangold the man behind films like Identity and Walk The Line did an excellent job of bringing this movie to the big screen. It's one of those rare remakes that turns out to be a terrific western with plenty of action, character development, and spot on performances by the whole cast. Russell Crowe makes for an effective villain. His character Ben Wade is a man whose seen a lot of bad things in his life and those experiences are what made him the man he is an outlaw who's willing to kill to get what he wants. Crowe continues to establish himself in 3:10 To Yuma as one of Hollywoods most talented actors. Christian Bale is equally impressive as the hero Dan Evans a rancher who was injured in the Civil War. Bale's Evans is a man desperately looking for a way to support his family and sees his way of doing just that by joining some lawman to help escort Ben to the 3:!0 To Yuma in the city of Contention with Wade's gang hot on their trail. With films like The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, and Terminator Salvation, Christian Bale continues to show why he's one of Hollywoods best actors today. Well done. Ben Foster plays Charles one of the criminals in Ben's gang another man whose probably seen his share of terrible things as well. Foster does a solid job of the role he does have in the movie. Peter Fonda does the best he can with the small role he does have in the film as Bryon McElroy a mysterious lawman with a violent past and the rest of the cast are good in their roles. There were however a few flaws like the pacing at times was slow and the ending which wasn't that bad but it could've been a little better. Overall 3:10 To Yuma has a good story, interesting characters, great performances from the cast, and plenty of action thats even spaced throughout the whole film that makes it an enjoyable western to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Instant Classic for Western aficionados,"This is a very solid film, with a compelling plot and solid cast, featuring two of the most notoriously ill-tempered actors in the business.

Foster is one of my favorite supporting actors.You can enjoy this movie as a straightforward classic action Western, or you can delve deeper into the psychological underpinnings, which are spread throughout the movie and which culminate in an ending that can either anger you or inspire a subsequent deep discussion with others who have seen the film.For Western aficionados, this flick is an instant classic and Must See.

"""This Town's Gonna Burn!""","Christian Bale and Russell Crowe light up the screen in this modern western classic. ""3:10 to Yuma"" tells the story of Dan Evans (Bale), a rancher who is plagued by debt and drought. Dan is offered $200 to join a ragtag posse tasked with escorting the infamous outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) to the town of Contention, Arizona, where Wade will be placed on the 3:10 train bound for Yuma, to be tried and hanged.What really makes this movie excellent to me is the explosive finale. It's poetic, heartwarming, and thrilling all at the same time. I think a lot of other reviewers on this site seem to miss the point of the ending. If you take into scope the entire story and the character changes that led to the conclusion, I personally feel like it makes a lot of sense and is satisfying.Crowe and Bale both give excellent performances, and though Crowe is completely vulgar and sly, he also comes off as extremely charming and comfortable as the plot progresses. The cinematography, acting, and overall aesthetic of the movie are all top notch. It was even nominated for a few Oscars for Original Score and Sound Mixing. I recommend watching this one with a good surround system. My only real complaint is that the picture and lighting is a little bit dark during the night scenes while they are camping out in the woods. It's kind of hard to see what's going on, but that only lasts for about five minutes.This is a very underrated gem of a movie, and I think that it ranks up there with some of the best westerns of all time. It sheds the ultra-violent spaghetti schlock of westerns from the 60s and 70s, and returns the genre to its morality play roots of the 40s and 50s, with much more advanced filmmaking technology and top-notch acting.

"For those that just don't seem to get it... this is a remake of the 1957 version.  A 50th anniversary present, possibly.","*******SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS*********** The following is the plot/summary of the original version: SynopsisIn the Arizona Territory of the 1880s, rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his young sons witness a stagecoach holdup. When the driver, Bill Moons (Boyd Stockman), overpowers one of the robbers and uses him as a human shield, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), the leader of the gang, callously shoots both men.Wade and his men stop at the saloon in nearby Bisbee, posing as cowhands. When Wade stays too long to become acquainted with the pretty barmaid, Emmy (Felicia Farr), he is captured, but his henchman, Charlie Prince (Richard Jaeckel) gets away with the news. The townspeople fear what his men will do, so the marshal (Ford Rainey) decides to have two volunteers sneak the prisoner to Contention City to catch a train, the 3:10 to Yuma. Mr. Butterfield (Robert Emhardt), the stage-line owner, offers $200 for the dangerous job. Desperate after three years of drought, Dan jumps at the opportunity, but the only other man interested is the town drunk, Alex Potter (Henry Jones). When no one else steps forward, the marshal reluctantly accepts them.Wade is placed on a stagecoach, which then stops (in view of some of the gang) for a faked repair; the outlaw is secretly taken off while the stage continues on with an imposter, in the hopes that by the time the outlaws figure out what has happened, it will be too late. Wade is taken to Dan's ranch, where Dan's devoted wife Alice (Leora Dana) serves supper to the family and their ""guest"".Dan, Alex, and Wade leave under cover of darkness, reaching Contention City at daybreak. Butterfield has reserved a room at the hotel. While they wait for the train, Wade tries several times to bribe Dan into letting him go. Dan is greatly tempted. The local sheriff is out of town, but Butterfield hires five men to help escort the prisoner to the train.Things go awry when Bob Moons (Sheridan Comerate) barges in unexpectedly and threatens to shoot his brother's killer. Dan wrestles his gun away from him, but in the struggle, it goes off. Downstairs, Charlie Prince, who has also come to Contention City, hears the gunshot, and spots Wade in a window. Charlie is seen riding off to fetch the rest of the gang.The men Butterfield recruited watch as seven riders enter the town. Not liking the odds, they retreat, leaving only Dan, Alex and Butterfield. When Alex goes out to reconnoiter, he spots one of Wade's men on a rooftop opposite the hotel. Alex calls out, warning Dan, but is shot in the back by Prince. The gang hangs the wounded Alex from the lobby chandelier, killing him. Butterfield decides that maintaining Wade as a prisoner is not worth the risk, and releases Dan from his obligation. Alice arrives and also tries to change her husband's mind, but he is committed: ""The town drunk gave his life because he believed that people should be able to live in decency and peace together. You think I can do less?""When the clock strikes three, Dan escorts Wade out the back door. Gang members take shots whenever they can without endangering Wade, but despite their best efforts, they cannot stop the pair from reaching the platform, where the train is waiting. Finally, the outlaws emerge to confront Dan as the train starts to leave. Charlie shouts for Wade to drop to allow them a clear shot at Dan. Instead, Wade unexpectedly tells Dan to jump into the passing baggage car. They jump together. The gang starts to run after the train, but Dan shoots Charlie and the rest then let it go. Wade explains himself, saying he felt he owed Dan for protecting him from Bob Moons in the hotel room, and confidently claiming he has broken out of the Yuma jail before (implying he can do so again), but whether these statements reflect his true motivations and prospects is not clear. Alice sees Dan safe on the train as rain pours down on her, breaking the long drought. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=3374650The differences are mainly that the son is along in this, the wife is less present, Dan dies in this one, and Ben kills the whole crew rather than just Charilie. In the remake, it did appear like Ben was about to draw on Ben Wade, once he defended himself against him, he had to take the others out, being they, too, were attempting to draw, it's called self-preservation. He wasn't on the train, yet, as he was in the original version. Plus, he plans on escaping in both versions. In this version, he gets to keep all the money, and he let the other man look like a hero. It's idealism, you don't need realism in everything. Just because it's not a fantasy genre, doesn't make it not. Movies are just that. Not every movie is based on fact. Actually, even the 'based on' movies aren't always 100% fact. I didn't need to suspend belief for a moment, I've seen too many westerns, horror flicks, gangster movies, thrillers, romances, sci-fi etc, etc, etc to expect anything other than to be entertained. When a movie fails to do that, then that is when it has failed. Only, then.This was a good film and it did make you care for the characters, and because I was able to get it, I cried.

It doesn’t have that stylish cowboy shootout or killing everyone senselessly; but it is more of a dramatic western movie which works to the certain levels.Three Ten started of very slow to the very point that I thought - well it actually be of any fun?, even with some gun fight it still felt very drag on, dull and unnecessary in the first hour, luckily the amount of pace start to catch up gradually and the last forty five minutes start to be something more like a cowboy movie. I don’t like my cowboy movie to go much off the track.I guess the present of Russell and Christian are the main reason I watch this movie, plus I read a whole lot of positive review about it. The two were just awesome, actually almost everyone in this movie is awesome, and some of them even give a very decent performance even with unexplored character. At first I thought Ben was more of a miscast but after the movie went along I realize he wasn’t all bad at all.The whole production was also pretty good, a very stylish wardrobe I must say, a very good lighting, good direction, brilliant location (not too deserted), and good editing. The only things that keep this movie from reaching its fullest got to be the uneven story and that unnecessarily overlong introduction. And that to me is the key point to any great movie.Lastly, with so many positive reviews I might have too higher hope for it, which leads to a mere disappointment when it doesn’t reach that expectation. It is still a good film none the less but don’t get high hope on it. The good thing is at least the movie is more or less rewatch-able.Recommendation: I Guess You Can Rent It.Reason to Watch: Russell and Christian were great.Reason Not to: First part of the movie is overlong and boring.Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C+)Please Rate Y/N Only After Read.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Even bad men love their mommas.,"The western now days is a pretty dead genre. Only a couple of times every now and then a wonderful genre movie gets suddenly released again, of which ""3:10 to Yuma"" is the most recent example.The movie isn't really a classic western, in terms of that it uses all of the clichés and techniques you would expect from the genre. It above all is a modern movie, that also takes an original approach to the genre. It of course features lots of tough looking and talking man but in the end the movie is all about trying to be a better man, no matter how black your heart seems.Yes, it's a movie that is being driven by its story and characters but it's also a movie that has plenty of action in it. It still makes this an action movie but one with some more heart and soul to it. You can of course expect a little bit more from a movie starring both Russell Crowe and Christian Bale opposite each other.The movie is of course being almost completely carried by its two principal actors but luckily the movie doesn't forget that it also has other great actors playing some nice roles in this movie, such as Peter Fonda and Ben Foster. The movie gives its actors plenty of opportunity to shine throughout.It's perhaps a bit of a long movie and it perhaps isn't always interesting enough but it builds up nicely to its ending, that is more than another big action sequences or shoot out but also shows how the characters have changed and most importantly grown throughout the entire movie.It's a visually impressive looking movie, with nice scenery and settings. The movie has a visual and technical modern approach to it but it still feels like an old fashioned genre movie, mostly due to its pace and settings. You don't have to be into westerns to like this movie and you don't have to be afraid when you are into westerns that this movie might not be faithful enough to its genre.A movie well worth seeing.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
3:10 is just about a TEN,"From director James Mangold comes the remake of the popular 1957 film starring Academy Award winner Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. The film tells the story of Ben Wade, (Crowe) a thief/gunslinger captured by local authorities and awaiting to be transported on the 3:10 train to Yuma for trial and conviction. Being accompanied by an array of lawmen, in the middle of all this is Dan Evans (Bale) who takes on this daunting task to support his family and get enough funds to save his ranch.Mangold has complete control of the film from beginning to end and never loses focus of the old western. He revolutionizes it and alas, keeps the same character and charisma it had in the early years of cinema. Deciding on shots and creating moments that sends sheer fear down the viewer's spine is the least of the director's achievement. He commands this ship and leads the players in some of the finest performances of the year. However there are some flaws with the script and pacing of the picture but all in all, you cannot ask for more from the film.Russell Crowe who may not be the friendliest person in Hollywood to most is undoubtedly one of our finest actors working today. He captures a strong grip on Ben Wade and chooses to chew up all scenery he's in. His villainous turn which is reminiscent of past performances such as Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York and Leonardo DiCaprio in Blood Diamond has the viewer rooting for him when you know you really shouldn't; a compelling turn for the actor indeed.Christian Bale which has been Hollywood's best kept secret for some time and is a household name is terrific as always. While being the most sympathetic of any characters on screen, he gives the viewer encouragement and anguish; a task not easy for many actors. His Dan Evans is completely lost in his life, while being nearly estranged from his older son and being permanently ""scarred"" to say the least from war, Dan is the champion of the story. Bale has been an up and comer for some time as far as awards consideration goes and exceedingly been left off many a time. With acclaimed performances in American Psycho, Batman Begins, and The Prestige and early year raved performance in Rescue Dawn, Bale may find himself amongst the list of candidates come Oscar time. Although he does share a co-lead with Crowe and may find himself pushed in supporting as studios sometimes do. But with amazing supporting performances in the film, he is overshadowed there as well.Ben Foster is the triumph of the picture as Ben Wade's right hand man and turns in the actor's most frightening turn to date. He might be seeing himself with a few breakthrough awards this coming awards season if momentum builds. Peter Fonda has a very simple role but dignifies the old western man so profound. Fonda which has been long ignored by the Academy with only one nomination to his credit doesn't have enough scenery to chew on to get the glorified veteran nomination. Dallas Roberts and newcomer Logan Lerman turn in excellent performances respectively. Gretchen Mol is also quite staggering in her blink and miss role.The film is quite the triumph and rolls out the red carpet for more western to return to Hollywood. The film will be followed later this year with The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and we look forward to a few more instances of great westerns to come.The film will have an uphill climb for Oscar season especially with hopes of a Best Picture nomination. Being a remake, two co-leads and slew of bigger pet projects coming in the months of Oscar, its true shot will lie in the Original Score category for Marco Beltrami, which along with a great cinematography by Phedon Papamichael are the best technical aspects of the film.It looks to be a great movie year thus far with a much surprise love for western cinema back in the light.Grade: ***1/2/****",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""He's killed more People than the drought.""","This will never be regarded as a Classic or even a remade improvement over the Original. It is just a pretty good modern Western and two fine leading Actors punctuating the proceedings with words as much as violence.The Bad Guy has killed and killed and is the kind of cold-blooded Killer needed to lead a gang filled with cold-blooded Killers. The Good Guy is a ""Job"" kind of Character that has asked God for help and He isn't listening. So he takes things on with an unwavering belief that he is redeeming himself while ""doing the right thing"" for his Family and is totally incorruptible.There is much that is unbelievable going on here and it is all played for Movieness rather than some sort of authenticity. The body count is extremely high and is purposely softened by the Philosophical exchanges, but in the end this is nothing more than a Pulp Western. It is not particularly deep, just knee-deep in corpses. An above average Film that tries hard to be Great but after all, it's just nothing more than Entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very weak story,"This is my first comment here on IMDb, and I just had to write about this movie because I can't really understand why it is so highly rated by so many. This one really disappointed me.Yes, the actors Christian Bale and Russel Crowe are magnificent, but the story has so many logical shortcomings and outlaw Ben Wade's (Crowe) actions at the end of the movie would never happen in real life (even if he had a twisted mind, which he really didn't show). All the shortcomings ruined it for me.Since I don't want to spoil the movie I can't really comment on specific episodes, so you will have to make up your own mind about the logic if you watch it.I can't recommend ""3:10 to Yuma"" even though I usually love both Crowe and Bale movies. Crowe was excellent in films like Gladiator and American Gangster, Bale was great in Batman Begins and The Prestige, but none of the actors could rescue this movie I'm sad to say.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Shot in the Belly,"This was a great movie that had a decent amount of action in it. Russell Crowe plays a conflicted robber and killer who is supposed to get onto a TRAIN at 3:10 in Yuma (which is in Arizona). One of the first introductions we have to Crowe's character is when his sidekick, Charlie - appears and has a very annoying voice and facial expression. Plus, he shoots everybody he can get his hands on. Charlie, in ONE SCENE, shoots Peter Fonda in the belly at POINT BLANK RANGE for NO REASON. Couldn't he have just shot him in the head or heart? So, Fonda's character bleeds for about 10 hours and can't move. Finally, he's lugged back to town and some doctor sticks a tool into his belly and pulls out a BULLET! The bullet apparently damaged Fonda's LIVER. So, by that evening, Fonda's character hops back on a horse and is completely healed. I found that to be a TAD UNREALISTIC.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Osacars all around for 3:10 to Yuma,"This was absolutely the best movie I have seen since Gladiator. Russel Crowe deserves an Oscar for his performance. All of the lead characters gave outstanding performances. The set designs and costumes were right on target for the period. If you like westerns you will love this one. I believe it is one of the best Westrn movies ever made. Not since John Wayne has there been a cowboy as rough and tough as Crowe. The ending will have you cheering for the villain, and crying for the hero- but in a good way. Not only will you enjoy this movie, but, you will walk away having learned some valuable life lessons. I highly recommend this movie- you will not be disappointed. I guarantee you will want to add 3:10 to Yuma to your DVD collection.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great, slowburning story with lots of dialogues, reasonably good acting and direction. Just a nice western, just nice.","The story in itself is quite simple: Christian Bale has to escort the crook Russel Crowe to court. But the dynamic and dialogues of the story are quite enjoyable. It could have been directed more bleak and grim. The original story lends itself to that mood, but director James Mangold made this story into an average commercial hollywood western, therefore it wont ever become a western classic, but it is still quite an enjoyable watch. Can be enjoyed by young and old, because the nucleus of this story is about a father son relationship, in which the father wants to risk death by bringing Russel Crowe to court, just to prove to his son, that he is a Man.Based on an Elmore Leonard story, an author that is one of Quentin Tarantino favorites. ""Jackie Brown"" is based on another Elmore Leonard story, just to give you an example. Lots of dialogues in this western. Not too much action. And what those Leonard stories also have in common is that the characters are true to life people. Although there are better westerns to be found, this one has got its merits because of its great story and reasonably good acting by Russel Crowe and Christian Bale.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nice But Not Great,"13 October 2007. 3:10 To Yuma tries but doesn't quite succeed in being great. The lines, the plot, and acting all seem to call out for increased applause and appreciation because of the nice flourishes and added touches that make this movie rise above many others. Russell Crowe's character Ben Wade has suggestive resemblances to the most famous of criminal heros - Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lector but never quite becomes that evil person we would like to take home with us, except by the end his character seems to decompensate and fracture into a somewhat confusing and perhaps too American movie studio caricature that loses a lot of its authentic appeal. The plot is strong, except with glaring flaws, such as when one counts the number of characters that Ben Wade is forced to kill later in the movie, two instead of three. Or when there is a stagecoach fire and no one appears to be screaming. There are number of overly convenient contrivances introduced in this movie in order to supposedly improve the movie but instead seem more artificially imposed on the story, particularly where and what happens when Ben Wade briefly escapes. There were even more opportunities for the script to have become even more edgy and emotionally compelling, like when Ben Wade's band of outlaws shoots some people in cold blood later in the movie that emotionally diminished one of the most important scenes in the movie where Dan Evans played by Christian Bale has to make a crucial decision regarding what he was going to do with Ben Wade. There is also a scene where Dan Evans's son, William Evans played by Logan Lerman, who comes to the rescue a number of times and one scene where he confronts Ben Wade and it is resolved in a fashion that appears too pedestrian without the sort of Ben Wade panache that would have been more likely to have been on display. Overall, this movie retains good pacing, nicely developed plot situations, consistency, and compelling emotional intensity while at the same time retaining a human sensitivity often lost among Westerns. This Western feels like a new and improved version of the genre, yet it failed to succeed in making it to the breakthrough that the producers, writers, and director sought.

3:10 ended up great didn't see that coming,"Well first of all I am not a fan of western movies of course when I was a child I found them nice. Now that I am 21 most of these movies do not get a second glance from me. So when I was watching a movie there was a preview that caught my attention mostly cause of the combination of Russel crow and Christian bale and a unique story (later found to be a remake).But any way the two stars of this film really do a great job the whole time you are drawn into this movie. You get a few different ideas of what it was like to live in those times by the life style you choose. Rare aspect of this film is great acting :) as I said before just really worth seeing that part. The story line is very well written too. Would recommended for kids over age 13 years old, so you could sit down with the family and watch this one. Bottom line if you like crow and bale and great stories from glances back when acting and plot make a good movie then take the time to view this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
3:10 to Yuma stayed true to the tradition of the Old West,"(My Synopsis) The legendary outlaw, Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his gang have just robbed an armed stage coach carrying the Southern Pacific Railroad's payroll. They kill everyone onboard except Pinkerton guard, Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda) whom Wade shoots in the belly. Dan Evans (Christian Bale) and his two sons find McElroy and take him to the vet's office in Bisbee, Arizona. Ben Wade is in town without his gang and the sheriff immediately surrounds the hotel. Dan distracts Ben Wade, and he is captured without a shot being fired. Railroad representative Grayson Butterfield (Dallas Roberts) asks for paid volunteers to join McElroy's posse to take Wade to the train station in the town of Contention three days away. The train arrives at 3:10, and they must put Wade on the train's prison car bound for Yuma. Once Wade arrives in Yuma, he will receive a quick trial in Federal Court and be hung. Dan Evans is a struggling farmer, desperately needing money to save his farm. Dan will help transport Wade to Contention, but he must be paid $200. The other paid volunteers who join the posse are Tucker (Kevin Durand) and Doc Potter (Alan Tudyk), the town's veterinarian. Unfortunately for the posse, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), Wade's right hand man, sees what has happened to Wade, and he goes after the rest of the gang to help liberate Wade.(My Comment) The remake of the 1957 movie 3:10 to Yuma stayed true to the tradition of the Old West. You actually get the feel of the real events from chase scenes and stampedes to gunshot wounds. You have your villains and your unknown heroes who come to the forefront to save the day. It has your perfect setting of a small prairie town with a saloon and loose women just waiting for a gun fight with the local sheriff and the posse that is taking Ben Wade to the train. Russell Crowe plays a great villain with his charm, callous conscience, and fast gun, who goes from cordial to lethal and back again at the speed of a bullet. The character of Ben Wade using the psychological weaknesses of the men on the posse was absolutely superb. The gun play was first-rate and very well done. Ben Foster as Charlie Prince did a terrific job of playing Wade's right hand man. I believe both Crowe and Foster will be nominated for Oscars. The story line is especially true today, when a father wants to teach his son what it takes in life or in death to do the right thing, and become a good and respected man.

Like the curate's egg - good in parts.,"Makes a strong start despite some silly shoot-ups and Peter Fonda's bullet-proof peritoneum. Nearly made it onto my list of best Westerns until the last 20 mins or so when the characterisation went a bit dada.An excellent main cast is supported by strong performances from the rest of this posse. Russel Crowe is initially chillingly convincing as a bible quoting psychopath and Christian Bale's character as a desperate, if decent, loser is understandable and played with considerable pathos. Ben Foster is also notable as the Schofield revolver-toting minion of Crowe. Peter Fonda still has beautiful eyes despite his now rather craggy exterior and plays the part of a nearly indestuctible Pink to perfection.It's just a pity that it all falls apart at the last hurdle.

Subtle and courageous,"The acting from the two leading roles are absolutely brilliant. Christian Bale's performance is captivating as the one-legged rancher fighting for his family. In fact, he takes over much of the attention at should be given to Russell Crowe as well. Crowe is given a hard and complicated role, yet he did brilliantly. In my opinion, Crowe's character, the outlaw Ben Wade is the more interesting. It is like the film is just a glimpse of Wade's life where there is so much more going on. Many people will be confused at the end by Wade's choices. But if we watch Crowe more carefully, there are many subtle hints through out the movie that will explain a lot about this special character, that in the end, you won't be able to characterize him as good or bad. The film is beautifully directed, very well paced. The music and cinematography are powerfully done. The only weak point of this movie is the acting of Logan Lerman who plays William. But it is a hard role for a young actor so it's understandable. This is one of those movie that will grow on you as you watch it over and over. I rate it 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Grand re-make,"I'm actually not really much of a 'western-fan'... my favorite movies within the genre are 'Young Guns I+II' - which should say it all.Russell Crowe has always been one of my favorite actors and Christian Bale... well - he has had his ups and downs in my view (some of his best are The Prestige, Batman Begins and Equilibrium/Cubic... the worst are American Psycho and Shaft). But my view on Christian Bale has changed completely - from this movie on he is in my good book.Rarely have I seen a better western - it has everything (though the indians only have a very small part to play in it)- the saloon, the gun fights, the good guys (with white hats) and the bad guys (with black hats) - and of course - the sheriff who actually shouldn't be a sheriff at all... But apart from all these very common things in all westerns, this movie has both feeling, morale and empathy. The story is intriguing, the plot is deep - and good, the acting is superb, the camera guys should get a raise and the instructor likewise a lot of equally good scripts (with equally good actors).I am not going to give any spoilers - any preview you see or read will say it all, but if you're going to see only one western movie this side of the century - make sure that this is it. I have recommended it to all of my friends - and have yet to hear an 'it is OK' or a 'that is not a movie for me at all'... and we do - oftenly - not share the same taste in movies...From Denmark - two thumbs up and 9/10 (can't be a 10 because I'm more of a horror-man than a western-man... but as good as 'Young Guns'... or maybe even better...)",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
I Realize Very Late the Raw and Real Force of Genius Russell Crowe Is As an Actor,"3:10 To Yuma thrives on the fascinating human chemistry of the two main characters, Christian Bale's unlikely hero and Russell Crowe's intimidatingly self-aware villain. The dynamic between them is so brilliantly indescribable and ambiguous in its portrayal of personality. When you leave this film, a bloody, fast-paced western, you're going to be pondering the subtextual motives of these two characters as a reaction to the unmatchably entertaining and fascinating climax. What you should remember is that we ourselves rarely know the reasons for things we do. Russell Crowe's character is such a richly drawn villain, especially for a western, because amongst all of his ruthless murder, ability to take charge of a vicious, rotten gang, and shark-like expressions is a man with a mind that's aware and open enough that he is capable of surprising himself. The expansive outreach of his character to his opposing company throughout the film just consumes you.The root of the film's expert delivery is the depth and intricacy of the script, which claims solid development to the point where it can be free to to take thematic liberties and create an unpredictable hot-cold-and-lost-in-inconclusiveness relationship between everybody.I was at first turned very much off by the frustrating animal violence early in the film, but I was progressively turned back on. Russell Crowe completely embodies a rugged manliness that suggests that he was born in the wrong era, as if he were a walking museum exhibit. It's almost alarmingly lifelike to see how genuinely he wears his scopically perfect character. The expansive intellect, not to mention the artistic and romantic sensibilities that are filled in around the edges, are not unequal in realism in Crowe's performance. He is making me realize very late the raw and real force of genius he is as an actor and a movie star. Alongside him, there is just no real way Christian Bale can match him. No matter how affecting Bale is, Crowe's villain is the sort that steals the show and pinches for every penny of it. However, the unlikeliness I speak of in Bale's hero is personified unreservedly as a farmer with such a good-hearted nature that he doesn't even recognize his own breaking point, which comes when he volunteers to assist the transportation of Crowe's notorious character to the gritty town of Contention. Bale shows us a tough everyman with a rifle who can carry himself just as well as anyone else despite his bum foot, but traces over him with the sad, innocent scavenging of a lost ego. Crowe and Bale are doubtlessly the best hero- villain coupling I've ever seen in a western.This western is doubtlessly the best American western I've seen in a life. If only they hadn't bothered with the stupid animal violence early on.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Christian Bale makes the rest of us want to believe that his kind of man still exists.,"The original version of this wonderfully done remake is probably the inspiration for 16 Blocks, S.W.A.T. and other similar movies. 3:10 to Yuma is about the complications in transit taking a prisoner from one place to another.Even non-fans of westerns should watch this if only for the extremely talented Christian Bale; watching any movie of his is surely time well spent. He always chooses to play interesting roles, and in 3:10 to Yuma, he plays Dan Evans, a poor, handicapped rancher who volunteers to be part of a rag tag team to take captured legendary outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to Yuma prison.James Mangold (Walk the Line, Identity) does an incredible job of directing the terrific cast. Ben Foster (X-Men: The Last Stand, 30 Days of Night) is a revelation as Charlie Prince, Wade's most loyal crew member, who will stop at nothing to rescue his captured leader en route to Yuma prison. Crowe is able to make his complicated character multi-dimensional in that he is both fearsome but someone you also secretly root for.Everyone does justice to the heart-wrenching script peppered with killer lines. In explaining his decision to take the prisoner on the dangerous journey, Dan frustratedly whispers to his wife Alice (Gretchen Mol), ""If I don't go, we gotta pack up and leave. Now I'm tired, Alice. I'm tired of watching my boys go hungry. I'm tired of the way that they look at me. I'm tired of the way that you don't."" In another pivotal scene between Dan and his teenage son (Logan Lerman), he says, ""Just remember, it's your old man that hauled Ben Wade to that station... when nobody else would."" Not all men in his situation will do what is right. Christian Bale makes the rest of us want to believe that his kind of man still exists.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Come for the acting talent, stay for the above average film","As a rule, westerns are not typically my jam. But there's something about a film, in any genre, when you get two heavy-weight actors going toe-to-toe that is just such a pleasure to watch. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe (in 2007 before he started phoning it in) are worth the price of admission here alone. Throw in a great Ben Foster performance and you have yourself a real treat.For what it is, the film is pretty good. It's a remake of a1950s movie, so it is quite simple in nature, but then most westerns are to be fair and that's what people tend to like about them. Of course you have to accept the usual improbabilities of 10,000 bullets conveniently missing the good guys along the way. We're all pretty used to that by now though, aren't we?There's enough here to keep the average audience member entertained, and if westerns happen to be your thing then you'll likely have a great time. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

All the nonsense I've been reading about whether or not there's a homo aspect is hysterical. What gravy for the filmmakers to have the great unwashed masses discussing that seriously.This excellent piece of work provokes and entertains. What is the difference between evil and ruthless...

3:10 to Yuma: The Legend,"There's something very special about James Mangold's ""3:10 to Yuma,"" a prince among remakes. Looking back, it's possible to recognize this in the first few scenes of the film. A bandit gang plans to rob a stagecoach in the American Southwest of the late-1860s. The bandits mount-up, but not before we see one of them place a few fistfuls of dynamite into his saddlebags. Surprise-surprise, a few minutes later we're in for a treat: the first use of ""shoot the gas tank""-tactics in a Western. It's an unlikely occurrence, brought to us for pure enjoyment.And so it is, I suggest, with the entire film. Unlike the 1957 original, which tells it straight, this version tells it crooked. We're not watching how events actually transpired. No, we're watching how we *wished* they'd transpired. If you want the truth, then check out the 1957 version, herein lies ""3:10 to Yuma: The Legend.""You should remember that when you first heard the 3:10 story you were lying asleep at night as a child with your older brother. He lit a match and told you of when it was ""your old man and Ben Wade to the station, when no one else would""",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A New Retelling of the 1957 Version,"Westerns are a tough sale to many movie buffs. They tend to be overdone, cliché, and ho-hum on action. And although 3:10 TO YUMA has a few of those strikes against it, it does stand out as a good film for a couple of reasons.First is the acting. Russell Crowe (CINDERELLA MAN) as the bad-ass Ben Wade was a great choice. He's a ruggedly good-lookin' fella with a heart of stone that melts just a tad when faced with a good man trying to raise a good family. The good man is Christian Bale (THE PRESTIGE) who plays Dan Evans, a one-legged rancher who decides to help out the local constabulary by hauling the murderous and thieving Wade to the 3:10 train destined for the Yuma federal prison. But the biggest surprise wasn't from Crowe or Bale but instead from Ben Foster (30 DAYS OF NIGHT) as the gruff and deadly Charlie Prince, lead member of Ben Wade's outlaw gang. His creepy and maligned gunslinging attitude was well-honed and goes beyond anything you've seen of bad guys in past western films. A surprisingly decent addition in the form of Peter Fonda (WILD HOGS) as a roughshod Pinkerton also adds a bit to the acting caliber throughout the movie.Secondly, although 3:10 To Yuma is basically a remake of the 1957 film by the same name (starring Glen Ford and Van Heflin), the script of this re-envisioned version weaves a new ending that goes a long way to helping it define itself as something more than just a remake. Keeping us guessing about the strengths and flaws of each of the main characters added a fresh element to what could have been a stale retelling.And finally, the action. There's plenty of old-style sequences that many will be familiar with (blowing up a tunnel by shooting a wad of dynamite in midair, a stagecoach shoot-out, etc.), but there's also some great chase-and-shoot scenes in the beginning and end of the film.I do have to mention that Hollywood has seen fit lately to remake just about anything some movie studio still holds rights to, and this trend appears to be gaining steam rather than diminishing. 3:10 To Yuma is no different in that respect, but it doesn't simply follow the same script of the 1957 version, which makes it an unusual hybrid: a film that treads over old terrain but leaves a new imprint via its ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The best western since Unforgiven,"I read the comments earlier prior to watching this movie and they were spot on. The acting is fantastic and Oscar worthy performances throughout. It deserves best film but whether this is up for Oscars come next year who is to say, it should be and best supporting actor easily by Ben Foster who plays the ruthless gang member on the trail of his captured boss Ben Wade (Russel Crowe). His performance was the most memorable as he exhibits the resolute qualities of his captured boss. Both the antagonist and protagonist roles are well played. A well crafted and intelligent screenplay which makes for the best film since Unforgiven. Like Unforgiven it doesn't set out to show good guys as flawless and bad guys without some sensitivity. Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) exhibits all the wile and cunning of a fox to escape his captors and it is towards the end he shows a different side to that which he plays so well throughout the film. Another case in point Byron Mcelroy (Petre Fonda) who is on the good side. It is soon apparent that he is as ruthless as those he intends to bring to justice and those who are justice are equally as ruthless in other ways as the story unfolds. Only Dan Evans (Christain Bale) has any credibility as the suppressed rancher. As the story unfolds the twists in the story make the film intense and thoroughly enjoyable. It will stand out as a classic and hopefully be the revival of the western. If it is I hope for more of the same intelligently written well acted and Oscar worthy westerns. Lets hope it is nominated and gains the recognition to put it up there with Unforgiven.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Yu Ma want to skip this one .....,"3:10 to Yuma is an awful film. Something that I cannot believe the likes of Crowe / Bale / Mangold ever got involved in. I mean - did they even read the script beforehand? It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The amount of unbelievable situations this flick throws up is ....how can I say it? Unbelievable!!!!Here's just a quick flavour of what's wrong in this picture: - Peter Fonda's character gets gut shot at point blank range, carried into town on a horse, operated on by a vet and still leads a posse to track Crowe the very next day. Or it could even have been the same day !! - Crowe is a master criminal- so smart he's robbed the railroad umpteen times but instead of heading to Mexico with his gang he waits around for the Marshall's to capture him - even having a drink with Bale as he waits. - Bale got his foot blown off in the Civil War and hobbles most of the time - yet is able to run and jump in the dramatic conclusion like Usain Bolt. - Crowe is supposed to be a psycho yet runs with Bale trying to avoid his own men from setting him free. He must have had a 1000 chances to run the other way and escape.I cannot go on as I would literally bust the 1000 word review limit on IMDb just simply pointing out the ridiculous premise of this movie. No wonder Cruise turned it down. He probably thought it was a joke. He was right.The acting is pretty good - Crowe is quiet and simmering even though he has an unplayable part in my view. His character simply has no logic to him. Bale is brooding and excellent as always - but again, his character makes some decisions that cannot be explained. Idiotic is too kind a word. Foster is eating the scenery as usual - but also good in his over the top way. The direction is OK, cinematography fine. It's just the story line, premise, screenplay that literally makes no sense scene after scene, page after page until the end that has to be watched to be disbelieved. Or better still - don't watch it.Skip the 3:10 guys and hope there's a better train behind it. 2/10 - Awful.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

Combining old and new: 3:10 to Yuma.,"Cracking whips, intense chases, stagecoaches, revolvers, spectacular gunfights, with the good guy always winning: all part of the old westerns. It seems that in the modern era, audiences are more enthralled with the complex than with the simple and sweet. Rather than merely be entertained, we want to be exposed to the characters' emotions. We want to feel the heartache, anger, love, or hate of the individual rather than seeing only his good side portrayed. I must admit; I am one of these people. I don't go to the movie theater to see a fake representation of life; I want to see it as it is, with all its ups and downs and everything in between. Perhaps this is why I so enjoyed 3:10 to Yuma. The film's creators combine the flare and feel of the old with the drama and emotional complexity of the new, while in the process producing a remarkable film.The film takes place in Bisbee, Arizona where the main character, Dan Evans (a one-legged Civil War veteran), lives with his wife and two sons. The film opens as Dan's barn is burned down by the landlord who is going to sell Dan's land to the railroad company. He tells Dan that he has two weeks to get off the property or the house will be next. On his way to speak with the landlord, Dan witnesses the robbery of a stagecoach by the infamous Ben Wade and his band of rebels. After Ben's arrest, Dan offers his assistance in delivering the criminal to the 3:10 prison train to Yuma (hence the movie's title). What follows is one scene of action after another, as the remains of Ben's gang hunt Dan and the others on the trek to deliver Ben.Perhaps the greatest aspect of this movie is the acting and character development. The film's creators manage to place two excellent actors into uncharacteristic roles. Christian Bale, used to playing the part of the tough guy (in movies such as Batman Begins and Equilibrium), plays the part of Dan Evans, a cautious rancher whose reputation with the public and his own family has suffered as a result of his reluctance to use violence. Dan's youngest son has tuberculosis, and this combined with a failing harvest has his family in a tough spot financially. When the opportunity comes to make $200 by delivering an outlaw to prison, Dan takes it gladly. When speaking to his wife, Dan says, ""If I don't go, we gotta pack up and leave. Now I'm tired, Alice. I'm tired of watching my boys go hungry. I'm tired of the way that they look at me. I'm tired of the way that you don't.""Opposite the character of Dan, is the outlaw Ben Wade played by Russell Crowe. Russell Crowe is likewise used to playing the role of a man of justice (think Gladiator). However, in this movie he plays the role of a conniving, womanizing, and Bible-quoting criminal. When asked by the doctor of the prison party whether it is true that he dynamited a wagon full of prospectors, Ben replies, ""No, that's a lie... It was a train full.""In my opinion, the best movies are those that ask questions. Even better are those that answer them. 3:10 to Yuma is of the latter. It asks the question, what makes a man good, and answers with the character of Dan Evans. While Dan may not be perfect, he strives to do what is right. The film brings out the fact that good things do not necessarily happen to good people; and, in fact, in Dan's case the opposite is true. His family suffers and even resents him because of his choice to ""turn the other cheek."" Despite this suffering, he leads his family in prayer. When Dan volunteers for the job of taking Ben to the prison train, we, Ben, and perhaps even Dan himself assumes that he is doing it for the money. However, when his comrades abandon him and he is left alone to deliver Ben, he is offered his payment, yet he refuses to accept money for backing down on a job. After this, it is presumed that the desire to perform a heroic deed drives him on. Yet, after racing across town among a shower of bullets, this is likewise proved wrong. Finally, we come to the conclusion, that Dan is doing this deed simply because it is the right thing to do and this earns him my respect as well as that of his son and Ben Wade.The intense violence, mature themes, and several swear words earn this movie an R rating. However, this is the most morally upright secular movie I have seen in a long while. In a time when the bad is often celebrated and the good looked down upon, 3:10 to Yuma offers a breath of fresh air. What happens to Dan? Does he deliver Ben to the train? Well, you'll have to watch the movie to find out. You may find me back at the theater watching it again too.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Horay for the return of the western,"If, like me, you were fed up watching a generation of fifth-rate westerns that were not fit to shoe the getaway horses of their predecessors from the 1950s-70s, then this film is a breath of fresh air.I was dubious despite the great reviews as remakes of great films like the 57 version of 3.10 tend to be dire and leave me like Colonel Kurtz muttering ""The horror... the horror..."" but this one was better than the original.It worked on several levels. Most importantly it was an express train of events - not just meaningless fireworks, but action leading to another action and another. But it also worked as a meditation on what happens if responsibility to your conscience and your loved ones want to go in two different directions. Much has been said about the excellent cast. Crowe in particular is icily impressive and the bible-quoting baddie. Best of all, it manages to be gripping without taking itself too seriously - it always has a heart as well as a head.I've not enjoyed a western this much since The Good The Bad and The Ugly.

Best western I've seen since Unforgiven,"I normally wait until someone whose taste in movies I trust recommends a western to me before I go and watch it. Cause I am not a fan of the genre. The odd one stands out for me. The Good, the Bad and the ugly. Shane. Unforgiven. High Noon. The sons of Katie Elder. The series of 'The Virginian'. And the remake of the 3.10 to Yuma joins that list. There is all you want from a good western (I don't do politics so there is no revisionism comparison in this review). The baddies are really bad, the good guys are truly good yet naive and unsteady. What makes it special is the deeper human touch that runs trough this movie. The interaction between the characters is allowed to develop throughout. Also the use of scenery is kept to a minimum so as not to interfere with the developments. Great movie, great entertainment and contrary to some reviews I thought the ending was appropriate!! Go watch it!!! I bet you won't regret it!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good movie with a simple story.,"You don't usually see westerns like this. This was a slow moving film, with some action, but mostly dialog, and it was very entertaining. Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) and his band of loyal men are tough and evil guys. When Ben is caught and escorted on horseback to the 3:10 train to Yuma by a group of men including Dan Evans (Christian Bale), Wade's men stop at nothing to get their boss back. Dan Evans is a farmer that needs to get Mr. Wade to the train to Yuma to get $200 so he can keep his farm. It's a very straightforward film with a really standard plot (obviously seen before in the original), and it's also very slow. The slow plot helps it. It's one of the few films where we get to know the good guys and bad guys as actual characters. I was interested the entire time and though I personally didn't like the ending that well, it still worked. I highly recommend this for fans of westerns or just good movies.My rating: *** out of ****. 114 mins. R for violence.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ben Foster is a legend already,"This movie is close to a perfect movie. The only problem I have with it is the slow pace at the start. Figuring out the Bales character is a coward!! OK! we got it, stop repeating it, move on! But after that it just becomes a brilliant story told really really well. I loved the set the scenery, the proper gun fights, the real sense of wild wild west. I like the way the two Big guns of Bale and Crowe work so well with each other to bring out the best in each others characters. I think Bale just held back a bit at the start!!! My favorite character was Charlie Prince played by Ben Foster. This is the second time I've seen him acting. First time was in Alpha Dog. He was brilliant in Alpha Dog and is even better in this movie. Brilliant casting; in this movie. Ben Foster is going to be the next big thing! Maybe he is already!! I don't know!!

An Honest Review,"Most of the time I hate remakes....but I give a big pass to most Western and War movie remakes.Mainly that's because, until M*A*S*H early war movies had soldiers that looked like they stepped out of the shower and put on a freshly laundered uniform...you know, instead of the realities of life in combat zones.And the same goes with Westerns, the cowpokes may be riding the range...yet they look like they had the time to shower, shave, style their hair, and press their clothes.None of that really sat right with me...at all.The remake righted that wrong.And it did it without killing the wonderful Elmore Leonard story the movie was based on and let's be honest, he really has the best ideas for crime and western stories the world has ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Don't Miss This Train!,"3:10 to Yuma is an example of a good film (the 1957 version) being remade into an even more memorable one. Directed by the ever consistent James Mangold, it is a suspenseful, beautifully paced western, with a great cast creating many memorable characters. The changes made to the original film, based on an Elmore Leonard short story, only enhance the storyline and give it greater relevance in the 21st century.Russell Crowe is outstanding as the highly intelligent, but deadly, outlaw gang leader Ben Wade imbuing him with a degree of sympathy viewers can't ignore. Christian Bale never overplays his up against it, Civil War veteran Dan Evans and he especially shines in his third act interplaying with Crowe, where his character's courage and quiet dignity are fully revealed. But it's not just the leads that stand out. Ben Foster's creates an arresting psychopathic, but loyal, Charlie Prince, who's Wade's second in command. And it's a pleasure to see Peter Fonda filling a significant supporting role, as Byron McElroy, an elderly Pinkerton agent hired by the Railroad company to hunt Wade and Alan Tudyk turning up, as a dubiously qualified medico, with an adventurous streak.In a storyline that doesn't feature a huge number of female characters, Gretchen Mol's scenes as Dan's wife, Alice, are both realistic and affecting and I loved her dinner interlude with Ben Wade, as he attempts to both charm her, whilst hopefully making preparations, for a possible future escape. Logan Lerman does just about the impossible, in what is a far more beefed up role from the original film. He turns Dan's (at first) brattish, impressionable, teenage son William, into a young man who we see has come of age by the film's exciting climax, which again has been very smartly tweaked, from the earlier version.The action scenes are really well choreographed and the cinematography from Greek professional, Phedon Papamichael, is never less than impressive. By story's end, it's abundantly clear that James Mangold's exceedingly well-made remake isn't as simply expressed as its predecessor, but more layered with elements of morality to consider for our modern sensibilities.Catch the 3:10 before it leaves the station.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sure as God's vengeance they're coming,"Wow. Do I really need to write any more than that? Writing ""wow"" 2,000 times would serve as a fitting description regarding how I feel after watching this film, twice, for the purpose of this review, but it would also make for a lousy review of such an incredible movie, so I'll do my best to bring justice to what a darn good movie this is. 3:10 to Yuma plays out like a perfectly choreographed dance. It is a film of perfect harmony, tempo, and movement, showcasing film-making and all that implies at such a level of perfection that I don't know how any other movie could ever rival this one in conveying its simplistic plot yet also complex characters with such grace. 3:10 to Yuma could easily have been just another action movie with pretty faces that become progressively bloodier as the film moves along. Instead, the film presents viewers with the unfolding of a new chapter in a man's life and shows the influence that the strength and determination of another can have on even the staunchest and coldest of hearts. 3:10 to Yuma packs quite the emotional punch while maintaining a pace complete with terrific, well-staged action and luscious scenery. This is film-making at its finest.Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is a poor rancher struggling to keep his land. He's nearly broke, and his land is declared worth more with him off of it. One night, those to whom he owes money burn down his barn. He and his two sons head out the next morning to recover their cattle that were driven off by the fire and witness the robbery of a railroad stagecoach orchestrated by the notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe). After a brief, tense meeting between Evans and Wade, the two go their separate ways only to meet again in the town of Bisbee where Evans is witness to Wade's arrest. For $200, Evans offers to travel with the gang accompanying Wade to the 3:10 to Yuma, a prison train that will take the criminal to his trial and execution. With Wade's gang hot on their trail, Evans and Wade come to know one another, and each man must choose his own destiny as the hour draws nearer to 3:10. 3:10 to Yuma is absolutely brilliant as a character study on human interaction and the bond that forms between men, a bond that stems from respect for a man's soul and not from the barrel of his gun. The characters of Dan Evans and Ben Wade are anything but archetypical movie characters. While they are simple men on the surface--a poor rancher and a criminal--they reveal a deep and profound sense of humanity, and the slow reveal of this trait, especially in the Wade character, makes for a stunning finale to this film. Wade's revelation is perhaps best epitomized in the film through the theme of his three drawings. I won't tell you what he draws, but when you watch the film, pay attention to them, especially his final drawing. I felt his drawing of each subject represented those things in which he felt peace and comfort, those things that allowed him to, even for an instant, forget he's wanted for 22 armed robberies and believe that he's a simple man enjoying the simple pleasures of life. Taken in this context, I found the ending of the film all the more powerful and relevant. Both Bale and Crowe are brilliant in their performances. Each actor is so good and the chemistry between them and the characters they portray is so strong that even the terse looks each gives the other is literally sometimes worth a thousand words. Watching these two fine performers in action is alone worth the price of admission.Technically, 3:10 to Yuma is a standout film. As an action film, I was completely impressed with the staging of the action as well as the realism and accuracy in the use of firearms in the film. Anyone that has spent time handling and discharging firearms knows that all too often, Hollywood glamorizes the use of weapons and gives them unrealistic actions and sound effects. This film is one of the most accurate I've seen. I was particularly impressed with the audible quality of the shots. The reverberation and hard hitting sound and power of each shot is amazingly reproduced. Directing the action is James Mangold, who has a wonderful variety of films under his belt, ranging from the edgy and underrated Cop Land to the Oscar winning Girl, Interrupted to the creepy horror flick Identity and finally to the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line. This eclectic mix of films shows the director has real talent, that he can venture from one genre to the next, and he has now proved himself worthy in the genre of the Western, one of the most storied and beloved genres in American cinema history. The movie also contains an absolutely wonderful score by Marco Beltrami.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""I Hate Posses""","As he did with ""Walk the Line"" two years ago, James Mangold has brought an element of aged entertainment back into the spotlight for new generations to enjoy. This time, however, instead of picking up a bunch of Johnny Cash CDs, viewers are sure to run to the stores and pick up some classic westerns.With ""3:10 to Yuma,"" Mangold and crew have re-vitalized the Western in a new style that still manages to hold on to what we all love about Westerns. The film stars Christian Bale and Russell Crowe as two men divided by the law and by their sense of justice. Bale plays the ""good guy,"" but he still manages to have some serious gray areas. Crowe plays the villain, though he's perhaps the most likable character in the film. Early on in the film, we see just how much influence Crowe's character holds over his crew, but it's completely believable. As we see more and more of him, we start to like him, eve if he is a brutal killer. What's interesting is that he acts in a way that he considers just.The plot is simple, though it is full of character development and intensity. There are some scenes that actually manage to be very emotionally true. There are some scenes that make you laugh hysterically until you realize how twisted the humor is. There are some scenes where the intensity goes on full-blast and we get that cool ""Western"" feeling. Al in all, it's a great story with enough great scenes to fill a whole city.What brings this film to the next level is the acting. Christian Bale is very restrained and subtle as the protagonist, and his performance suits the film well. Peter Fonda gives a great minor performance that is sure to arouse memories of his father's older roles. Still there are two performances in this film that should surely be nominated for Oscars. Russell Crowe deserves a Best Actor nod for his fun and likable portrayal of such a complex and gray-shaded villain. This may be his best performance so far in his career. However, the show-stealer here is really Ben Foster as Charlie Prinze, Wade's (Crowe's) right-hand man. He embodies the classic spirit of a western villain. His lines are the best and most quotable in the film. His expressions and accent are also pitch-perfect. He utilizes his heavily-made-up face to create some of the most intense moments of the film. He also plays one of the most interesting characters in the film. He has a devotion for Crowe's character that is so strong and so passionate that it borders on (if not crosses) some unwritten lines that were only barely touched upon in past Westerns, with the exception of a particularly ""different"" one that came out a couple of years ago.See ""3:10 to Yuma"" for the acting. See it for the upsetting but powerful take on violence. If none of these things appeal to you, just see it for the chase and shoot-out scenes and for the sheer fun spirit that the film embodies.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Elmore Leonard's short story, the basis for the very fine 1957 western directed by Delmer Daves, has hence become a bloodthirsty yarn filled with psychopathic villains, dead bodies, and a runaway teenager. As the silver-tongued killer, Russell Crowe initially appears to be giving a subtle yet sharply-etched performance--but this portrait degenerates as the film goes on, as does just about everything else here. Director James Mangold leaves no western cliché unturned; by the time we get a surprise attack by gun-toting Apaches (whom, we're told far in advance, ""enjoy killing""), the movie has spread itself too thin, and all evidence of a suspenseful, character-driven western has been negated.

Classic Western,"Westerns have been a mainstay of Hollywood since the early years of the motion picture industry. 3:10 to Yuma is a classic story with, clearly defined characters. Russell Crowe having previously proved himself a well rounded actor in movies like ""The Gladiator"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"", once again amazes the audience with his role as the antagonist, bad guy, Ben Wade. Ben Wade has a clearly defined, dark edge but, is also portrayed as a thinking man who seems to be more of a victim of circumstance, than evil by choice.

"jam packed, good stuff","Seen on a double bill, I hardly expected to like this movie more than ""A Fistful of Dollars"", but damned if it ain't true. In spite of the rather silky Bush-era hairstyles, it's a ringer for a good A western of the classic era - no doubt because it lifts most of its script from one. Like all my favourite Westerns, it is anti-heroic; the good guys and bad guys shade into each other until there's some doubt about who is who, and it manages this without being corny. Themes aside, it's been a long time since I saw a movie that packed this much visual information into its first five minutes; the set pieces are all riveting; the performances live up to the production - it obliterated my Russell Crowe block. My minor complaint is that the fleeting outsider's nod to the Chinese railroad slaves should have been more detailed and defined; as it is it feels like guilty liberalism. My major complaint is about the ending; there's a couple ways to take it ideologically I guess, but the bottom line is that it just doesn't work. But it wasn't such a turnoff that I didn't spend a long time thinking about it, and overall this is way better work than I expect from Hollywood these days.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Modern western hits the target,"Bale and Crow put in a masterclass in a serious and western-set version of Midnight Run.3:10 to Yuma is a modern western, a genre which is rather fading out these days, which is not something to sadden me greatly as I was never a fan of the theme. So when given this DVD to randomly borrow, I went in with as open a mind as I could muster, and was certainly attracted by Bale and Crow as both are actors I can watch.Bale is Evans, a former military sharpshooter now trying to get his ranch into some kind of fruitful state and his family comfortable, but he has to battle against the odds with authorities wanting to tear him apart given his location on wanted land, and a son who looks at him with contempt not respect.Crowe plays his nemesis Wade, an outlaw with a black heart and rotten posse.Initially the point of the movie seems unclear until Evans volunteers his (paid) services to aid in the transport of Wade who will be trialled for his various crimes.Just like Midnight Run, this is basically a tale of two arch rivals one of whom has to take the other to justice. Difference is this is anything but a comedy. Sure, it isn't the most serious movie you will ever see, and even manages a little humour (if not a lot), but it is certainly a fairly deadpan drama.The performances ensure this; Crowe oozes charisma as the colourful Wade, a truly 'bad man' but who elicits charm throughout and even hints at a humane side. Bale's Evans is a successful display of a man who simply has to battle everything, who is not a dominant personality by nature, and whose own chidren seem to lack respect for him.This escort is his chance to make things right.The directing in this movie is impressive - fast moving and never boring even for a second. Serious work went into this and the cinematography flows seamlessly as a result.And the acting makes you care about the characters, even Wade. However, Foster puts in a cracking shift as Prince, a truly rotten and despicable killer with not an ounce of decency in him - he is a lot of fun. He is very much the villain of the piece.3:10 to Yuma is an impressive piece of cinema, and the 3 main leads steal the show - which is really the point.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"great western action, characters, and performances; a lot of dialogue and clichés though","One of my favorite westerns, as it has some excellent action for the genre, and a memorable villain played by Ben Foster, Charlie Prince. Easily my favorite character in the movie, despite being such a bad man. Christian Bale did phenomenally, as he always does, in a role that is more dramatic than macho, which isn't to say that he wasn't tough as nails. Russell Crowe played Ben Wade with perhaps too much finesse, it felt sappy after a while, but given the source material I can't be too critical. The romanticism of his character also seemed to be laid on too thick, as was Bale's character's son in the movie, with his resentment and rebellious nature, laughable to me. The pacing is a tug-o-war, but not to say that non-action scenes were entirely boring. Much of the dialogue was well written and performed, laying a foundation for great characters, even for those who were less reputable.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Great Return for the Western,"Finally the western genre has returned. In 1993 ""Tombstone"" was released and was a big hit; it revitalized the dying, or already dead, western. Since then, even with as big as hit as it was, Hollywood just hasn't released any westerns, at least not mainstream ones. There just wasn't money to be found in them, and audiences largely ignored them, until now. Talk abounded surrounding a trailer for a movie called ""3:10 to Yuma"" starring some of Hollywood's biggest stars. For once, wanting to see a western was the ""thing"" again. And the movie that promised a ""cool"" western really delivered.""Yuma"" is based on a 1950s movie based on a short story. This time directed by ""Walk the Line's"" James Mangold and starring Christian Bale and Russell Crowe. Bale plays a down and out farmer, Dan Evans, who has a huge debt to pay to the local baddies, so when notorious outlaw, Ben Wade (Crowe), is captured and sentenced to death in Yuma, Ben is more than willing to collect the ransom to take Wade to the 3:10 train to Yuma. But Ben's old gang isn't about to let that happen.Christian Bale is once again brilliant as he will be for every movie he ever makes. Crowe is equally great as he balances on the line of pure evil and showing some good side. And that's the cool thing, Ben is such a dark, suave, well mannered guy one second, the next he's putting three bullets into his gang member for messing up. Other notables are Ben Foster as Wade's right hand, Charlie Prince, who is so extremely evil he makes Wade look like an angel. And Peter Fonda as a mean-tempered, revenge bent sheriff is great as well. The cinematography is stunning switching from the serene desert, to a fast-paced, intense gun battle.

more of a drama than western,"...which is not to say it doesn't have actions and explosions..it does and in plenty. But it delves more into the psyche of an eccentric outlaw(crowe), a one-legged rancher(bale) trying to *man* up for his family and children and the relationship that develops between them. Christian bale delivers good performance, just short of a great one. It reminds me of al pacino in donnie brasco. The normal tough guy playing the weakling. Its difficult for them to pull it off because the audience is used to seeing them in a different shade and they themselves have to let go of their normal selves and natural instincts to put up a character like that. There are times in this movie when Bale lets the normal Bale come to screen and i felt that at odds with how the rancher should have been. But thats only once or twice in otherwise a great performance.The movie has its share of clichés, like a bible-reciting,painter,womanizer outlaw and others and heck i wouldn't say there is much novel about the story/screenplay. But it's just well done and there is no dull moment in the movie. The score is also reasonably good.

Good (Until the Ending),"This is a well-done old fashioned Western, a repeat in fact of a film done 50 years earlier.

Westerns have virtually disappeared as a film genre but if you were raised on them, as I was, you've seen variations on this plot 1000 times more or less.

I thought Russell crowe shined as the antagonist, while Christian Bale did a pretty good job as well. Its shot and edited very well and has a very suitable score from Marco Beltrami. Its not a film i would watch over and over, but i enjoyed it a lot the first time around. Ben Foster Peter Fonda and Gretchen Mol were great in supporting roles while Logan Lerman wasn't bad as Bale's character's son either, decent job for a young actor. I think for what it is, this film is good, real good, don't expect the most realistic action sequences, though, as that is not exactly the case with the shootouts, but then again, its still a bit more realistic than most films of its kind, thus i rate it highly. My Rating: 9/10. #302 on my list of all time favorite Movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
phenomenal film,"One of the best films of the year, certainly one of the best of the 'new breed' of westerns to come out in the past ten.Gritty and realistic but without the gratuitous gore thought necessary in updates of this genre.Russell Crowe and Christian Bale (why is he constantly overlooked by the Academy?)are at the top of their game. The supporting cast is outstanding with nary a false move made by anyone. Very happy to see the entire ensemble nominated by SAG. Ben Foster has true chameleon like qualities and makes for an excellent villain.I have not seen the original but I have to say the ending was unexpected.Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
another extraordinary western movie,"Wait a long to watch this movie. I was wrong. This movie is worth of watching at the first releasing date. Amazing, brilliant. The story is quite simple, a temporary team recruited to send a robber and killer onto 3:10 train to Yuma, but the director made this movie tight and attract audience attention all the time, not any waste in story forwarding. Bale and Crowe were brilliant; they portrayed the characters multi-dimensionally, exhibited the characters' mind to audience. Ben Foster is really shocking in playing the gangster, smart, cold blooded, and loyal. At the end, I kind of started to like Crowe's character. There was still love in his heart somewhere, deeply.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A great western,"This is a great film that every western fan must see.I first saw the preview for it some time ago, and I was convinced I had to see it.

Russel Crowe and Christian Bale does an incredible job here, and plays great the whole way through.

Even bad men love their mommas,"A western about a downtrodden rancher who seizes his opportunity to turn in a notoriously dangerous bandit and save his family's livelihood.

Goof - Railroad tracks in Background Scenes,"I'm a fan of railroads and railroading. One thing that struck me when watching this movie was that the railroad tracks in the background, when Dan Evans was hauling Ben Wade from the hotel to the railroad station to catch the 3:10 to Yuma, roll up and down the hills. What the heck. Railroad engines were not made to go up and down hills like an automobile or bicycle or virtually any other conveyance. Railroad engines of any type, steam or diesel, are only capable of climbing gradual grades, and thus cuts were made in hills for trains to travel through or, in the case of some mountains, tunnels were created. To a railroader, those tracks going up and down the hills stretched the imagination and for me, virtually ruined the scenes in which they appeared because the goof distracted from the action. The movie producers should have paid better attention to detail for the sake of authenticity.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Excellent movie.  Kudos for Russell Crowe and company,"For a remake of a movie that was made fifty years ago, this is an excellent movie. Usually remakes are lemons. Not so with this one. This is an excellent movie, with great acting, solid script and beautiful cinematography. Russell Crowe once again proves that he is one of the great actors and the rest of the cast give great performances too, especially Ben Foster and Peter Fonda. Now regarding Mr. Fonda, his presence improves any movie. What a wonderful actor. But what raises this movie to a higher level is the story, which is part High Noon and part Good,Bad,Ugly.

Did anyone praising this movie actually see it?,"Awful to say the least. So bad I could not finish it. Its a Western so of course I expected clichés, but this was just stupid. Or rather it assumed the audience was stupid. The sniper hitting a target on a bouncing stage-coach at 300 yards? Peter Fonda gut-shot with a .44 but riding hard the next day? I finally ejected it at the hotel scene where the #2 baddie was offering money to the townsfolk to do his killing for him. Why were the lawmen not picking the gang off instead?! Why didn't the good guys ambush the gang as they rode up the street in the first place after the the boy warned them they were coming?! As I like Crowe and Bale I do hope their careers can recover from this choker. At least I didn't get suckered into paying theater price but still wasted over an hour of my life.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not just another remake... This is THE remake!!! 9/10!,"I'm not letting myself get caught by one of my favorite actors (Bale), or one of the ones I hate the most (Crowe). They both made this film so full of emotions that I could barely stop watching the screen. But what I really wanted to highlight about this is Ben Foster's performance... It Was INCREDIBLE. Period. I cannot remember right now another performance as good as Ben Foster's in a western, except for Mr. John Wayne as Hondo Lane or Clint Eastwood as Jed Cooper in ""Hang 'Em High"". It is worth clarify how much of a western movies freak I am...and a collector as well.. I loved the first one, and I certainly love this one too! Let's hope Mr. Mangold has in his mind another western made, although I'm not sure if another remake will do...

"A great western, destined to be a classic","It is a great idea from the movie studios to bring back western movies, its been a long but a very long tie since I watched a good and decent western until today that I saw 3:10 to Yuma, a remake from a 1957 movie with the same name. This movie keeps the same formula of old time westerns but wit a whole new look. A very interesting story about a rancher who decides to escort an outlaw to the train station so he could take the 3:10 train to Yuma. The plot convince me a 100%, it is very well developed. Its a film with lots of action and adventure, some involuntary humor. The time line is perfectly portrayed on the landscapes, the scenery and the costume design. The direction from John Mangold is excellent, it has a very good rhythm, thing that makes the movie very enjoyable. It has a wonderful cast, Russell Crowe gives one of his best performances as the legendary outlaw Ben Wade, Christian Bale is also amazing in his role of rancher Dan Evans. A great revelation was young actor Logan Lerman in his role as Dan's older son William, it was a really good performance. In the supporting roles we have to mention Ben Foster as Charlie Prince and Peter Fonda as Byron McElroy, their acting were pretty impressive. To conclude, this was a very enjoyable and entertaining movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Very recommendable.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Take the ""3:10 to Cine"" to see ""3:10  To Yuma""","Do not be a train wreck by missing the exhilarating western ""3:10 To Yuma"". It is quite the entertaining western that we have been waiting for. Director James Mangold struck gold in his delivery of this remake of the 1957 western starring Glenn Ford. Mangold was quite fortunate to lasso thespian megastars Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in the title roles this time around. Bale plays Dan Evans, a crestfallen rancher who is so broke that $3.10 is about the estimated total cash he has on him to support his worried wife and his two melancholic kids. Crowe plays Ben Wade, the wily outlaw who leads a posse that robs armed stagecoaches carrying lots of ""Big Ben Franklins"" for Big Ben Wade to steal. Wade's luck runs out when he is captured by lawmen in the desolate western town of Bisbee. The ""financial desperado"" Evans is then hired by the Bisbee lawmen to join a posse which will take the baddie Wade to the town of Contention in order for put him on the 3:10 to Yuma train; that will lead him to Yuma jail for an eventual hanging. Let's just say that they want Wade to hang it high as the basketball Wade does when he dunks the ball. Anyway, Evans accepts the offer and what follows is a cerebral & physical duel between Evans & Wade that is quite the roundup I have been waiting for in a suspenseful & creative western. Along for the ""take Wade to the 3:10 to Yuma ride"" is Peter Fonda playing Byron McElroy, a former grungy outlaw who joins the Bisbee entourage because he himself despises Wade; Kevin Durand as Tucker, a loudmouth cowboy; Alan Tudyk as Doc Potter, the town veterinarian who is used to hanging out with a bunch of desperate old dogs himself; and Dallas Roberts as Grayson Butterfield, the railroad lawman who is as soft in the inside as butter itself. Not exactly the dream team of Western Bad-Asses; which does make it easy for the clever Wade to always be in contention to escape on his way to Contention. However, I will hold my guns here because to say more would be a misfire in adequately reviewing the film with no spoilers. Ben Foster plays Charlie Prince, Wade's right hand man (no not Shaquile O' Neal) whose devilish demeanor is western bloodcurdling at its apex. Yes, this Prince definitely does ""go crazy"". Let's just say that Prince and his bandit posse will go to any means to save their boss Wade. Many of the acting performances of ""3:10 to Yuma"" are deserving of Oscar nominations at the Kodak Corral. Crowe and Bale were simply brilliant as Wade & Evans and will probably be dueling out again in the Best Actor category in numerous award shows. Foster means ""American for Best Supporting Actor nomination"" for his wicked work as the monstrous Prince. I was also fond of Fonda's fun acting as MCelroy. Logan Lerman who plays Dan Evans' son William was also a nice addition to this winning acting posse. Director Mangold ""walks this western line"" with a triumphant psychological western touch that makes the ""3:10 To Yuma"" the yummiest cinematic experience of the year. ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great story, well acted, close to Unforgiven","If you enjoyed Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"", then you will love this film. The cast is brilliant and the on screen chemistry is obvious. While one is better off following directors rather than actors, I find myself seeing every movie that Bale and Crowe star in, and I'm rarely disappointed. I won't bother summarizing the plot. The film has all of the necessary elements of a true Western: a dangerous and outwardly heartless gunslinger, a truly heartless land owner, and decent family man (protagonist) who's adherence to a strict and honorable moral code is constantly tested and often ridiculed in the harsh frontier. The movie takes these basic elements and peals them back. The actors are able to give the characters depth without becoming cliché. The action is well performed and well shot. You will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent Film,"I have actually seen a few bad reviews in here and I'm very surprised by them. This movie was really terrific. If you are looking for realism, I'm not sure where I could point you. 3:10 to Yuma is based on a story from about 40 years ago so of course it is going to have some points that seem ""far fetched."" They are all within the context of the movie. The acting is outstanding. I'm convinced Russell Crowe hasn't made a bad movie since ""Virtuosity."" Christian Bale is rapidly ascending the ranks with Crowe and Edward Norton as guys who simply don't put their names on to bad films (the Norton clown movie aside). Suspenseful the whole way through and great viewing. Nothing bad to say about it. One parallel I will draw though that may be a bit abstract but for those of you who have seen it I think you'll get the gist .... 3:10 to Yuma has a lot of ""A Bronx Tale"" in it (or should I say vice versa since this is a remake). Either way, watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Save yourself time and money,"Save yourself time and money and see the original, it's much better and much more believable. From the saloon scene with Wade and the barmaid to it's ending this version is a very pale comparison at best to the original.Even in black and white the cinematography is much better in the original and the characters of the original are so much more real and memorable than any in this very poor remake.Basically this version seems to follow the example of the present horror movie genre where you see if you can top each killing with a more horrific and bloody method than the last murder scene.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another Fine Performance from Ben Wade,"When we last saw Ben Wade, he was chewing (sipping) the scenery in Ridley Scott's ""A Good Year"". Nobody saw that film, prompting Mr. Wade to lament that people should trust him and his judgement in film. Well, I do. I am happy to report that Mr. Wade's latest outing, ""3:10 to Yuma"" proves yet again that Mr. Wade is the finest judge of scripts and directors in (and outside) of Hollywood.Since Mr. Wade's introduction to America in ""The Quick and the Dead"", he has captivated audiences in one quality production after another. ""Yuma"" abandons the camp of the ""Q&D"" and gives us something straight out of the '50's and '60's'. No cynicism here: this is the mythic Western of my youth, where America's westward expansion focuses the morality of a man into Biblical proportions. No wonder that most Westerns of the classic period were set in deserts. No wonder that the excellent dialogue and delivery exposes the purity of a man.Supporting Mr. Wade is Christian Bale, who himself is proving a most versatile actor, with a similar ability to judge the quality of a script. His struggle is the central focus of the film, with Mr. Wade's as that of muse or guide through that journey to redemption.Heartily recommended....but stay through the credits...they're quite entertaining, especially if you admire Mr. Wade's ability to bury himself in the part!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Yale plays Evans brilliantly,and Crowe,damn,is just too cool for words. I've never seen the original,but I can't imagine anything topping this. It is in the same league as the classic Western ""High Noon."" My advice is don't miss this one. It is rated R,for language and violence, but I wouldn't hesitate to bring my teenager.

Classic western for the modern viewer,"I really love westerns. The stories, the gunfights, the scenery, the slightly over-the-top characters- all of it. However I'm in my 20s and the heyday of westerns was long before my time (many thanks to cable and premium channels for keeping them alive.) They are dated, both in quality of filming and acting and in freedom of expression. This 3:10 to Yuma captured the spirit of those old westerns with today's more serious acting and improved cinematography and special effects.The plot was the very definition of a western: war veteran family man, failing ranch, greedy railroad men, gang of outlaws with a dashing leader. Much like the previews suggest and enjoyable the entire time. The acting may not have been ""oscar caliber"" but everyone was right on character. Ben Foster had no problem on screen with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe, and even the young Logan Lerman (had to go look his name up) held his own. Nice to see Peter Fonda and Alan Tudyk, minor characters but memorable moments.The violence was stronger than back when, though not deserving of the R it was given. PG-13 only I would think, comparable to the X-Men series or teen horror movies. The eldest son was played by an actor too ""young"" to see an R movie! PG-13 also for the mild-strong language and sexual situations more vague than a Viagra commercial.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Western since Tombstone,"This remake of the classic 50's western was truly one of the most entertaining movie-going experiences I've had this year. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe again do not disappoint. Both actors add a level of depth to characters that could've just as easily been archetypes for good and evil. And the movie itself could've easily been edited down to receive a PG or PG-13 rating, but I'm glad the filmmakers decided against that in order to show the grittiness of the Old West. The supporting actors also did a fantastic job, especially Ben Foster. Foster has been surprising me lately with how he disappears into a role. I didn't recognize him as The Stranger in ""30 Days of Night"", just the same as his role as Charlie Prince in this film. Some may argue that this doesn't live up to the original, but the strong performances all around and the grittiness lacking in the original should set this apart.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The best western ever.,What a wonderful film and a great western. The direction was magnificent as well as all of the acting. The screenplay contained so many twists and turns that I will have to see it again to make sure what I saw was correct. You must see this movie for yourself. If someone merely told you the story you would not believe them. Russell Crowe and Christian Bales went beyond their normal good acting to move into an even higher category. All of the supporting actors were right on task in each scene. The exterior scenes shot in New Mexico were spectacular and were on the same par as John Ford films of the past. I am sure that the Academy will recognize this film as one of the best of the year.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a film! Absolutely Brilliant.. and no one saw it!!!,"I used to dislike westerns something rotten, i couldn't take them seriously, that was until i watched the dollars trilogy, and saw what westerns were really about.. a recent time in history where money was truly king, and life was worth as much as it cost to live another day, and whether that was historically accurate or not, it didn't matter, it offered the opportunity to show men at their basest and most basic.3:10 to Yuma captures that essence, and it is the driving force behind the story, a story that is great pulp fiction at its best. It's hard to find fault with this film from a story-telling aspect, I'd find it hard for someone to get bored, or to not want to know what happens next, and to find themselves completely satisfied by the time the end credits roll.When you watch Yuma you wonder why it wasn't as well known, it has a great cast, with faultless performances, Crowe and Bale have an amazing chemistry, and the supporting cast is fantastic, Ben Foster is fast becoming the best guy on camera that you love to hate.. wow i never expected him to play the roles he has since first seeing him in 'Get Over It', but now he plain flat out rocks, i'll watch anything with him in it and it was a pleasant surprise to see him here. But why did no-one see this film?? THE NAME!!! the promotion campaign had some of the coolest posters going around, but who is going to watch a film with a bunch of numbers and an odd sounding abstract name in it? It sounded like a science fiction film, but was a western. Once you watch the film you'd find it hard to call it anything else, but this film is a pure example of the title defeating its success.I hope the name doesn't hurt it post theatrical success, because this is seriously a great film that anyone who enjoys good stories will like, right up to the immensely satisfying finale, this is one of the best films of 2007 by far.. if you're even half interested in watching this film , and are reading IMDb reviews to figure out whether it will be worth your time and money to watch it.. just stop reading now and go watch it!!! i'd be highly surprised if you were disappointed.. not many films make it into the IMDb Top 250 within a few months of being released, and the ones that do.. they're usually worth 2hrs of anyone's time.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Ben Foster was GENIUS! I was simply in awe of him in this film - so in character and soooooo believable. Everyone was just simply excellent. The only reason for the ""9"" of ""10"" is that Russell Crowe is supposed to me a mean guy and sometimes the writer does not allow him to be mean. Only that one small thing does detracts from 100% credibility to the plot and reminds you it's a movie and its Hollywood and its for entertainment so something can happen that is a bit magical or make-believe...something that might not have happened in real life.

310 To Yuma,"3:10 To Yuma is a remake of a film of the same name made in 1957 and based upon a short story by Elmore Leonard. The film is set in the old west and is about a rancher named Dan Evans who agrees to escort a captured outlaw named Ben Wade to the next town to be taken on a train to the Yuma jail. Dan is a good man with honest intentions and good principles and he is also short on money and wants to support his family, so he agrees to go along with a group of other people to take Ben to the train station. Along the way they encounter difficulty with members of Ben's gang trying to prevent them from getting to the train station and getting Ben there proves to be a more difficult task then they had planned. I haven't seen a lot of westerns before, I mean I have seen some, but not enough to make me an expert of the genre, but if they are done well I do like them and I did like this remake of 3:10 To Yuma. Keep in mind I have never seen the original, so I can't compare the two films, so I' am rating this film purely on my unbiased viewing of it. Technically the film was very well made with good direction, editing, costumes and the film looked exactly like the old west and the attention to details with the costumes and sets were well done. Also this film was different from a lot of other westerns I have seen in the way that I found there was a lot more depth and personality in these characters and there was more to this film than simply action scenes and shootouts, which was another thing I admired about it. Granted when there was an action scene or shootout they were done with good editing and stunt men and it ended up being very entertaining. Probably my favourite part of the film was getting to know both Dan and Ben and what makes Dan a good man and why he is so devoted to his family and being a good citizen and why Ben is an outlaw and why everything he does leads to violence or something evil. At one point in the film the characters do talk to each other regarding something similar to this and in a way you almost get the feeling that Ben admires Dan and has some respect for him and perhaps wishes he wasn't so late in life as to not have a chance to change his whole life around. So in between the action I found some good comparisons between characters and because the acting by the two main leads were so impressive it was pulled off very well. For being a more intelligent and different western which I admired and because of being well made technically and good performances I recommend the remake of 3:10 To Yuma to fans of westerns and even to people like myself who haven't seen many, but might want to give them a try and here is a good place to start.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
As the Crowe Flies,"I just saw the pre-screening of this movie and I could not wait to get out of the theater. I don't know where to start on how bad this film was. I can't imagine the other comments giving it such high stars unless they're as lamebrain as this movie was. I guess perhaps from a cinema field of work, this movie could be viewed as fine performances, but they certainly were wasted. I mused that even Crowe had a hard time packing away his paycheck with the delivery of some lame lines as well as receiving same. The storyline, as in the original, is sound, but what was done in this one, the industry should be ashamed. I lost count of how many people were killed and how many guns (endless supply of bullets) were around. In one scene, they're traversing through non-friendly Indian country to take a short cut, and maybe my brain drifted, but I didn't see any Indians ... just gunfire. At that point in the movie I was actually hoping to see the Indians and finish everyone off! I think what disturbed me the most about this movie was how evil Crowe's character was, but yet they added a twist to glamorize him and his horse instead of the hero. This movie was, also, very long. The killing scenes were even too much for my friend sitting next to me and both of us turned away ... which I would say here to turn away from this movie and keep your money in your wallet. Lionsgate, shame on you for this sicko, bad-taste movie and whip it out to the public as a Western. Ten thumbs down on this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Obviously one of the best westerns ever made,"Even the biggest critic could realize the potential this film has. The only thing you have to do is look at the cast. Christian Bale, Russel Crowe, Ben Foster, Alan Tudyk, Peter Fonda: a better cast could not be asked for. Although you can assume the film will be good based on the cast, you should expect 3:10 to Yuma to be a good movie which it is. 3:10 to Yuma is probably the best modern day western film.The cast delivers in this film. Christian Bale has a good performance as a good hearted rancher named Dan Evans. Russell Crowe delivers a terrific performance as Ben Waid, a dangerous and disturbed character. His character is an absolutely unstable and deceitful criminal. His character is just as dangerous psychotically as his character is physically aggressive. The best performance comes from Waid's right hand man, Ben Foster! Foster's character is just as dangerous a criminal as Crowe's character if not even more dangerous. Foster captures the anger and ferocity of his character in such a beautiful performance which makes his character dangerously scary. Peter Fonda who plays a bounty hunter and Logan Lerman who plays Bale's son, Will Evans, deliver two great performances as well. The casting of this movie was chosen perfectly and the performances were delivered just as well.The story of the film is perfect. It is a very gripping story and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I was expecting more from the film in terms of gunfights but the film delivered in showing a brutal, violent, and vulgar West. The film took not only an approach of showing how violent criminals were back in the Old West but also showing how vulgar they were and just how mentally unstable they were. I absolutely loved the film for that. One of the central themes surrounding this film is morals. You will see this theme continually evolve more and more throughout the film. The ending is more than what I expected!! I did not expect the movie to end the way it did and put it simply, ""The $hit hits the fan!""The music of the film is terrific. It fits the tone of the film perfectly and adds to the tension of the film. The film is shot beautifully with what seems like little reliance of special effects which makes the film fantastic.I know this film is a remake and I have never seen the original! But I can say this movie is absolutely fantastic. 3:10 to Yuma is a must see film whose brilliant acting is the pinnacle of the film. Westerns don't come around very often anymore and when they do, they come out in the form of 3:10 to Yuma; A True Masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
crowe and bale superb,"In this 2007 Lionsgate production, directed by James Mangold, Russell Crowe and Christian Bale showed forth excellent acting abilities in this tense ""High Noon""-type western. Russell Crowe plays the outlaw Ben Wade, a man so heartless that he does not care if even one of his own gang members is killed in front of him. Christian Bale plays the poor, mistreated farmer Dan Evans who must go after Wade and put him on the train the 3:10 to Yuma, since he needs the money so very much. Gretchen Mol is very appealing as she plays Dan Evans' wife. Ben Foster plays the mean, ugly cohort of Wade, and is was hard not to hate him. Although Dan Evans is a Christian man, he doesn't think twice about asking for the money that's coming to him, nor does he think twice about being brutal toward Wade. While, in the movie, it is a long distance to where Evans must put Wade on the train, the movie is not a bit boring, but is tense and exciting. Again, both Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are very convincing. The action is exciting all the way, and the color is beautiful in its own way. In these days when many westerns are hard to find and/or see, this one is excellent as westerns go. A well-done production.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Finally, I like a movie the ""professional"" reviewers liked!","Wow! So nice to go to a movie and be totally entertained! I guess Hollywood has to do remakes of older movies to have a shot at putting out a good one these days. I never saw the original version of this one, but this version is fantastic! (I gave it a nine because ten should be considered virtually unattainable, to me anyway) The acting is excellent by all. There is action, humor, and a hint of ""romance"" (a veiled sex scene, I guess some people consider that romance). I've only seen bits and pieces of Russell Crowe in other movies. He plays the part of the extremely evil villain, that somehow seems likable, excellently. There are even a few good messages this film presents, but I don't want to discuss them, because I would have to check the ""spoiler"" box. The ""R"" rating is pretty much just for a few profanities, and fairly graphic violence, but it is much tamer on the senses than the current crop of gross-out movies. I think children as young as 12 (at least boys) could handle this movie without creating haunting images in their minds that could last the rest of their lives (like I still have from some movies I saw when I was a young teen), since the violence is on par with many video games they have probably seen or played before. I would be surprised if anyone did not like this movie, unlike so many of the critics favorites, which I am tempted to walk out on most of the time.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Legendary Western,One of the best Westerns I have ever seen. A movie that has heart and a brilliant story about hero.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"This movie was so bad, I don't understand how some people like it.","Now, I heard quotes saying things like "" The best Western since UNFORGIVEN"" And, being a fan of unforgiven, I wanted to see this movie. Of course, After the movie's End, I realized that it was the ONLY Western since UNFORGIVEN. So, naturally, it had to be the best. You see, if they had made any other movie set in the west, even spongebob squarepants, then that would have been better than this PC piece of Crap. Now I remember watching John Wayne and Clint Eastwood movies, and being so happy when the badguy died/got sent to jail. So, I got very excited for the ending. So what i thought was going to be an action packed Wild Western Shoot out turned out to be a running scene set to unfitting music where the bad guy (Spoilers/PC part) turns good, willingly gets on the train, and kills all of his outfits members for killing his captor because he wanted his captor to be a ""Hero"". This Movie is a Failure and belongs in the Bottom 100.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
A remake I do like.,"Rather than simply ape the original (and thereby ruin this version), this one has a lot more action and since it's done now, a lot more violence. The story is still the same, a Rancher (Bale) promises to put the bad guy (Crowe) on a train to jail. Their interaction, as well as the son who doesn't respect dad Bale, is well done. Well worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
BETTER THAN THE USUAL GRAVE-ROBBING,"Hardly the economical and quietly tense classic the original is, but better than could be expected from the usual Hollywood grave robbery. More overtly violent (as was to be expected, although - I think - to good effect) and more obvious about its presentation of ethics and psychologies - i.e. It loses much of the iconic and poetic flavor of the original, which is due in part to the fact it is in color. Still, a more than adequate exploration of the same themes.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent western,"A real discovery! 3.10 is an amazing movie near to Eastwood's masterpieces of this genre but far away from Leone's philosophy. A movie of its own. In my eyes, an excellent photography, a screenplay with very few mistakes and an astonishing Russell Crowe are helping this movie to become a legend. It belongs to my top ten westerns near Leone's The good, the bad ... and For a few dollars more, John Ford's Rio Bravo and Liberty Valance, Tarantino's Django (except the blood), High Noon, Costner's Dance with wolves and Eastwood's Josey Wales and Unforgiven. Christian Bale is unfortunately playing a little too shy, not convincing at all as father even if his character is a key. But Mister Crowe let us forget this weakness. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Watch the original,"I have made the mistake of watching a lot of old westerns and hoping that the new ones can measure up to those standards. Unfortunately this one did not. If you like blood & guts and the Matrix type movies this version is for you. If you are looking for a saga, gritty, good vs evil watch the original.Westerns made today are cowboy dressed up versions of the Transformers with special effects, things blowing up and slow motion bullets going into the heads of their targets. The days of cinematography, real dust, camera angles, herds of cattle and cowboys who know how to ride, seem to be past, or faded into the sunset.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
The return of the decent western,"Russell Crowe is the leader of an outlaw gang. Christian Bale is an impoverished rancher who, desperate for money, is persuaded to escort Crowe to a prison train. On the way they encounter hostile Apache, vengeful railroad workers and, not least, the outlaw gang as they seek to rescue him. Crowe has a great presence, switching effortlessly between menacing and charming throughout the film.It was good to see Peter Fonda back on the screen, too, playing a bounty hunter.It's beautifully filmed, with a number of exciting set pieces.Still, one thing puzzled me - why did Crowe's character make some of the decisions he did towards the end of the movie? I won't go into spoiler territory, but some of his moves seemed confusing and illogical.Anyway...excellent as Crowe is, he is upstaged by psychotic gang member Ben Foster, one of the most frightening characters to appear in the movies since Trainspotting's Begbie.All told, this is a western that's well worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
