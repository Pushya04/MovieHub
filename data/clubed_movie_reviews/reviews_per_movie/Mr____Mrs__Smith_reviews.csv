"Energetic action flick, somewhat wonky near the end","Since going through most recent action movies is like chewing through cardboard, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is pleasantly energetic for an action flick. Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith is good fun, and does a decent job of satisfying the occasional need for summer-movies.The effectiveness of the film lies in the exploration of what happens to a failing marriage when the couple are at their wits end ... and ... for the first time, come to realize that the other is a professional assassin ... and ... subsequently push the ceiling on what is termed 'spousal abuse' ... and ... of course, get to play with guns.The success of the film, however, lies in how Jolie and Pitt actually bother to exercise some of their acting talent. They look like they are having fun, and genuinely enjoy the other (surprise! surprise!). The chemistry is good, and the actors are super sexy, which is always a plus for any film.The movie fails, naturally, when the ending summarily degenerates into what is expected of action-fare, the shootouts, gun battles, and kisses. Enjoyable, nonetheless, even on its final wonky legs.(Note: it is also a shame that in a film with so much shooting that no one gets to shoot Mr. Vince Vaughn. My, is that guy a terrible actor who can't resist hiding himself.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Hmmm,"I find it quite hard to..i don't know..analyse this movie.On one hand this could be a masterpiece, with the swirling clever cinematography and the obvious chemistry between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt (as they hitched up in real life during the filming). But, on the other hand, this is a stupid film, just an action flick, trying to be emotional and meaningful but turned out trying to be a blockbuster.I hope you see what i mean. I have rated this film 7, because of the reasons above, as the clever cinematography mixed with some good fun comedy and watchable action can't be that harmless can it. Can it? See for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
So Much Better Than The Previews Would Have You Believe,"John Smith and Jane Smith has the perfect marriage. Well, not quite so perfect. And they've been keeping secrets from each other. They work for rival firms that do outsourcing work for the CIA. (Sadly, this would be better if viewers didn't know this for the first twenty minutes of the film, but the previews already gave it away.)Based on the preview, I thought this would be a Pitt-Jolie lovefest. I have enjoyed many of Pitt's films but not so many of Jolie's. And together, it was like a showcase of perfection for the American masses. Do I need to be reminded I'll never be handsome or rich? (Some will say movies help us escape this, and maybe it does, but still...)My concerns were unfounded. This movie is well-acted, well-directed and well-written. The story is layered and brilliant, as well as quite funny. The direction fits well. The acting is superb, some of the best from Brad Pitt yet. And the explosions and gunfire and things breaking and high-tech gadgets? Very nice - someone put a lot into this film and/or has some natural talent I hope we see more of in Hollywood.I don't know if this film is PG-13 or R. I heard it was PG-13 because a sex scene was cut. Well, let me say: you should have kept the scene and kept the R. With all the excessive violence (really over the top) and the cussing, a little smut isn't going to make much difference. I mean, as an action film, I expect a solid R rating (look at Bruce Willis and ""Die Hard"" or ""Hostage"").No real complaints about this movie. I really want to say something bad, but I cannot. I was entertained the whole time and found the film very persuasively believable. I don't know who wrote or directed this (I guess I could check, but I didn't) but they just scored points in my book. Unless it was Michael Bay, but I'm pretty sure he had nothing to do with this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Good,"It may be unfair to say, but its easily admitted that the most interesting ploy this film can rely on was the media storm surrounding ""THE affair"" that led to ""THE Hollywood couple to be"" Brangelina. As a matter of fact, the film is actually rather good and the playful yet genuine chemistry berween Pitt and Jolie excuses the ludicrous plot and reliance on marketing gimmicks. The film really isn't a serious one, but it is a sexy one.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Nice Surprise!,"I saw an advance screening of this movie tonight, and I must say it far exceeded my expectations! Of course, due to the stars involved I knew there'd be sex appeal. And due to the advertising I knew there'd be plenty of stuff ""gettin' blowed up real good."" But what I wasn't expecting was the tongue in cheek jokes, dark humor, and respectable plot twist! Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will only fuel rumors of their relationship with their performances - their chemistry on screen is scintillating, to say the least. The allure of each actor as an individual is undeniable, but when they're together, whether getting busy or getting pummeled, the screen fairly sizzles. It's a popcorn, Hollywood movie, of course, and you'll have to get past the fact that the two leads are the only two among many professional killers who seem to be decent shots! But the action is kickin, the acting well above par, the leads luminous, the plot is lots of fun, and the laughs are plenty. Enjoy! I sure did...",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Pretty Good Summer Blockbuster,"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie play husband and wife ""John and Jane Smith"", a seemingly ordinary couple living in the suburbs, who each have a secret that they keep from each other: they're assassins for competing organizations. Their marriage is put to the test when they're assigned to kill each other, adding even more excitement to their romance.Mr. and Mrs. Smith isn't the best film of the summer but if you're looking for some mindless fun then this movie should fit the bill. It offers enough explosions and romance to engage the viewer and the film hardly ever gets boring. The script is the only thing that keeps the movie back from truly succeeding. It is riddled with holes and some large ones as well. Of course, they didn't even occur to me until the movie had finished. This shows that the film is quite engaging if it can take your mind off the problems with the story. The screenplay was written by Simon Kinberg and he was behind Elektra and XXX 2. So, it's no surprise the script is weak since he probably only focuses on the action sequences and not the actual plot and character development.The acting is pretty good and the actors make up for the weak script. Angelina Jolie offers a very good performances and she looks amazing on screen. Her co-star also gives a good and funny performance. Together, Pitt and Jolie have more than enough chemistry to carry the movie and the film works so well because of them. Vince Vaughn is the highlight of the supporting cast and his performance is pretty funny. His role may not be very big but every time he appears on screen, he manages to keep the audience laughing. Adam Brody gives a terrible performance and he isn't funny at all. Luckily, his role is small so he doesn't hurt the film too much.Doug Liman does a decent job behind the camera but I was expecting a little more since he also directed The Bourne Identity. He does a nice job with the action sequences and the film has a very nice style to it. However, the movie still felt a little ordinary and I don't think he really took full advantage of this interesting premise. If you do give the film a shot, keep in mind that this is a summer blockbuster and not an Oscar quality movie. It entertains the eyes and it won't make you think. In the end, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is worth checking out in theaters. Rating 7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Entertaining as Hell!,"This is a daaaamn fun movie! Heh. To all the critics, yes, there are a lot of explosions, gunfire, unrealistic battles, plenty of times where you think ""they MUST have been hit by a bullet by now..there is noo effin way..."", and over-dramatized violence, but there's plenty of good stuff too that should not be ignored.Probably the best part about this movie is the couple. I know it's been said before, but it's so true that I'm gonna repeat: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have incredible chemistry. It's no wonder they're still together today. Even when the movie couple, John and Jane Smith, where in their ""off period"" of marriage, you could feel something between the two. They are an amazing screen couple, they work incredibly well together. Their dialogue is just right...when one says something to the other, it's smooth and real. And of course, Pitt and Jolie are both extremely attractive, so they're fun to watch. Haha.The plot is all right..nothing extraordinary. It's a typical action movie plot, simple enough to leave plenty of room for the battle shots and violence. Nothing special. The dialogue wasn't bad, it wasn't lame action movie words. No stupid puns or anything. There was really nice cinematography, some shots that really were stunning. Usually the emotional aspect of action movies is dense and easy, cliché and boring, but I liked it in this movie. You could tell that they really loved each other, yet at the same time were committed to their jobs. You could feel the conflict.I own this movie and I'm glad I do. It's a good time. I recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The trick to this review -- it is a TIME CAPSULE not just a movie,"If you look at this film as merely another glitzy Hollywood spy thriller/spoof -- in the grand tradition of say OUR MAN FLINT or KINGSMAN -- then it is merely an ""8"". As in great writing, acting, direction, casting and generally a lot of fun.So far, so good.Here is the trick -- for viewers of the future, when we mere mortals have come and gone, but the IMDb lives on, this is better viewed as a time capsule.The two stars were, to under-state it -- at the peak of their fame and charisma. I recall from the time a survey which conclusively showed, for example, that Angelina was not merely the hottest woman in show business but possibly (these surveys tend to over-state) the hottest woman on the planet.(To be fair, they only surveyed living men. If the dead had also been allowed to vote, who knows, maybe Helen of Troy would have won?) And the Bradster was also at his peak.Once you understood the hidden and secret dynamic of the film, it becomes both iconic and classic, and will be entertaining viewers for a very very long time.(PS == watch Vince Vaughn before TRUE DETECTIVE, also of historical interest)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Smiths Have A Little Something For Everyone.,"Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a story of a husband and wife who are working as assassins, unbeknownst to each other, and not surprisingly, are in therapy to save their marriage. Ironically, they both believe their lives together are too boring.John Smith (Brad Pitt) meets Jane (Angelina Jolie) while both are in danger of being exposed in a foreign country, while working. They are both experienced assassins at the time and go with the flow, and eventually falling for each other. Neither tells the other what they actually do for a living.Needless to say, they find each other out and both agencies who they work for, give the order to kill the other within 48 hours. Thus, the hijinx ensue. Both are vying for control and to discover how much the other actually knows. Upon finding that they both know everything, a full on mini-war begins.This movie has a little bit of everything. The Smiths are not without their humorous sides, especially Brad Pitt. Also, there are a few good fight scenes, between The Smiths along with some others. There are a few nice weapons to be admired here, as well as some very nice eye candy (I am talking about Miss Jolie, but I hear the ladies are fond of Brad, also). Also, I would like to give an honorable mention to Vince Vaughn as Eddie. I feel his performance was funny, but too small for this movie.This movie is a fun little romp through the house with some nice action scenes. Recommended if you would like a somewhat toned down True Lies. 8/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Skip it. You'll be happier and smarter for doing so.,"A wife (Angelina Jolie) and husband (Brad Pitt), both with secret identities as hit-men, are given contracts to kill each other. This movie has some genuine laughs, but just does not work. It is incredibly implausible and silly. While this is not normally a problem (I thrive on silly movies) the movie ultimately fails when it tries to up the drama factor. How can this be taken seriously? Two people, one named Jane Doe, the other John Smith, marry each other spontaneously while not being the least bit suspicious of each other's backgrounds? Even if I wasn't a trained assassin, I would be suspicious. Stu-pid. And it takes them 5-6 years to figure this out? Stu-pider. The acting is fine. Brad plays Brad (and he's done it well over the years) Angelina plays herself. There are a few funny moments supplied mostly by Vince Vaughn, and when Brad and Angeline are trying to conceal their secret identities and later when they try to kill each other (spousal abuse is funny!), but eventually it reclines back into every unmemorable action movie you've ever seen. The bullets become ignorable because there's no way the stars'll die (Even the Terminator was more destructible). You know how the plot ends. Bor-ing. This gets a C",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Butt-kicking John and Jane.,"A bored married couple named John Smith (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) is shocked to learn that they are both assassins hired by competing agencies to eliminated each other. In the process, they learn more from each other as their affections for each other grow.This is a cleverly devised script in a plot filled with humor (albeit, a little corny at times) and believable acting (for the most part). I don't recall too much moments that bored me to tears, and was entertained by the drama, the chemistry between John and Jane, the suspense and tension between the two competing agencies, and the overall action.Grade B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A wasted opportunity,"No relation to the 1940's Alfred Hitchcock comedy of the same name, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is an actioner/comedy/thriller that manages to entertain in spite of some serious limitations.John Smith (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) are not your typical married couple. (Yeah, I know, we've heard stories like this before, but this film's hardly original). They both live a seemingly normal life together, in a nice house in a nice neighbourhood. Both are trained assassins, but they don't even know the truth about one another. That is, until they are dispatched to kill the same target.Shades of Alias, The Incredibles and True Lies consistently surface, from the deceptions to the violence to the thrills. What differentiates Mr. & Mrs. Smith from those other works is its sense of fun.Director Doug Liman showed with The Bourne Identity that he is adept with action, and films such as Go have shown his skill with plotting and character. Unfortunately the film's plot is all over the place, even when the film is at its most entertaining, and the character moments are rather ordinary.It is saved mostly due to the sparring between the two leads. When Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are on screen together, competing with one another either verbally or physically, this film really soars. (Jolie has more than just atoned for her performance in Alexander here; for the first time in a long while, I found her tolerable.) This, in addition to some inventive set design and cool gadgets, is what effectively constitutes half, it not more, of the film. At one point I was convinced that this would be my first truly unqualified recommendation of the summer.Alas, not long after John and Jane find each other out, the fun, laughs and excitement give way to a succession of eventually tedious chases and shoot-outs. After being very entertaining for long periods, the film begins to outstay its welcome very quickly. There are still some enjoyably quirky moments hidden in there, but I doubt that most viewers will still be as attentive by this point.I would have appreciated Mr. & Mrs. Smith more if it had maintained the tone that came before the generic action scenes throughout the entire film. Then again, that probably wouldn't have filled up the two hour running length, would it? Mr. & Mrs. Smith is entertaining enough, I suppose, but in my opinion it's a wasted opportunity. And that's not the first of those I've come across this season.Rating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Should have payed attention,"Movies, like books, can't be judged by the packaging. When it came out in '05, the reviews were above average, but didn't appear to ring everybody's chimes so I avoided seeing it.Buying the DVD seemed like a safe bet when it came out. It had lots of action and two marquee stars. But having been burned buying movies I hadn't seen - Sideways, Lost In Translation (O.K., not burned but a bit disappointed) - I passed. I'd wait till it dropped below $10.Time passed and now it's on T.V. I happened to be flipping channels when I stumbled on its opening scene at the marriage councilor. Right away I was hooked. It had the marriage milieu nailed in a few minutes, like Orson Welles in Citizen Kane: the awkward questions and answers, the poorly disguised discomfort, the seething resentment.It got even better with the banality of home life: the glaring silences, the perfunctory politeness, the stilted discourse, the hidden frustration, ennui, equivocation, avoidance, and interior decorating conflicts. Maybe you actually have to be married to appreciate how true the representation was.Then the plot twists that accentuated the facade. More twists. Don't let your guard down for an instant, or you may get killed! The subtle, pleading moments. Like when Jane hangs up on him in the car. Additional twists and action all the way into a grand finale with scads of bullets, bombs, etc.Is the true love of shared experience beyond the banality of everyday life realized? Well, you have to see the movie.Yes, the plot is complicated, and sometimes doesn't make sense, like marriage, but on closer inspection reveals hidden reservoirs of true feeling and connection.I guess I had overlooked a great film, just like John and Jane had overlooked each other.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Mr. & Mrs. Smith offers enough entertainment value to warrant a watch, but it ultimately lands as an average addition to the action genre","I recently revisited Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) on Tubi. The storyline follows a married couple whose life is getting stale, only to discover they're both rival assassins tasked with killing each other. As they grapple with this revelation, they must also confront the reality of their marriage and the need to eliminate each other.Directed by Doug Liman (Edge of Tomorrow), the film stars Brad Pitt (Fight Club), Angelina Jolie (The Changeling), Vince Vaughn (Wedding Crashers), Kerry Washington (Scandal), Keith David (Requiem for a Dream), and Adam Brody (Ready or Not).While Mr. & Mrs. Smith boasts a talented cast, including strong performances from Jolie, Pitt, Washington, and Vaughn, it falls short of greatness. The chemistry between Jolie and Pitt is undeniable, and the action scenes are thrilling and entertaining. However, the storyline lacks depth and the villain's portrayal leaves something to be desired in terms of menace.In conclusion, Mr. & Mrs. Smith offers enough entertainment value to warrant a watch, but it ultimately lands as an average addition to the action genre. I would rate it a 5.5-6/10 and recommend watching it once.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Sharp, Witty, Excellent!","From the opening scene with Pitt and Jolie and the unseen therapist, it was clear that this movie was going to be a cut above the usual fare. It did not disappoint. Sharp, witty, smart writing, excellent performances. I'm not a fan of either actor, especially Ms. Jolie, but I must admit they both impressed me in this one. Great support from Vince Vaughn as well. Effective soundtrack, too.The movie is like an extended metaphor for the trials and tribulations of modern marriage. Fortunately it does not lay its message on too thickly.Yes, it does have quite a few plot holes and is a bit long - but all in all I enjoyed it.PS - what happened to the ""steamy sex scene"" with Pitt and Jolie?

True lies was better!,"Apart from Brangelina's stunning looks this movie is mediocre.I watched it on Netflix and i was surprised by the poor audio quality. Very loud gun scenes which you had to turn down in order not to become deaf and very silent dialogs which you had to turn up in order to hear a word.And let's not pretend that (and ok ... I know its Hollywood you are talking about) it was mostly unrealistic. Many instances in which they should have gotten themselves killed.Also, were it not for Brad and Angelina we will be talking about a not so hyped movie.

Two hours of butt-numbing stupidity.,"I didn't really like the movie, because it took two hours to explain a whole lot of nothing. It seemed pointless to watch, because its a typical Hollywood spy-flick cliché. Two people fall in love, are found out, and ordered to kill each other. I think it was a horrible movie, and could have been better. And they could have had better actors for the main roles, too. It was rather lame, seeing as they focused mostly on keeping their careers secret. If it had a bit less guns, and more swordsmanship, it may have been a bit better. My friend and I sat in the theater for two hours, laughing only at the parts that everyone else laughed at. It was pretty stupid, especially after they stole some Batman moves.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
These two killers missed the target,"Eh. This movie was just okay. One could easily tell that it was made for mainly eye candy--to show two supposed ""pretty"" faces. Pitt, according to many is one of the hottest male actors (nothing special about him in my opinion); and Jolie, also according to many is one of the hottest female actors (she's more elegant than she is pretty). Now put these two together in an action flick and you have something that people want to see--no matter how unrealistic or dull it is. This had a pretty good plot and it could have been taken further, but as I said, the two main actors were more concentrated on. I did not feel them as assassins. I did not feel them as married. I did not get much from this movie. It was all right until the end of the middle, and then from there it got dull and I was hoping for it to end soon. I just did not care about what happened to these two. But I'll stop saying the negatives about this and go on to the positives. There were some funny parts like the battles that Mr. and Mrs. Smith have. I like how they are married without knowing who each other really is and that their marriage is falling apart particularly because of that. I would go on and say what else I liked, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone. It is also humorous when the couple is trying to kill each other. Other than that, I did not care for this movie. These two killers missed the target. But, nevertheless, this drew in a large audience and many of you will enjoy it especially if you like Pitt and/or Jolie. I suppose that's it =)5.9/10 Stars",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Meh...,"The only weak aspects of this film are the cheesy dialog and somewhat overkilled action sequences. Lines like, ""There's no place I'd rather be than right here with you,"" and, when Mrs. Smith finds out about a past romance involving Mr. Smith and another woman before the couple met:MRS. SMITH: What's her name and social security number? MR. SMITH: No,honey, you're not going to kill her.Eh, we've heard stuff like that before. Mind you, Pitt and Jolie are no rookies, they have the ability to take this dry dialog and give it somewhat of a sub-textual backbone. I will say, however, that the counseling sequences are done very well and utilize awkwardness in a wonderfully comedic style, I enjoyed that very much.As far as the action sequences go, one can pretty much predict the direction of the scenes. These predictable sequences, however, are preceded by one extremely definitive scene after Mr. and Mrs. Smith find out that they are each other's targets. This scene, my favorite from the film, could be defined as action although there is no action during this scene. Both characters know that their job is to kill one another, but they have a hard time with such an awkward situation, even for assassins like themselves.In a nutshell, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a decent flick, but it's just that, a flick, not a work of art or the action adventure of the year. If you get a chance, see it. If you don't get the chance, that's okay too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Knockout of a Picture,"Always enjoyed viewing Angelina Jolie, (Jane Smith) who is very beautiful and sexy and also Brad Pitt, (John Smith) and his great acting skills in many pictures. This picture surprised me with plenty of action between a husband and wife who are involved with undercover operations and are in one way or other are hit man and woman. There is also romance combined with plenty of explosions going off and plenty of fights going on between husband and wife.

What they offer...,"I have said that I've fallen asleep during action sequences in movies; and it happened in ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"". The noise, the energy, the adrenaline are all stuff that should easily keep me awake, or wake me up if I sleep. But it is impossible, even more when they're pointless, like in this movie. As an action film, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" sucks.Now you're wondering if it works as the other things it seems to be trying to achieve. The answer is that it could, but lacks the potential in few but important details. It is not a terrible movie, no, but it has its things. Whoever wants to accept those things, because of reasons I'll explain now, there they go; but I can't.""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is the typical summer film that arrives at the time of the year where the audience wants to have fun. The package of its type includes two hot and well known stars playing the lead roles, an attempt for chemistry and fun and stuff blowing up everywhere, generally (""Bad Boys II"").All those are nice elements, and even if they work well or not, the package comes with a mix of genres that confuse the ones who look for something more than amusement. It's not that I'm always looking something more than having fun, but when the fun comes from nowhere, I can't laugh. Simon Kinberg's script is a union of unfinished ideas put into paper, including confusing time fixation, incoherent scene connections and very (really) very little plot substance whatsoever. The rest of the team, very familiar to these types of film, makes its best to get the visuals correctly and not to screw up, which turns impossible because of the script and Doug Liman's direction that tends to mock his own style and film. The man has done interesting films; I don't know who dragged him into this.The thing is that it happens to me with these movies, where I am never satisfied. I couldn't explain what a movie needs to satisfy me right now, but it's never enough. I compare this film with ""Hollywood Homicide""; it could have been so much better. There you had Josh Hartnett and Harrison Ford having fun in a stupid story that lasted for two hours. Here, the theme is similar, although ironically opposite (you'll understand if you saw the latter one), and you have the ""hot as hell"" Angelina Jolie playing Mrs. Smith and the ""sex symbol"" Brad Pitt playing her husband. We also get well known directors in small roles, the authentic Vince Vaughn (Eddie), who's always nice to see, as Pitt's ally, and my man from ""The O.C""; Adam Brody (Benjamin Diaz). He is not given much to do, but for a start he shows his comedic talent in every one of his words. I don't want to say much more, but I find the boy a very promising actor; great things are ahead of him.The package, as what it tends to achieve, it's perfect. There's an excellent chemistry between the two leads, who besides being hot and well known, are good actors. The best scenes of the piece, where they show their comedic timing, are developed in a marriage consultancy office; you can tell they're both having fun. And the people, yes; they'll attend. There'll be money butWhere's the movie?",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
welcome relief!,"This film is a hoot, after the of so serious (but enjoyable) Star Wars and KoH, Mr and Mrs Smith rollicks on to the screen for two hours of unbelievable but fabulous fun. Yes, I've read some of the other comments, I'd have to question whether some of these people really have been to the ""preview screenings"" they claim, or just seen the trailer and have an axe to grind, chip on their shoulder, etc.... their comments are always so general I can't help but feel they are basing their comments purely on the trailer.I saw it in a full house with cinema owners, industry and press - even the film critics came out with huge smiles on their faces, everyone had a great time, the script is full of great one liners, finally an action film that all our wives will enjoy as much as we simple boys.Doug Liman, thankyou.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"You can fight off villains and pull international operations off your sleeve; until you handle the risks of married life, you ain't seen nothing yet!","In the end of the day, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is a classic Hollywood production: big guns, fast paced action sequences, lots of punch lines that'll thrill the audience, and two stunningly beautiful lead actors (who somehow remain beautiful, despite all the mass destruction going around them throughout the second half of the film). The pre-release buzz regarding the dynamic duo's on screen chemistry is absolutely true: as a pair, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are even more sparkling and charismatic then when they are apart (on screen wise, I mean; don't know what's happening off-screen). As a matter of fact, I could have sworn I actually saw them shining during several parts of the film. Add that to director Doug Liman's unique, if controversial, directing techniques (with many of the stylistic action scenes followed by melodramatic music and sharp camera movements) - and you've got yourself a certified crowd pleaser, and the best action film to come on screen... well, since Liman's ""The Bourne Identity"" three years ago.The plot, for those of you who haven't already read about it in almost every form of magazine or internet site, revolves around a seemingly normal married couple: John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith. The Smith's have been married for several years now, but apparently lost their initial passion to each other, replacing it with what seems to be chronicle marriage fatigue. What they don't know, is that underneath their upper-class and dull daily routine of troubled marriage, lies a secret waiting to explode: both of them are highly skilled deadly assassins, working for rival agencies. Of course, neither of them knows what the other's occupation really is, what only widens the gaps threatening to destroy their relationship. A mission gone wrong on both sides leads them to discover they are not working alone... and that their component, whom they now have to eliminate, has been sleeping beside them for the past five, maybe six, years!From here on out, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" turns into an intense, action-packed, cat and mouse chase, as the prince and princess of modern-day Hollywood turn their guns (hidden in extremely nonchalant hideouts inside their house) - at each other. The last half hour offers the viewer some of the most stunning examples of why I love Hollywood so much, as pure mayhem conquers the screen, with bigger than-life action fragments (the best i've seen since the original ""Matrix"" back in '99), catchy one-liners thrown to the air, waiting to be quoted by movie buffs who'll come in droves to watch this, and intriguing (yet somewhat predictable) plot twists lurking at each turn of the script. It's hard to go into details without spoiling the film for those who are intending to watch it, but I can easily say that I, for one, was very pleased with the final result. Liman directs this summer fare with heart and style, always a lethal combination. Although many will claim it is an emotionally drained vehicle, only good for it's large-scale destruction sequences, one can easily relate to the marriage crisis the heroes are handling, proving that (as Liman said in an interview I read) you can fight off villains and pull international operations off your sleeve; until you handle the risks of married life, you ain't seen nothing yet!Clocking in at nearly 120 minutes, there are some obvious ""dead moments"" throughout the film, especially after the excellent beginning and somewhere towards the middle (before all cinematic hell breaks loose). What saves these moments from crucially sabotaging the film's experience is the numerous cynical remarks the Mr. & Mrs. keep throwing at each other. At times, they are so cute, you just want to pause the film, cross the screen into the movie, and give them both a big hug. This is, by far, one of the best on screen pairings I have ever seen; where the relationship part of the film feels a lot like the 1979 classic ""War of the Roses"", and the action will even make the almighty Jerry Bruckheimer gaze at the screen with envious eyes. Another positive angle in the film is Vince Vaughn's character, Eddie, the comic relief of the film, who plays Pitt's long time business buddy and best friend, in a parodic appearance that sheds new light on Vaughn's portrayal of Norman Bates in the 1998 remake of ""Psycho"".All in all, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is made up of all the right ingredients to turn it into a classic action piece, one that could be watched over and over again throughout the years, and yet stay fresh and entertaining as it is today. True, this isn't the most intelligent or thought-provoking movie I have ever seen, but it sticks to what it's good that, and for that i'm happy.I gave it a strong 4 out of 5 stars, and a 9/10 IMDb rating.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
No heart and soul in film,"Movie is balancing between ""True lies"" comedy/action type and reemphasized marriage drama. Brad and Angelina are with no doubt great performers but it seems that in way this combination of genres any actor would be confused. Or to come down to ground level: How you can expect from a character who is killing people for living (lots of people and with no regrets) to be involved in real family drama? Or how can you believe them that they are real (so you can connect with a character in drama)? It's a pity that chemistry which is glowing and obvious between this fine actors was not being covered with a story and directing better. So either director should stick to ""try lies"" type and forget about drama or vise versa. At the end when you going out of cinema a bitter bit stops in your throat that this could be better. Someone should write a nice script for this Brad/Angelina duo and directed Academy Award performance which they could obviously give. Some English drama or love story but with real characters in which we could believe and not this summer hit killing everyone around kind of thing. To conclude kids will probably love the action, fans of Brad/Angelina would probably wait for DVD with more nude scenes and some of us will hope that they will match up again in a real movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Didn't really like it but Pitt and Jolie were great!,"Mr. and Mrs. Smith (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) are unhappily married to each other. They think the other has a quiet respectable job...but they are actually hired assassins for opposing companies. Then they each get a job...to kill the other one. Did I mention this is supposed to be a comedy?The premise is a good one and it's played (relatively) straight...but this doesn't work completely. As an action movies it does succeed--there are tons of gunfights, some really incredible stunts and multiple explosions--typical turn off your mind summer movie fun. But as a comedy it doesn't work at all. For starters the lines just aren't that funny. It's also hard to laugh in a movie where at least a hundred people are shot to death or knifed (but there's no blood so I guess that makes it OK). The casual violence in this is STRONG and there's a fight between Pitt and Jolie that I found way too violent to be amusing. There is one funny bit--when a prisoner is being questioned he's wearing a ""Fight Club"" T shirt.On the plus side Pitt and Jolie are just great. Who knew they could do comedy so well? The lines are lousy but they give them their all. Also they work VERY well together and there's a great chemistry between them. Also they're both very physically attractive. They make to movie bearable. Vince Vaughn and Adam Brody are in supporting roles but given nothing to do.So I'd love to see Pitt and Jolie together again--in a better movie. I give this a 7--mostly for them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Mr and Mrs Smith A Decent Action Film,"Mr and Mrs Smith is a decent action film from director Doug Liman the man behind films like The Bourne Identity, Jumper, and Go. The film is worth seeing because of the impressive performances by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as the title characters. The supporting cast are good in their roles including Adam Brody, Kerry Washington, Keith David, and Michelle Monaghan but they aren't given much to do and lack screen time. Vince Vaughn shows up for a small supporting role as Pitt's friend and fellow agent who does his usual thing playing a guy still living with his mother the only woman he trusts bringing some much needed comic relief to the movie. The action sequences are well executed with some going over the top but for the most part it's still an entertaining movie. The pacing may be a bit slow at times but overall Mr and Mrs Smith is a good enough action movie with solid performances by the lead actors that make it somewhat enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

emotional action movie?,"When you think of a movie like Mr. and Mrs. Smith, you probably imagine brainless bloodshed and empty plot; but thats not what you'll get in this film. In a subject that has been seemingly overdone, this movie explores more than emotionless assassins and the crazy situations they get themselves into. It gets more personal than that, and takes on another level. I saw a metaphor for marriage itself, with the couple's problems manifested in guns and bombs. This is by no means a realistic movie, but it seems to know that and doesn't take itself too seriously, which is also part of its charm. I laughed, cried, and suspensed my way through the twists and dialogue. The trailer doesn't do this movie justice, so if you are expecting predictable male violence, you'll be happily surprised. This could finally be the perfect date movie: fun action for the guys, deep heart for the gals, and romance for all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Taking the audience to the cliff of absurdity... and dropping them mercilessly,"This is a really fun, entertaining & enjoyable movie if you know what to expect. The overall plot puts us in the mood of a classic noir-type spy romance (think Bogie-Bacall), but it's done with a modern, glossy look and over-the-top theatrics that instantly make you wonder ""WTF am I watching?"" The 2 heroes can defy gravity, accept it. Guns never run out of bullets, or if they do, there's always a fully loaded gun conveniently lying on the ground. Accept it. Entire armies of commandos appear out of nowhere to tear up a city block and there's no sight of a police officer anywhere. Accept it. Our heroes can take a beating better than Mike Tyson on crack, and they only get a tiny droplet of blood on their foreheads. Accept it.If you can accept all that stuff, then you can sit back, relax & enjoy the show. The whole movie borders on the edge of campy, and I don't know about you, but I think that's how all action flicks should be because movie action IS campy! If you want a realistic spy thriller, watch ""The Day of the Jackal"" (1973) or ""The Spy Who Came In from the Cold"" (1965) which are both excellent films by the way. But if you want to be taken to a pseudo-fantasy world & entertained, then go for this.The pacing is fast & the action is practically nonstop. But what made me really enjoy this film are the toned-down scenes between Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie. Now there's a textbook illustration of a passive-aggressive relationship. Their dialogue is so painfully awkward & strained (and hilarious) that it provides a perfect counterbalance to the blazing car chases & rains of bullets. A few of their lines will go into my vault of funniest movie lines ever, such as ""How often do you have sex? - I don't understand the question"", ""Mom, we are on high alert here! I almost killed you right then!"", ""Broken eye socket"" and ""I said I saw your dad on Fantasy Island!"" (They probably don't make much sense out of context, but watch the movie and maybe you'll die laughing too.) Also worth noting is the hilarious show-stealing performance by Vince Vaughn as Eddie, the crazy spy friend who lives with his mom. Be sure to watch the deleted scenes on the DVD for more of him (I can't understand why they would cut it).This is a pure fun flick that's perfect for a date, with your family, or just by yourself after a long day. Other films with the same flair (quirky love-hate relationships) include the spy-rom-com ""Duplicity"" (2009), the fantasy-rom-com ""Camille"" (2008), and I'll throw in the classic Bogie/Hepburn film ""African Queen"" (1951) ...all of which are charming, refreshing & thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Souless Creatures,"Creepy and not in a nice way. Creepy because those faces - Pitt's and Jolie's I mean - are very familiar to us, to me. But, in ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" they look like repplicants without soul. It is the most depressing experience I've had in a theater in a long, long time. Remember how good Brad Pitt was in ""Thelma and Louise"" or ""12 Monkeys""? Now is some kind of thing, he's being thingified with his consent I'm sure. Angelina is working her way down as an actress and building her virtual state as a star in a world where Scott Petersen and/or Paris Hilton can become a star. How sad! As far as I'm concerned the movie has no redeeming features. I felt so cheated that I had to run and rent ""Prizzi's Honor"" as an antidote. It sort of worked but I wish I could erase the Smith's out of my mind.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
War of the Smiths,"I don't normally watch films with ""power"" couples in them, e.g. ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Gigli"", ""Daredevil"", and others. Really I think movies with star couples in them use that as their main selling point. Everybody is so interested in the iconic male and female stars that no one ever stops to evaluate the type of movie or the movie content.This movie wasn't bad though. There was some nice action; some nice edge of your seat moments. There was good dialogue and good humor at times. I think the eventual ""War of the Roses"" scenes are what piqued my interest the most. The movie wasn't complimented much by the supporting actors (most notably: Vince Vaughn). And I'm a bit tired of the clean, beautiful, intelligent super spies/assassins. I'll take ""The Professional"" type assassin any day of the week over the pristine and unflawed assassin. I think James Bonds image for spies and hit men has run its course.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Really dumb and silly but quite breezy fun if you are in the mood for it,"John and Jane have been married for five or six years and pretty much have the American ideal; they live in a big home in a nicely white and middle-class suburb, they both drive nice cars and both have very good careers. Sure they have problems in their marriage but outwardly they look great and they are getting counselling for the lack of spark anyway. The real problems probably come from the fact that, unbeknownst to one another, he is not really a building contractor and she is not really a computer expert, really they are both professional killers working for different companies. This is all well and good until they both get sent to do the same job and narrowly miss killing one another. Discovering the other's secret identity, they both assume that the other is only in the marriage to get information and mark the other so neither has a choice but to try and kill the other first.From the plot summary alone you've probably got the idea that this is not the film to come for if you are in a cerebral mood. The plot is rather silly to say the least, the action OTT and the whole thing is utterly unconvincing and unengaging. However it is all rather fun and entertaining in a big, dumb, noisy summer blockbuster sort of a way. On this level it is possible to just take it as it comes, ignore the lack of substance and be taken in by the slick style with which it is all carried off. It helps that all those involved know to deliver it with their tongues in their cheeks, so it never looks stupid, it knows it is silly but it also knows that it is entertaining and, in the summer market, that is all it is required to be doing. The result is that it all moves forward quickly and constantly with an air of slick confidence that produces funny lines and plenty of big noisy action.Of course it is not the film to bring your brain to, because if you think about it you have lost the point and will no enjoy it. I found myself thinking once or twice and forced myself to just get lost in the film as a product that than a story. I thought about how the characters were more about the celebrities than the writing, but this didn't matter because that was part if the appeal of the film. I thought about how the action lacked any tension or anything to really hook me in, but that was mainly because the film and characters had no substance below the slick exterior, so the action matched that approach. I also found some of the scenes of violence a bit hard to take - was I the only one who watched this married couple punching and shooting each other and thought how the real sufferers of domestic violence would not appreciate such a sensual and funny look at the subject? Like I said though, I nipped these thoughts in the bud because the film is not about the detail, it is about the glossy finish - the engine of this car might have been a couple of badgers on a treadmill, but the bodywork had definitely been ""pimped""!With such a glossy vehicle, it was important to have a couple of really sexy stars who have chemistry to carry off the silly nonsense. Fortunately the stars are textbook for that type of stuff. Pitt has been slickly moving through Ocean's 11/12 and Jolie is sexy/sassy personified. Individually they keep the quips coming, never take it seriously at any point and manage to make knife wounds, bruises and wounds sexy and cool. Together they both seem to get the joke and their slick deliveries go really well together; I could not care less about the whole ""are they/aren't they"" gossip column nonsense but they really did make this product work by turning up the ""slick"" quotient to 11. For me personally though I felt that Vaughn stole the show by doing his usual stuff - he is consistently funny and his rougher character made for a really nice contrast to the endlessly slick delivery in every other section.It is all nonsense of course and I had started to forget it the moment I left the cinema, but it does what it sets out to do pretty well; not to make you think, not to provide realism, not to be tense, not to engage your emotions but simply to provide a slick, funny film that lives entirely on the surface and never stops moving in case you notice this. This it all does well and, for all the problems with it, it is indeed sexy, smart, funny, noisy and enjoyable. Not great by any means but will certainly keep the target audience happy.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Mr. & Mrs. Smith explodes with flaming chemistry but assassinated its own script.,"""Brangelina"". Without Liman's standard action comedy, we wouldn't have had the power couple that dominated the tabloids. Several children wouldn't have been adopted and brought up in a completely different, yet financially stable, environment. Jolie wouldn't have been the charitable humanitarian she is now. And Shiloh's first baby photograph wouldn't have amassed over ten million dollars worldwide. Wow! Suffice to say, the two most beautiful humans in Hollywood have a substantial amount of gratitude to show Liman for his efforts in pairing them. If only his energetic vibrancy was enough to power the lacklustre screenplay, the balance of action and comedy could've been a landmark within the sub-genre. A bored upper middle class married couple are astonished to learn that they work for differing assassination organisations, soon to be assigned to kill each other.It's your standard marriage. Winning a teddy bear at a carnival, falling in love whilst buying the most expensive mansion on the street, succumbing to the same mundane daily routine, destroying the house with an almighty shootout followed by a gas explosion, participating in the feistiest erotic love-making scene ever and naturally ending in marriage counselling. A cruel irony for ""Brangelina"", maybe they should've watched the film they made together? Cynicism aside, what truly elevates the memorability of this feature is the onscreen (and offscreen, bow chicka wow wow...) chemistry of its leading stars. Jolie and Pitt are exceptionally effortless with their comedic timing, dramatic endeavours and high-octane action. The lightning-fast wit that they inject into Kinberg's less than impressive script is nothing short of, well, impressive. They make the film. They are the film. And they certainly have solid taste in curtains.Liman maintains a light tone throughout, never dabbling into the cracks of the marriage which is vital for retaining a fun buoyancy. This isn't an analysis on marital breakdown. It's just a tongue in cheek slice of entertainment.Having said that, despite the tantalising chemistry of its leads, you never quite feel that they are truly in love. Unfortunately, Kinberg's script is so vacuous in emotional conviction, that both Smiths resemble roommates than a married couple. Understandably the marriage is stale as they conform to their upper middle class lifestyle, but even when they fight and makeup, there's no real connection. I yearn to see Jolie and Pitt lust over each other. The momentum essentially grinds to a halt after their house explodes, with Kinberg's script focussing on a central plot point involving ""The Tank"" and an onslaught of heavily armed operatives raiding a department store. Attention for the splendid couple instantly dissipated with a third act that seemingly refused to end, ultimately losing the acute fun that preceded the underwhelming conclusion. The whole ""keeping up appearances"" act was tossed out of the smashed window, and that was the sole element that made the film incredibly fun.Mr. & Mrs. Smith doesn't conclude with a divorce, as it is sensible light entertainment for the vast majority of its runtime, yet the concluding act and poor screenplay prevent the marriage from flourishing fully.

"Mr and Mrs Pitt, I mean Smith","Watched Mr & Mrs Smith/Pitt at the weekend. It was very entertaining. Brad & Angie are very easy on the eye, there was obviously no expense spared on production, and sufficient snappy one liners to keep the laughs coming. All of the iconic references (Brad/Steve McQueen/Paul Newman/Robert Redford all wrapped up in one actor) are easy to see, but that's part of the fun. Angelina, you're a great gal, but your acting skills - well, to quote the film ""Who's Your Daddy Now""..... Jon Voight, honey, and he could teach you a lot, Angie. The Soundtrack was excellent - and the climatic fist fight between the two protagonist was wonderfully choreographed. But, I have to admit it, that knowing that these two Beautiful People were falling madly in lust and love with each other during the making of the film made it a very interesting viewing experiences......were they acting or not in that sexy dance scene? Was he thrilled that the film allowed such physical interaction between him and Ms. Jolie? Was she anxious that she'd betray she desired him when they were ""acting""?

"Forget all the gossip and tabloids, check your brain at the door, and enjoy...","In addition to being the film which turned out to be the genesis for the greatest media circus since OJ, MR. & MRS. SMITH is one of the most richly entertaining, though highly improbable, action adventure yarns to come down the pike in quite a while and was responsible for creating a media firestorm which has come to be known as ""Brangelina."" Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as John and Jane Smith, married assassins who have somehow been able to keep their occupations from each other for five (or six) years of marriage because they work for different organizations. Things heat up when they are both assigned to the same case in an effort by their respective agencies to take each other out and that's where the fun begins. If you don't think about it at all and just let the story flow over you, fun can be had here. The film boasts energetic direction, a surprisingly deft screenplay, a superb musical score, enough technical gadgetry to make James Bond proud and yes, the on screen chemistry between the leads is positively kinetic...it just about burns a hole in the screen.

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in a movie together.,"All I wanted from this film was an action-packed parody on married life - but alas, it didn't deliver. Simply put, the film is too cool - and every action therefore comes off as being very unrealistic, and this is more a parody of fluffy romantic comedies than married life. Despite his impressive role in Troy, I've been rather unimpressed with Brad Pitt lately. He seems far too keen to wallow in his celebrity, and his role here; along with the one in the terrible Oceans Twelve last year, shows that all too clearly. His co-star, Angelina Jolie is another who is more bothered about her star status than putting in a good performance. Both Pitt and Jolie are clearly in this film for the money, and the fact that it will be liked by all the casual cinema-goers; and it's rather annoying really, especially as the idea that either of these two could kill someone  let alone be professional assassins, is ridiculous. The camera caresses them both - and all we get therefore is Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in a movie together, not a movie with characters being played by Pitt and Jolie. The excuse for Pitt and Jolie being in a movie together is that a married man, who is secretly an assassin, finds out that his wife is one too. Oh dear.The star power of the leads is what attracts most people to this movie, but for me it was always the action. To be honest, if the film could have gotten this right, I would have been willing to forgive most other mistakes. The action isn't all that great really, but the way it's fused with the idea that the two people who are trying to kill each other, don't really want to kill each other - is actually well done, and you can believe it in spite of the characters being non-existent. The film also does a good job of setting itself plainly in suburbia, and the way that the neighbours poke their nose into the central couple's business; while the two of them pretend to be just the norm in suburbia provides the film with most of it's laughs. Vince Vaughn appears too, but is lost under the central duo's ""star power"", and is never given a chance to shine because of this. Overall, I would say that this film is good enough to provide entertainment - but it's not all that good. All of it's good points come in spite of the leads, not because of them; and I for one think that this plot line is capable of springing a much better film than this one. Perhaps next time (i.e. in thirty years time when this film will be ripe for a remake) they could cast a couple of actors that are right for the parts, rather than being right for the box office.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Saw advanced screening,"This was the movie I was waiting for since we had snow on the ground and I am pleased to say, I was NOT disappointed. It was extremely entertaining from start to finish. It opens this Friday and I will be standing in line with my friends waiting to see it again. The trailers mislead you a bit. You are certain that the movie will be a hot sex romp filled with explosions and bullets flying everywhere. What it doesn't tell you is that this movie is a huge comedy. Anyone who has been in a long term relationship will find themselves laughing the whole time at the sharp tongue-in-cheek stabs they inflict on each other. Brad has never been more likable in a movie. I've never thought of him as a comedic actor before, but comedy is his calling. Angelina... my God that women is incredibly gorgeous. After watching her for over an hour and a half, women will go out to their cars, look in the rear view mirror, and sigh because no reflection could compared to hers. Their chemistry together is so electric that you don't want them to be apart. Besides Catherine Zeta Jones, I can't imagine any other actress playing her part. She is strong and takes the lead quickly. Bottom line is when the movie was over there was major clapping in the audience. It is a must see. The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is the lack of naked sex. Dropping this movie down to a PG-13 was cruel. Let's hope the DVD will be the unrated version.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Thoroughly enjoyable, if conventional popcorn flick...","This is a hard movie to not enjoy. Yes, a true afternoon popcorn pleaser, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" takes off in flight early and never fails to keep your attention.The plot is solid, enjoyable, and not too twisty. It keeps you interested all the way through. There aren't many moments to sit on your laurels and rest a bit--the director keeps the gas on the floor throughout.Is the Brad-and-Angelina chemistry Hepburn-and-Tracy chemistry? Well, perhaps not, but really awfully close. Brad and Angelina bounce off each other kinetically and beautifully. I used to despise Brad's vague surfer-esquire Keanu-like delivery, but I'm starting to really like him as an actor, albeit his ""range"" will never win him an Oscar (unlike Tracy).Angelina melts the camera lens every time. Not much more to say other than she's simply spectacular. As long as her cheekbones, skin, and lips hold up--another 10-15 years you think?--she's got a long career ahead of her if she chooses it. Hard to believe she was the techie vixen in ""Hackers."" This is a movie that centers ENTIRELY on Brad and Angelina, with the exception of Vince Vaughn playing his usual hungover ADD rapid-fire stereotype that remains virtually changed since ""Swingers"" came out 10 years ago. Like Ben Stiller, his delivery and style never changes from one movie to the next, but that's why I like him (unlike Stiller, who comes across flat across all his movies).The action sequences also double effectively as interludes for a kind of romantic comedy. There's some genuinely hilarious one-liners throughout. I give the director (and editor, most likely) credit for integrating these neatly into the film.Many of the action sequences, especially the final one, are completely unbelievable. I found myself laughing when they are SURROUNDED by 15 special ops guys with Uzis who can't seem to hit the broad side of a barn. But that's Hollywood for you, isn't it?This would have been a lot more fun to watch in a theater, but, alas, unless I get a 60"" HDTV deposited on my door step today, I'll have to enjoy it in all its squished analog 480p glory.In short: Completely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

This film is a wild ride of thrilling espionage, explosive action, and the undeniable chemistry between two A-list stars.Meet John Smith, played by the suave and charming Brad Pitt, and Jane Smith, portrayed by the stunning and talented Angelina Jolie. On the surface, they're a seemingly ordinary suburban couple living a mundane life. But here's the kicker - they're both highly skilled and lethal assassins working for competing agencies!When they discover each other's secret identities, all hell breaks loose, leading to an epic showdown of bullets, bombs, and, of course, heart-pounding romance. The film brilliantly balances the high-octane action with witty banter and comedic moments, making it an exhilarating and entertaining experience.Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's magnetic chemistry is off the charts, and it's no wonder that sparks fly whenever they share the screen. Their cat-and-mouse game adds a delicious layer of tension and flirtation to the story, and you can't help but root for this badass power couple.""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" is packed with thrilling action sequences, from intense shootouts to acrobatic fight scenes. It's like a spy movie on steroids, and the stylish direction by Doug Liman keeps you on the edge of your seat.Amidst the adrenaline-pumping action, the film also explores the complexities of marriage and relationships. John and Jane's marriage gets a wake-up call, and they have to navigate their feelings while dealing with bullets and betrayals.The film's supporting cast, including Vince Vaughn as John's best friend and Kerry Washington as Jane's friend, add a touch of humor and charm to the mix. Their interactions with the main characters provide some much-needed comedic relief amidst all the chaos.Now, some critics might argue that the film's plot is a bit thin and relies heavily on the star power of Pitt and Jolie, and yeah, it's true that their chemistry does carry the film. But hey, when you've got two charismatic leads like that, who needs a super intricate plot?So, if you're up for a thrilling and fun-filled action-comedy with A-list star power and undeniable chemistry, ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" is a must-watch.

Mr. and Mrs. ALIAS,"I heard so much about this film prior to its release and after I saw it I think its probably one of the dumbest movies I have seen this year. This is pretty much like the show ""Alias"" but doesn't even have supporting cast to rescue it from the disaster that it really is. From the very opening scene where Pitt and Jolie are getting marriage counselling I felt they are just going through the lines like they are reading of some cards; you felt it was like fake acting and their whole interaction just got to be worse through out the whole movie; they just had no depth that would translate to some kind of chemistry. Most audiences are sold on the idea that just because these two stars have huge sex appeal,hence, that equals to screen chemistry and I am sorry to say that Ms. Jolie doesn't have any kind appeal even in a dumb movie like this.Pitt on the other hand is an actor who's game is raised by what others bring to the table; when he feels he is challenged his acting becomes better; even in a film like Ocean's 12 where he is having an affair with a cop ""Catherine Zeta-Jones"" and those few scenes had much more chemistry than all the scenes in this movie; and that was a pure pop-corn movie yet it had many great moments. Again in an older film like Seven there was a great chemistry between Pitt and ""Gwyneth Paltrow"" given that they were dating but they didn't even have to talk to each other on the screen; the same in ""Spy Game"" with ""Catherine McCormack"" the chemistry was in their interaction and by far richer than Ms. Jolie whom we are sold on this idea that she is this hot sexy thing that sizzles on the screen.I read some of the other reviews here and I feel I watched a whole other movie?. First the story of two people who meet in a hotel in south America both standing behind the door scared and not either suspecting the other as to why? then jump cut to married several years later and you have not even shown a series of shots of how those few years were like, their missions, or any clue as to one even suspecting another. You just are given these superficial scenes with Joile trying to do her best to convince you that she can act. I hate to compare but if you watch ""Alias"" you can see ""Jennifer Garner"" along with the whole cast really do their best in that one hour to bring depth no matter how bizarre the plot is; its her interactions with the rest of the cast that makes her believable, she can be tough and Daddy's little girl at the same time, she makes the character human and her face can take up the whole screen and you can read a lot in her expressions and I think she would have done a much better job in this film than Ms. Jolie.This is the same director who did ""Bourne Identity"" which was a terrific film; the whole chemistry between Jason and Marie was developed so beautifully slowly but it was believable; I felt with all the action the interaction between them stood out and that's what made it ""Bourne a great action film. In Mr. and Mrs. Smith you don't even care to like the characters; this movie had potential to become much better film; there was so many scenes that could have been slowed down and more about the problems of two people in a marriage and yes at the same time being funny and a action film but its became one big joke and even when you see Joile shed a tear in a restaurant thinking she killed Pitt its quickly ruined by Pitt's surprise arrival and their brutal tango throwing knives across tables and not even one person noticing it?Lets face it this was just an idea of putting two box office stars together to make an action film with any script; because there is no story here that you care to even understand, it has no direction even as a comedy; I find the TV show ""Alias"" more enjoyable and even more interesting than this stupid movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great Fun,"Romantic action movies are among my favorite type to watch and rewatch. Do a Google search and see what comes up. This Means War and Knight and Day. Both fantastic movies if anyone would ever give them a chance. This movie is just as good, if not slightly better.Two double agents fall in love, get married, and then turn on each other. And then you've got Hollywood's power couple as the lead roles. Doesn't get much better than that.Highly recommended.7 stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"Can you imagine having a job that has to be kept a secret from your significant other? Well that is what the movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith is all about! Everyday they go to work. Both of them keep their jobs confidential until they are on the same case in order for them to go after one another. What happens when they find out they are in a marriage full of lies? Will they stay together or will one of them die?The characters and setting of this movie are very important. There are two main characters that the movie refers to, John and Jane, who are really Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolene. Eddie is also another character that is seen frequently and he is really known as Vince Vaughn. John and Jane say they have been married for six years in their counseling session. The main settings of this movie include: The Smith's home, Jane's work in New York, and John's work office. There are many more scenes that this movie takes place at like the desert, the car they drove together when they are being chased and many more. Now what exactly happens in the movie?The movie dates back to six years ago when Jane meets John at a hotel for the first time. They spend that night together and during the day they go to a fair. At one of her counseling sessions, Jane tells the counselor that some things are not spoken of and that they have secrets. They both go off to work events the same night and return but neither says much about their work events. At work the next day, John hears about his next job. Jane appears at her work, where she too is assigned her next job. Little do they know they both were purposely assigned to the same case. She is waiting for the suspect in a desert area. Jane then sees a civilian and shoots, which really is John, so then he shoots off a big missile and she leaves. John then tells Eddie that he got his ""ass handed by some girl"". John then goes to her work and sees Jane's name on a tag. At the same time she is watching the video and realizes the civilian is her husband.During dinner that night they are catching onto one another. Once they drop a bottle of wine, they both disappear. Jane leaves the house and John grabs a gun. He runs after her in the car and shoots at the car and they continue to fight down the street. The next day John ends up showing up at her work and tells her she needs to disappear, but she says no. In the next scene he is at Eddie's again where he says, "" You mean you had a shot at her and you didn't take it"". When John shows up at her work again Jane blows up the elevator. She then goes to look to see if he is really dead. That night John shows up to dinner to find Jane by herself. When she goes to the bathroom, something explodes and she disappears as everyone else is exiting the building.They both are racing home while talking on the phone to each other. Jane and John race around the outside and inside of the house. When they both are inside they are again running through the house firing at each other. Then Jane and John start physically fighting one another. This is when they aim guns at each other and John says he can't shoot her. After he says that they make out. While this is happening, Eddie then sees a note on his phone that both John and Jane Smith are wanted for 400,000 dollars each. They are wanted because they live together and are both undercover agents. Back at their house, a mailman then gets out of the vehicle with a gun and throws a bomb in the house. Another bomb is thrown into the garage and they make an escape to one of their cars. This scene is when they start to make many confessions to one another. The truth finally comes out when they realize their lives are in jeopardy. Watch Mr. & Mrs. Smith to find out the ending!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
a good intent,"I wouldn't say this is a fantastic movie but the drama that came from this movie, as with most, was as unpredictable as it could be. I never thought that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie would ever consider dating, but i was way way wrong. Angelina Jolie, who definitely has my attention on the big screen, could have done much better then Brad Pitt. I see a movie like this with a bad-ass husband who coincidently marries a bad-ass just like himself, and i think how different. Although as much as this may sound like i am bashing the movie, my intent is good because, as the movie unfolds and the action is amazing this movie turns out to be quite good. The only reason i wouldn't rate this a 9 or 10 is because I think that the movie wasn't really a movie i would want to see again although it will be a movie i am glad i didn't miss.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Imagine if your spouse was a killer!,"Movie industry loves creative ideas, or at least it used to. And on some point, the director Doug Liman wanted to make a movie about a perfect couple who are both secretly killers. But, what can be better than an interesting and weird idea. An all star casting! Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were at their prime. Even if at some point other actors were planned like Gwen Stefani, Liman still picked Pitt and Jolie. What's weird is that afterwards they started to date, had kids and even got divorced after this film. So it's an important milestone in both of their lives. But is this film memorable for the general audience? I'm here to say, that yes, no matter if you are a critic or just an average viewer like me, you'll find at least one great moment in it.It all starts with Mister (Brad Pitt) and Mrs Smith (Angelina Jolie) meeting in an aeroport, even if they were strangers at first, but they lied that they were together, and afterwards, they loved each other and got engaged. But both had a skeleton in a closet, not literally though, but you get the idea. Both John and Jane are actually killers for hire, and they keep this a secret from each other. But on one day, they got the strangest mission, where John had to kill Jane for a huge amount of money and vice versa. The plot sounds weird, luckily, it does more than enough material to make the experience worth it. Mainly to all the fighting and explosion scenes, and all the weapons being used. I liked the scene where Jane tried to explode an elevator where John was in. And I also liked another scene with the car chase. Honestly I'm a huge fan of such scenes, because they feel fast and fun. Similar to the ones in Madagascar 3, Cruella and even a similar movie Killers. And it's all done on the spot. However, at the same time, John and Jane seem to be the perfect couple, that neighbours look up to.The acting is top notch. It feels like Pitt and Jolie really got invested in this crazy and wacked up idea. The characters feel fleshed out (no pun intended). At first they seem like a happy couple, with Jane being a surprisingly good cook, and John being the loving husband. I also liked the twist in the ending, where the couple had to team up for a very surprising, even somewhat shocking reason. I won't mention it due to spoilers, but trust me, it's unpredictable.Overall, this one is probably a must watch for fans of the main 2 actors or just want to watch some fun action flick. It's a pretty fun movie, not for everyone, cause some will be turned off by it's weird concept and sometimes confusing moments, however, it's definitely a creative flick. I liked it, not my most favorite movie of all time, it was still worth it, and definitely memorable for it's audience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
What a boring bummer,"I'm nearly 20 years late to seeing the well-known ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" film and... Yikes.I think part of my dislike for the movie comes from my expectations, which maybe isn't fair but I'm finding it hard to separate out my feelings. I thought this was a more serious movie. I knew it was a comedy but I didn't realize it was so hokey and cheesy and fake. I thought there was more legitimacy to their livelihoods as spies, not that everything was gimmicky and half-baked. That was a real letdown.The acting by both Brad and Angelina also leaves much to be desired in this one. The whole movie is just smoldering and showcasing how attractive they are. It gets older about 60-75 minutes into a 126 minute movie that's for sure.Some entertaining scenes and sequences but overall quite the dull dud.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"When two bored, married assassins find they are each other's target, the fireworks really start","I wasn't expecting too much from this film due to the hype, but was very pleasantly surprised. Sure, the leads are impossibly good looking and the story line is completely ridiculous, but we always knew it wasn't a documentary. It really is a wild ride, very glamorous and violent, with witty lines and gorgeous wardrobes. Angelina Jolie does a great job of being very cool, with a warmth and unexpected vulnerability bubbling just below the surface. Brad tends to be guilty of wooden acting in some films, but not this time. He also plays his part with warmth and an endearing eccentricity that he can do so well. These two certainly compliment each other, and there is no denying that the on-screen chemistry is just about the best I've seen in a very long time. The support acting is good, especially Vince Vaughn, but the show belongs to Angelina and Brad, and rightly so. Great fun, great lines, great cheekbones.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Frothy Action Comedy for Brangelina Fans,"Most two-career marriages have their share of problems, but John and Jane Smith have a unique set. Seated before an unseen marriage counselor at the film's opening, John and Jane appear relatively normal, although for two young attractive people, their sex life is non-existent, and they seem somewhat cool and distant. Can this marriage be saved? At their lavish home, Jane fusses about the new green drapes, John hates the color green; despite his aversion, Jane serves him green beans and peas. An evening out at a party emphasizes that the misfit couple is equally ill at ease among their neighbors; despite lengthy protests, Jane takes a baby onto her lap, and each looks at the other like an alien close encounter.The Smith's underlying problems surface when a seemingly inebriated John breaks into a poker game, and, separately, a leather-clad Jane strides into a hotel room and whips a kneeling handcuffed masochist. Unbeknownst to each other, the two married professionals are both highly successful dispatchers of unwanted people; a hit man and a hit woman. Famous as the film that spawned wall-to-wall Brangelina tabloid reporting, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, as though anyone within range of the Internet or cable news is not already well aware.The film starts off well and, for at least the first half hour, is breezy amusing entertainment. Pitt especially seems to be enjoying himself; perhaps Angelina had already bewitched him. Unfortunately, the plot thickens and becomes confusing, violent action overwhelms the personal chemistry, and gimmicky gadgets stretch credibility. The film goes on far too long, and the joke eventually wears thin. However, Doug Liman's direction keeps the pace brisk, and the two leads play well together, although nothing on screen is remotely believable, and the story is already familiar from other movies. For most viewers, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" will provide frothy fun that will evaporate like soap suds before the credits roll. However, for die-hard Brangelina fans, this, their first co-starring epic, the movie that started it all, is a must-see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

They're bulletproof...,"""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is actually a rather enjoyable film, and I can say that with all honesty despite not being overly much a fan of neither Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie. It is a combination of the storyline, the action and the acting that makes ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" work out so nicely.The storyline is about married couple John (played by Brad Pitt) and Jane (played by Angelina Jolie) who has been married for 5-6 years. They lead fairly mundane lives together, but individually they are both top trained agents. Things become very complicated for the couple as their respective agencies set them up to kill one another.""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is very fast paced, and the story does get up into high gear right from the very beginning, and it actually never slows down. And on that account, then you are in for a very enjoyable thrill ride.The characters in the movie are actually quite nicely detailed and fleshed out on the screen. And they are characters that you instantly take a liking to and that you feel connected to somehow. But a lot of credit does, of course, go to the actors and actresses in the movie, as they really put their heart and spirit into the movie.What really impressed me in this movie was the action sequences and the amount of action throughout the course of the movie.

War of the Roses in Steroids,"A pretty entertaining film featuring two mega-wat stars in what could have been a major disaster. John and Jane Smith (Anjelina Jolie and Brad Pitt) play an unhappily married couple that lead separate and very secret lives as paid assassins working for different agencies. When they inadvertently get assigned the same target, they must off each other because they need to eliminate the competition. I guess it's bad for husband and wife to be competing assassins. I don't know, for about 45 minutes they spend a lot of time shooting up the house and throwing knives at one another. That stuff is actually a lot of fun.This is a pretty witty film as well as a pretty violent one minus a lot of gore and bloodshed.

"The worthy companion and enjoyable summer blockbuster to ""Batman Begins"" vs. ""War of the Worlds"" or ""Bewitched""","With the tremendous success of ""The Bourne Identity"" 2002 and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" 2004, director/producer Doug Liman is established as a filmmaker who truly understands what makes an action/suspense movie work. This summer's ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" with the pairing of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie once again firms up Liman's credibility and peerless delivery of a blockbuster supreme.""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is sheer fun and chemistry. Definitely Hollywood packaged, valued entertainment product. If you want star power - sure got it with Pitt and Jolie. If you want fun and action (over the top explosive effects) - 'tis solidly included even with dashes of romantic notions for the taking. Yes, the beginning scene (in front of therapist/counselor) seems to be a departure/side-stepping scene, reminded me of ""When Harry Met Sally"" - the talk/exchange about marriage has its subtle stabs at humor. It's a slick, stylish, hi-tech bullet-flying movie, literally about a couple of assassins. Thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining. (Of course you're not supposed to take any of the plot seriously. Sheer amusement.)The title is reminiscent of Hitchcock's only comedy, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" 1941, with screwball comedy queen, Carole Lombard opposite Robert Montgomery. In a way, I felt Liman has injected some of the principles of screwball comedy into his ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"" and he knows where to draw the line and keeps the action sequences exciting and effectively congruent with the 'quieter' segments - not letting go of the suspense thread loosely.For this movie experience, I felt the music by John Powell played an important part in complementing the action sequences and repartees between the two leads. Kudos to Liman's direction and vision, tight and enjoyable plots kept well in rein. Of course, Pitt and Jolie delivered charming performances to no end, even 'simply' doing action stunts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Mindlessness,"How can anyone enjoy such a cliché-ridden mass of unconvincing drivel that was Mr and Mrs Smith? I should have known by the implausible premise of the movie that everyone knew about before seeing this rubbish. The initial scene rang alarm bells loud and clear. The lack of chemistry between these so-called stars was evident when they were at the marriage guidance in the first scene. The characters had not been established in the viewer's mind so it just looked like Pitt and Jollie familiar from gossip magazine covers. It did not look like two characters in a story. Right from the start it was Brad and Angeline. (Hey guys you are supposed to be taking the part of the characters, not acting as yourselves.)They looked uncomfortable and unconvincing. I knew within 30 seconds that it was trashy tabloid stuff. The attempts at humour were laughable rather than funny. I was laughing at the movie right away and not with the movie. Seeing Brad urinate was absolutely unfunny and gross. Who wants to see the splashes on his shoe? How does that entertain? The reliance on flash gadgets in the movie added to the general atmosphere of trashiness. The sadomasochism when Angeline got dressed up in whips and stockings was clumsy, gross, unconvincing and about as sexy as a constipated bodily function.Add that to the quips trotted out when people got killed in the plot and you have a movie that is seriously z-grade There was no plausibility in the plot whatsoever! Even in a light comedy it should be convincing and plausible. Batman was far more convincing and plausible even though we know from the start he is a comic book character. There is no excuse for the unforgivable implausibility of Mr and Mrs Smith. I am just amazed that anyone could actually assert that this is a good movie. My wife agreed and three quarters of the way through we could not stand it any longer and walked out of the cinema, sickened by the people in the theatre giggling mindlessly at every pathetic joke (just like they were supposed to) on cue like gullible automatons.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I was proved wrong,"I have walked past this DVD several times, and finally decided, ""why not?"" I am not sure what I was expecting, but I wasn't expecting much. Nevertheless I was pleasantly surprised with the chemistry between Brad and Angelina. Great interaction, great lines, and surprisingly humorous. No wonder they ended up together after this movie! Not the storyline I expected, so in that sense, it was a good movie. If you are buying this movie for Vince Vaughn...well, you won't be disappointed by his typical, witty, rambling a mile a minute, comedic role. I am definitely a fan. But you may be disappointed by his apparent uselessness in the storyline. Seems to me that the movie would be the same without his character.

"The battle of the sexes, again","The first surprise in Mr. & Mrs. Smith is the beginning: As the couple is interviewed by their marriage counselor we get scenes derived from the world of Woody Allen. It sets the tone for things to come: We see the couple in suburbia with their mechanical, uninteresting life (peas, please). The whole action part of the movie is set up parallel to the marriage crisis unfolding. First they have minor quarrels, the relationship explodes when finding out their true identities and war is upon them. Only by working together against the outside world and destroying their suburban home along the way, true happiness sets in. So, the action is interwoven with the marriage crisis and the comedy, but there's another level in the story: They frequently comment the whole story (""Happy endings are just stories that haven't finished"").The suburbia-theme can be found throughout the whole movie. The end scenes first start off with a family car where several features of it are used to fight their adversaries; then we end up in a kind of Home Depot-store, just the kind of battleground they usually go for shopping and feel right at home to battle their enemies.The names Jane and John Smith already suggest their anonymous, uninteresting lives. Also take a look at the agencies / companies they work for: Jane's company is up-to-date, but only inhabited by women, John's is old-fashioned and looks redundant in the modern world.Simon Kinberg did a good job here. See the memorable quotes-section for some nice examples of how clever this is written on a basic level. You start wondering if the script of xXx: State of the Union was wasted, because it had more potential. I am curious what he makes of X-Men 3. Doug 'Bourne Identity' Liman's fast-paced, fluent and light directorial style fits in well. He adds some jokes to the already many side-jokes and in-jokes in the script (at least I lost count; Benjamin wearing a Fight Club T-shirt, in most scenes there are jokes in the background visible). But it is overlong like most movies these days so cutting it by about 20 minutes would have made a better movie. And why do they keep showing previews where they already show the whole movie (De Palma's Femme Fatale-preview once contained literally the whole movie, showed 100 times faster).This is the kind of movie you forget about 15 minutes after leaving the theater, but it is worth a look because few blockbuster movies succeed in integrating action and comedy properly.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A bit of over OTT fun!,"I'm only adding this review to help stop the overall score from being dragged down by so many people awarding 1 star.This film was never supposed to have a mind bending plot or a message that plays on the audience's minds for months after watching. It is intended as a bit of light relief with zero effort required to watch. I had seen it some years ago but had mostly forgotten the plot, which could be written on a post-it note and still leave room for a small shopping list.And fun it is! The main characters are beautiful and funny with a good deal of chemistry. The script is lightweight and light-hearted, but always entertaining. Everything else is ready-mix Hollywood & ticks all the required boxes.The violence & shooting is so excessive, it becomes part of the humour. It's not graphic or scary compared to most serious action filmsAfter watching the Hannibal series back to back for the last few days, this was a perfect choice!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A most interesting time,This movie was made while Angelina was still married to Billy Bob and Brad to Jennifer Aniston. Both were cheating though Angelina was at least separated. Ironically Vince Vaughn is in the movie and he became Jennifer's first boyfriend after divorcing Brad. The best part about the movie is the chemistry between Brad and Angelina. The premise is absurd but the movie is mostly just fun. Sadly their marriage also failed so I suppose that is the Hollywood way and this movie now stands as a marker between relationships for all involved. Ironically everyone mentioned is now divorced except for Vaughn who wisely steered clear of marrying an actress.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An action movie with a happy end.,"I wasn't expecting a story like this. The film was great and, for me, the most important thing in a movie, it can changes our feelings. Angelina Jolie was lovely, very pretty woman and she did a good job when acting with guns and in the fight scenes. She had surprised me, totally. About Brad Pitt he did a really good job too, he maintain a great shape and like we saw in the Ocean's movies, Brad Pitt has a special performance when the movie include ""dirty"" business. About the story, its good and the way it takes is enjoyable, in my opinion.

No people in Ohio like the Smiths,"It takes awhile for the plot to get into high gear. To put it into retrospect, this is a film for gun nuts. Smith's secluded arsenal has more firepower than the Cleveland Swat Team. Automatic assault rifles, RPG, 9mm handguns, they got it all. During the cat and mouse foray in their grandiose house, some rounds fired by John hit the kitchen gas range and start it on fire. There's a brief silence then John says ""Are you okay, Sweetheart""? I was so flabbergasted at that point I almost choked on my popcorn. Upon hearing the noise caused by the Smith's quarrel-turned-rumpus, a few neighbors came to the door asking ""Is everything okay? We heard noises coming from your house"". But near the end of the film when the house explodes into smithereens (pun), do the neighbors assemble in the street to watch? Nope. Maybe they all went to the country club for cocktails. After the smoke cleared, there was still one ponder able enigma to be resolved...where the hell was Chuck Norris? The scene where John fakes intoxication and starts kibitzing and ultimately gets a seat in a high-stakes, covert poker game was pretty clever I thought. Jane now, who has much clout and eminence at her detective agency, acts so nonchalant in the face of the formidable task she has undertaken- in contrast to the female adversaries in James Bond 007 films, who show more aggressiveness. In summary, if you like lots of surprises, Mr. & Mrs. Smith will make your cup runneth over. If you delight in the eloquent mannerisms of good thespians, go see another film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Mr and Mrs Smith - Requisat In Pacem,"I had not planned on seeing this movie as reviews and trailers that I had seen did not particularly appeal. However, as I had seen everything else on offer at my local cinema I decided to give it a go.The early scenes made it clear that this was going to be a shoot 'em up comedy/action movie that was making no claims to reality. I figured, OK, I can live with this, and settled back for a good laugh with a couple of good looking movie stars.There were certainly some funny lines/scenes in the movie, but they were few and far between, leaving many, many ridiculously unbelievable situations with no humour whatsoever. To me these became cringe moments, you're not serious moments, no, no, don't do it moments and just plain embarrassing moments - a lot of them.I know many will say that maybe that was the point - but I'm sorry - it left me cold. The movie needed to be more serious and somewhat more believable (a la Bruce Willis type movie) or a little more humorous (a la Jackie Chan).And just as a completely unfair, off the topic comment - if there is a reversing treatment for collagen-inflated lips, Miss Jolie needs to look into it. Her lips look like a train wreck in this movie - absolutely nothing sexy about them at all...sorry.....",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Mr & Mrs Sh**, more like","Truly, truly awful and offensive in every way possible. Let's diagnose why this stupendously awful movie managed to dribble from a studio with two supposedly really good actors and a need to have a box office hit at some point in the next year or so.1. The 'thrilling' Pitt/Jolie off-screen romance has somehow been Lost In Translation and we're left with an Act One that assumes you know the characters already. Jolie's character is totally unlikeable and there's no chemistry between the actors whatsoever.2. The film manages to steal substantially from True Lies and Grosse Pointe Blank, taking the husband/wife secret life story from the former and the face off of two professional killers from the latter. Shame it didn't take the wit and action from the first and the humor from the second.3. The special effects sequences are too loud, noisy, confusing and ultimately uninvolving. There's a point where two cars flip after being shot at, which was the sort of the bizarre special effect that I thought we'd left in the 1970s. The end scene is really dumb, too: it's worth seeing (on DVD) just to see how badly it fails.I'm going to slam this on the IMDb as soon as I get over the annoyance of having lost $20 to watch this. If the Cinderella Man Money-Back Guarantee had been in place, I would have been screaming to the manager but alas too much cinema is caveat emptor.By the way, while I respect most comments from IMDb members, I urge those who liked this film to give it a second reviewing and reconsider.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Entertaining, but a little too much","I tried to stay away from Mr. & Mrs. Smith, from all the Brad and Angelina hype, I just wanted to get far away from all the news and their faces. Now, it's been almost 3 years since then, but we've still got that silly story going on, sad, I know. But I guess I was a little interested in seeing what Mr. & Mrs. Smith was about. My boyfriend had it on DVD and told me to give it a look, that it was actually pretty good. So I watched it yesterday and I have to say that it was a pretty good film, it had solid action with a great and original story, but the action at times was a little too much and then reminded me of True Lies. Angelina and Brad did have great chemistry, but the fight scenes between them could have just been a little bit more tamed down and more believable. Now I love action films, I love how unrealistic they could be, but Mr. & Mrs. Smith just could have been more of a realistic type of film like James Bond where at times is a little silly, but for the most part is something you can say that looks real.Jane and John Smith met on a romantic trip in Columbia and immediately hit it off, they get married, but quickly everything isn't clicking as well. One of the reasons that might be is because they constantly lie to each other. They are both secret agents and neither one of them are aware of the other's secret double life. But when they are hired for the same mission, they spot each other and fail the mission. Now their agencies are demanding that they kill each other, but they may find a hard time doing that when they just reignited the flame in their relationship.Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a good action movie, the acting was typical, it was average, but it worked for the film. Brad and Angelina had hot chemistry as we've had rubbed in our faces for the last couple years, but onto the film. The fight scenes were cool, but my favorite was when they came home to dinner and both of them know but don't know that they know about each other and they think that they are out to get each other. It was a funny scene and Brad really made the comedy fit in very well. I would recommend Mr. & Mrs. Smith for a watch, it's worth a look, it's just over the top, I warn you.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Absolutely the only - and I mean only - redeeming feature of this film is that it did provide a period of employment for the participants, i.e., carpenters, costumers, drivers, et al.

Apparently Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie think that they have such great name recognition that they can afford to appear in whatever garbage will give them the biggest paycheck. I hope they're right, because this poor excuse for a movie could be a career-ender.

I enjoy watching this movie,"The film ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" (2005) I always review with pleasure and today I want to tell you about it.The picture with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in the lead roles wins first of all with the duet of actors who perfectly complement each other. They got used to the roles so much (which, incidentally, is not surprising) that it seems that we really see a real married couple who have been living together for 6 years and after a while they understand that the relationship has lost its former attractiveness and is even forced to seek help.I think it was thanks to this beautiful and unusual couple that many people watched this film, and many, like me, even reviewed it.The plot of the film is quite predictable, it turns out that Jane and John are hired killers and work for different agencies and at one point they find out that they need to kill each other ...In my opinion, the plot is somehow unrealistic, but perhaps it was thanks to him that this film attracted my attention.The music in the film is also worthy of attention, melodic and romantic, which, however, is not surprising, because despite the seemingly shooting and profession, we primarily follow the relationship between the characters than the specifics of the work.Undoubtedly, the film ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" I recommend you to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Fun Action Flick with A-List Chemistry but Shallow Plot,"Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a fun action-comedy that will provide entertainment to fans of the genre.

The action sequences are well-executed and the comedic timing is spot-on, making for a lighthearted experience.However, the film's biggest flaw is its lack of depth. The story is fairly predictable and the characters are not fully developed.

Pleasantly playful little Hollywood romp,"John and Jane Smith are an ordinary married suburban couple, with ordinary and fairly monotonous lives and a marriage that is devoid of any passion or romance. What they don't know about each other is that they both work as contract-killers - for competitive firms. Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) is enticing entertainment at a high level, teasing you almost every step of the way.The controversy surrounding Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's relationship certainly boosted and propelled the film when it was released - so was it all a publicity hoax? Only time will tell. In any case, Pitt and Jolie are sexy, dynamic, flirtatious and and playful as the married leads, thereby giving the film that little extra spark in the eye. Even when they are just sitting by the dinner table together, exchanging suspicious looks, the film plays on their sexual chemistry. Funnyman Vince Vaugh adds a subtle comedic edge in the role of Mr. Smith's assassin-colleague.Unfortunately, the novelty of this sexual chemistry wears off sometime in Mr. & Mrs. Smith and this is a fatal failure for the whole film as it relies to heavily on this magnetism. It thereby becomes a bit too long and the plot is paper-thin, so that aspect can impossibly help carry the film once Pitt and Jolie's attraction is no longer a useful device. Nevertheless, I think everyone can find _something_ they like in Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), because it really is quite a bit of fun.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Only average, but could'be been great.","Mr. and Mrs. Smith have been married for five or six years and have lived a seemingly mundane lifestyle. Their personal relationship is sinking and their sex life is down the hole (mind the pun.) However, what they are soon to find out is that they are in fact both contract killers and their next mission is to kill each other.I was instantly intrigued by this movie, it had huge potential  such an original idea with a good director and actors should have been a great movie. But wasn't, so what went wrong?No it wasn't the actors, nor the writing or producing. The main problem was that the story wasn't explored to its full capabilities. The synopsis that we read is only a small part of the movie and the rest seems to have been thought up on the spot to try and make the movie longer. There were so many aspects that could have been explored in this movie that were hardly touched on. For example: The psychological side of the story was hardly explored. Instead of letting the characters run with the idea of them each knowing their true identities and having a bit of fun, making it more entertaining and fun for the audience, it falls into the Hollywood blockbuster trap and they break out shooting at each other. This, to me, seems like a cop out by Mr. Liman, who proved to us he knows perfectly well how to make a good psychological action thriller in The Bourne Identity. I guess it is easier as a director of an action film to throw in a whole lot of explosions and CGI to try and impress your audience than to have a bit more of a think about your actual story and try to leave your audience entertained and left thinking after the movie.This movie wasn't all bad though. The performances were quite good for what they were; Brad Pitt an Angelina Jolie did have good on screen chemistry (a little too good if you ask Jen) and did seem like a believable couple. Vince Vaughn was quite good as far as his acting capabilities go and Adam Brodie played a similar role to his in The O.C, a sarcastic rich teenager which is always fun Looking out the window of his limousine ""Hey look, more desert!""

The action and comedy is well directed. Vince Vhaughn is a strong supporting role. Vhaughn can be annoying and funny at the same time, a hard task. Pitt and a few others could pull of the lead role. Pitt was able to act serious, and silly. Jolie is a mystery for the viewer to understand, and Jolie fits the character's actions. A good drive-in movie. Two movies for $7.50 is a great deal, and Mr and Mrs Smith is a great headliner. 7 out of 10. A great date movie.

"A forgettable, but not badly acted, popcorn movie","I didn't go into the theater with great expectations. First of all, I am an avid Jennifer Aniston fan and believed that Brad Pitt (John) was scum for cheating on her and Angelina Jolie (Jane) was trash for going so as well. Now that that is out of the way, onward to my comments.It starts with a couple whose relationship firstly began with passion, though after five, or six, years it was all but lost. They have normal relationship issues excluding one. Oops, they're spies and they find that they're next assignment is each other. I saw it a few weeks after it opened and already the details are escaping me.John and Jane both have their own insecurities, wondering whether or not the other just married them to make an easier kill. The sparks are genuine, I'm afraid, and the acting is not the problem. I enjoyed this movie somewhat though I can remember what I ate at the theater better than all of the witty banter. It's strictly a popcorn movie with no other value, no undermining lesson except 'be honest, for all you know your spouse could be a hit (wo)man.'Some of the issues of the movie were the fact that the 'surprise' of the film were shown in the commercials (unavoidable, but...) and the 'twists' are not surprising and you can see them coming from a mile away. Despite the fact that I dislike Jolie and Pitt personally (well, from what I know of them) it is undoubtable that they did a fine job in this movie and the acting was above par.

Hard not to like,"Mr & Mrs Smith fails to work  or, in fact, add up  on so many levels. Probably the most trying suspension of disbelief required is the notion that two chronically paranoid assassins take a whole 5 or 6 years to figure out that they're sleeping under the same roof. Or, from a crude perspective, that it takes Brad 4 or 5 years to put Angelina's lips to work on anything more saucy than a peck on the cheek. Yeah right!But none of that matters. No, really, listen to me, it doesn't. Because dwelling on such trivial matters as plot flaws, character inconsistencies, continuity problems and the like, you might fail to appreciate the majestic, hilarious nonsense of it all. Which would be a shame, really, as that's the whole point.Think of it this way: Mr & Mrs Smith is Day of the Jackal meets Pirates of the Caribbean. It's bonkers (it would appear this is both literally and figuratively true). Leave all cerebral engagement, rumination and cogitation for later (it will only get in the way); lie back and think of Angelina - or Brad  or both - depending on your proclivity and/or stamina.Mr & Mrs Smith is saved from the Chris de Burg Award for Hollywood Mediocrity by two critical factors, neither of which alone would have been enough to save it.The first is the extraordinary chemistry between two fine actors. There is a point early in the film where Angelina, who is wrapped in a sheet with a flower in her hair, approaches Brad after a night of well, you get the idea. Brad looks at her with what one might generously describe as raw, naked lust. It was a look that could have impregnated the unprotected from 30 paces. Someone really needs to bottle that and give it to Orlando Bloom. Anyway, I digress. What this does for the film is help you overlook some of the knottier problems with the characterisation  like that fact that these two are, presumably, not very nice: y'know, the whole assassin, killing-people-for-money thing. To take another example, the whole Brad-cheerfully-and-repeatedly-kicking-his-wife-in-the-stomach (albeit off camera) thing.The second saving grace is the dialogue. Fractious couples have been done comedically before, of course. But the counterpoint of marital strife and cold-blooded psychopathy has probably never been so funny. Think of the car chase in the Terminator, then think of it being used to relay two back stories not one. Then imagine it being played for laughs. It works, it really does. It's a skill.There are some really deft touches too. Watch out for the lift sequence, and following dinner engagement. Watch out, also for the nice little reference to Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid at the end. It's worth remembering that the director was also responsible for a real spy movie  The Bourne Identity, so he knows what he's doing on that score. And definitely watch out for an hilarious turn from Vince Vaughan  now there's a man who knows how to spot an opening! Is this film high art? Erm no. Is it extremely difficult not to like? Yes it is. It's genuinely entertaining, and there has to be a place in cinema for that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"All meringue, no pie. A pretentious and tiresome piece of narcissistic fluff, by some self-absorbed Hollywood players","This is narcissistic fluff. I suspect this movie is trying to imitate some of the famous 'couples movies' from the 1930s and 1940s, such as the Nick and Nora Charles characters in the 'Thin Man' series, and Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn in 'Bringing Up Baby'. Sorry, but NO way are Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie anywhere near the class of Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn!Nothing against Brad and Angelina Thingy personally. The fact that those actors have their own lives, and the right to pursue their professions in whatever way they see fit is not lost on me. God bless 'em! Let them go for it. But surely, after having cringed my way through several of their movies in the past, I should have learned my lesson and stayed well away from any movie they are starring in.Think of the Danny Divito 1989 movie 'War of the Roses', which was vicious and rather ugly, when you consider it. Then imagine that movie having the sheer delusion that it could be one of the William Powell and Myrna Loy detective couple movies, or Grant and Hepburn. Sort of sad, really. A weird and sick blend of marital cutesy and really gross and hurtful violence.This flick is offensive. It is stupid, it is silly and worst of all, it is guilty of taking itself, even in its alleged whimsy and spoofiness, WAY too seriously. It might be OK viewed on DVD at home, whilst drunk.

Hasn't anybody noticed ?,"I know Hollywoods propensity for retreading or rehashing earlier films - it's so much easier than thinking - but hasn't anyone noticed that the 'plot' is a complete rip-off of the 1985 film 'Prizzi's Honour' made with Kathleen Turner and Jack Nicholson, which was in turn taken from the novel by the brilliant, late, writer Richard Condon. At least the remake of his novel 'The Manchurian Candidate' last year gave some acknowledgement even though it was probably far inferior to the Harvey/Sinatra film of 1959.I'll probably go to see this but I doubt if it will be a patch on the Turner/Nicholson film.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Hidden gem,"A nice love story went wrong. Mr. & Mrs. Smith covers the real-life romance between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.Kidding, but this movie does what it intends to do.

do you know who you married?,"In this case no. Two super killers marry yet neither knows what they do. They each have cover jobs and are gone a lot. The movie begins with them in marriage therapy. They show how they met in Bogata. Hot! Each gets assigned to the same target. They try to kill each other not knowing the other's identity. The target gets away but they soon discover it was the other that tried to kill them. So the middle of the film is them trying to kill each other. There's an awesome gun and hand fight between the two as they wreck their home. But neither can kill each other. They make up and now got both their agencies after them since their cover is blown.The last 20 minutes with another gun fight was rather boring, not as good as the rest of the movie.And Jolie and Pitt are as hot as ever. Brad takes his shirt off several times and looks better then he did 5 years ago.FINAL VERDICT: One of the better big budget action films that has been released lately. The two stars are very hot and fun to watch. The plot is entertaining enough and there are several funny lines. So, I recommend it for simply a fun movie to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Mr and Mrs Smith,"After enjoying this film I asked myself what was this movie about? What was the script? What was the plot? What was the its genre? I failed to answer any of these but I know I enjoyed this film.In quick first act John(Pitt) and Jane(Jolie), two strangers totally over each other, fool around in a rain-party. And they get married on impulse. Now after 4-5 years of their marriage they are still strangers to each other! They haven't yet aware about true nature of others job. Both are 'deadly' assassins. They finish their jobs (killing people) and return home at night as if has done a '9 to 5' job. This routine is disturbed when they find each other on same assignment and came to know about true nature of their jobs. And so they come after each other. Sequences when these two try to kill one other are presented in carefree manner. As that supposed to be. ""Oh come on, it was just a little bomb"" says Jane- can give you idea what I am talking about. This is a vague idea of 'Mr and Mrs Smith'.Film occasionally switches to the scenes (real, real high moments of movie) where these two are asked questions by a marriage counselor. We come to know that fire between these two is no more there now. Exact lines were: Therapist: How is your sex life? Jane: I don't understand the question John: I don't get it, is this another 1 to 10 thing? Or one where John: ..There were moments .u know..It is full of hilarious sequences like the conversation about curtains Jane: If You Don't Like Then We Can Take Them Back. John: OK. I Don't Like Them. Jane: You'll Get Used To Them. And there is one car sequence these two commenting, retorting each other. scenes with Eddie(Vince Vaughan) and John are fun to watch. It's never ill or forced comedy, I must say. In one scene when these two look for hidden-weapons is sure to make you laugh. One with Angelina Jolie asked to hold the child in party, watch Jolie's expression there.Dialogue here are funny and to chew over and over. My most favorites are when Brad Pitt is caught in lift and threaten to be killed by Julie : Jane Smith: Any last words? John Smith: The new curtains are hideous. and in last scenes before credits roll John says ""Ask the sex question again.(with that grin on his face)"".No one dare to say against the performances. Those are fabulous. These two are the perfect cast. Sensuous Angelina Julie is now rated most beautiful woman on earth. Brad Pitt is heartthrob for years and he will continue to be. Vince Vaughan is smooth and impressive.I loved Soundtracks from it. Joe Strummer's 'mongo bongo' (Jolie-Pitt rain-dance song) and Pink Martini's 'Don't stop falling in love' are just wow!! Yet there is something missing in the film.All steamy scenes might have cut by our dear censor board so can't say anything about those. But they must have set screen on fire.One advice before you see this movie: Don't ask too many questions. It is a slick flick. Just Go and feel the kick!'Mr and Mrs Smith' is emblazoned with exploding chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and plenty of cheezee one liners. That's it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

marriage love,"This film is actually a reaction to marriage. The director looked at the marriage from another perspective. At the beginning of the film, it was all about Qin Se and Ming.

terrible movie,"This is a terrible movie that glorifies domestic violence in the guise of a comedy which makes it even worse. Both actors, who showed such great promise early in their career, seem to be reduced to making One-dimensional comic book movies that have no substance but a big paycheck.The movie self-destructs because of it going from being a look at a marriage that has lost that spark and both people are bored (sounds a lot like True Lies) to an action, shoot-em-up, guns that don't need re-loading and two stars that engage in all this and yet don't seem to even mess up their hair. At least True Lies had the stars looking dirty when it was called for and a good supporting cast. Neither Ms. Jolie or Brad Pitt seems able to carry the movie by themselves. Also, True Lies had comedy that wasn't built around domestic violence and was a movie that work not because of the sexual excitement people feel (which is a poor excuse for a movie) but because of the chemistry and good natured aspects. In True Lies (I'm not saying this was a great movie but a lot better than this one), when the terrorist slaps one of the female actors, the audience responds to this. In this movie, The violence is within the marriage and setting aside the comedy should make people feel uncomfortable.A film needs more than sexual chemistry between the leading actors. It needs a good script, a good director that knows where to draw the lines and a good supporting crew. This movie has none of this. I'm not against sexual chemistry but if that's all the movie offers then just rent some porn and given some of the comments made by posts here that's what I would recommend. At least it would be cheaper for you. A good movie also needs more than things being blown up and people shooting one another. If you compare it to Prizzi's Honor, Prizzi's Honor had a great cast, good script, great supporting cast and an ending that makes you feel a sense of sadness in the main character. Nicholson conveyed a sense, at the end, that he may not have taken the action he did and you come away with a sense of sadness from him that he got sucked into an action and the aftermath that he didn't really want.If you compare it to War of the Roses, War had a great cast, good script, strong supporting cast and was filmed as a dark comedy that really, in the end, didn't make light of domestic violence, whether it's from the husband, wife or both. The movie ends with DeVito telling the couple to go home and stay together. Also, the movie ends with the knowledge that DeVito is married and happy.Of course it would be nice, given what both have said, if they would take those big paychecks and, instead of spending them on 5-7 million dollar houses, private jets, and 3 million for diamond earrings...etc... and donate some it to the causes they supposedly support. Hypocrisy (in their personal life) and terrible movie choices (in their professional life) will lead these stars down the has-been track. After all, age takes it toll and their good looks without any show of acting ability will cause them to end up in the same dustbin as Sharon Stone and others.One finally note on the movie: don't get caught up in the glamor of the stars (whether this movie or others), boycott the movie and send a message to Hollywood stars that we demand more of them the drivel they produce.Asidenote on June12- box office receipts were very good for this movie but with the other one dimensional comic book movies coming in the next 2 weeks, it probably won't last. It's to bad that all this money is spent on this film when there are many more great films out there. Hollywood knows that the summer for these types of movies and waits until the fall to put out the better ones. I just hate to see so much talent being wasted on a throw-away movie like this one.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Red Alert in the Chemistry Lab.,"Pre-release rumors of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie being romantically linked in real life become a distraction that was not needed in this brain-dead demolition derby that is full of incoherent elements. Pitt and Jolie are an unhappily married couple who are both really government assassins who have hidden their true lives from one another. Amazing to me that these two experts could not know the real truth about their marriage. Either these are the two sneakiest spies in the history of film or two of the dumbest (I side with the latter). Anyway the secrets hit the fan, chaos strikes and the chemistry between our two leads hits a fevered pitch that makes you ignore the stupid story all together. Comic relief from scene stealers Vince Vaughn (as Pitt's most trusted ally) and enigmatic wise-crack Adam Brody (of ""The O.C."" fame) become two more unnecessary distractions that ultimately lead nowhere. Brody gets immersed in the middle of the entire dizzying exercise as finding him becomes a top priority for the star duo. ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is like being in a high school and watching the senior quarterback and head cheerleader date. At times their routine may be cute or endearing and at other times you want to strangle them both because of their sickening relationship together. To say that Pitt and Jolie do not have a heated chemistry on the screen would be an outright lie, but honestly this is nothing but a whole lot of noise that represents a bare minimum of cinematic thought. Kind of like a science lab exploding and no one really caring. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Violent Screwball Comedy of Literally A Battle Between the Sexes,"Up to just beyond the half-way point ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" works as a modern screwball comedy, a less dark ""Prizzi's Honor.""But the gloss of suburban satire turns unappealing when the violence first gets personal, then becomes like mutual S & M foreplay, if not disturbing abuse, and then goes completely over the top into military operations that make one wonder what has happened to law enforcement.Staging the final battle in an Ikea-type store seems like a lame attempt to restore the satirical element of two assassins who have been living undercover as suburbanites, but it looks and feels more like a video game, though the shiny cinematography emphasizes their brittle surface environment.So maybe it's not so much that their violence is an aphrodisiac as it is a wake-up call to stir latent emotions (including a ""Lethal Weapon 4""-like scars comparison) as certainly two of the most beautiful physical specimens on the planet do have sparkling chemistry together and each keeps up the battles of both wits and guts. Brad Pitt even occasionally shows some charming vulnerability and Angelina Jolie is a droll bad ass.The camera simply loves them and there is just enough banter to keep up interest in them as people when they are blowing up everything around them. But the dialog misses many opportunities to go any deeper into their psyches beyond cartoon characters.The contrasts in their businesses is amusing, with Pitt's casual headquarters anchored by motormouth mama's boy Vince Vaughn incongruously and vicariously planning mayhem, while Jolie manages an all-woman high tech, high gloss operation under cover as a temp agency, including Jennifer Morrison of ""House, M.D."" as yet another overly efficient assistant.The music mostly supports the comic undercurrent, including a Muzak take on ""The Girl from Ipanema"" contrasting with other excellent Latino selections on the soundtrack.While once your stomach has been turned by the mutually destructive violence so that it's hard to keep laughing, this is mostly about Pitt and Jolie looking gorgeous and doing impossible things -- and they pull it off entertainingly. Ah if only real violence was about these fantasies and not terrorists.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Entertaining, but isn't all that different from other movies in the genre","All you read or hear about this movie has something to do with the possible affair between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt and it's sometimes very hard to find some decent reviews in the magazines. That's why I didn't exactly know what to expect before going to the cinema to watch this movie. I already figured out that it wouldn't be a romantic comedy (I still find it a typical title for such a movie), but that it would be an action filled comedy. But that was all that I knew about it and I just gave it a try, hoping for the best.When the movie starts, we see John and Jane Smith sitting in the office of a marriage councilor. They have been married for 6 years now and they admit that they are bored by their average married life. But what they don't know is that they both have a secret life. They are both assassins who travel the world to kill for money. But when they are both hired to kill one person, they get in each other's way without knowing it and blow the job. Now they are told to go after the person who was the cause of their failure, making them find out that it's their own spouse they are after...""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is a typical Hollywood action movie. The car chases are incredibly fast and well orchestrated, the explosions are gigantic, the bullets seem to fly around your ears by the millions and they use plenty of gadgets that would make James Bond blush like a little schoolgirl. That's not exactly what I'm normally looking for in a movie, but in the end it's still enjoyable and the actors have a lot to do with that. If it wasn't for these two pretty actors, this movie would be a typical action flick that would have gone by unnoticed. Because, let's be honest, do you really believe that this movie would have drawn such a crowd if Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie hadn't played the leading roles in it? Jolie is the only reason why all men want to see it and only because Brad Pitt is playing in it, their wives or girlfriends are willing to go with them. And my own experience only proves it. To give you an example of what I consider to be a large crowd: it was very difficult to find a seat in the enormous room while they played it in three different rooms at the same time. I would say that that must be enough room for approximately 1,000 people and it was full of men and women.Personally I must say that I liked this movie most for the humor. Thanks to the several witty remarks from both characters and the absurd situation of two assassins sitting in front of a marriage councilor without knowing who their partner really is, was really funny. In my opinion it saved a lot of this otherwise poor movie. I say poor, because it relies more on the marketing around the possible affair than on a decent script. I know that this is an action movie and that such movies don't exactly offer the most intelligent stories, but I've already seen a lot better action movies in the past. Take for instance ""The Rock"", that was a movie full of action too, but the story worked.In the end it isn't a bad movie, but it is a typical American blockbuster that doesn't really stay very long with you once you've left the cinema. I only see this movie as some easy entertainment and than I must say that it's OK. But it's not excellent and that's why I give this movie a 6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fun with John and Jane,"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" a 2005 film also starring Vince Vaughn and Adam Brodie. The story concerns an unhappily married couple, each not knowing that the other is a special government agent. When they both go after the same target, they realize the truth. Each is then assigned to kill the other; when they find out that they are both supposed to be eliminated, they decide two are better than one.The film combines elements of ""War of the Roses,"" ""F/X,"" and ""True Lies."" It's interesting to see the comments so divided here. That possibly has to do with two elements: the more positive comments are from people who saw ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" as a rental or on television and the more negative are from people who saw it in the theater and paid $10; and/or: the more positive comments are from people who just like to be entertained, and the more negative are from people who like films to make sense. This is one of those films where you can't have it both ways.""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a fun rental with two beautiful stars who have great chemistry. The beginning is a little slow, but it picks up and then the pace is very fast. But in order to enjoy it, you have to let go of things like wanting the film to make sense. It can't - first of all, the premise is ridiculous. Secondly, in order to keep the stars alive throughout the film, the writer had to make the way the plot unfolds even more ridiculous. If you can make up your mind to just be entertained, this can be a delightful experience. There are some funny bits and some impressive action sequences. One of the funniest is when Jolie takes off in her car and Pitt tries to go after her. I found both the actors very enjoyable with great presence, and they really both light up and fire up the screen.You can always find plot holes and in this case, you'll fall into the first one and never get out. But it's a comedy. Comedies are sometimes absurd but still funny, and special effects films are sometimes absurd but still exciting. Just take ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" on its own silly merits and enjoy yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Intelligent Romantic Comedy of the Year,"11 June 2005. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is an intelligent romantic comedy that ups the bar for using action-adventure as a way to highlight marital discord and resolution. Unlike the trailers, this comedy isn't really about tapping into the adolescent male need for speed and violence, in fact one of the primary scenes that includes action feels off balance in the movie. The movie begins as a romantic comedy with Mr. and Mrs. Smith in a marital counseling session (while the movie credits are being shown!) and the first third of the movie is actually way slow for an action-adventure movie, thus expectations are challenged as to the pacing of this movie if one was expecting one type of movie and ended up with another.The delicious interplay between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is backed up by good cinematography, a sensitivity to acting and expression (not only dialogue), and so good relational, emotional punch lines that become available under this ridiculous scenario of two assassins being married to each other. The underlying theme of marital relationships within such a conflicted profession allows the screenplay to delve into the nature of marriage further than is possible in reality. It allows the audience to be exposed to an alternative reality, that tests certain truths about men and women in relationships where one has to decide between life and death of the self and the life and death of the relationship that are not ordinarily available in normal circumstances. Thus film can take us places we cannot go in reality, and explore certain concepts in an entertaining manner.While not perfect, this movie goes into comedy romance in an area that is tapped for its gems. The plot has some holes in regards to plausibility (much like Lara Croft movies), but it is the comic approach to revealing more about marriage than about feasibility and realism that counts here (see Indiana Jones, Star Wars), that is a stake. The pacing and the tone of the film undergo stresses by this bold attempt to manage a script that jumps into murky waters of romantic comedy and deciding to go for the feels good, instead of the dark, black comedy approach of ""The War of the Roses"" (1989) with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner that could be better described as a comedy-drama. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is an example of the continual evolution, exploration of the romantic comedy genre that highlights the nature of the industry is progressing, not deteriorating.

Good movie,"""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" is an action-packed romantic comedy that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is undeniable and their performances are both charming and convincing. The film tells the story of a seemingly normal couple who, unbeknownst to each other, are both highly trained assassins working for rival agencies. When they are both assigned to kill the same target, they find themselves in a dangerous game of cat and mouse, which ultimately leads to a battle between them.The action sequences are expertly choreographed and visually stunning, with plenty of explosions and gunfire to satisfy any action movie fan. However, what really sets this film apart is its humor. The witty banter between Pitt and Jolie is hilarious and provides a much-needed break from the intense action.The film also explores themes of trust and honesty in a relationship, as the couple struggles to reconcile their secret lives with their desire to build a life together. This adds depth to the film beyond its surface-level entertainment value.Overall, ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" is a fun, entertaining movie that is sure to please both action movie fans and rom-com enthusiasts alike.

Could have been great with a better script,"The premise to this film is great, even if it's not completely original. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie--two of the biggest current box-office draws, and deservedly so for the most part--are a couple whose marriage is on the rocks. But they have even bigger problems. Despite living together for ""five or six"" years, their identities and professional lives, as each other believes they know them, are lies. They're really both ""secret agents""/hit persons, regularly trotting off to exotic locales to kill. When the truth is discovered, can their relationship stand the strain? We get to see both aspects of their lives, with the result being an unusual but potentially captivating mixture of well-crafted action/adventure scenes somewhere between James Bond and the Mission Impossible films and a light romantic comedy, a bit heavier on the turmoil than usual. The premise has the potential to fuel a more adult Spy Kids-like film.Unfortunately, Mr. & Mrs. Smith suffers from a couple major flaws. This is a plot and character-driven film, but the script leaves the backstory, motivations, justifications and character development by the wayside, focusing instead on what writer Simon Kinberg must think is extremely clever dialogue. It's not--I may have only chuckled a couple times, and instead the audience is left in the dark wondering just who the protagonists are and why they would have the reaction they do when the big realization about their partner arrives.We never learn just who they work for (hence the confusion about whether they're secret agents, hit persons, or something else altogether), why their employers would amount to ""enemy"" organizations, and why Mr. & Mrs. Smith would unquestioningly follow particular orders, especially when at the same time, insofar as the characters are developed, neither seems like a ""yes-man"" who would follow _anything_ that anyone says unquestioningly.By the same token, we know that their marriage is on the rocks, especially because the film begins with Mr. & Mrs. Smith talking to a marriage counselor, but we never know why. Their marital problems are not further developed than the fact that Mr. Smith dislikes Mrs. Smith's cooking, Mrs. Smith thinks that Mr. Smith is somewhat slothlike and irresponsible at home, and they do not communicate as much or as well as they should. That, and/or similar states, describes plenty of married people whose relationships are not threatened.Instead, the film sets its sights on dialogue that Kinberg must think is hip and witty, delivered in a fairly rapid pace. The dialogue isn't horrible, but it's certainly not hip and witty, and director Doug Liman--who has been hit and miss--he directed the fantastic remake of The Bourne Identity (2002), but also did the awful Go (1999)--encourages Pitt and Jolie to sound affected and pretentious far too often. Aside from this, Pitt and Jolie do an admirable job, and of course they're pleasant to look at, but you have to wonder why they wouldn't be more careful in choosing a script and more adamant against the occasional bad directorial advice.The action scenes are competent to good technically. A lot of juice is drained from them because of the underdeveloped story--we need to understand these people and their situation better to be on the edge of our seats, and the scenes are a bit generic (even more so the score), but for a big action fan, as I am, they're entertaining enough. A car chase near the end of the film (no surprises there) and a big fight in a house are extremely well done, exciting and deliver a few of the funnier lines at the same time. But a couple scenes where Mr. & Mrs. Smith are practically invincible--for example, standing in the middle of a hail of bullets and small explosives, protected only by bullet-proof vests but receiving nary a scratch--tend to negate the great scenes.You could look at the whole movie, even the action/adventure scenes, as more of a metaphor for a couple beginning the process of separation or divorce. It's not uncommon to hear of people having secret lives that a spouse is unaware of, and of course most people become quite nasty in the separation process, other people become involved, and so on. Seen this way, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is potentially cleverer, but again the script needed much more work for us to understand and care about the characters.Overall, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is just so-so, as the result of a balancing act between good points and bad points. In my rating system a 7 is equivalent to a ""C"", but this one is really a low ""C"", which means it almost doesn't earn credit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Mr. & Mrs. Smith is full of funny moments, it's true, but it relies too heavily on Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's charm to work, lacking substance","Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Two of Hollywood's most talented, sexiest, versatile and capable stars together, and for the first time ever! They needed better reasons than these to make a film like Mr. & Mrs. Smith? Even more that we count on Doug Liman in the direction, the same of the interesting The Bourne Identity (2002), the first episode of the series starring Matt Damon. The filmmaker manages to skillfully exercise his histrionic vein by combining artificiality with verisimilitude, a fleeting pastime with relevant arguments, an involving subtext in an apparently superficial plot.

They are also married, but they don't know about each other's work and are currently living a bored life. The situation between them takes a turn when they each receive a new job from their respective agency, which causes them to meet to carry out the same mission. The secret between the two is that both he and she are professional killers. The farce ends when they receive, at the same time, the mission to end each other's lives. The alleged reason would be that each organization wants to eliminate the competition, but this is just a plot excuse to unite them and finally let each one get to know each other better. Having overcome the differences, they will have to work together to end those who want the same from them.Pitt and Jolie play the title couple, two lovers who, after some time of marriage, can no longer bear the boredom of their relationship. With a very inspired opening sequence, in which instead of having car chases or big explosions we are introduced to the two protagonists in a couple's therapist, with both pointing out their grievances about their spouse. In this initial sequence, the perfect chemistry between them is evident - which would later go beyond mere professional activity, as everyone already knows - and half the work is done.Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a legitimate Hollywood product, with the face of an American summer blockbuster, made to raise millions of dollars, and which nevertheless manages to go below the surface and offers the occasional closer reading. The film starts from the paradox of trying to portray two of Hollywood's most celebrated and envied stars as ordinary people, who wake up early in the morning for work, shop at supermarkets and spend many nights a week without having sex with their partners - and all this before them. Actually form a couple (as happened in real life). All they fear is facing the changes in their routines, something very close to the average viewer. This, however, may be the starting point of the film, but from the beginning it is clear that the tone used will be that of debauchery and satire, which is why Brad and Angelina work so well in their respective characters.From the very first scene, when the couple faces a painful session of marital therapy, the actors manage to convey to the audience that it could really happen, whether they were hired killers who happened to meet each other in the midst of explosions in Bogotá (Colombia), fell in love, and kept their real profession secret. The tape deals very well with this ""infidelity"" committed by the two, transporting scenes that we have seen several other times to this unusual situation. John Smith (Pitt) comes home from work and hides a red tag on the collar of his shirt under his sweater. Jane Smith (Jolie) hides in the bathroom to remove the dominatrix outfit she used to seduce a gun smuggler. For those who are outside, seeing both sides, fun is guaranteed. The two live the typical upper-middle-class American life that lives in the suburbs, with those white houses, green lawns and boring neighbors. That's why they can't stand to look each other in the face and fight even when it's time to pass the salt during dinner. At this point, the script knows very well how to hide the real nature of its protagonists from the public (for those who went to watch the movie without seeing any trailer), giving false tips to the public, until they finally start to show their true skills at work with about twenty minutes of film.Directed by Doug Liman, the story addresses, after a long introduction, the conflicts between John Smith and his wife Jane, who have been married for 'five or six years', after they discover that they follow the same career, that of professional assassins. Working for rival 'agencies', they are tasked with killing each other, which, of course, does nothing to help their already in crisis marriage. First of all, I must acknowledge the obvious: the plot conceived by screenwriter Simon Kinberg is simply absurd. The concept of highly sophisticated agencies of professional killers is never developed in a way that makes any sense, sounding like a mixture of S. P. E. C. T. R. E. From the old films starring James Bond and the intelligence service that employs Robert Rodriguez's 'Spy Kids'. And the fact that the two 'agencies' establish themselves as rivals willing to eliminate the competition makes it even more difficult to understand how they could have managed to grow so much (to the point of having real armies) without ever drawing the attention of the government or the media. And the motivation and means for ordering the deaths of Pitt and Jolie's characters sounds even more ridiculous than one might at first imagine.But while the script snag poses a serious problem, the truth is that Mr. & Mrs. Smith is not a film concerned with plot or coherence: the main raison d'être of this project is the appearance of the couple of protagonists, as well as the dynamics between them. In this sense, the film is a success: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie really work extremely well on screen, displaying great chemistry and demonstrating that, sometimes, glamor is an end in itself. Individually, however, the results achieved by the duo are a little different: Jolie, in general, seems more concerned with showing off her physical perfection and sensuality than with building a character, while Pitt, much more talented, understands being in a comedy and avoids taking himself seriously, taking advantage of any opportunity that arises to provoke laughter through facial and body expressions and the irreverent way in which he says his lines (in fact, he had already revealed his great comic timing in films like 12 Monkeys , Snatch, The Mexican and Eleven Men and a Secret).In return, Mr. & Mrs. Smith squanders a good source of jokes by ignoring an element that is only hinted at by the script: the fact that Jane is clearly more effective as an assassin than her husband. There are moments when the film even seems to prepare gags on the subject, but these never appear on the screen - at least, not directly. This is perhaps motivated by Kinberg's overt sexism, which leads John to frequently rush to his wife's aid (although, as I said, she is obviously more capable). Furthermore, although he creates an 'agency' populated only by women, the screenwriter cannot avoid the impulse to make them subordinate to a male figure symptomatically baptized as 'the Father'.Seeking to establish a fast-paced narrative pace, talented director Doug Liman manages to keep the viewer attentive and - most importantly - distracted enough not to notice the frailty of the script (that is, until we start thinking about the film as we leave the theater). ): the car chase sequence, in particular, is efficient and creative, even if it doesn't quite measure up to the one Liman orchestrated in The Bourne Identity. On the other hand, not even the filmmaker manages to create a dramatic center that gives weight to the adventures of the Smith couple, which would be fundamental for us to really fear for the fate of the duo. It is worth mentioning, by the way, that the fluctuating degree of fantasy adopted by the script eliminates any possible tension: right after eliminating some enemies by hitting them with knives, for example, Jane hits her husband's leg, who only looks annoyed and removes it from the wound, which does not appear to bleed or hurt. In this way, there is no way to take the problems of the heroes seriously.Mr. & Mrs. Smith is not fault-free, let's be clear. Ending suddenly and unsatisfactorily, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a throwaway pastime: it has its share of funny moments, it's true, but it relies too heavily on Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's charm to work, lacking substance. In addition, half an hour less would be ideal, as well as a reduction in the plot and less pyrotechnics in favor of the fun dialogues between the protagonists would also achieve a better result. Still, its merits are beyond mishap. Adapted from an eponymous television series shown on American television in the mid-1990s, it is a competent, dynamic and fun feature that certainly deserves the space it conquered.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Overkill ...,"MR. AND MRS. SMITH begins like a Woody Allen movie. John and Jane Smith sit looking at the camera, talking to the disembodied voice of a marriage counselor, revealing bits of their marital woes through awkward attempts at casual humor. It is a nice beginning, but totally misleading. What seems to be developing into a clever, bittersweet, sophisticated drama about a failing marriage evolves into a tiresomely violent and overwrought video game tale of suburban warfare.The twist, which the film treats as a surprise even though it is made apparent in all the advance advertising, is that John and Jane are paid assassins working for two rival, unidentified government agencies. They marry not knowing each other's little secret, which should indicate just how incompetent they are at their jobs. Then for reasons that are never made clear, they are assigned to kill each other. The result is the battle of the sexes as an extreme sport.It is an insipid idea for a movie, yet nonetheless intriguing: taking domestic violence out of the hands of amateurs and leaving it to the professionals. And as long as the cat and mouse bloodlust between John and Jane remains personal, the film has a sharp satirical edge. The battle of the sexes becomes more than a just an ironic metaphor. The problem is that the film doesn't know where to stop and a screenplay that wants to become more and more outrageous ends up just getting more and more stupid. It is alleged that the screenplay went through fifty drafts and presumably each successive screenwriter added a ""wouldn't it be cool if ..."" moment that prompted them to exaggerate everything. When it takes on dimensions that would even be embarrassingly unbelievable in a James Bond movie, the result is like THE WAR OF THE ROSES on LSD: coyly malevolent but utterly incoherent.As the Smiths, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have a fair amount of chemistry, most apparent in a dinner sequence where paranoia and cunning are served up along with tainted roast beef and extremely sharp carving knives. But as they tango through scenes of bickering sarcasm their witty banter literally gets drowned out by explosions, gunfire and squealing automobile tires. Then, even though it rushes to resolve the conflict between the Smiths, the film drags on for another ultra-violent thirty minutes designed to -- but totally failing at -- explaining the plot's myriad loopholes. The film ends with a smug happily-ever-after in which nothing has been resolved.Ultimately, the film has no real point. As it systematically destroys all the symbols of middle-American bliss -- marriage, suburban home, mini-van, etc. -- one suspects that the original screenplay for MR. AND MRS. SMITH hoped to join the ranks of THE WAR OF THE ROSES; DIVORCE, AMERlCAN STYLE and even WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLFE? as a brittle commentary on the decline of the American family. But the right to even be compared to such films apparently was written out of the story during all those revisions, with any sharp insights gunned down by all the high-tech pyrotechnics. A film focusing on adult themes sells out totally to juvenile comic book mayhem.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Coasting on star power,"Take a generous helping of ""True Lies"" (1994), add a hint of ""The Thin Man"" (1934) and toss in a dash of ""Prizzi's Honor"" (1985) for good measure and what have you got? Why, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" of course.I can't remember the last time I saw a film that depended so completely on its stars' charisma to carry it. Luckily for director Doug Liman and screenwriter Simon Kinberg, they have Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, both of whom have undeniable screen presence. But as well as they click, even Pitt and Jolie have to overcome a script that loses its way in the third act and a story with enough holes to drive through several convoys of trucks.One critic said this film contains a level of sophistication, a la ""The Thin Man"" films. The Smiths are no Nick and Nora Charles. Make no mistake about it. The banter between Pitt and Jolie doesn't even come close replicating the Charleses' repartee. ""Come to daddy,"" Mr. Smith says during a fight. She decks him and replies, ""Who's your daddy, now?"" Simon Kinberg's script really doesn't go beyond this level. You want sophisticated comedy? Watch an Ernst Lubitsch movie.All that being said, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" still remains enjoyable for the most part. Much of the enjoyment comes from watching Pitt and Jolie play off each other. There's undeniable chemistry between these two stars and they know how to use it. They make their dialogue - however preposterous it may seem - to sound natural. You get the feeling these are two people awfully comfortable in each other's space and that helps a great deal.Director Doug Liman knows how to shoot action sequences. He's proved it before. Here, again, the action scenes are exciting, pounding and fast-moving. But where the film comes apart is when, for some inexplicable reason, Liman and Kinberg abandon their characters and turn ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" into an excuse to blow things up and nothing else.True, this is a leave-your-brain-at-the-door film. There's no doubt about that. But the story had potential and the film gets off to a terrific start. But it really gets too caught up in the action and forgets about its two very interesting protagonists.On ""Inside the Actor's Studio,"" Jolie said that the film's stunt coordinator looked at the script and added plenty of action, turning essentially a half-page of action into several weeks of shooting. And that very well could've been the problem.The film gets more ridiculous as it goes along, culminating in an outrageous shoot-out that defies belief even for a film of this nature. The sequence also isn't done that well, either. For a good example of how to make such moments taut, tense and thrilling, watch the Italian film, ""The Nest"" (2002), which essentially takes place inside a warehouse.""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" ultimately has more bluster than it ought to. There are two tremendously talented stars and one awfully capable director. But somehow they get so wrapped up in the film's cacophonous action that they ignore this story's most important aspect  its charming characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Why so many killing companies design a trap and dispatch so many personnel to kill them both, only because they are husband and wife and they might disclose too much more than they should?

May divorce be with you,"With a well-turned calf and a dazzling grin, this preposterous action flick goes about its business with a gleeful disregard for logic and plot exposition. But with a hit-couple as ridiculously good-looking as Brad and Angie, it's not surprising that the camera sticks to them like glue, only tearing itself away long enough to focus on their destructive handiwork.The movie suffers from a beauty overload; too many long, lingering close-ups and scenes of navel-gazing slow it down. This is an action movie that loses its momentum too often, strategically timing each explosive set-piece to get things moving again.Despite the stop-startness of it all, there is much for action junkies to feast upon. The 'domestic disturbance' chez Smith is a stand-out, and both the desert hit and car chase deliver the requisite thrills in an 'is this a John Woo movie?' kinda way.But as the climactic, video game-like gunfight wore on, I thought that it would have been more interesting to have the Smiths squaring up to another couple of hitpersons, rather than legions of faceless goons who couldn't shoot fish in a barrel.

Vince Vahn's character was hilarious, but they did not explain him well enough to understand the meaning of him and why he was in the film. The story was great though and I loved how well it was plotted, but as I mentioned earlier how it dragged i little,and that bored me. The ending was perfect.

takes awhile to find its footing but delivers the goods,"In ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie make love with blows and bullets rather than with hearts and flowers. Could this be the new paradigm for romance for the 21st Century? Pitt and Jolie portray a couple whose marriage, after six years, has become so boring and routine that they have literally nothing left to say to one another. This despite the fact that both lead extraordinary double lives as secret agents - so secret, in fact, that neither of them knows that the other is really a hired assassin working for a rival company. When the truth finally comes out, the film turns into a sort of James Bond version of ""The War of the Roses,"" with both parties devising ever more elaborate ways to rub one another out. However, the equation changes a bit when they discover that they have both been targeted for assassination by their respective agencies who fear that having two married spies from opposing camps might result in a serious conflict of interest for both sides. Soon, John and Jane come to realize that there's nothing like shooting it out with a common enemy to put a little zing back into a marriage.Written by Simon Kinberg and directed by Doug Liman, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a clever, stylish dark comedy jerry-built out of equal parts star power, high concept cleverness and cartoon violence. Although the actors sometimes seem to be having a better time doing their thing on screen than we in the audience are having watching them do it, the fact remains that ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" after a somewhat faltering start, catches us up in its skewed view of marital relations gone wild. For the more threatened and knee-deep in danger and trouble the two of them get, the more they begin to communicate and reconnect as lovers - proving, I suppose, that two people can indeed make both love AND war despite what the slogan says. Most of the humor, in fact, is generated by the incongruity that arises from hearing them air their marital grievances against the backdrop of life-threatening gunplay and explosions. Who ever would have thought that facing death under a hail of bullets could be a more effective form of marital therapy than conventional counseling? As the bickering couple, Pitt and Jolie achieve a genuine romantic chemistry on screen, hitting just the right note of urbane sophistication and sly detachment necessary for what is, essentially, a slick, post-modernist comedy for star struck audiences. Both are suave, laid-back and utterly unflappable in their presence and demeanor, as befits the tone of the film. My only complaint is that the gun battles do go on a bit long at times and the film does have some trouble finding its footing at the beginning.

In their scenes together one can't take one's eyes from them for fear one might lose something important.""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a good summer film in which to get lost. The story about these two agents, working for two different outfits that are going after one another is a good way to spend a couple of hours at the movies. The film will not disappoint the action fans that will surely flock to watch this amazing new film.Angelina Jolie is a fine actress who commands our attention at all times. Brad Pitt is an actor that excels under good direction. Adrian Brody is seen in the pivotal part of Benjamin and Kerry Washington also shines as Jazmin.Doug Liman does it again!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Delivers What it Promises, No More, No Less.","If nothing else, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" put a big smile on my face. When analyzed, it might seem to be its own enemy. The script and musical choices prevent the action from being truly tense or awesome. Writer Simon Kinberg piles the scintillating quotes and revelations on top of the action, which undermines its ability to enthrall. The music is totally inappropriate for a normal action movie. None of that is a problem, because ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" does not have the same goals as they do. It is exactly what the title says it is, and that is not ""Ultimate Deception,"" or ""Married Assassins.""The movie begins innocently in a marriage counseling session. The therapist (William Fichtner) makes basic inquiries such as marital satisfaction and sexual frequency. His clients do understand the questions, reminding me of Spock's puzzlement towards ""How do you feel?"" at the beginning of ""Star Trek IV.""They are, of course, John and Jane Smith (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, or Bradgelina). The two do not communicate well. John always appears preoccupied and Jane apparently lacks the language to express her feelings. Despite their positive responses to the marital satisfaction query, they act nonchalantly towards each other. Since both are professional killers and neither knows it, they are unable to open up to each other as they live their numerous lies. ""There's this huge space between us, and it just keeps filling up with everything that we don't say to each other,"" laments Jane as answers escape her.""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" does not skimp on the setup, nor does the violence quickly follow their revelations of each others' real careers. The amusement continues as the movie plays coy with how they intend to resolve the dilemma. Possibly the best laugh comes when John arrives home for dinner and sees a most unusual item on the kitchen counter. The swanky dinner is a close second. None of the humor is presented in the Monty Python/Mel Brooks ""I put it right in front of your face, now laugh"" manner. It is merely there, hiding in plain sight waiting to be eaten layer by layer as one would a gourmet cake.John Powell's score frequently employs accordions and violins harmonizing in happy movements. The absence of music can push the tension higher. The classic Bond vs. Grant fight in ""From Russia with Love,"" and Bond vs. Janus brawl amid the finale of ""GoldenEye"" come immediately to mind. Most high-impact tussles are scored with loud, quick and intricate music employing prominent guitars, violins or horns, which is what most expect as Brad Pitt leaps through a threshold and into action. The contradictory elements assure the more fun, light-hearted feeling to the movie's marquee scene.Try as they may, John and Jane cannot deny their feelings for each other. The entire movie works around that concept. The true climax is not the final action scene. Angelina Jolie continues to amaze me. She creates more genuine tears than most actresses can, and repeatedly does so in goofball scripts. Her talents extend far beyond a pretty face and popular body. The action icon won an Oscar and played the lead in ""A Mighty Heart."" Pitt plays the relaxed but serious character he does so wonderfully, but sometimes speaks too softly. Director Doug Liman repeatedly fails to amplify his voice. Both Pitt and Jolie use their strengths to embody their characters' massive internal conflict.The rest of the acting is passable, except for Vince Vaughn, who works well with the resident oddball. His character, Eddie, lives with his mother and gives a pretty convincing argument as to why. Vince shows his comedic gift, but he is not as sharp as usual. Keith David's near-absence is disappointing.I had no idea what to think when the credits rolled at the conclusion of my first viewing. Upon further review, I appreciate the white picket fence approach employed. Pitt and Jolie were not just big name castings, but inspired choices who drew upon their budding love for each other to build a solid cornerstone for the rest of the picture. It is never difficult to root for them. I tend to prefer action movies with more vicious feels; nevertheless, I am happy I saw ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" and will continue to enjoy more viewings in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Rarely hits the target.,"This romantic comedy/action pic starring Hollywood A-list sex symbols Brad 'Pretty Boy' Pitt and Angelina 'nice tits, WTF lips' Jolie has something for everyone, male or female... or so the studio must've thought when concocting their calculated 'sure-fire hit'. Shame then that they forgot to include decent laughs, neglected to bother whether the script made any sense, miscalculated the level of on-screen chemistry between the film's stars, and failed to generate any excitement until long after the audience had stopped caring.Coming across like James Cameron's Trues Lies crossed with Michael Douglas/Kathleen Turner's black comedy War of the Roses—only minus both of those films' style, wit and charismatic lead performances—Mr. and Mrs. Smith sees Pitt and Jolie as a bored married couple who, to their surprise, discover that each other is a hired assassin working for a rival agency. This conflict of interest initially pits the pair against each other, but with so much in common, the couple eventually rekindle their love and form a formidable alliance.Clearly, with such a set-up, the audience is intended to connect emotionally with the film's cold-hearted killers and find humour in their predicament, but Mr. & Mrs. Smith fails to pull off such a trick, the script lacking the sophistication and requisite dark humour that the subject matter demands.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I was entertained,"Well, what do you get if you put an incredibly good looking couple in a movie? None other than this fun filled thrill ride of a movie called Mr. & Mrs. Smith!!! At first I was quite sceptical about this movie because I had a preconceived notion that it was going to be a vanity project for both actors. But what was I in for a surprise: this movie delivered on all levels and then some. Explosions, guns,car chases, punches, punchlines and, of course, Angie and Brad getting it on (although very mild)! The only peeve was the underutilisation of Vince Vaughn. He could have been in more scenes with more things to do instead of just having him talk your ears off. If you're not a fan of action/comedy then don't watch this. Go see some drama. However, if you enjoy this genre, sit back, relax and enjoy the ride!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Angelina Jolie for Comic Actress of the Year!,"Mr. and Mrs. Smith are just an ordinary couple, living in an ordinary town and in an ordinary house and leading ordinary lives. Or so the audience is lead to believe. But the audience knows better, or at least they should know better. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are not paid big bucks to play just anybody, and the movie soon proves this to be the case. Once Pitts's and Jolie's covers are blown, sparks fly, things blow up, and the one-liners spew forth at a rate almost equal to that of the speed of sound. What this movie proves is that Angelina Jolie is now the funniest comic actress since Sandra Bullock. In fact, if someone decided to make an updated version of ""I Love Lucy,"" I would definitely cast Ms. Jolie in the role of Lucy Ricardo. There is no question that she would do credit to such a role. Andy Garcia could play Ricky Ricardo, and Dom De Louise and Cathy Bates could play Fred and Ethel Mertz. But enough of this digressing. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is good entertainment, and Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt work well together, and for these reasons alone the movie is worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Light fun for a summer's eve, but I've seen it before.","Everyone compares ""Mr. and Mrs' Smith"" to ""The War of the Roses"", but I think it also has a lot in common with the 1985 film ""Prizzi's Honor"" which is about two Mafia killers (Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner--again) who fall in love and then find out they are assigned to kill each other.""Mr. & Mrs."" has a lot of humor and a lot of action. Unfortunately, there are many times where the dialog is hard to hear because the characters are whispering or the background noise level is very high (such as in the highway chase scene).There is also the fact that the movie comes to an end without a resolution to the main driver of the second half of the film.

Spice up your marriage,"This is your typical action movie with a bit of a twist. The plot involves a married couple who has been together for 6 years, as the relationship begins to go stale, woops.. they are both sent to kill each other. This can certainly spice up their lives..Mr. & Mrs. Smith puts an interesting spin on a usual action flick, but with all of the expectations & previews prior to the opening, I couldn't help but leave saying that was pretty good, not great.

It started fast whit some funny quotes. The action is not something we haven't already seen but it's directed in a funny way ( the car chase scene is very funny ) I usually don't like Brad Pitt but this time he was great, Jolie was beautiful and great as always. Their performance is great while not a lot of other characters got the attention.But those two are good enough to really keep you watching the film until the end.So i would say this is a great summer blockbuster, and it's good way to start the summer on a very high note.10/10 because i simply love it and can't wait to see it again",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Great plot, nice effects, very good acting. Loads of tension and excitement. Scenes where you laugh and scenes that make you want to cry.Actors. The chemistry between Brad Pitt (Mr. Smith) and Angelina Jolie (Mrs. Smith) is unbelievable. They fight, they dance, they talk in a way only really good actors or people in love can.

worst movie ever,I have only ever stopped watching two films. 1) Godzilla 2) Mr & Mrs Smith Absolutely shocking waste of time. Characters leave you feeling cold. Absolutely no story line. You stick with it and it just gets worse. On a more serious note it also glamorises domestic violence and wife beating. The two characters are often seen kneeling over each continually pummelling each others faces in a la the now banned ultimate fighting. Most human beings don't find that entertaining only knuckle heads and white trash - surely people who don't go to the cinema because they cant afford it. Publicity surrounding brad and Angelina's off screen romance is the only thing that carried this film. American rubbish. What happened Doug??!!,1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Nutshell Review: Mr and Mrs Smith,"Nevermind the tabloids, this show is a must watch to see exactly how sizzling the chemistry is between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. And it's no surprise that Hollywood's sexiest couple wraps the entire show in their sensuality.Brad Pitt is John Smith (a very generic name which was the highlight of a joke), construction foreman in the day, top killer at the side. Angelina Jolie is Jane Smith (again very generic), IT company CEO as a front, top assassin extraodinaire. Mr and Mrs Smith, living in suburbia New York, to everyone, a perfect marriage (and in my opinion, they do look good together)This film takes a very successful and insightful look into relationships, courtship and marriage, albeit with a sprinkle of well timed humour. It's a joy to watch them showcase typical marriage problems (the film starts off with things not going too well after a very successful courtship) like the lack of communication, the petty arguments, the little deceitful secrets, and always, always accidents which somehow come across as deliberate actions. And when things get out of hand, who do they run off to for solace? Why, their best buddies of course! It's these situations that you can connect to in real life, that sets this show apart from your usual action flick.They argue, they fight, especially when they find out that they work for rival assassin companies. From guns to knives to fist fights, the action is top class - always something different, always surprises around the corner. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, and each time Jolie hits the roof, she's never short of bringing down the house!Vince Vaughn shines as Pitt's sidekick Eddie, with his off the cuff remarks. And the film takes a subtle dig at one of Vince's earlier film Psycho, with his character living in solitude with his mom, whom we never see on screen. Fans of the TV Series OC will probably celebrate at Adam Brody's short appearance.Before you groan at the action pieces (too many guns, too many chases, etc), let me assure you it's refreshing - not only you get to see the very attractive leads in action (yes, Jolie did the leap-off-the-building stunt herself), but the marital / relationship bickering thrown in for good measure worked buckets. It is with this ingredient (heck, I'm getting all homely now) that makes the highway chase here a tad more entertaining than the one in The Matrix Reloaded. And the finale shootout will make even John Woo extremely proud - sweet poetry in motion.Ah, and the trailers don't give away everything (or anything for that matter), so it's a joy to watch when your thoughts get pulled from under (say, didn't the trailer suggest this, or was it that?) Never mind the trailer, watch this movie for what it is - rip roaring action, identifiable life experiences, and the sexy Angelina Jolie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great fun!,"Summer is finally upon us it seems as blockbuster season is now kicking in. We have had Star Wars and now it's the Brad and Angelina movie. The name of the film escapes me, because this has been referred to as ""That film."" by so many media resources, in and out of the movie industry. The plot, such as it is borrows heavily from True Lies and War Of The Roses and has a bizarre melding of the two. What it does though is include the fun factor of those two excellent pieces of Saturday night fodder. Brad and Angie play a husband and wife, who lead double lives. By day a now bored married couple and at night gallivanting off in varied locations scrubbing out scum for their respective agencies. When out on conflicting missions they find out that the other is in fact also an assassin. Furthermore they are under instruction to kill each other. Now both Mrs and Mr have to face up to the question; do they love the other? Of course the end up trying to kill each other but when they get down to it they realise they love each other, blah-blahdy-blah! Then of course they team up against their organisations who have sold them out. This is essentially an excuse for lots of action and witty banter, and for a Sunday evening after hard days work, it's exactly the sort of undemanding brainless action flick you need. While other action blockbusters can tend to feel soulless and churned out by the Hollywood machine, this film has some class to it, thanks to indie director Doug Liman, who doesn't make this film too Hollywood. It's a fun movie, pure and simple.As for the cast, well Brad and Angie have great chemistry and that also makes this a grade-up from the usual gun fests. Like Arn and Jamie Lee or Michael and Kathleen, they spark well off each other. Pitt proves himself a capable action man while keeping his everyman likability. Vince Vaughn also pops up in a funny bit part as Pitt's buddy and business associate in the whacking game. The rest of the cast have very little to do to be honest, it's essentially a three man show, and one of that three man team is a woman, the rather gorgeous Angelina Jolie. MY GOD! Jolie is a real walking advertisement for hand cream for the hairy handed adolescent in all of us. She is astonishing beautiful, and I'll tell you what else, she could kick Brad Pitt's butt from here to Bangkok with her hands behind her back, she is an ass kicking machine. This is Angelina's movie, she's a dynamo, a sex goddess, as well as being as good actress of course.Elsewhere John Powell provides a simple and effective score while the film looks great too. The film is also full to the brim with cracking action. You have gun fights, fist fights, car chase and masses of fiery explosions, the film is pure eye candy on every level. The audience can gorge themselves on carnage while in the separate demographics, the ladies have Pitt to drool over while us guys can sit there transfixed by Jolie. Angelina kept my gaze locked upon her. God knows what Pitt was doing while the two shared the shot because I would have been concentrating on Jolie.All in all this is a good fun movie, simple, yet exciting. ***1/2",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"I'll have a martini, please","""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" expresses a degree of ""realism"" that's been lacking in most Hollywood movies in the last 10, 15 years or so. When I mean that what's taking place on the screen is real, I mean we get a feeling that the chemistry between stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is genuine. Well, if the rumors are true, then the chemistry is indeed, ""real.""Much has been made in the tabloids in recent months over Brad Pitt's failed marriage to his wife, actress Jennifer Aniston. The rumor mill has centered on the possibility that Pitt's on-screen antics with co-star Jolie were a lot more than just skillful acting. As the rumor mill would have it, things do seem to look the way the media is portraying the stars of this film.Does this hype it up? Sure. Will it work? Definitely. Will it be a box office smash this weekend? Well, let's just see on Monday. While those who read the gossip pages in US Weekly or The National Inquirer will certainly get their just desserts, others who haven't been bombarded by those star-studded tabloid rags may find a surprising level of ingenuity in ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith.""Pitt and Jolie star as John and Jane Smith, a happy suburban couple who literally save each other's necks in Bogota, when the military there is on a manhunt for lone tourists over an apparent assassination attempt on an important political figure. They introduce themselves to each other, go dancing, and spend the night in one another's arms before they realize that they're going to be a lot more than just friends.Much to the dismay of John's friend Eddie (Vince Vaughn), who has more than a slight distrust of women and is living with his mother (the only woman he feels he can trust), they get married. Eddie is another one of those faithful movie buddies, who works with John and Vaughn's role here is a little more than a retread of the character he played in ""Swingers"" (1996).Five or six years later, they're living in suburbia, where John has taken up a job as a construction worker, while Jane is a happy-go-lucky housewife, always fixing a beautiful dinner for her husband - who has perfect timing - just as he walks in the door from a hard day's work; they eat dinner, right on the money, at 7:00 p.m.What neither individual is aware of, however, is that they are both highly trained assassins. When they are simultaneously dispatched by their respective handlers to take out a target, this poses a serious problem for the two lovebirds, as they both scramble to find the identity of the rival would-be assailant.The action is paralleled by John and Jane's attendance of marriage counseling and therapy; an off-screen personality provides them with questions to which they answer, either jokingly or honestly. Well, if you found out that your lover is living a secret life as a hired killer, would you attempt to save your marriage? I honestly can't say.The way that this is played out eventually culminates to what is arguably the funniest and most amusing scene in the movie, where Jane cooks John a wonderful dinner. John already has a hunch of Jane's intentions, and it's exciting to see them pick up knives, check food for poisons, test each other, and otherwise try to outdo the rival spouse who may or may not be aware that the other is a hired assassin out for their blood.""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is helmed by Doug Liman, the hip director behind the already mentioned ""Swingers,"" which also co-starred Vince Vaughn, ""Go"" (1999), and attempted mainstream capability with ""The Bourne Identity"" (2002). Here, Liman exercises the comic timing and hip directorial flamboyance he perfected in both of his hit indie flicks.The stars, Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith, have a chemistry that easily surpasses an otherwise ludicrous plot, which is also the film's biggest weakness. Like any average film, it only serves the purpose of providing big set-pieces, that are somehow or another balanced by the stars' attempts at sorting out the complicated details of a crap marriage. Also, how often do we have films where real-life couples come together on the screen, and the film either flops or is a magnificent triumph at the box office? The release of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" couldn't have come at a better time for either star, as the rumor mill is simply going bonkers over both of their personal lives.""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" works best as a screwball satire of idyllic suburban life, not an action flick. Both Pitt and Jolie aren't strangers to action (Pitt's been in ""True Romance"" and ""Spy Game"" - both directed by Tony Scott; Jolie starred as Lara Croft in both ""Tomb Raider"" films). They fill out their action scenes all right, but aren't terrible or full of themselves in their skills.Well, the tabloids are sure to have a ball with this one, if you haven't already seen the front page stories of their rags. It's a decent effort, if not entirely memorable one. But the tabloids will definitely be this one's biggest ally in helping to rake in the cash over the weekend.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Violence,"A tight and nicely pitched bit of boom bang-a-bang bang all the time with Brad Pitt and the impossibly eye catching Angelina Jolie as the couple drowning in the sort of domestic hell that Tyler Durden would have incinerated. What the couple don't know is that they're both assassins but someone else does find out and dispatches them to kill each other. That's it really. They find out, they fight, they exchange a few bitchy comments and destroy the matrimonial lair. Liman though is no slouch in the action department as he proved in the Bourne Identity and the couple bust each other up with enough destructive zeal to stop you getting bored, even if you're never exactly brimming with excitement. It's not much of comedy but there are a few mouth raising asides and Vince Vaughn is good value was Pitt's anxious friend and associate. A perfectly diverting two hours when all is said and done, sentiment free and worth seeing for Jolie's curves, the house is on fire moment and Seth from the O.C looking at an aggressive looking Pitt, wearing a fight club t-shirt, tied to a chair. Actually he didn't half look like Tyler did in the scene where Ed Norton was tied to that chair. Come to think of it, the Smith's shrine to unrestrained capitalism did go up in a firey ball of fury.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
VERY disappointed!!,"I just read another review and was very surprised that the comment was so positive. I am a huge Jolie and Pitt fan and was looking forward to this movie from the looks of the trailers. First of all, there was no chemistry between Pitt and Jolie (hopefully Brad didn't leave Jenn for Angelina). Second, the movie was mostly boring and almost a comedy; just very disappointing. If you really want to see this movie, wait until it comes out on video, don't waste your 8-10.00. In this movie, the very beautiful Jolie does great acting but it just doesn't make the cut. It doesn't make a difference. The storyline itself is just pretty lame (if you can even call it a storyline).",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
V. entertaining  great chemistry between the leads; funny one-liners; best when it tends more toward comedy than action,"I went into this movie expecting to be entertained, and I was  very much so. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" works very well because of the amazing chemistry between the two leads, the ridiculously good-looking Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The film opens with John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith in marriage counseling, and apparently, the magic has gone out of their marriage, probably because they can't speak truthfully about their jobs. They don't know that they are both skilled assassins, but when they are hired to do a hit on each other, the truth unravels. The plot is rather brainless, but I realized about ten minutes into the movie that I really didn't care.The first part of the film is more enjoyable and successful than the second part, mainly because it's fun to watch the Smiths not realize the truth about each other and then dance on eggshells around each other when they think they know the truth. The dialogue is witty, and filled with great one-liners and double entendres. Take, for example, when John and Jane return home for dinner after trying to kill each other, and John says, in response to Jane's question of why he has returned early from his so-called business trip, ""I missed you."" She replies, matter-of-factly, ""I missed you, too."" The movie is often very funny, although most laughs come from when they're doing generic couple stuff (like seeing a counselor, eating dinner at home, brushing their teeth, etc.).""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" relies mostly on the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie, and they have that in spades. The sex appeal literally explodes off the screen, and I wish the film spent more time laboring over the couple-stuff they do and not so much the explosions and action. Jolie has never looked better or more hypnotically beautiful than in this movie, and it's pretty obvious why Pitt's character falls for her almost instantly. I also thought that Jolie was great at making her Jane Smith character a real person; she brings a quiet poignancy to the role. As John Smith, Pitt is wickedly funny and excellent. He gets all the best lines. In the hands of a lesser actor, his lines would sometimes seem corny, but Pitt makes his character believable and extremely likable. The supporting characters (played by Adam Brody, Kerry Washington, and Vince Vaughn) seem a bit wasted, but this is, after all, the Brad and Angelina show.My main problem with the film is the excessive (and often plodding) action scenes. While it is fun to watch Pitt and Jolie look sexy while doing cool stunts, it gets tiring pretty quickly. This is the primary reason that the last thirty minutes or so of the film aren't as witty or entertaining as the earlier moments in the film. I think the movie could have been improved if there were less physical explosions and mindless action and more of the explosive chemistry in the quieter scenes between Pitt and Jolie.Despite its flaws, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a wonderful way to spend two hours at the theatre. I plan on seeing in again at the theatres. Not a movie for anyone demanding a real plot or serious depth, but a must-see for everyone else! 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Put this movie into the correct genre before you watch!,"This movie is pretty much a light comedy with heavy action.I'm seeing a lot of comments on this movie that indicate folks either loved it or hated it... Me - I'm realistically a little above the middle :)People who were expecting to see Brad and Angeline knock out some sort of intellectual thriller were vastly disappointed - and you should be.People who set their minds on glide (some do not have to make this setting), were very happy with it. This movie is not ""da bomb"", but I think it was entertaining.Good: There is fairly good chemistry with Brad and Angelina. The playful banter between the two was fun. Enough excitement and plot deception to keep you watching.Bad: At the end, there were too many over-the-top action sequences (the mini-van, the concrete shack, etc...). This pretty much follows mainstream action movies being pumped out by the film industry these days - ""build the action up to an unrealistic climax, trump the last action flick that was just put out"" *sigh*Some pretty cheesy lines were given during highly intense moments. I found them to be somewhat annoying; others, though, may find these funny.But... since I pretty much know that over-the-top is the case for 99% of action movies these days, and this was handled in a fairly humorous way, I found it enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Could have been a contender,"As the movie opened I found myself intrigued by the two characters sitting in front of an analyst trying to sort out their marriage problems. But soon after that I realized this sophisticated premise would soon leave way to same, already seen big action movie. When the main characters find out about each other's hidden life they're way into their marriage, and I found it incredible that it took such a long time to realize only because they were placed one against the other to mutually eliminate. It would have been fun to have a closer look to their early marriage years, with the various ups and downs and an intimate look at how their violent jobs started setting the couple apart - and only then turn the story into an action movie. There doesn't seem to be a way for U.S. producers to tell a story in a more innovative way, and given the incredible screen presence of Pitt and Jolie it would have been a wonderful acting opportunity as well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great film!,"This film was exceptionally well done, and everything was perfect except for the ending. All of the elements that make a big time Hollywood hit were present.

And that pissed me off because this film was awesome. Despite the poopy ending we needed a sequel with Vince Vaughn and Kerry Washington.

enjoyable,"Major gaping plot holes aside, it's been a long while since I enjoyed myself so much at the cinema.

Not that he's in danger of winning an Oscar anytime soon, but he's not just another pretty face anymore. He had a lot of nice moments, so did Jolie, but I had a hard time accepting her as a character in this film. Can't put my finger on why, though.As well, I felt a little disappointed when I walked out of the theater saying ""geez, a film I actually don't feel I wasted money on"".Where have all the good films gone? Is there any hope that the ratio of 10 bad films to every good one ever going to rectify itself? Is it my imagination or has recent cinema gone extremely down hill?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Action/romance Dream Team,"Maybe I'll look stupid for saying this, but I adore this movie. Angelina from the time when I couldn't decide if she was a better actress or hotter chick, and Bred, who is one of the best actors in his generation. Angelina went to hell and back these days and Brad is cast into shadows by a new generation of even better looking good actors, but for me, this movie remains one of the dearest ""love"" stories Hollywood gave us.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Crap,"Sorry to say this if people actually like Angelina Jolie. But i have to say she is one if the worst actresses. The only film i think she is a good actress in is girl interrupted. And i don't know why people find her attractive. This film is very boring and just pointless. watching Brad Pitt and Angelina on this movie is painful, they have no chemistry at all. It appears as if the main reason people went to see this film film was the fact that Brad and Angelina were dating each other rather than the movie itself as they was suppose to be having an affair while they were filming this, which i found sad. As they said they didn't i believe they did and the only reason why the couple said they were just friends was because they didn't want to spoil they reputation. in my option they movie was a waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Bogota is not a jungle,"I loved the movie, probably i will buy the DVD when it comes to Colombia, but there's one thing i didn't like at all. I don't know what is it with the producers or directors or whoever fault it is, to show south American countries mainly their capital cities (probably excluding Argentina and Brazil) as if they were located in the jungle, and as if the houses built here were huts. I've lived 23 years in Bogota, and believe me this city has nothing to envy the big cities around the world. I was proud to see my country exposed in a Hollywood movie, but then i was extremely disappointed when the city (Bogota) came to frame. Except for that detail i loved the movie and i think i can't imagine other two actors being John and Jane Smith, but Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
As Bad as It Gets,"Since I saw this for free (borrowed DVD) I shouldn't gripe. But this was a pathetic a piece of ""entertainment"" as I could imagine.When I was looking at the listing on the IMDb I found what went wrong. The screenplay went through over 50 drafts and a mob of screenwriters. Under better circumstances the project would have been put out of its misery and a new project found.Doug Liman used to be a director. Watch GO! if you don't believe me. But with THE BOURNE IDENTITY and this he's gone to the dark side of the force. Now he's making assembley line prefabs. Sad.There was one surprise in the movie. Seeing Vince Vaughn working in a piece of crap like this. Shame on you, Vince. You should know better. Brad and Angelina are self absorbed creatures of publicity who together have (almost) the intelligence of a clam. Vince is way too smart for this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Huge offensive geography mistake,"I think it's really disrespectful and even kind of racist the way the people responsible of the south American scene showed the city of Bogota at the beginning of the movie. I'm not even Colombian and still i feel so offended by it, because as Latin I'm frustrated they keep trying to show us as a group of natives living in warm towns. Not all places in Latin America are like that, in fact Bogota its not one of them. At least they should have look for a picture on line (it's not so hard) to see the city before shooting the scene and read a little bit about the weather, architecture and other important facts. This shows the lame concept that some people still have about us and their ignorance!!!!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Perfect popcorn movie,"The movie's mostly a romantic comedy with some action thrown in. Director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"") gives fresh direction to what could have been a run-of-the-mill flick.This movie is the perfect popcorn movie. Regardless of their relationship off-screen, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie do have chemistry in their roles as John and Jane Smith, a pair of assassins who are clueless about the true identity of their perspective spouse. Over the years, their relationship has gotten cold and distant, since they're not really allowed to share their lives with their partners. Doug Liman, as he did in The Bourne Identity, really knows how to direct action scenes; the fights are well-choreographed, as well. Of course, when they each find out the truth, it leads to a funny sequence where they're trying to take out the other. The film as a whole is quite funny, especially during the psychiatric visits that bookend the film. This is the first film in a while where I could just turn my brain off and enjoy the ride, which in my opinion, makes it a success.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Way too much hype surrounding this flick,"Even after all the hype of the Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie affair, if you still haven't seen Mr. & Mrs. Smith, it is now available on DVD.After meeting in a moment of chaos, John (Brad Pitt) and Jane (Angelina Jolie) rescue each other from certain death by pretending to be together. Shortly afterwards and without the support of their colleagues/friends, they decide to get married.They both believe the other has a normal, boring job, but little do they know they are assassins working for competing organizations.After being assigned the same hit, Benjamin Danz (Adam Brody), the target shifts and becomes each other.There are both positives and negatives to this movie. First of all, it is a flick both men and women could enjoy. There is a lot of action with violent shoot outs, but it also has a hidden love story in between.Second the acting is great. Jolie and Pitt played these parts very well. There is definite chemistry between the two in this movie (gee I wonder why.) Unfortunately, they alone could not pull this film together.Finally the last bit of entertainment is found in two words, Vince Vaughn. Eddie (Vaughn), John Smith's partner was a riot without even trying. He definitely adds to the likability of this movie and should have been given more air time.What was not so great about this film is the long running time of 120 minutes. There could have been a lot more editing to not make this movie drag on like it does.In addition, towards the end, there is just too much that is unbelievable. Really, is no one going to notice a swat team and bombs going off at their local home store? Overall, this movie would normally receive two out of four stars, but since it could be entertaining for both men and women and Vince Vaughn's character; it receives two and a half out of four stars.If you haven't already seen the completely over-hyped Mr. & Mrs. Smith, pick it up on DVD and ask a date to join you for some Saturday night movie action.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Style Over Substance,"Sometimes, a movie can have big stars, a huge budget, and spectacular action sequences, but without a solid story behind it, it all feels like an eye-catching package with little real substance. Mr. & Mrs. Smith blends action and comedy with a simple premise: a seemingly normal married couple is actually made up of two assassins working for rival agencies. The problem is that the film takes itself too seriously when it might have worked better with more irony and lightheartedness, making everything feel emptier than it should.The biggest draw is the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who carry the film with their charisma. The movie gives them room for playful glances, meticulously choreographed fights, and moments of romantic tension disguised as conflict. However, beyond them, the story is minimal, and character development is almost nonexistent. The action sequences are well-executed and fast-paced, but without a strong script to support them, they become pure visual spectacle and lose impact as the story progresses.It's not a boring movie, but it doesn't leave much of a mark either. If you take it as a showcase of high-speed chases and explosions, it can be entertaining, as long as you don't expect much more. However, the lack of a more developed story and the overly serious tone prevent it from fully working. In the end, it's a visually attractive product that, if not for its lead actors, would likely be forgotten.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An odd action romance comedy double feature,"In a way the film felt more like 2 films than one. While some might say this adds action, this to me felt more like a distraction as the action strips away at the plot, leaving much to be desired in terms of the relationship between the couple. Furthermore, this prevents it from having much rising action, making it a film that felt mostly like one continuous stream of eh.While there were a couple instances of good comedy, this was often hidden within so much bad comedy that it is hard to see.Still, not too bad a watch but neither is it special.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Two gorgeous people shooting at everyone in sight. What could be more fun?,"This movie is great fun. You have two beautiful people shooting at bad guys. All with a sense of humor. What could be more fun? Also, the choreography of the shooting sequences (one in particular) is stunning. If you are looking for an Academy Award winning drama, this is not it. If you like big budget blockbusters, however, this one is definitely worth it. Brad and Angelina both play well. They have great chemistry and are up to the task of playing uber-spies with as much believability as is possible given the difficult premise. There are some well-acted serious moments that are a bit of a surprise. I also appreciated the fact that although there is a lot of killing, it is not a gory movie. There is very little blood - other than that which is used as a fashion accessory on the two stars. In the end, it is a blast.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Jennifer Aniston hates this movie,Overall Mr and Mrs Smith is a funny and entertaining movie that I enjoyed watching and would recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it. I would have given the movie a 7 or 8 but I can't help but to feel sorry for poor Jennifer Aniston anytime I think of this movie. As we all know while filming Pitt and Jolie started their affair that would end with Pitt leaving Aniston and marrying Jolie. I know this has nothing to do with the plot or entertainment value of this film but it always reminds me of what happened to Aniston and how horrible it must have been to lose her husband to a more attractive woman.,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not worth the time . A mixed up script.,"This movie may be counting on publicity between the two main performers but there were quite a few people walking out of the theater where I saw a sneak, shaking their heads. May do well first week but word of mouth will doom this flick.Its confusing and unbelievable and most of the time very boring. The direction is only fair, but the actors are not following any direction it would appear. Best wait and see if its still holding up in second week before wasting your money. The picture started production in early 2004, then stopped production, and a completion bond company had to step in to make funds for the completion of the picture. this usually tells you that even with a eight month delay the actors do not seem to look exactly the same in each scene.Too bad as Pitt needs a hit and so does Angelina.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
who says a movie has to have a plot to be entertaining?,"Now I am sure there has to be at least a thousand people living middle class suburbia lives who are really high tech assassins. And with all of them out there, it stands to reason two of them might actually meet, fall in love, and continue to do what they do without ever telling the other. Not buying it? Me either, but who says a movie has to have a plot to be entertaining? Jurrasic Park pulled it off three times. I think the appeal here lies in pretty people (Bradjolina) and marriage counseling taken to the extreme. Vince Vaughn, a tremendous talent, provides the perfect foil for Brad, and adds tremendously to the film. Angelina's staff of beauties looks like something out of early Bond or In Like Flint, but they add to the artistic merit of the film (okay, they are great looking women worth looking at), and the special effects and photography is wonderful. PG-13 is about right, language is pretty restrained, so its the violence you have to watch out for. Not particularly collectible, but highly entertaining, especially if you and your spouse have been married for about five (or six) years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Awful action movie, bad casting","Mr and Mrs Smith is terrible because it is such a typical action movie, there is nothing new, it's the same boring blow-up everything kind of movie, don't get me wrong, i love action movies but i think that it is time to add something new!!!!! and I really don't see any chemistry between Angelina and brad.For once I would like to see an action movie that has a good script, this one in particular had an awful one, But the blame is not only for the writers it's the casting crew, what were they thinking when they thought of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt together, it's just too much! Too perfect!I think maybe someone like Penelope Cruz or Eva Longoria would have been so much better for this role.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Slick, Sexy and Funny","I have to admit that I enjoy a good action flick. Sometimes I simply don't want to be challenged. I want schlocky, escapist fun. Action movies are like pornos - the story and dialogue don't pretend to be great. We know they are there merely to advance you to the next action/sex sequence. I mean, that's why we bought the ticket, right? We can't expect anything better, or can we? Well, Mr & Mrs Smith proves that we should expect more. The opening title sequence alone had the audience cracking up. And in that moment, the filmmakers made us a promise: that this film would be slick, sexy and funny. Thankfully, it didn't disappoint. The well crafted dialogue transcends the genre and, with a great cast and fine direction, helps to create a product that's all class.Both Pitt and Jolie show that they're fine comedic actors. We've had a taste of Pitt's looniness in 12 Monkeys and charm in Oceans 11/12, but not this. Here the comedy is subtle, the characters are truly engaging and the rhythm is perfect. (It got me thinking just how much better the Italian Job remake could have been with Pitt as Charlie Croker, instead of Wahlberg) The chemistry between the 2 leads is undeniable and delicious, heightened only by what the tabloids tell us we should read into it. We buy them as a couple, we buy them getting counselling, we buy them squeezing triggers. Vince Vaughn also delivers a wonderful (if unusually restrained) performance as Pitt's partner/booking agent. The rest of the cast are kept at arm's length. Even the multitude of agents our heroes encounter remain hooded and faceless, leaving us no option but to soak up Brad and Angelina.Oh yeah - and the action's pretty great, too, especially in an inspired minivan sequence. Sure, we have to suspend our disbelief, but that gets checked when we enter the theater, right? This had all the goodness of an old Brit actioner, with Hollywood production values. I'd put it up there with Ronin and Renny Harlin's underrated, yet equally fulfilling The Long Kiss Goodnight.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fun feuding spouses spy film,"Mr and Mrs Smith is a fun energetic action movie that revolves around a married couple of 5 years. John and Jane Smith are really both spies but neither of them knows that the other is a spy, they both keep that part of their lives completely secret. I was happy with the casting of Brad Pitt as John and with Angelina Jolie as Jane. They had good on screen chemistry, both when it was supposed to be romantic and when it was them going at it trying to kill one another. It makes sense that the chemistry was so good once the news of affair broke. Poor Jennifer Aniston.... Back to the movie. The action scenes are very well done, they have everything you could ever ask for from an action film. The love scenes are well done too, well lit, and a mix between being hot and romantic. The writing accomplishes what the film wanted to accomplish. And in my opinion that's all you can really ask for. I mean sure the movie could've been better, and I've seen better more entertaining action films with romantic leads. But overall not every movie is gonna knock it out of the ballpark, and truth be told I didn't expect this one to do that. Since I didn't have really high expectations going in, I was overall pretty satisfied. 7/10 for Mr and Mrs Smith.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Guns, Guns And Only Sexy Guns","I went to this movie to clear my mind from my recently concluded exam, and I wasn't disappointed. The movie is not much of a thriller or a comedy, and it certainly doesn't boast the action sequences of action thrillers like Matrix, Rambo, etc....But its fun watching. The plot is funny, and Angelina Jolie is goddamn sexy(who said she's not???) and the guns.....If there's one reason you want to buy the DVD of this movie, its to loom at such great guns up close. It has all, starting from bazookas, to rocket launchers, Carbines to SMG's, Desert Eagles, Mags, everything.The story is simple, 2 hired killers, are husband and wife, neither knows about the other's true profession. By ""accident"" both of their agencies give them the same job, to eliminate a high security prisoner. They mess it up by getting in each other's ways. Their agencies gives them 48 hrs. to eliminate the person responsible for the slip. They come to learn that their spouse is the person involved. When they come face to face, they learn that they love each other too much to kill themselves, but 48 hrs are up and all hell breaks loose, the entire NYPD plus the SWAT are after them, they get themselves into a mess.....Thats where I think I will stop, at least you'll have to find out what actually *happened* in the end....The last action sequence was well shot though overall the camera action was poor...

Angie is HOT! Good Chemistry. Lousy Story,"I always anticipated the movie to be lousy, it thus exceeded my expectations. The movie was still bad, but not disastrous. Mrs. Smith -what can I say.... God probably created her to punish us men. She keeps getting more and more gorgeous in every movie.... and while her acting isn't too bad, she could just make better choice for movies. As far as her career goes, Mr & Mrs. Smith wasn't a bad choice for Angelina Jolie at all. Might not be the greatest hits, but she finally got paired opposite a well reputed actor and she'll need a few more such roles to hit off her career. Their chemistry was just brilliant! I gave it a 6/10. This is just for Jolie and the chemistry between the 2 leads. Vince Vaughn was funny again as he was in Be Cool, but he needs to take up more lead roles in serious/semi-serious movies. I agree he got over-looked earlier on in his career with Psycho, Return to Paradise and The Cell. He also paired up well with Jon Favreau for Swingers and Made, but the time has come to return to serious movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
There's Garbage and then there's Mr. And Mrs. Smith,"I don't typically enjoy big budget Hollywood films but after hearing that this film is about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie trying to kill each other, I thought it might be an entertaining offbeat popcorn flick. It just sucks. Essentially you have two alcoholic (watch closely, if you must watch at all) assassins who are married and work for these corporations killing lots of people. Neither one knows what the other one does. They're each assigned the same particular job and they ""spot"" each other and it's the rule that after being spotted one must kill the spotter. After trying to kill each, they fall in love again and must defeat a new enemy in order to survive. The film is just terrible. It has no charm and it's morally empty. I repeatedly found myself wishing that one of the thousands of bullets that Mr. And Mrs. Smith dodge would actually hit them and put an end to these white-bread murderers lives that I'm supposed to empathize with. Vince Vaughn's character is funny and the cinematography is nice but that doesn't even come close to saving this two hour turd.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Guns and marriage.,"Before seeing ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"" I'd never gone to a movie because of the actors who are in it. Movies are such a collaborative effort that it's usually very difficult to say it's good or bad because of an actor. This movie is a little simpler. I like the work of director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity""), but this movies greatest strength is undoubtedly that the majority of screen time is given to images of two of the coolest, most beautiful people in the film industry.""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is an action movie, and it is a movie about John and Jane Smith's marriage. As an action movie, there is nothing particularly novel or interesting about it. If you like big explosions, and guns, and knives, and more guns, you will enjoy watching this movie. I don't particularly mind these things, but they were not nearly as interesting as the relationship between John and Jane. (Many people say it's actually the relationship between the actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, but I'm not going to go there.) The concept of the story is thought-provoking. A married couple discovers that they have each been leading a secret life that their partner knows nothing about. When they find out, it revolutionizes their relationship.The parts of the movie that focus on their marriage are the parts that I enjoyed watching. Not the scenes where they were in marital counseling, but the scenes in which momentous things are happening all around them, and suddenly they realize that their relationship is blossoming into something different. These scenes made me believe that they were John and Jane (rather than Brad and Angelina), and that the characters had a relationship that, fundamentally, was realistically human. This allowed me to identify with them.When I was watching this movie, my experience was marred by noise. Not people-in-the-theater noise, but the-volume-was-too-loud noise. Before you think I should shut up and call the theater about this, let me say this. I was sitting just 5 seats over from where I sat during ""Revenge of the Sith"" and although that movie was also uncomfortably loud, it didn't bother me. Here's why: in ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" the loud explosions, and over-long gun fights don't do very much to advance the interesting story of John and Jane's marriage. Instead, they show-case a dizzying array of weapons, and yet another boring scene of bad guys being killed while the good guys emerge from the fight virtually unscathed. If this were an artistic choice, and were anywhere near original, I might not complain. But I know it is pandering to the masses; that it is an effort to take more ticket money from those who have a thirst for stupid action and senseless killing.If you like Brad or Angelina, you will like this movie. If you don't like gun violence, you will likely be turned off. If you are married, you will identify with or laugh at what I think are the best parts of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Pointless,"This film falls into that category where you wonder if you're falling asleep every two or three minutes. It seems little else could explain why you cannot follow the plot or make sense of most of what's going on. Was there maybe a manual you should have read before watching?Relax. Your marbles are fine, and you aren't experiencing the early stages of narcolepsy either, but this film does have the capability to force normal people into a form of hypnotic sleep, much like driving on an empty motorway for ten hours without stopping. The intended plot is as useful for the film as a home-knitted woolly sock is in protecting the family car from the elements. It's one of those movies where, if you're a great fan of the lead actors, you'll drown yourself in their never-ending, cutesy tete-a-tetes and conclude it was a phenomenal film. If you're not, reach for the remote before the next onslaught of forcibly induced sleep.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Unreal but Cool,"if you want to get out from the cinema with a smile on your face Mr & Mrs Smith is the suitable film. Even if many scenes are very unreal and above all the ending is very ""American"", it's easy to get involved by the complicity between the 2 protagonists that is very funny and not banal. Great idea the visit to the analyst that opens and closes the film and makes people laugh at the beginning as at the ending of the movie. Maybe some scenes, as the one when the couple shoots one another in their house or the pursuit and the shoot-out in the commercial center, are too long. Cool the wink of Pitt to the public in the scene of the dance in the restaurant. The protagonists'performance was excellent. Pitt & Jolie are an ideal couple of spies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Good evenings entertainment with the shining coupling of two perfectly matched actors,"It's interesting that I saw this on opening night and have since forgotten about writing a review about it, for me that says a lot about a film. You could feel it fading as you left the cinema and even talking about it with friends twenty minutes later you found each other reminding yourself about scenes.For me that shows one of two things, the film was bad or it was pure entertainment which, although it can be enjoyable, just washes over you and lets you walk away without getting in your head and making a big impact. For Mr and Mrs Smith it was the latter.There's something that hits you about this film straight away in the opening scene, and it follows through the whole movie making it much more than it really is. The acting and chemistry between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. On screen they play off each other perfectly, and if you forget the movie and everything that's happening around them for the moment, you can be reminded of one of those great on screen couplings from the older days of Hollywood. Together they are classics. Really, I'm not selling this too high, the opening scene nails it in terms of performance, their timing and playing off of each other is perfect and brings forward the sharp, incisive comedy in the script. There were many a nervous laugh from couples in the audience, and the singles laughed much harder! That's what makes the film for me, with any two other actors I think the movie would have ridden an even keel and never made half the wave that this movie has.That aside, the premise of the movie in that the couple are both hit-persons, provides for a lot of set pieces and some excellent action. The interplay of a pair of warring hit-people reflects that of a badly married couple very well (not that I would know that!). The script is really strong, and gives some excellent dialogue to the leads. For me the beauty is in the detail here, not the big explosions. When John walks to his tool shed to check if his secret stash of money has been taken he's instantly upset that the tool shed has been rifled, the typical man's domain, except he never ever used it. It's these little moments of pettiness in an angry relationship that made me, and the audience laugh. Those and the superb counsellor scenes, perfect moments.The action is pretty cool in most parts, and the most excellent scene was the car chase. They've really tried to pull the camera back from the action a bit, something I wasn't really enjoying in a lot of Hollywood movies these days, and you get to see things that are actually happening. Plus the script writers haven't stopped at the dialogue, they've brought the sharp inventiveness into the arena of the set pieces as well, and there are a few good laughs to be had while the cars do battle from the action itself as well as the continuing married banter.A couple of things did stand out for me though, there seem to be a few huge cuts which were quite jarring. One is early on when you see for the first time John Smith on a job, and the camera seems to drop and hide behind a chair for most of the events. Then the second big one is when John and Jane go for glory after having a big fight, and just as they seem to be getting to the nitty gritty they suddenly collapse and you are left wondering if Brad just can't go for that long. To be honest that's a nice relief for us mere mortals with sixteen packs instead of six.Yet that's something I noticed throughout, bullets firing and hitting nothing more than walls and inanimate objects, which is fine for the fight scene between the couple, but during the rest of the movie it all seemed a little watered down for me. I'm not saying give me an R or 18 rating, I'm just looking for a little more of the real hit-person feel. There's also something along these lines that happens near the end that makes me think there was another ending but again it was chopped. Perhaps it was, perhaps it was another cut I felt just didn't work right.However, those niggles aside, it's a great evenings entertainment, and an enjoyable film. The script is sharp and insightful, with the wonderful chemistry on screen from Pitt and Jolie, who bring back the beauty of the old Hollywood on screen couplings for me. They have proved themselves in some key scenes in this movie, I'd like to see them take it to something meatier.I now hold a good hope for The Bourne Ultimatum from Doug Liman and for X-Men 3 from the writer Simon Kinberg.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Spy vs. Spy,"Couples to me are never really entertaining to me without friction. It's hard to say why, may'be it's because though friction both are able to exercise certain emotions and feelings they never can never express to other or themselves.This is an action film that I think is just a bit under the radar. OK not exactly but as time went on it has became a bit forgotten, which is a strange thing to say.I really love the concept which I think is colorful idea for an espionage story but also a romance story if you can believe that. Yeah I know it seems like a bit coincidental a one in a million shot that two superspys or assassins would meet and fall in love. But cmon this is a movie, and hey like all coincidences whose to say it can't happen.I really like the fact that this is an espionage/hit-man movie that is actually fun and personally their the kind I like because they make the intrigue move a lot faster and have more creative freedom, the only other film I can think of is ""Grose Point Blank"" another under the radar gem. I also like the fact that is one of those romance film to me that work because this is a could that are adults and are in a long time relationship.This film is pretty much almost a live action version of Mad Magazine's Spy vs. Spy which was simply about one trying to kill the other in different colorful clever ways, which is something both of them are doing throughout most of the film.I really like the dialog and the dry witty humor and there is a lot of it. Like in a neighborhood party sequence I can't help but chuckle a little as we see both are kinda board which just shows how the suburban existence doesn't' really suit both of them, their both out of place which is a feeling I can emphasize with it make no sense doing what you don't want to do. Or even my favorite which is the dinner between both John and Jane as it's really a game of psych out, trying to draw out But I just love the chemistry between both John and Jane, both of course played well by Brad Pitt and Angeline Jolie both one of my favorite actors, having both of them together was at the time something I never thought would happen (I said at the time)so this was kinda a dream come true for me.It's true we don't truly know both John and Jane fully, but that's the point. Both are spys/assassins after all, hence their first names. But I also think that's what makes both their characters all the more interesting, knowing too much about a character to me makes the well of interest run dry. The reason both are on the rocks are the fact that both haven't been 100% honest with one another, simple misunderstandings, but also that they've forgotten those feelings from the past.It's kinda funny and suspenseful as we see both are just clashing once the cat is out of the bag on who they both really are. You could say in a way it's a blackly humorous metaphor on how couples work out their problems with one another (well sort of); both John and Jane really take it to the next level in this film. But despite the conflict there feelings for each other are reigniting making both their feelings and the conflict even more hotter. Despite how hard both are fighting they don't hate each other, heck in each snafu they devised after another on each other they couldn't kill each other that should say something to both of them.And both we can see are the same, I like how we see a parallel contrast between them as we get a glimpse at both their secret agencies which in a way are sort of two schools of espionage. John's is pretty much more low key sort of looks like an old detective agency like you'd see in the noirs or the old spy novels, while Jane's is more high tech and up to date like CTU in the TV show ""24"". It's also kinda funny how Jane's agency consists only of women but no men which is kinda strange but also a homage joke to the TV show ""Charlies Angels"" they also have a unseen boss whom is only a voice on a phone (cameo voiced by Keith David whom is another favorite actor of mine). But this also makes the conflict sort of a clash of the sexes and two schools of espionage action.The action sequences I think are great and memorable. From the fight at some Wal-Mart like store which is one of my favorite battles, I always love battles that take place in those areas because their colorful, have all kinds of places to hide but also any items you need.However the most memorable battle and to me personally is one of my favorite one on one battles is of course seeing both Jane and John shoot it out and duke it out in their own home. I really like how the gunfight and even the fistfight is choreographed in that sequence because it takes place in a condensed space, though it doesn't look too fancily choreography which makes it almost a bit realistic mainly the fist fight if you can believe that. It's also a bit suspenseful because it really feels like a 50 50 battle it could be anyones game.It is said friction is what creates fire. And these two have made a forest fire.Rating: 3 and a half stars",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fantastic Allegory of Marriage,"Not many of us would have a relationship as exciting as Mr and Mrs Smiths', but all the little arguments, desire, and resentments on screen or very relatable. It is the dynamics of a marriage materialised as the battle the two assassin couple undertake in the 2-hour runtime. How will they survive each other?The opening scene sets the dynamic. A couple therapy session with hints of tension.This film is also Doug Liman at his best - pumped full with action and comedic moments... and absolutely made iconic with the two leads - Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.Movies often start and end with no real message or purpose told. Mr and Mrs Smith as an allegory of marriage makes for a fun and delicious ride.7-8/10. Highly rewatchable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Precisely the movie that made me got onto imdb. :),"That's how good this movie is! Intelligence. Wit. Looks. And, jam that into two hot, sizzling actors with great chemistry. I don't think any other couple in Hollywood--or any other industry for that matter... can beat this two. Of course, the movie had to bring them together. It was quite obvious from the scenes. They weren't just acting, but rather living it. And, i absolutely adored that.Can't wait to purchase it and add it to my collection. :)Oh, my favourite line: ""Honey, are you still alive?""",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Entertainment with a few spills.,"Mr. & Mrs. Smith.When I sat ready to watch this, my first thought was to continue with an open mind. As it is, when watching an action adventure film, you must slide into that state of mind. Taking a film like this seriously would only result in a travesty. In my opinion if the makers, writers and producers intended to make a family feature which you could sit through with a smile they succeeded.First of all i did enjoy the cast. Each character was believable as who they were meant to be. I know that sounds strange placing Pitt and Jolie as agents; but it worked for entertainment purposes. Their was chemistry between them, and it seemed they enjoyed being on screen together. And that always helps between two leading stars.Some scenes may have pushed it a little far. For example when they are fighting, it spirals a little out of control but still maintains the fun element with going too far. The action scenes are nice and balanced, and in the end it becomes what it was meant to be; An action film, which offers excitement, thrills, and a rich plot to keep an audience entertained for a little under two hours.All in all, a fun film that kept me occupied.78/100",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Decent movie but oh so tiresome,"I loved the action and all of the gadgets. I do like Angelina Jolie because she always plays a strong woman and that was why my boyfriend and I paid to see the movie this past Sunday, 7/17. However, for the first time in my entire 36 years of living and breathing on this planet, I almost fell asleep during the last 20 minutes or so of this movie and my boyfriend DID fall asleep. The only saving grace is that we saw it at the matinée price of $5.50 each but even that was far too much to pay to see this movie. I don't care one whit about Brad Pitt but I do like Angelina Jolie and I think that both actors did the best they could with what they had to deal with but this movie is just tiresome. Good premise but it falters at the end, BIG TIME!!!! I'm shocked that the director, producers, writer, etc.....the bigwigs.....didn't see the slowdown during the last 20 minutes or so. Don't want to spoil anything so I'll say this. Believe me, I'm not one to fall asleep easily. I have to have complete silence and darkness but yet, I damned near fell asleep during that part of the movie!! I forced myself to stay awake because my boyfriend was already asleep and he snores. There were about 30 people in the theater and I forced myself to stay awake so that I could shake my boyfriend in case he snored too loudly. I didn't want his snoring to disturb others.Bad movie. Loved the gadgets, cars, Angelina Jolie but dang! I've never had to fight so hard to stay awake in a movie theater. Color me shocked!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Not as good as I was expecting, but passable.","I thought the idea of Mr & Mrs Smith was fantastic, the two most sexiest people on the planet, together, kicking butt in a spy action film. However, when I saw it, I was disappointed. I'll start off with the good things, then move onto the bad things and then wrap up with a conclusion.Good things: - The chemistry between Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie is red hot, they really did do a great job. - The mix of humour and action is superb and reminded me of one of my favourite action films - True Lies.Bad things: - The action, although entertaining, contains a lot of unnecessary violence towards innocent by-standers - to which I don't particularly like. - It ends with the usual climax, however this time the action dissolving into a B-Movie where the bad guys seem to hit everything but their targets.Overall I got the impression that this film simply was trying too hard to be the next True Lies. It had good action, great comedy and two fantastic stars - but thats it. I ended up walking away from this film thinking ""was that it?"" when usually i like to discuss it with family or friends.It's recommended to rent for a Saturday night in, not recommended for a DVD collection or serious viewing.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
There's some well staged action scenes despite the comedy is flat,"(2005) Mr. & Mrs. Smith
ACTION COMEDYThe comedy falls flat as well as it's abysmal story line about a married couple, John (Brad Pitt) and Jane (Angela Jolie) Smith or as the movie is called ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" who don't know that the person other persons/he are married to are really hired assassins! Things get complicated when their next hit is on each another! All I can say is that a movie directed by Doug Liman (Bourne Identity) have provided some well choreographed and staged action sequences (except for some of the fighting) which are charismatic to look at!

Mediocre film pulled up out of the doldrums by chemistry of Pitt and Jolie,"I am not a fan of either Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie. However, since this film got such good reviews, I decided to give it a chance. I found that the chemistry between the two leads made up for a multitude of sins, including numerous plot holes and some ridiculous situations. I did enjoy myself, and that's what movies are all about, isn't it? I will say that I found the violence to be excessive and a little monotonous. This could have been trimmed a bit (to maybe 100 minutes or so) and not have lost anything. I did enjoy the scene where the two leads stepped into the elevator (in the middle of the night) and ""Girl from Ipanema"" was playing...LOL!! There are several other little jokes like this in the film.) This is a great summer movie...not much substance, just some fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Enjoyable Ride.  Interesting metaphors,"I quite enjoyed this movie. ^_^ Generally the plot involves a married couple, played by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who both happen to have secret jobs as professional assassins on the side without each other knowing (in fact, they each work for each other's rival companies). When they find out they've been deceiving each other, their loyalties are tested, and bunch of stuff blows up as they proceed to kill each other.In a way, it's an interesting, symbolic way of portraying the love/hate tumultuous aspects of marriage relationships. Eventually, they will have to work out their differences and go after a common enemy (or will they?), which is also, by the way, the same plot-line of John Woo's movie The Killer (which had two mortal enemies, cop and hit-man, with a common goal). There's definitely very good chemistry between the attractive leads (Jolie and Pitt) and the way they play off each other (as ridiculous it may be) is playful and endearing. While there are plenty romantic elements, ultimately, it's a movie for action fans, much like True Lies (which also played with domestic humor vs. spy action flick) and there are certainly multiple aspects from movies like War of the Roses (dark humor about marriage gone awry) and John Woo-influenced action spectacles. Doug Liman (who directed Bourne Identity) does a great job of portraying the characters with style, as well as beautifully shot action scenes (complete with an obvious John Woo's ""The Killer"" homage/inside-joke near the end of the movie, with the couple, now reunited, storming their way out in visceral, explosive form). Yes, it's ironic and ultimately, entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Action Photography was Jerky!,"The action photography was horrible! If you like watching the camera bounce all over the screen during the action sequences then you'll love this movie. When are the directors going to stop handing over the camera to their 8 year old kid's to shoot the action sequences anymore. It's like they do not want us to actually see whats going on during these scenes. It makes me dizzy to try and watch them. I don't know if it was just me, but I could not make out a lot of what Pitt was saying either. Another thing, call me old fashioned, but I like it when the guy saves the girl. I really don't think she could have held her own in a fist fight against Pitt.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Excellent commentary on married life,"I just watched Mr and Mrs Smith with my husband and we both found it to be a fun and action filled film worth seeing, but more importantly worth seeing together. We were obviously both happy to go and see the film for the big name and obviously attractive stars, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. We figured we would both have something to look at and to boot there would likely be some romance and a lot of action as well to feed both our appetites. We were right on this count but we weren't expecting the message underneath the obvious premise of the story. While everyone knows this is a story about two assassins who are married to each other and don't know the other is in the same business. One begins by thinking, ""Come on, how could you not know, this is unbelievable!"" and a lot of the scenes are quite unbelievable in the way the two always come out on top in every situation. But as you sit there watching the movie as a person in a marriage you begin to realize that this movie is not just about two assassins but it is about marriage. It is about marriage in its extremes of feeling and extremes of fighting not just with each other but against the whole world. It is about how to work things out and how extreme it can become as you do so. With that in mind, we thought it was an excellent film that really hit the nail on the head and it left us going home hand in hand ready to beat down another day in our own marriage. Well done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
How Ignorant Can Hollywood ?,"Oh my God, yes Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are Beautifiul and they try to be funny, but who told the people in this movie that Bogota was an awful and dirty town and that we Colombians have that horrible accent and music!!! Starting that Bogota has a cold climate and is situated on the Andean mountains,is a city of more or less 9 million habitants, Its the Capital of Colombia and is one of the most cultural Latin American cities, its so sad to notice the lack of respect for a entire country and a culture, because in this movie they are making stupid stereotypes of Latin people!!!Please... the people that know Bogota and Colombia know that the things that are portrayed in this movie are far very far from reality!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
What can I say I love Angelina Jolie,"This is a film you can sit and watch and not have to worry to much about the plot, although it is very cleverly done to be honest. It is quite retro in it's style at the beginning of the film with the use of film footage and titling between with almost a fade effect. (well I know what I mean) The musical score helps to, carrying you through the film with pace and emotion... its very powerful just like the characters within the film. For the first time I thought Brad Pitt suited his role, but then who wouldn't enjoy being next to Angelina?? I also like the way the film focuses around marriage, it can be a battle ground, yet true love conquers all, and together they were stronger than apart. Its hard to write a comment without giving away too much of the film. One thing I do find frustrating is that at a certain stage in the film it was quite obviously cut... so it wasn't as seamless as it could have been. (watch it and see if you can see what I mean) Even if you just go to see it for Angelina or Brad... you should because you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"entertaining, but nothing more...","If you're in the mood to watch two really good looking actors on screen, duke it out, in a funny way, with some really funny lines, and light humor, than check this movie out. However, if you're looking for something more clever, you're not going to find it here.This is a step up from a light romantic comedy, and definitely nothing more. You won't find a 'True Lies' or a 'The Mexican'. Nothing more than straight, mindless entertainment. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, although worked well together, there wasn't much chemistry between the two of them, which some might find ironic since they did end up having an affair together behind the scenes of shooting this production (no pun intended.). After six years of marriage in the movie, their relationship seemed like they'd been dating for less than a year. They didn't seem very comfortable with each other, and that made for a bad connection between the two of them.I will admit though, I was impressed with the cinematography, the wardrobe, locations, and direction. The whole movie was enjoyable to watch, but nothing more again, than something easy to kick back with where you really don't have to think much. There are no twists, nothing that you're not going to figure out within the first ten minutes of the movie, and no big surprises by the end of it.Brad Pitt was pretty to watch, and surprisingly really funny too, at times. Angelina Jolie stole most of the scenes with her beauty and amazing figure, and it was hard to keep your eyes off of her most of the time, which I'm sure were the intentions of the director and costume designer for Ms. Jolie.If pressed, though, it was a good movie and I liked it well enough to watch it again someday.

Looking back at the list of quotes, I can suddenly hear that same dialog in MacNee's and Rigg's suave voices.

The Smiths Rock,"The term ""chemistry"" is often used to describe that ethereal quality in movies, and rarely is it used accurately or precisely. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie absolutely have ""it"". Consequently, Director Doug Liman's ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is one of the most enjoyable movies in recent memory. When Pitt and Jolie are on screen, they could be in an elevator baring automatic weapons, not saying a word (which actually happens), and be simply captivating. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are the screen's most stunning couple. Granted they are both simply beautiful, and charismatic presences. Though when they are on the screen together it is pure chemistry. Acknowledge Liman for keeping the romance in the foreground, in a well orchestrated action movie-- so to speak. This is no small accomplishment.Simon Kinberg wrote the screenplay for ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" 5 years ago as his Master's Thesis. I had read that his screenplay evolved through numerous rewrites. Kinberg's story has a novel premise. John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith have been married for 5 or 6 years (depending on whose account), and their marriage has gone stagnant. John is a successful contractor. Jane is the CEO of an Internet company. They live in a comfortable home in an up scale neighborhood. We are introduced to the Smiths in their marriage counseling session, where John asks for clarification in rating their sex life-- he wants to know if 10 or 1 represents the highest. This is an example of the wonderful touches Kinberg provides. Turns out that John and Jane are expert professional assassins working for rival companies-- unbeknown-st to each other. The story seems to imply that both rival companies are contracted to ""The Company"", though this is inherently vague. Pretty much it seems that John and Jane's targets are ""bad guys"". When an FBI hostage, Adam Brody (Benjamin Diaz), is independently identified as their next job, their secrets are invariably revealed. Note this comes as no surprise, being this is the what the movie is advertised as. Predictably John and Jane become each other's next job. Now the fun really begins.Pitt and Jolie are really deft and skilled performers. They play their roles straight-- there is no winking at the camera. This is the real charm of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"". You have smart and charming actors playing smart and charming characters in a preposterous situation. The sense of humor derives from the situations. Pitt as John is so at ease and natural, and proves he has a talent for comedy, because he is not trying to be funny. Pitt also gives John an underlying strength. Jolie as Jane has this amazing cool and composure that is completely charming. Jolie is also brilliant at providing Jane a hint of vulnerability. Pitt and Jolie can also crank up the intensity on a dime. One can tell that both are having fun making ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"". There is a hilarious and vicious fight scene where both are attempting to kill each other. In the cut away scene John is soccer kicking Jane, until she strategically kicks him. Liman then expertly tailors this to a character arc between John and Jane. Pitt and Jolie are amazing in this narrative and character shift. Ultimately, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is about the power of love and the value of relationships. This sets a touching carve-out in what is an exquisitely orchestrated action thriller. The movie also never takes itself seriously-- very smart.The Smiths may have gotten married as the perfect cover. Recalling how both met, their smoldering affair, and their present state of marriage, John and Jane must choose whether it is worth fighting for. There is some twisted humor in depicting a marriage where both partners are literally out to kill each other. Liman and Kinberg set up the joke and know that there is catharsis in the resolution. The bottom line is that love and honor are always worth fighting for. Always. So do Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are awesome in Doug Liman's very fun and captivating ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"". I truly would love see ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith II"". Really.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Pleasurable Trip,"I like modern action-movies, particularly since they often intermingle with other genres. In this case, comedy and romance. The real trick (which was the major problem during the 80's and 90's) is to make the genres mix seamless, like the action can't be without the comedy and the other way around.Mr. & Mrs. Smith succeeds in this. It is fun, fast and pleasant. So, the problem with it. I've never been a huge Jolie-fan. I feel she only found her true character-style in Girl Interrupted, but everything else is just wrong (especially the Lara Croft: Tom Raider-films, in which she really, really sucks). OK, she is not a disaster i Mr. & Mrs. Smith, but you can feel she is not having any fun.So the grade only reaches an average, and only because of this insanely overrated (both as an actress and as a beautiful? woman). But in all other departments this is a great film. I would have loved to have seen a more down-to-earth-woman in the role as Jane Smith.

Absurd Movie With Nothing But Bullets & Bombs,"The first half-hour of this movie introduces the super beautiful Angelina Jolie and the equally beautiful Brad Pitt. This part of the movie is fun.

When Brad and Angelina are not trying to kill each other, many others are trying to kill them. Superman could never survive this continuous onslaught; I leave it to your imagination if Brad and Angelina do or don't. This movie is the movie equivalent of Jay Leno's ""Jay Walking."" Just brainless. If you like pictures without any semblance of a plot, with absurd dialogue, but with multitudinous special FX, mostly explosions and car collisions, then this is the movie for you.

Entertaining and creative,"If you don't like films that have absurd scenarios that are highly unlikely to actually happen. This film might not be for you. However I enjoyed it a lot. Plus this movie doesn't stretch limitations nearly as much as science fictions. What it does stretch is its entertainment value throughout most of the movie. This movie is about a married couple with professions that are kept a secret from one another until it inevitably intertwines them in a dangerous situation. From this point on you get to see how the two characters deal with this dilemma and how it has a domino effect during the rest of the movie. This film also focuses the attention on both the wife and husband, making for a different kind of narration in comparison to other actions. Overall there is a satisfying but kind of cliche and wonky conclusion to this film.

A watchable comedy action movie,"So why 7 out of 10 as 2 huge stars who did a fantastic job, well simply Angelina Jolie & Brad Pitt did the best they could do with the script making this a solid 6 out of 10, but the supporting cast especially Vince Vaughn gives it another solid star ( he is very funny in this movie ). The problem is this is a big budget movie that with a better script should have been a 9 out of 10 movie at the very least.That is why this movie ended up a watchable 7 out of 10 simply because the basic concept of the script was fantastic, but the overall script they used had too many holes in that makes the audience fall out of some of our suspended disbelief, even though we already in the first 30 minutes ( where it was on it's way as 9 out 10 ) had a very solid script. Unfortunately in the next 1 hour & half too much happens that goes beyond acceptable belief even in an action comedy ( yes with the bits of comedy in this action movie you get a little wiggle room, but unfortunately some script writers seem to think as soon as we have a little comedy in the film then the plot does not have to make sense ( this is far from the truth as all great comedy have plots they make total sense & from that foundation the comedy is that so much better ). So this movie loses 3 stars because of script writing ridiculousness.That being all said, it is still an enjoyable movie so long as you go into with the expectation it is a 6 out of 10 action movie ( with a bonus star for the very good comedy moments from the script that all the actors who partake do really well ).All the actors really did do their best with the final edited script that was used.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Comic Book Action,"The movie started well. In fact the first half was really really good. The chemistry between Brad and Angelina was so strong it's no wonder poor Jennifer was insecure (which girl wouldn't be if confronted with Ms. Jolie?).The movie opens with a very ""Mission Impossible II""esq start. If I loved the scene between Tom Cruise & Thandie Newton right at the start of MI II, then the Pitt/Jolie flashback scene was equally riveting.So far so good. The movie was totally not what I expected. It's not a movie version of the ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" TV Show - which I naively thought it was (wake up Melody!). There were even a couple of laughs & nice gadgets, which lulled me into thinking I was right to think this was the movie of the year And then came the post-break.Apparently Angelina cannot stray too far from Lara Croft and silly comic book action stuff. The writers of the movie obviously put so much effort into creating just the perfect equation between Mr. & Mrs. Smith (& I do agree, they achieved perfection there) that they forgot that the rest of the movie must have a plot! Common sense was thrown out of the window while hopelessly trying to ape James Bond (failing miserably). Note to writers: 007 has a mission every movie.Would say more here, but would give away ""the plot"" (see I can be funny too) so will end my tirade here.The verdict then?

"Jolie and Pitt sizzle, but Liman rules","Mr. And Mrs. Smith might be the textbook definition of Hollywood entertainment: two beautiful movie stars, whose on-screen chemistry can only be overshadowed by their possible off-screen romance, starring in a spyesque action flick from a director whose definite sense of style underscores the film nicely, without ever making it about him. It may not be Macbeth, but this steak has sizzle.However, it's not this steak's obvious sizzle, but the unexpected meat on its bones that turns the film into a real delight. The seemingly simple premise about two assassins that get married without ever revealing their real day jobs to each other is just the vehicle that writer Simon Kinberg and director Doug Liman use to delve into a more complex subject, a stale marriage.John Smith (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) meet, while on separate assignments in Bogota, Columbia. There's an immediate spark between these beautiful strangers, and it's not long before marriage bells ring. Five or six years later, depending on which Smith you ask, the spark is gone, and while each on enjoys his/her own success in the exciting world of contract killing, the marriage is failing and they resort to counseling in an attempt to save their boring, suburban union.Failed marriages is a topic so many Americans are familiar with, and one of the film's strengths is that it spends plenty of time chronicling there lifestyle. We watch the Smiths go through their daily routine; they argue over new curtains, attend a neighborhood party, and definitely do not have sex Fate steps in when Jane and John are assigned to off the same person. Out in the field they each interfere with their spouse's plan of action and end up trying to kill each other. Using evidence taken from the scene of the attempted crimes, the two identify each other as competing agents before rushing home and expressing how they missed each other over dinner.This is where the real fun begins as all the frustration built up over six years of marriage is let out in a barrage of humor and violence. Jolie and Pitt trade barbs and gunfire before realizing they cannot kill each other. Instead they team up to fight off their respective agencies, who now want them both dead, all the while revealing the secrets that have been swept under the carpet all these years.Doug Liman, whose impressive resume includes Swingers and The Bourne Identity, keeps the story grounded in the characters, who deliver more wit and humor then can be found in most mainstream comedies. The action sequences are directed with a John Wu like grace and do not invigorate so much as provide moments for the characters to entertain. Anyone who has ever had a long term relationship can empathize with the Smiths as they duke out their frustrations.It's hard to imagine a hotter couple, either on or off-screen, than Pitt and Jolie.

Decent action rom com,"It's what you would kind of expect. Nothing spectacular, solid movie to turn on the that has pretty good action scenes along with some funny moments from Bradley. Angelina does a job being that bad ass she plays so well. I actually just watched it for the first time this year. As a kid I remember seeing the trailer and thinking that looks dumb. It actually turned out to be a lot better than I thought. Definitely corny at some parts and the plot is wild. However, considering that it's based off the TV show that I just found out about, that was created in the 90's, I can't complain too much.

Why is this movie rated so well?,"The only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster (in my mind) is that there are a few laughs throughout the film. Then again, the film's jokes became redundant after the first half hour.I'm typically not very starstruck by a famous cast, nor am I impressed by the blatant exploitation of sex appeal. So if you're a horny schoolboy or schoolgirl, please disregard my comment.Did anyone notice the absurd number of plot holes and other things that just didn't make sense? Did the two rival companies that Mr. and Mrs. Smith worked for suddenly collaborate to plan a very elaborate death for these two assassins? Didn't Austin Powers teach us anything? Just shoot them! Don't place them in an easily escapable and overly complicated situation.Why is Mr. Smith able to throw a bomb into a mailbox in front of a police officer and get away? How, exactly, did this movie end? Did they kill everyone in both companies and are now living happily ever after? I don't understand why the movie ended when it did. Furthermore, I don't understand why anyone in the movie theater clapped when it did end.Let's not forget how underdeveloped the entire story was to make way for explosions and car chases. They never, for example, explained who the two leaders of the company were, and why they wanted certain people killed. There was a lot of missed potential there.On many occasions, I'm willing to let a minimum number of holes in the story slide, but the movie should still make some sense.

Susy,"I think it's a very good movie, the performances were very good, and it didn't look too unbelievable. It's good that the movie believes in true love, even though on these days that's the last thing the people believe in. Also believes in forgiveness and honesty. But, it would be better if you guys could do a little bit of more research about Bogotá, because, you were wrong about some things. For example, Bogotá has not hot weather, it's cold.

"A little harmless, implausible fun","""Hey Johnny! So how is Mr. and Mrs. Smith?"" Well, what exactly are you expecting from the movie? ""Hmm, I'd say the action of Revenge of the Sith combined with the the clever script of Memento. Oh, and with complete plausibility thrown in for good measure."" Ah, well in that case I would have to say you should probably be flogged with a wet, jello-filled straw. Don't worry, it's not too bad. Trust me. Then you should take my course, ""How to Properly Analyze a Movie Based on its Trailer."" It'll help you look a lot less like a jack-a-dandy and prevent you from complaining about how this movie is just too unbelievable.Too unbelievable? You don't say. Look, right off the bat we're expected to believe that this couple has been married for 5 or 6 years, they're trained assassins who pride themselves on recon, and they never suspected the other of being an assassin. If you can buy that premise going into the movie then you waiver all rights to complain about anything else that's a bit far-fetched, OK?Is this a great movie that I'll gladly add to my DVD collection the day it's released? Nah. But it was good for a couple of hours of non-analytical fun. It's a little slow-paced at times, and there is probably too much emphasis at the beginning on the mundanity of their marriage (they're bored, we get it), but once things start to kick in we get beautiful people, gunplay, car chases, explosions, one-line exchanges, inside jokes, and doses of humor thrown at us left, right, and up the middle. I'd also add ""out the ying-yang"" but that'd be too cliché. The fight scene between Brad and Angelina is particularly funny (though probably a little too reflective of a day in the life of Ike Turner), as is Vince Vaughn's small role. You gotta love his defense of living with his mom, ""She cooks, cleans, makes my bed, and I'm the dumb guy?""If you're looking for character development then you better keep on looking. Chances are you won't ever buy into the fact that you're supposed to be watching the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Smith on screen. More likely you'll be thinking as I did, ""Hey, there's Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie just having some fun!"" But who cares? As long as it entertains then so be it. It doesn't really take itself seriously, so why should you?I mean, come on, Angelina Jolie walks out of gunfights and explosions looking like she just walked out of a salon, so what are you expecting? It's funny because this prompted my sister Amber to comment, ""I wish I could get blown up and still have my hair looking nice."" To which I inquired, ""Why would you want to get blown up in the first place? How about just wishing for your hair to look nice and not worry about being involved in an explosion?"" Amber's response? ""I'm just saying, if I were in a gunfight or explosion then I wish I'd walk away looking as fixed up as Angelina Jolie was."" Oh. Well, THAT makes sense. *shakes head* Women.THE GISTThere are some pretty cool scenes that I wouldn't mind witnessing again one day, but there are also some clunkers that I'd fast forward through just so I could get to the good stuff. In a Summer full of heavier (albeit entertaining) material, if all you want is to watch a bunch of beautiful people blow stuff up and aid you in a little escapism, then Mr. and Mrs. Smith just might satisfy.3.5 marks (out of 5)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Domestic Espionage,"""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is a film that mixes action, comedy and romance in a fun and intriguing way. The premise of a seemingly ordinary couple who discover that they are both elite assassins adds an element of surprise and humor to the plot. The film does not stand out for its originality, but it makes up for it with well-choreographed action scenes and good chemistry between the protagonists. The narrative is fluidly paced, allowing the viewer to become involved in the complicated and often hilarious dynamics between the main characters. ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" may not be a groundbreaking blockbuster, but it certainly provides an enjoyable and exciting cinematic experience, especially for those who enjoy a good dose of action and romance mixed in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Another typical movie.,"I'm not sure if producers and directors (with some notable exceptions) in US think on a good movie as a big budget, a lot of special effects, super stars in leading roles and stupid, forced and unbelievable situations. If the answer is yes, well this could be a good movie, but reality is beyond this ideas. Black humor in this film is absolutely pathetic. Directors must have seen Tarantino or Cohen brother's films first to understand what US black humor is all about. Who can believe that Angelina Jolie is falling down from the top of a skyscraper with nothing but a rope? Or Brad Pit receiving gun shots, stabs, hits of all kind and he remains with enough energy to make jokes and discuss his marital problems? Or the final shooting scene where the two of them kill and defeat dozens of well trained and better armed mercenaries? Those are only a few samples of stupid scenes during the movie. Besides that, what about the acting performances? Totally ridiculous and exaggerated. The typical tough guy and the sex symbol, nothing more. You don't need deep dialogues or strong performances, because there are a lot of weapons, explosions and dead people. Even the extreme violence is not justified.Nothing new but a big budget film. If you want to see the typical predictable and stupid action movie, well this is your option. If you are fan of Pit and Angelina, believe me on this, there are better movies to see them, well, probably not; I'm not sure at this time. Anyhow, if you have better things to do, avoid it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The most fun I've had at the movies this year!!,"I can't say enough how much I loved this movie! Forget all the talk about Jolie and Pitt getting together while filming this, you HAVE to watch this movie. It is both very funny and full of action. This is what a true action film should be like - FUN. It reminds me a little of Die Hard - full of explosions and shootings, but also hilarious at times due to its witty lines and great banter from the two leads.The story, which I'm sure everyone knows by now, is about a married couple who are getting bored with their relationship, little realising that they are both professional assassins working for different companies, and when they find out the sparks really fly.If I had to criticise, I would say that the beginning of the film is really slow and it takes a while for the real action to kick off. But when that beginning has Angelina Jolie in a hot dominatrix outfit it totally makes up for it and I can't complain that much. Jolie and Pitt are great together, which means that the media will probably say that they definitely are together. I especially liked Brad Pitt's character, he plays the laid back, charming guy brilliantly and it's hard not to like him. Angelina is is hot as ever and the role hardly requires her to stretch her acting limits, but then that was never the point. Vince Vaughn is also great putting in an appearance as a hit-man who lives with his mother, because that's ""the only women he's ever trusted"".Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot and I would recommend it to anyone who likes their action/action-comedies. 4 out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"""Mom! We're on high alert here! I almost killed you right there!"" - Eddie (Vince Vaughn)","Summer is the prime season to release the wham-bam guilty-pleasure action movie. These movies are pretty much brainless, but they are fun to watch because you can escape reality and watch someone get the crap beat out of them. Well, that's what Mr. And Mrs. Smith is. It's nothing more then a guilty pleasure popcorn flick, and I really enjoyed it. It isn't anything great, but it's a hell of an entertaining film, with immense amounts of explosions, cool cinematography, and some fantastic fight sequences. If you enjoy kicking back and watching some kick-ass action movies, 'Mr. And Mrs. Smith' is the movie for you. The movie is about a seemingly happy, seemingly normal suburban middle-class couple, the Smiths. All the neighbors like them, and invite them to all their mind-numbing Tupperware parties and such. Yes, John and Jane seem ever so content on the outside, but their marriage is falling apart. A lot of their passion for each other has faded (like most married couples), and they both have a big secret they are hiding from each other - they are both C.I.A. assassins. When the couple finds out these truths about each other they try to kill each other because their jobs come first. Watching Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt try to run over each other with cars, shoot at each other or attack each other with household appliances, 'Mr. And Mrs. Smith' kind of turns up being a violent version of 'War of the Roses'.Doug Liman, who just recently directed 'The Bourne Supremacy', does a fine job with 'Mr. And Mrs. Smith'. It's nothing to even consider handing out an award for, but he makes sure the film stays fresh and doesn't drag. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are consistent in their parts, but I found that they didn't have very good on-screen chemistry, which is funny due to the two actually being a couple in real life. Vince Vaughn is funny and steals some scenes for the very limited screen time he has, and The O.C.'s Adam Brody seems to be just thrown into the cast for window dressing. Brody plays a role that could be cut from the movie easily, but the producers probably figured with him too in the film, it could boost ticket sales, especially for clamoring teenage girls who are obsessed with 'The O.C.'. Keith David has a short cameo as Father, and 'House's' Jennifer Morrison has an extremely short role as one of Jolie's co-workers.In closing, 'Mr. And Mrs. Smith' is a big, loud, extravagant popcorn flick that any action fan will enjoy. I felt it was superior to a lot of other films in it's genre, because it had a perfect balance of fun, drama and comic relief, which is rare these days. It's a good film, not a great one, and certainly not one worthy of any kind of award. It's just a guilty pleasure, no more, no less. Grade: B- (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 6/10/05)my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces).",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Shiny People and Shiny Things,"Full of actors pretending to be assassins pretending to be boring suburbanites, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" never convinces that it's anything more than famous people surrounded by shiny things, and doesn't seem to be trying too hard to do so. It's as if the film is so proud of having people as pretty as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie together on screen that it figures any characters they create couldn't possibly be as interesting as, well, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" feels entitled to pile contrivance upon contrivance, at times undermining its own logic, to allow Mr. and Mrs. Pitt-Jolie to slap and tickle their way through all manner of gun play and combustion.John and Jane Smith, a couple of happily hired killers who ice skels before heading to the neighbors' cocktail party, have managed ""five or six"" years of marriage without realizing the truth about each other. Well, at least one of them has. After their respective Murder, Inc's send them to the same hit, they ID one another and are each given 48 hours to eliminate the other. This is unfortunate, not least because it requires them to turn their sprawling faux colonial into bullet casserole. As far as I could tell, the only reason either heads home is to participate in a lengthy shootout in which exploding drywall serves as an aphrodisiac. It's one of many sequences in ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" that exists only for its own sake. There's a set up and a double cross that eventually lead the pair to shoot at things other than each other, and to realize that, dammit, a relationship between merciless, competing guns-for-hire CAN succeed in spite of the odds.""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" affects a forced whimsy that signals it's not to be taken seriously, but even so, virtually nothing that takes place in the film is at all necessary. One would think Charlie's Angels-type professional hit squads would be able to handle their own internal issues without conspiring with their competitors in an elaborate scheme to wipe out one of their own. Likewise, having been assigned to the relationship as a cover, it seems odd that one of the two would then be marked for death for being in that very relationship. But to heed such nitpicking would leave little cause for mayhem, and would expose the near total lack of chemistry between what admittedly must be one of the most beautiful couples ever to grace the screen. Without the able support of Vince Vaugh, here as so often the best thing in the film, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" would be virtually humorless. It wants the taste of Brad and Angelina it dishes to us to be enough, an appalling display of laziness and condescension. If that's all you're looking for, any recent issue of People magazine can give you the same punch far less expensively.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An Incredibly Fun Favourite,"I think this movie is excellent. Sure it's got some real cringy dialogue throughout but to this day I still think it's got some of the best action sequences out there.Angelina & Brad are unquestionably great actors and have very real chemistry which sells their characters.This film is perfectly paced with satisfying beats and incredibly well choreographed fight sequences which have been cut together beautifully and paired well with clever and fun music choices.Every time I hear people put down this movie I think I must have a ridiculous amount of nostalgic love clouding my judgement... until I watch it again, attempting to do so with a more critical eye but my love for it only grows stronger.I think a lot of the background/side characters are b-grade at best (bar- Vince), and as mentioned there's some poor dialogue but I forgive it all for the joy this film brings me. I've tried putting it on in the background but always end up finding myself sucked in, grinning ear to ear.It's fun, exciting, cool & sexy.If I was being critical I'd give it an 8 or 9, but it's a personal 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Ignore the outlandish plot device and enjoy the scenery.,"John and Jane Smith are a long married couple who have stopped communicating in any meaningful way. It's not that they hate each other. They make polite small talk but seem more like roommates than a couple. The reason for this is that everything they say to each other is a lie because each is an undercover assassin. Maintaining an innocuous facade to conceal this fact has made them bored and distant. They each learn simultaneously that the other has been assigned to hit them, but instead of checking with THE SPOUSE, each assumes that the marriage was a false front, entered into to keep an eye on the other and gain information. Each decides to test the other instead of actually discussing the situation openly, misunderstandings occur and this leads to an escalating war of words and more than a few bullets. And then there is that staple of the action comedy, the groin kick. Take THAT Brad Pitt...My take on the central story device was that it was a 're-imagining' of that old chestnut the 'oops-we're-not-really-married' gambit. How many 60s sitcoms used it to kill an episode? Gilligan's Island, The Flintstones, The Dick Van Dyke Show etc. etc. It's a pretty shopworn story device by this point. But, in the wake of movies like Fatal Attraction, and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, in which a character within or close to the main household turns out to be a threat, likely somebody got the half-clever idea that instead of not being married, the couple should find out that they had no idea to whom it was they were married. In short, let's substitute subversion of legal concepts like 'good faith' and 'informed consent' for the more straightforward device of not legally being married. And laughs and many expended shell casings ensue.The resulting movie is strictly popcorn fare, built around a central plot device so outlandish as to defy reason, and yet quite entertaining despite this, thanks to imaginative staging of fantastically elaborate action set pieces and tightly choreographed comedy ballets. The technical demands of their roles are surprisingly varied and one has to gain an appreciation for Pitt and Jolie in this regard. They are as attractive as the picture's background scenery, but more than just eye candy. A potential action classic and worth a watch at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Skinny legs!,"Wow, this movie is a very entertaining, but is has some flaws in it. First I was and I'm still in love with Brad Pitt however his skinny legs make me crazy. Well, I never saw Brad Pitt's legs that close until see Mr. & Mrs. Smith. I may consider loving Brad Pitt with a certain reservation. Speaking of reservation; Angelica Jolie tried to be funny in this movie but sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. It's not like when I saw ""The Room"" in Los Angeles (midnight showing only) and everyone was laughing, clapping, talking and having fun. I will recommend Mr. & Mrs. Smith to my friends with a little reservation related to Brad Pitt's legs. Overall the movie is somewhat fun to watch; so go and see it !",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Weak story, fun characters and dashing actors","I feel that with a better writing this could have been a good film. The basic idea itself isn't all that intelligent in that a movie based on this idea is never going to revolutionize your way of thinking or how you see the world. But it's a fun little idea with a clever premise that could allow for lots of jokes, humour and action. And we do get some of that. There are some really good scenes when the first starts to drop hints about the professions of its two main characters. On the whole I actually like the first half of this film a lot more than I like the second half. The first just has more good scenes, better humour and more character moments where we are introduced to these people. The second half is almost nothing more than one action scene after another. They're good action scenes, mind you, but the strength of a film almost always lies on its characters and its story, and we don't much of either of those during the second half.Though there are some scenes, where the characters of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie come to grips with what they have learned about each other and those scenes do work, mostly because the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie is that good. It's always nice to see two big stars sharing a film. Dueling Stars these films are called and I usually like them a lot, because these stars usually have such a strong presence, especially mega stars like Pitt and Jolie - they're famous for a reason - and that presence usually translates to great scenes where they do nothing more than interact with each other and it's still enormously entertaining. We have that here in abundance.On the technical side of things, the visual style of this film looks rather good. I especially like the flashback to the day when the main characters met, with its blazing colours and hot atmosphere. And, as stated, the action scenes are great as well. Nothing groundbreaking, but they're entertaining and feel realistically brutal, although they still add in that necessary touch of ""no way!"" grandeur.So, is it a good film? Well... no, it's not. It's a bit below average, if I'm being completely honest. Whether you'll like it or not, depends a lot on your taste in movies. If you're looking for good action and humorous storytelling, then you might very well like this just fine. If you demand deep characters and thoughtful pondering, you're out of luck with this film. It's not for everyone, but I was personally entertained by it. If only had it spent more time with its story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
no need for all the hype,"Finally saw the movie that has created much hype in the past few months. Was all the hype worth it? Not too sureIt seems as though the idea of this movie sprang forth in the following sequence: Take two known sexy actors, stick them in a dark, romantic comedy, add a few explosions and big guns here and there, don't forget the sexy sex scene and viola, a summer flick is born.Creating incredible on screen chemistry together was no sweat for Jolie and Pitt. Their acting, however, deserved no standing ovation. The storyline of this flick is somewhat fresh, yet somewhat predictable. However, it is still a lot of fun to watch, especially with a spouse. After all, the movie certainly held a double meaning in many scenes that are related to marriage and the married life. It is no doubt an adult movie rather than a PG movie. But, I guess it is rated in accordance to where the money is!The direction of the movie concentrated too much on the two characters as Jolie and Pitt, rather than Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Pay attention to all the unnecessary, extreme close-ups and the comedy that brought forth the personal lives of the two, rather than building on the characters. On the other hand, the message and the whole idea of ""perfection and simplicity in marriage"" which does not exist was very well done and enjoyable to watch.To sum up, no need to make it a top priority, however, if the chance does arise, do take your husband/wife to Mr. & Mrs. Smith.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Another point of view...Story behind the script is interesting,"I have no concrete information about the original story and the writers thoughts, but I realized a very different aspect of the story. As many other viewers (even may be to all) the movie is not just an action movie based on a couple whom are agents bla bla. The first scene gives clues about the original story. It is a different presentation of an ordinary American couple whom has very common relationship and engagement problems.First consider the names and the case. An ordinary couple whom has very common communication and marriage problems. Even the names are very generic for an American couple, John & Jane Smith. They have different point of views on marriage and relationship, and common marriage objects like having a baby etc.The movie exaggerates the feelings of each with action where majority of the scenes are figurative and fictitious based on this exaggeration. The scenes sometimes show real life but on the other times show the figurative exaggerated presentation of the feelings. I have noted many many couplings for these transitions. For general examples see below matchings...The flurry and excitement of love initiating the engagement (first matching in a very authentic environment), As time passes by the polarization and being a side (symbolized as secret agents whom are serving to different sides) The baby issue, father first rejects and wants to get rid off it before birth ( the young guy whom is on target to be destroyed)And specifically; at the and there were a devastating fight in between where guns and bombs were in action. But right after settlement no harms were in between (as a standard viewer) ... But it was just to show the though argument in between and the explosions and blasts were emotional frazzle (in real aspect).This point of view may not present the actual approach but please consider viewing the movie once more from this aspect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Charming performances, good action","John Smith (Brad Pitt) is an assassin for hire. Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) is, too. They work for different companies, and neither one knows the other's true occupation. Until they're hired to kill each other. *cue suspense music*Thanks to the excellent chemistry between Pitt and Jolie and some riveting action scenes, the movie manages to lift itself above most others in the genre. That is to say, it's not just another dumb shoot-em-up, although not as brainy as, for example, The Bourne Identity. The mutual discovery that their spouse is a hit man doesn't occur until a good half hour into the film, but once it does, you're treated to a series of fast-paced scenes in the tradition of The War of the Roses, including a decimation of the couple's home. The trouble is that I can't give you too much of the plot without telling you the twists, because there aren't that many to begin with. But as long as you concentrate on the combined hotness of the starring duo - so smoldering that sparks flew off-set as well - you'll be fine. Don't let the story distract you!Doug Liman, who gave us such instant classics as Swingers, Go, and The Bourne Identity, keeps things moving pretty quickly, although a peek at the goofs page on IMDb will show that enough errors were made to make one question the editing. Still, the action scenes pack quite a wallop, particularly the close hand-to-hand combat between the Smiths in their house.The story varies for the most part from implausible to improbable, as is often the case with action films. But Pitt and Jolie both look right for their respective parts, including handling firearms and other weapons. What impressed me is that neither character seemed particularly moralistic about their line of work. For example, no ""oh, we kill only bad guys!"" junk - they kill whomever, whenever, wherever. Particularly amusing is the scene in which they reveal to each other how many kills they've had.Vince Vaughn is on hand as Eddie, who works with John, and even though his role is very small, he manages to walk off with every scene he's in. That's because Jolie and Pitt wisely underplay their roles, leaving the fireworks to take center stage. Oh, and their obvious good looks, too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

They're hired to kill each other of course! While I usually enjoy watching movies with Angelina Jolie in them, I found this one to be quite boring and predictable.

Worst film Ever...6.6 on IMDb Nooooooo!!!!,"A truly awful movie. I cant comprehend how it has got such a high rating on a usually reliable site.The Movie is an insult to the movie goer, and the movie goers here seem to have lapped it up.I have so many holes to pick in it, but the thing that gets me the most is the fact that the director hasn't been bothered to include ANY explanation of who these guys work for, and why they are so set on killing each other. It is a film based purely on style over content and fails miserably to pull that off. I actually felt a bit sorry for Pitt and Jolie having to carry a film with no discernible script. As for the failed marriage metaphors throughout the film, they only managed to make a bad film even worse.If anyone can reasonably explain to me why this film has received 6.6 on this site I would be delighted to be enlightened. I give it a 1, but only because I cant give it 0.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a light action comedy,"Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a light action comedy.

"Pretty people doing awesome things, in cool clothes...I sooo wanted to hate this movie","John and Jane are trapped in a boring, loveless marriage. They only share one thing in common and neither one knows it. They are both contract killers. They are hired to hit the same mark, both fail, and now they have to kill each other. No problem, really. They've slowly grown on each others nerves...and now they can really take out that unspoken aggression from differing opinions on the living room drapes.Brad and Angelina have amazing chemistry (duh!). Vince Vaughn works his natural gift to play arrogant motor mouths. Ah, Vinny...you do it so darn well. If he weren't an actor, then he'd be the wealthiest used car salesman in the universe.Ultimately, sparks fly when the two try to do each other in. Their passion for their profession transfers into their passion (or lack thereof) for each other. In the film's beginning, the couple's marriage counselor asks, ""When was the last time you had sex?"" Jane replies, ""I don't understand the question."" She definitely understands it now. WAIT A SECOND! John and Jane try to stick out there marriage. They seek counseling. Is this movie a parable about marriage? Till death do us part? Marriage built on honesty? The truth shall set you free?! Am I reading too much into this? Explosions, car chases, billions of bullets blasting, and...the tango. Hey, it worked for True Lies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A good popcorn flick,"Mr. and Mrs. Smith is the story of a bored married couple who have nothing to talk about, but when they each find out that the other is a deadly assassin, they're on a race to kill each other.First, I'll look at the story and the writing. The writing is pretty good, and at times it's snappy. The comedy in the movie is pretty funny, but this really isn't a full blown comedy like a lot of people were expecting. It's really more of an intense action film. I thought the funniest part was the satirical look at suburban living. Now, while I enjoyed the film, I couldn't help but notice a lot of plot holes, and the somewhat inconclusive ending. Also, it seems to drag on in some parts.The acting in the movie is pretty good. Brad Pitt is as cool as ever in his role, and Angelina Jolie is just as awesome. Vince Vaughn seemed a little out of place even though his scenes are funny.Anyways, don't expect a serious full blown Hollywood action film. This is more of a popcorn flick. 6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Good Action Movie!,"I had my doubts about seeing this movie. But I saw this movie on sale for only three bucks and I was fortunate enough to buy it. This movie has several flaws, but I liked it better than I thought.John and Jane Smith have been married for five or six years. They live peaceful, blissful lives to each other. Away from each other, they are assassins of rival groups. Their next mission is to eliminate each other and that will cause havoc.The acting is pretty good. I enjoy watching Brad Pitt act. Angelina Jolie was even better to watch. They had pretty good chemistry. Vince Vaughn even did a good job.This movie is also filled with comedy. The Smith family had some pretty wise remarks. The special effects are good.A major flaw would be the plot. The plot/script is not all that good but everything else makes up for it.Overall, this is a good action movie made for popcorn munchers. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Left With Mixed Feelings,"Here is my 2 cents worth of opinion on Mr. and Mrs. Smith. I felt the need to comment since I sat through the DVD feature, all three commentaries, and the other special features to try and understand why I was left with a mediocre feeling about the movie. I was thinking about giving it a median 5 rating, but increased for Angelina Jolie and great set design work to make LA & Pasadena look like other locations.There is a lot to like about the movie if you look at the actors, sets, editing, and cinematography. Even though the studio seemed to be making the producers cut costs all along the way based on the commentary, the $110 million budget estimate seems more than adequate.The weakness seems to be the lack of a great plot, and the producers admit that they decided to focus on the relationship between John and Jane Smith and abandon the original plot points after having about two thirds of the film shot and edited together while waiting on actors to complete other projects. The scenes at the marriage counselor's office seemed to flash ""The Sopranos"" at me even though it seemed like a good idea, most of the other budget cuts and location changes did not seem to degrade the movie at all, but they may have relied on computer (CGI) graphics too much, even with very good editing.The producers and director were changing and forming their vision for the movie as it was being shot, I think that made it difficult for the actors to know what their ultimate result was supposed to be. The level ranged between serious assassination & action fight scenes to silly comedic style scenes resulting in a cartoonish feeling even though I thought the visual aspect of the movie was very good.My first thought about this movie was how will they be able to even pull off this difficult plot in any way that is believable and novel, and I felt they did it in the relationship scenes at their home better than the rest. I would have guessed the opposite. The only way I can see dealing with the plot better would have been to create something more like old TV ""Avengers"" staying with a less violent Steed and Mrs. Peel tongue in cheek relationship the whole way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Terrible,"I saw this movie at a press screening and thought it was terrible. So much of this movie is unbelievable, I don't know where to start, including Pitt and Jolie in their parts. I guess they looked great, but chemistry? It's all superficial and forced.The script is a mess. You never get a sense of who these two people or their motivations are. We never get to know them, so when the story gets going and people start trying to kill each other, it feels pointless. I like violence when it's properly motivated, but because the story is so badly laid out, the violence here feels superfluous and ugly. The film is smug and thinks it's really funny to have the characters make jokes as they kill people, as if it's some kind of clever action comedy. These lame comedy moments make the film feel worse than empty: it feels evil. There is a truly disgusting moment of violence between Pitt and Jolie as they beat each other up.The only thing I liked was Vince Vaughn, who was hilarious in a supporting role. It was as if he were in a completely different movie. Somebody needs to give him a lead role.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Sex! Violence! Tabloids! A Very Guilty Pleasure,"I loved this movie.It's big, loud, and the source of endless tabloid cover stories. There are lots of explosions, and there's not a single profound line in the movie. Much of its appeal is purely superficial: you get to stare at Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in fabulous costumes, and the shreds of those costumes, for two hours.It's also funny and smart and stylish.Brad Pitt is terrific. I never really understood his appeal before. I do now. He has a great gift for deadpan comedy.Can Angelina Jolie act? If she can, she doesn't show it here. But, as everybody knows, men like to look at her, so what else is there to say about Angelina Jolie? (Yes, I would have liked to have seen a woman who is both beautiful and something of an actress, but you can't have everything.) The chemistry between Pitt and Jolie would be obvious to the dead. Jennifer Aniston never had a chance. Pitt and Jolie were fated to be together.This movie is sort of a pumped-up version of movies like ""His Girl Friday"" in which Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell sparred over work while also working out marital issues common to all couples. Here, of course, the marital issues are worked out through the two leads' careers as high-priced assassins.It makes no sense at all except as a big, sexy prank. John and Jane compare numbers -- not how many people they slept with before they got married, but how many people they've assassinated.The ending falls flat, but, other than that, it works.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"""You still alive, baby?""","My husband and I just got back from seeing ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", which opened in theaters today. Normally I don't review current-run films, much less on the day they premiere, but I had planned beforehand to review this one. I knew I was going to enjoy it. Aside from and in spite of all the media speculation about Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, I had a feeling it was going to be a fun film. I like Angelina Jolie and I especially like to watch her in action roles (yes I love and own the two Tomb Raider films). Seeing her run around with a big gun, kicking butt, is FUN. She's as great in this kind of role as Diana Rigg was as TV's Emma Peel! A perfect fit. And Brad Pitt is an underrated actor, he is really very good, and he is funny in this movie! He has great comedic timing.The plot is simple. Two professional assassins find out that they've been hired to kill the other. The plot is only barely complicated by the facts that (1) they are married to each other, and (2) they did not know until this point of the story the other's true occupation.The ""eye candy"" factor is high: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, often scantily dressed, heavily breathing lines such as ""Who's your Daddy now?"" It's also an action-packed movie, with good dialogue, great chemistry between Pitt and Jolie, and plenty of (not too bloody) violence. It's much more tongue-in-cheek than the trailers indicate. And Pitt and Jolie get some great one-liners.All in all, a highly entertaining ""popcorn"" movie; great summer flick. As we walked to the car I said ""It's sort of a mix of 'True Lies', 'Tomb Raider', 'The Avengers' (the old TV show, not that lousy movie), with a pinch of 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' thrown in.

"Bad. Really, really bad.","The producers of this are the luckiest people in Hollywood at the moment. Thanks to the celebrity-snogging factor, they've been saved from the box office drubbing they so richly deserved. How sad. People really are sheep.The first hour is (barely) passable; the second is just dreary. Things explode and lots and lots of people are killed; this is just as much a video game as either of Jolie's awful Lara Croft pictures. The extended action sequence in which the married cold-blooded killers (oh...they are ""professionals,"" so we're not supposed to notice that they are the scum of the earth) destroy their house while trying to kill each other and then play violent make-up games is utterly predictable and utterly revolting. This movie has the moral core of a New York pimp. It also has no ending, but you can say that about 2 out of 3 Hollywood movies these days.If this were truly played for laughs it might have been a kick, like the original version of ""The In-Laws"" with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin. But it's not funny, not by a long shot. I guess the one consolation is that, based on appearances at least, Pitt and Jolie will probably use some of their take from this pile to do something good out in the real world.Somebody give Doug Liman a script, please.

Both combine to create an amazingly fluid watch with no wasted time - every second is there for a reason, and it all fits perfectly.I honestly can't fault any of it, barring some in-film tactical inaccuracies that are there purely for cinematography, but I'm happy to let it slide because the end result is a spectacle and a half.This is quite possibly one of the most watchable films of all time, and there's no limit to when or where, you can just put it on and enjoy the ride whenever!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Mr. and Mrs. Smith aims to be a mash-up of True Lies by way of War of the Roses, but coasts on it's A-list real life couple to carry the material in place of wit or intrigue","John (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) are couple five (or six) years into their marriage who've fallen into a routine. Unbeknownst to each other, John and Jane are actually assassins working out of different firms under the guise of not particularly exciting white collar jobs that require spontaneous travel. When both are sent after the same target, Benjamin ""the Tank"" Danz (Adam Brody), the two soon find out the other's secret and are given 48 hours to kill each other or face the consequences.Mr. And Mrs. Smith is a 2005 action comedy which has the distinction of being one of the first produced film screenplays of Simon Kinberg who actually sold the script back in 2000 while working as a graduate student at Columbia University. Formally beginning casting in 2003, the film actually came very close to not being made as original co-lead of Nicole Kidman had to drop out due to commitments with The Stepford Wives and failed attempts at finding a replacement almost cause Brad Pitt to leave until the 11th hour casting of Angelina Jolie saved the film. Upon release the film garnered a lot of publicity due to the ""Brangelina"" (to quote People Magazine) fascination in the public per the conventions of the mid-2000s as well as rumors of the two having starting dated during filming. While films featuring celebrity couples are nothing new (such as the films Humphrey Bogart made with his wife Lauren Bacall), in many cases such recent projects had garnered a reputation with notorious bombs such as Shanghai Surprise, Gigli, or the films Bo Derek made with her husband John. Nonetheless the film proved a sizable hit earning just under $500 million world wide against a $110 million and earned praise from critics towards the chemistry of the leads (while also critiquing the script). Mr. And Mrs. Smith certainly is a time capsule of when it was made and has two leads who have strong chemistry, but for me it can't make up for a lack of clever writing or any real sense of stakes.Starting right off, yes, Brad and Angelina work well together and their real life (at the time) chemistry certainly comes through on camera. You can also tell that the movie has a large budget, and it comes through in its action sequences and production design. With that said however, Mr. And Mrs. Smith doesn't really create any compelling characters or scenarios and the sub sitcom bored suburbanite setting and supporting characters aren't all that interesting or unique even when they're just used for contrast against the spy/assassin shenanigans. While Mr. And Mrs. Smith is loaded with action and spectacle, a lot of it is delivered with such a shrugging and almost winking self-awareness that you don't have much reason to care. The only element that leaves an impression (in the wrong way) is Vince Vaughn playing John's best friend Eddie whose character and dialogue is laced with casual misogyny (which the movie tries to play for comedy by addressing he lives with his mother) and rather than being funny it just feels off putting and uncomfortable.In terms of action there's certainly a lot of it with the fight in the Smith's house a setpiece that has ingrained itself into popular consciousness through various parodies of it, but much like the rest of the movie it's delivered with the same smarmy sense of self awareness so it never feels like it has any stakes (especially with the inclusion of the song ""Express Yourself"") and coupled with the fact Pitt and Jolie are playing archetypes you never see beyond the actors and they aren't playing characters. The movie soon realizes how thin its premise actually is because it creates a faceless antagonist complete with faceless henchmen who serve as the primary threat for the last 30-40 minutes of the movie and regardless of how well you stage the action hordes of faceless goons meeting their demise doesn't make for engaging or thrilling set pieces against our plot armored ""characters"", especially when you learn the ""why"" behind what's going on making all this seem even more pointless.Mr. And Mrs. Smith is not a movie that has stood the test of time and it's not even one I got into when it was first released. When rewatching the film with its mixture of True Lies and War of the Roses, it only served to remind me of not just how much better those two films on their own were, but also similar assassin comedies like Grosse Point Blank and The Whole Nine Yards. The only reason this film was as big as it was at the time was a public fascination with celebrity in the ""golden age"" of reality TV, TMZ, and the E!

"though not Oscar worthy, come on guys, it was a very fun movie","OK. This was a pretty entertaining dar n good movie. I'm NOT saying it's the best movie ever made in the history of all movies, BUT, it was pretty good nonetheless. Though from what I remember, it was advertised as an action movie, I think it is really a romantic comedy in disguise with a lot of action added in as a plus. The fact that the actors were Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie also was a plus. Now some previous reviews have said that the movie was awful because it totally destroys the marriage life and marital bliss idea but I think those people were taking things too seriously and literally in the movie. First of all, I don't think this takes place quite in our reality. There are many parts where Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's characters seem indestructible or perform amazingly pseudo-comic book moves. It's a kind of different heightened reality so don't go rolling your eyes discrediting those moments. I think the problems the characters face are like metaphors for problems in a relationship. It's basically like saying look, once two people get married it's not ""happily ever after"" there will be problems and you both have to work through these together if the relationship is going to last. It just so happens that the Smiths' problems are that they're assassins- a funny extreme, if you will. But this extreme enables some awesome unreal scenes and even small asides that are very much entertaining. The physical fighting at first might seem like battery but it's a fine line of, again, an extreme. Or s&m. But then again, that interpretation might be too literal. All in all, I'd watch it more than once. (I've watched it many more times than that.) More than twice, actually, since the second time around you know the ending and other asides pop up.

Laughing With The Smiths,"Angelina Jolie is breathtaking while the ladies will certainly swoon over the ever-cool Brad Pitt. Even though the public probably views Jen as a better match for Mr. Smith, the arresting Jolie does a commendable job of playing his better half in the movie.The action scenes are engaging but it's the playful and almost childlike exchange between the couple that keeps the audience entertained. While not known for his comedic talents, Pitt delivers the laughs in his own unique manner and the amusing Vince Vaughn only adds to the entertainment.Although burdened with a predictable plot and an anticlimactic ending reminiscent of a 'Gun Kata' fight sequence from Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium, one still enjoys the film for what it is, a fun movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A hooker,"Those two insane face cards of Angelina and Brad almost gave me trouble concentrating but the movie itself is great, I'm not usually fond of action movies, but the ""romance"" driven plot, with the top comedy as well did it for me! The theme it sparks is very interesting and debatable, I love how they handled it and the answer they give us at the end. The development of the characters as we learn who they are and they learn who they are as well is so interesting to witness and watch. They barely talk for most of the movie, so every line they deliver is soo iconic, they're not physically close either so you're just on edge every time they move around each other especially when they found out about the lies. The tension is THICK! The whole thing has you rooting for both Jane and John. The cool vibe and atmosphere it has, the camera angles and main dark colors of the movie/backgrounds I find it so hooking. I love how it's structured in Three main parts too, they go through smoothly. One : enemies. Two : lovers. Three : allies. A raw and simplified way to describe it but it's the idea. The plot twist at the end was good too.It aged so well, you'd have trouble guessing it was filmed in 2005.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A sexier True lies...,"The only thing funny about this film is Vince Vaugn. Pitt and Jolie are good, but there's no great chemistry. There's hardly any supporting cast, other than Vaugn, so the whole film revolves around Pitt and Jolie, which becomes slightly boring and predictable (even if it is good eye candy for the audience). The dialogue is very suspect, but you can't knock the action sequences, especially the highway chase which is top dollar.Of course it's sexy and glamorous, which is what you'd expect from a film with these two as the main characters, but it plays off that way too much, and the story fails due to there not being a genuine bad guy.A decent Friday night date flick, but nothing more. Arnie and Jamie Lee Curtis still rule as the best undercover agents.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A reasonably entertaining romp,"A reasonably entertaining romp. Sort of a romantic comedy/action film. I did actually laugh out loud a time or two, and that is a bit rare. Everyone knows the premise by now, and the genesis of the romance between the stars, so there's not much point in commenting on that. Some of the plot holes are pretty large, but I suppose that is a) par for the course, and b) part of the charm of the film. It is a bit much to believe that two such accomplished assassins and intelligent people could be so oblivious to their spouses. Anjelina Jolie is, as always, spectacularly beautiful. Overall, it's worth checking out. I can't imagine how anyone would hate it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

get a magazine,"My date picked this movie. When we left the theater I said to her, ""from now on I'll pick the movies."" She said, ""that's probably a good idea.""Mr. & Mrs. Smith was supposed to be a campy, action packed, big-star studded War of The Roses on steroids sort of film. I guess it was a lot of those things. It just didn't work. It was campy, but in a disingenuous sort of way because Jolie and Pitt come across as if they are really just playing themselves, giving us a wink and nod that this is a movie made primarily so we can get a good look at them. It was action packed, but in an absurd sort of way. It had big stars, but the bigger the star does not mean the better the actor. And it was sort of like the War of The Roses on steroids, but Brad and Angelina are not Michael and Kathleen. This script was amateur compared with Roses, and the plot was just too flimsy.Usually a weak script and plot are enough for me to dislike about a movie, but my least favorite thing about M&M Smith is that entirety is so strongly anchored to the looks of Pitt and Jolie. OKAY, WE GET IT, THEY ARE GOOD LOOKING, but this is not porn, and movies can't get by on looks alone.Off the screen Pitt does seem like a nice guy who is humble and means well, and that's worthy of respect. And he is handsome, pretty...insert whatever good looking adjective you like. But he is a mediocre actor. I have yet to see him take on a role that called for substantial acting talent. He is safe relying on looks, but I'd like to see how he fares taking on a little risk. Maybe he has the potential, but the way I see it he has not developed that potential, nor a range, and most definitely not in this movie.The same is true of Jolie, except she adds the unpleasant dimension of shamelessly reminding you in every scene that she is a very pretty, sexy...insert whatever good looking adjective you like. She doesn't do this by getting into the role as an actor, trusting that her looks will shine brighter if she allows a little humility to guide them. Instead she delivers these arrogant ""everybody's looking at me"" smirks. That's fine for the hot looking woman sitting in the bar who likes that kind of superficial attention--can't even tell you how many times it's gotten my attention, but that's not what I'm looking for when I see a movie. But I guess a lot of people are. You will see Brad Pitt in a badly fitting pair of boxers, and Angelina exercise her ego, and this was an annoyance to me, and my date.In my opinion you are better off staring at a magazine cover for 90 minutes. It would be a cheaper way to get your fix of two attractive people, and you would not be nearly as disappointed when you put it down.One last note: this movie was fairly violent, lots of language, and sexual innuendo. It's not for young kids",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
What a wonderful idea - what an awful plot line,"One of my favorite actresses, Jolie and Pitt both good looking, possibly the movie couple of the year. I thought the movie would be a really good experience - nice idea, good actors, some action, I even didn't expect anything more. But, actually, I was disappointed.Although the movie has its moments, interesting and funny lines from time to time, it seems quite unfinished. What I actually expected when John and Jane gave themselves away to each other is an interesting crusade, better action and plans, instead of a few unrealistic action scenes. When it was all over and when I saw the credits screen, I could hardly believe it. End already! Then, I concluded about the movie as the massive failure.However, it is worth watching. You may like it a bit more, but, in general, don't expect too much. I'd rather fantasized about some more interesting plot line.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt ""get it on"".","Only in retrospect can we see how, and why, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have become a couple in their personal life. However, the chemistry and electricity between them must have been obvious on-set, too, as it certainly comes through in the film.The device of the to-camera marriage counseling sessions (from the point-of-view of the counselor, presumably behind a desk) allows several revelatory occasions that help to tie the movie's time-line together.The emergence of the Smiths as coolly efficient killers is brought out by degrees. Once established as a 'fact', the killings then multiply.SPOILER: The scene where the good/bad guys come for them, dressed in black (with an appearance like Ninjas), and are obviously defeated, is in the end a gratuitous scene of carnage. This scene is reminiscent of the ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" shoot-out scene, complete with the dressing for the occasion, but the body-armor saves the scene from becoming a remake.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I had high thoughts before watching it but still I wasn't disappointed, which I've been on several other occasions.In fact...I'm gonna go watch it right now, so...bye then...and if it's not been obvious enough I highly recommend this work of art.P.S.

A surprising summer blockbuster,"When I first heard about how Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were dating, I looked at my calendar and found this all kind of ironic. Only a few weeks away from the release of the big blockbuster film that they were both starring in, we find out they're dating. Could this be one of the many marketing schemes that went into this film's promotion? Probably, they must have been dating since they were actually making this film,then they thought, ""Hey, wouldn't it be smart to let the world know were sleeping with each other a couple of weeks before this film is released? More money for us!"". What better promotion is there for a film like this? How about the idea that Jennifer Aniston must feels horrible right now! For months now, i've been seeing trailers and commercials for this film then this little 'Brangelina"" thing came along, my initial reaction was that this movie was going to be horrible. Surprisingly, it wasn't! The film follows a married couple who are bored of their sub urban life style, they both feel a growing space between them. Most people who was told this story would say, ""Hey, that's normal"", but you guessed it, their wrong! John and Jane Smith are both assassins for separate corporations and they have no idea about their spouses identity. They both believe that they work boring desk jobs. As you can imagine, the film's plot starts to get interesting when they find out of each others identities.The acting in this film is surprisingly believable, when it's her time, Jolie as a house wife works perfectly. Vince Vaughn plays Eddie, John's boss, I was hoping for some comic relief coming from his character and I guess that's what the writers were aiming for but it really didn't work for me. In fact, this film was publicized as a sort of comedy film, I didn't find it funny at all. Since Brad and Angelina's acting is so believable, the relationship between the characters are even more believable.As the film's plot unfolds, the action starts coming. The action scenes in this film are probably the most entertaining in awhile. Unlike most of the recent action films, this one does not use the shaky camera effect which if you ask me, is getting really boring and annoying. There is one highway chase sequence that is a lot like the one we saw in 'The Matrix Reloaded', this is probably the best action scene. Unfortunently, this film has just as many cons as it does pros, probably even more. Like I said earlier, Vince Vaughn's performance was disappointing, usually he plays some doped out idiot, in this film he played someone who was so serious that it was awkward to see him not crack a joke. Of course, there's still some subliminal jokes but they weren't funny at all. One of the biggest problems with the film is that we never really get an idea of who John and Jane are working for, you can never tell which corporation is the ""good guy"", we probably aren't supposed to know this so it wouldn't take away from the main plot but it would still be nice to have a little background information. One other problem I had with this film is that it kept trying to push this message that really didn't effect anyone even if they did get it. The film wanted people to go home confessing their secrets to their loved ones, this didn't work out at all. The film makers should make a note that this film is a summer blockbuster, not a late winter Academy Award plea.Anyways, I may have not gotten to the points of the film i've wanted to because I can't spoil the film for everyone so you might not understand my final verdict on this flick. I was going to give this film a 6/10 but since it had a good ending, i give it a solid 7/10! Would I buy this film? No. Would I see it again? Maybe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

We all have secrets,"Pitt and Jolie star as an old married couple(and they really come across as one, and it's one of the better sources of humor(when it isn't kind of flat, as it is for the first bit) and what makes this memorable), who happen to both be assassins. They keep this from everyone else, including each other. One day, they're both hired for the same job, and they both ID their spouse. Their respective companies let them know they have 48 hours to kill off the other, before they will be dealt with by said employers. This leads to the most tense scene in the entire piece, where they are back in their dull, plain(if luxurious) suburban mansion(with nice neighbors, etc.), trying to gain or maintain control of the situation. Further developments should not be revealed here, but I will say that the middle portion of this is by far the best, the strongest. That is when the duo has been introduced, the scenario fully set up and when it just kicks loose and has fun with its clever concept(which works as an allegory, if it is somewhat disturbing to see how far these two go to kill each other, given that they are to be representative of a relationship that has lost its spontaneity) This is a pretty straightforward Hollywood popcorn flick, and other than first-mentioned aspect, it does little to distinguish itself(with the anticipated result of such). The action is phenomenal, with well-choreographed, energetic sequences such as shootouts(with various handguns, SMG's, shotguns, etc.; in fact, they get use out of many types of weaponry, also including knives, explosives, and rocket launchers), car chases and martial arts fights. This is remarkably well-paced(granted, this does take its time getting to the open and all-out battle between the two, however it is worth the wait and it isn't wasting time, rather building towards it), and never boring(even when we're seeing people who find stuff around them uninteresting). The plot does not hold up to scrutiny, what little there is of one, and the main conflict of it ends up unresolved, with this film limiting itself to focus on the lead pair. That is also evident in the additional characters barely being there(you could say the rest of the cast are cameos and extras), with Vince Vaughn being the only exception to that(and he plays himself so if you like him, you'll like his role). For this being a big spy thriller kind of thing, it doesn't have many exotic locations(I guess really just one, the nicely done bit where they meet, early on). They do throw in a lot of hi-tech gadgets and such. This has some cool surprises, and you don't see where it's going. The music is very fitting with the tone, with several love songs of different kinds. There is a lot of violence, though it is bloodless and not terribly brutal(if effective, it looks like it hurts), and a little direct sexuality(no nudity) and mild to moderate language. The DVD comes with two commentary tracks(one by writer Simon Kinberg and director Doug Liman, the other with producers Akiva Goldsman & Lucas Foster. Both are amusing and informational, they get into some technical stuff and discuss the elements of the movie), 3 deleted(more like extended they're OK) scenes(coming to 8 and a half minutes), a Making a Scene featurette(with a running time of 8 minutes, it's decent) and trailers for Fantastic Four, Guess Who, Fever Pitch, In Her Shoes, Into The Blue, one for this and a teaser for it. I recommend this to fans of the actors and other people responsible for creating it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I found the plot this time to be a bit predictable. and as such, the action was OK but the plot was really a snoozer. It was a bit funny though to see a couple of hit persons at a marriage counselor. The only difference here was that the two were to hit the same person and both got in each others way. As a result, each had to go after the person who spoiled the hit, and naturally it was each other. In Prizzi's Honor, Nicholson throws over a mafia don's daughter and hooks up with Turner. of course they are ordered to hit each other but Prizzi's Honor comes off like a black comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Great, fun and highly enjoyable!","I saw this movie today and right from the opening scene knew it was my type of film. The critics and the trailers seemed to indicate that it wasn't that good a movie, but fortunately I went with the fact that I like both main actors and the premise. It has both action and a love story (not soppy), as well as humour. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie really bring across the idea of the married coupled (like any other) going through a rough patch - but with their own unique quirks.I especially liked Jolie's acting. Some critic said that they don't gel, but I found they work excellently together. The action is smart and well shown and rather spectacular at times. I like the way they managed to put humour, love and action all into one scene - without making it confusing or sacrificing one for the other. The story is told compellingly and holds up fairly well to inspection, with good plot twists. This is not some drama or a thriller, neither is it camp comedy, so don't watch it expecting to see those.

VIsual Error in Chase Scene,"I enjoyed this movie, although the beginning was a bit slow and lacking energy. The one thing that was very obvious to me was towards the end of the movie, during the car chase scenes there were some visual errors, I believe. At first, the cars are in New York City, NY, driving and chasing. Then, in the middle of the chase scene I noticed the Long Beach, CA bridge which is used for the cruise ships and such. Then I was blown away when I saw a sign which read ""Los Angeles"" as an exit on the highway/freeway. Then the scene is back in N.Y. City while the chase continues. I happen to know this because I was raised in NY until I was 21, then drove to CA (Ojai/Ventura) and know this area well as I've been here for 23 years. Please be more careful during editing.

Bor-ing!,"I recently rented this movie on DVD and watched it with someone else. We watched the movie ALMOST entirely, because about three quarters of the way through the movie we got so bored that we decided to skip to the end.I decided to rent this movie after the guy at the video store told me that Mr. & Mrs. Smith was a romantic comedy with an actiony twist. I just thought ""sounds good"", and I decided to rent it with relatively high expectations, thinking that this wasn't some typical boring romantic comedy. Well, I was certainly right about that, but to be honest I actually found it even more boring than the average romantic comedy.To be fair, the movie was quite funny at times, and the ""fight scene"" between the Smiths during the second part of the movie was gold. Apart from that, though, both my friend and I found it extremely dull. The only thing that kept me going through most of the movie was the sight of Brad Pitt's sexy face and bod, but even that failed to stop us from abruptly skipping to the end of the movie.In short, it has a couple of cheap laughs and some very tasty eye candy, but that's all there is to it - no matter how hot you think Brad (or Angie) are, it is not worth watching this movie. It's one of those movies that are so dull that you can feel your brain eroding.By the way, I'm extremely surprised (in a bad way) by the overall IMDb rating for this movie - personally I think it deserves to be a 4.8/10 at best, but even that may seem too unrealistically high.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Doug Liman, which had already successfully directed the action film The Bourne Identity, proves himself to be a very good action movie director.Mr. & Mrs Smith is not even close to be a great movie.

Killing Me Not So Softly,"This is a movie about two contract killers who are married to each other, and implausible as it may seem, it is not a caper flick, or a crime story, but a domestic comedy. Roger Ebert in his review is spot-on: the only reason this movie exists is to see Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie together. So strong is their chemistry that it relegates the flying bullets, impossible plot, and preposterous posturing to the background.The movie opens in a marriage counselor's office, which sets the tone for everything that follows, namely, what their occupations and deceitfulness do to their marriage. The incongruity of all the murder for hire machinations is simply to be dismissed as irrelevant to the real business at hand. And, from the quotes section for this movie is a sampling of what this movie is about:John Smith: Your aim's as bad as your cooking sweetheart... and that's saying something!Jane Smith: Happy endings are just stories that haven't finished.(about the new curtains Jane bought) Jane Smith: If you don't like them just say so and we can take them back. John Smith: All right, I don't like them. Jane Smith: Learn to live with them.Counselor: How often do you have sex? Jane Smith: I don't understand the question.Jane Smith: There's this huge space between us, and it just keeps filling up with whatever we don't say to each other. What's that called? Counselor: Marriage.Eddie: This broad is not your wife; she's the enemy. John Smith: She tried to kill me. Eddie: They all try to kill you. Slowly, painfully, cripplingly. How you going to handle it? John Smith: (grabs assault rifle) I'm going to borrow this. Eddie: I like where your head's at, man.Therapist: How long have you been married? John Smith: Five years Jane Smith: Six years. John Smith: (chastened) Five or six years.Jane Smith: Any last words? John Smith: The new curtains are hideous.It is offensive to my personal sense of morality that the occupation of the two likable protagonists is never examined. To the credit of the screenplay, they only kill ""bad"" people thugs and gangsters and such, so we never catch any hint of dystopian fatalism. Think Adam's Rib or When Harry Met Sally with gunplay, and you have pretty much the essence of this movie. I liked it in spite of myself. Miss Jolie is now officially on my list of hot actresses ..

Way Ahead of Its Time,"Comparing this blockbuster to the recent movies released, this is a masterpiece. The human, action and acting is well crafted.

Of this was released in 2020s it would have made millions more as moviegoers are more likely to watch similar movies and consider it an action blockbuster without considering its silliness in actions.

Very Entertaining,"Two top assassins (Pitt and Jolie) meet, fall in love, and stay married for 5-6 years without either one telling the other what he/she really does.

If you had the brass contract for this movie you would be quite wealthy by now. Yes, there is a lot of shooting, and explosions, special effects stunts(very spectacular), and car chases (Whoa!) and well, everything you want in a good spy movie. It's all here.

I was somewhat reminded of the War of the Roses, and although this movie really goes for the jugular, it's light-hearted enough not to be scary or gory.One of the things I liked best about this movie is when the characters went after each other, there was no malice and in some ways it was quite comical and still very serious.

chemistry and explosions and shoot-outs and un-witty dialog can't make a good film,"Does this version of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (I say version because to call it any kind of 'remake' of the Alfred Hitchcock film, with no similar plot at all, would be an insult to the master) have its occasional moments of entertainment? I suppose so, but for me that cannot constitute a good movie. A lot of the comments I have read or heard about the film from critics and others who have seen it have all said this, whether they liked it or not- 'Brad and Angelina have such chemistry, they work together so well, they're so good together, etc, etc.' I wish I could say that could make a film a success, but I get frustrated with this kind of blockbuster mentality- if the film has a story, and then it has chemistry, then it will work a lot better than without it. Mr & Mrs. Smith seems to start off with a story, about an un-happy married couple who deceive each other as each being undercover agents, soon assigned to kill one another. Or rather, this is really a premise, a set-up for what should be a better story coming along. When first hearing this, it sounded amusing, a kind of riff on the 'True Lies' scenario for two other stars, Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis. But while for that film James Cameron gave them a good story to work with, after about an hour into Mr. & Mrs. Smith, there was no story I could logistically follow, or at least have an interest in following. Although Jolie and Pitt look like they're having a good time throughout, they never seem like they're taking it farther than that. It is a thriller of the most 'popcorn' dimensions, but of actors who have brought much to other roles, I expected a little more. Also, throwing in Vince Vaughn as good measure to get laughs doesn't help matters either.It might be worth watching one night on cable, or even local TV, but I wouldn't recommend Mr. & Mrs. Smith to see in the theaters- it's a film that starts of with earnest to entertain, and descends into non-sense (and not the good, laughable kind). Not a total dud, but it is one of the disappointments for me of the 2005 summer movie season.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Clever, Comedic, and Un-Contained","""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a fast-paced comedy about a husband and wife who live secret lives. John and Jane Smith are assassins working for different companies, and their world is flipped upside down when they learn of each other's double lives. This film is very enjoyable on a number of levels - humanitarian, comedic, and action-oriented. The director, Doug Liman, shows how these two characters struggle to not only save their own lives, but save their marriage as well. In a Hitchcockian fashion, the humor is based around the idea that the audience knows something the protagonists do not. When the discovery of each other's true identity is made, classic Hitchcockian suspense is used in a number of interesting sequences. The action in the film is not only entertaining, but smart. I am reminded of the Gene Kelly dance sequences at the end of the 50's Big Band musicals because the action is passionate and reveals the characters' emotions. The stylized choreography is visually pleasing and clever. In conclusion, this film has a solid script and cast, and reveals the ups and downs of marriage in a modern and fun way. If you like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""The Matrix,"" or even ""Singin' in the Rain,"" then I highly recommend this film. Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Great star-cast but screenplay falls flat.,"Plot Outline: Six years after marriage John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smiths are bored of each other. The marriage counseling too seems to fail. Unknown to each other, they lead secret lives as contract killers. The drama unfolds as they discover that their next target is their spouse.Comment: Although the plot outline and the trailers seem enticing, the biggest attraction for this movie is its star-cast. However, as the movie unfolds, it feels that it there is a void in the story-telling. The vacuum increases as the movie progresses. Some of the SFX are not up to the mark. The best of Gen-next gizmos are shown with Jolie's team on the screen as they zero in on their next targets.The only reprieve in the movie is the slick action sequences and the ready to kill looks of the stars.

Oh its Good,"The chemistry between angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt is priceless in the film.

The film is filled with witty lines and great action that really pulls the viewer in. There are some epic shoot out scenes in the movie that are worth the watch. There were so many moments that made me laugh. The only downfall to the film was the use of a camera that shakes a bit in some of the scenes, I think they were trying to give the movie a more ""realistic feel"", which was unnecessary. The biggest thing this movie has going for itself is that it succeeded in making a perfect balance.

A metaphor for marriage...,"This movie...I just love it. At first, it was just because of the chemistry of the two stars, both so beautiful to look at and hear.But then, the much deeper meaning of the movie started to become clear. The whole thing is a giant metaphor to what many of do in marriages/long-term relationships. The marriage counseling at the beginning and end just sealed this for me. Starting off hiding true selves, becoming bored with the fake life you built together, hurting each other in serious ways, and then, finally, letting each other see the entirety of who you are to establish true intimacy.The action scenes are fun, and what you'd expect.

The basic idea is great, but I think the producers should have left out a big load of ammo and spent the then saved money on at least having someone proof read the script. Somehow I get the feeling I'd rather read the book, then at least I could expect to get all of the logical flaws of the story explained -- but unfortunately there is no such book.This is truly Hollywood at it's worst, with absolutely no respect for the movie audience, only for their dollar bills.

I definitely give this a 10 out of 10. The movie starts out with a Psyciatrist talking to Mr. and Mrs. Smith about their marriage, and the first couple of lines are pretty good such as, ""How often do you have sex?"" Mrs. Smith replies with ""I don't understand the question."" Hardly any drugs, some violence more along the lines of physical comedy, such as John kicking his wife as hard as he can...

It is violent, disrespectful to the sanctity of marriage, and predictable, I yawned throughout the movie. I wonder if it would ever be possible for two big ""stars"" to make a movie about a relationship that is based on honesty, forgiveness, tolerance, and integrity.

SUCH IS NOT THE CASE WITH this waste of money called ""ms & Mrs smith"". she has talent as does Pitt. however, whoever wrote the script does NOT have talent. as a writer, i know i could have done better 15 years ago! therefore, this film is NOTHING BUT EYE CANDY for straights, gays and anyone in between. Jolie and Pitt are indeed sex symbols and rightly so--they're both hot. not only are they smart, eloquent and seem to hone their craft with every movie but they look good on camera and fantastic on the big screen. so this film i recommend for total eye candy value, so if you crave light, fluffy cotton candy rather than a cinematic snack of substance, then this film is for you. otherwise, go rent ""amelie"" or ""iris"", two fantastic foreign films of depth.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Even with it's tongue in it's cheek, not very enjoyable...","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsAfter meeting and starting a fiery romance in Bogata, Columbia, John (Brad Pitt) and Jane (Angelina Jolie) are now a happily married suburban couple going on for five years of marriage. But then they learn that they are both, well, secret agents and that their next assignments is to, well, kill each other. Cue complications and comedic capers from there...Nothing gets a bad film rolling quite like publicity. Especially when that publicity becomes bigger than the actual film itself. The publicity in this case being the supposed 'Brad and Angelina' romance that sparked up on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith, rumoured to being behind the big tabloidy break-up of Hollywood golden couple Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. No doubt Mr & Mrs Smith has raked in considerable takings at the box office as a result. And it seems all the bad reviews and the actual poor quality of the film can't change that...I'm not sure if it was aware of it or not, but the whole thing just seems like some big spin on Schwarzenegger's 1994 hit True Lies. But nowhere near the quality. As events roll on, the absurdity of the plot just gets at you so much, you really know this is a part-comedic film with it's tongue in it's cheek, but the stupidity of it all reeks just the same. The action itself is a collection of the usual loud bangs and thuds that we've been seeing in movies lately. Interspersed in one of these scenes is a supposedly 'comedic' bit, where Pitt and Jolie engage in some hand-to-hand combat in their home, where you can't help but think of the growing amount of domestic abuse cases in the country and how some weak-minded individual may see that and be tempted to go home one night and re-enact some of that on their spouse. There is a disturbingly casual attitude to violence and aggression hinted at throughout the entire film, but that is the one that stuck in my mind the hardest.Performances wise, Pitt is his usual wooden self and Vince Vaughn is incredibly irritating as his on-screen buddy. Adam Brody is an impressively sarcastic villain and Jolie has an incredibly sultry, sexy presence to her (as usual), but doesn't really rise to any great heights in her role.Overall, this is a daft, unfunny and pretty unsuccessful film that, for the most part, just fails miserably to do anything right and has only done as well as it has by falling on the band-wagon of all the superfluous off-screen publicity it's two leading stars have generated between them. **",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Pretty ridiculous,"While Angelina Jolie is smokin' hot, and Brad Pitt may be the same, putting two good-looking actors onto the screen with guns and telling them to shot people without looking at them doesn't exactly translate into a good movie.This is where things go wrong for 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith,' whose relationship is strained by secrets. This secret? Both are secret agents, whose spouses assume they hold an entirely different and not-as-cool job.Once each discover who the other really is, it's up to husband and wife to figure out if they'd rather love the other or kill the other. The banter between the two when they initially try to kill one another is the best parts of the film, and are parts that truly are enjoyable. However, it's when the two decide they'd rather fight together against an undefined and easily-defeated villain that things get messy.The villain is no threat, apparently, to this super-smokin married duo who seem to be playing in a romantic comedy with lots of shooting than anything else. What's more, is the audience never really knows who the villain is or why they are a threat to Mr. and Mrs. Smith; we're just supposed to all assume that they for no explained reason want to kill the couple and Pitt, with his 50 or 60 career kills, and Jolie, with her 312, will take them out without hardly a scratch. (This includes the ""climactic"" scene where it's about 2-on-30 but they take out the baddies without a problem).Unexplained, undefined, and beyond ridiculous once the actual fun of the couple's banter is over with, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' is not, and shouldn't be, Doug Liman's crowning achievement as a director.

As the movie progressed, I became more and more involved in the storyline. Excellent performances by Pitt and Jolie, and I was amazed at the on-screen chemistry they shared. I could definitely see why the tabloids are so involved in their ""relationship"". Perfect roles for both of them, especially Angelina because she just has the right on-screen charisma.

But for my wife I would have went home half way through.The plot started slowly, so I was bored for the first fifteen minutes to begin with. When we finally got to the action it was monotonous. The dialogue was hardly riveting, although there was the odd funny line. Brad Pitt looked throughout like the whole thing was an exercise in self indulgence. Jolie, less so.To me this was the Warof the Roses with explosives, although I much preferred the War of the Roses to this.

Mr and Mrs Smith - Awkward Couple,"'Awkward' is probably the best word I could use to describe the on screen chemistry between this supposedly married couple of 5 or 6 years. While Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are fine actors respectively, together they just didn't sell it. Another viewer I overheard as we were making our way out of the theatre commented that they had a ""totally unrealistic relationship"", which I have to agree with. For two supposed spies/hit men to not realize that they are each living a fictitious life with one another is somewhat ridiculous. Where did they park their instincts? The worst of the unrealistic points of this movie has to be when Mr. and Mrs. Smith face off. There is just something disturbing about a husband smashing his wife up against the wall and repeated blows to her abdomen. But I don't want to spoil all of the fun here, let's just say that there are two saving graces in this film, Jolie's ass whooping fight scenes and Vince Vaughan's character is a hoot! I wouldn't have thought that he could shine any brighter than he did in Be Cool, but once again Vaughan has captured my heart as the whacked out underdog in this role.I think that this movie is somewhat ill-suited for the kiddies, the violence and the occasional profanity is really driven more towards the teenagers and up crowd.reel2reel.blogspot.com",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

In which case, hire Mike Myers and turn it into an Austin Powers movie.But I liked Doug Liman's Swingers and Go, and I think Angelina Jolie is not-of-this earth beautiful, so figured it was worth a matinée viewing.I seriously underestimated this movie.The story ""A"" which you are familiar with from the previews (why two assassins married without knowing the other's identity and are eventually tasked with killing one another) is indeed preposterous and sorta lame at the same time, but they found a way to make it work. Except for a few stylish set pieces with big guns and various spy toys, the director wisely chooses to barely sketch that plot in. Instead, he focuses on the more interesting story ""B"" -- which is a close examination of marriage itself. The plus to this approach is that Pitt and Jolie are on the screen verbally and physically sparring with one another for almost every frame. There is definitely chemistry between the two and that helps to make the physical fights between them (gut-punching, drop kicking, stabbing, etc.) almost sexy. It also helps that you believe Angelina Jolie could actually kick Brad Pitt's ass. Thus, its a fair fight and not misogyny when he gets the occasional punch in.The dialog was also excellent-- vastly wittier than the usual banter you would find in a typical romantic comedy. Maybe it had something to do with the reputed 100 re-writes and numerous writers this script went through, but my hat is off to whoever honed the dialog.Even though the writing is great and the choices the director made were spot on, credit for this film's success is definitely with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. They are both frighteningly beautiful and completely assured in this movie. You can't take your eyes off them. For this film at least, they were definitely worth whatever millions they were paid.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Movie That Forgot The Time,"The film just didn't seem to want to end, even though it should have much sooner than it did.

"Just  excellent, fun, funny, summertime popcorn cinema","Think about it folks...Who goes into the summer movie season to see highbrow art-house films?That's what I thought. This movie was a genuine relief away from action movies and only special effects reliant movies that have been dominating the screens for several years. Was it the most plausible? No, its a summer movie, was it the most believable, no it's a summer movie. Was it the funnest I've seen this year (and I've seen quite a bit) the answer is definitely yes! Action sequences by Doug Liman are in top form (as good if not better than the Bourne Identity).Two things in my humble opinion make this movie stand out.1) The rebirth of the one liner! Throughout the movie, the script never faltered or got stale and repetitive. (yes we know the back and forth cat and mouse is repetitive) but the script didn't. The lines are delivered believably and seriously when need be. There weren't two stick figures trying to act out lines that have passion, hate, anger, humor behind them like another summer movie that is the end of a legacy ( you get the hint).2) On screen chemistry makes it's return to the screen. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie appear to be perfectly suited to act opposite each other, their chemistry is that good. I haven't had this much fun since The Thomas Crown Affair with Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo.Overall, if your looking for a fun, action packed, popcorn munching movie with great sound and special effects.

Neither The Humour Nor The Action Are As Good As I Was Expecting,"Let's start with the positive. I liked the basic storyline. John and Jane are both assassins working for rival criminal organizations of some sort. They meet while on an assignment in Colombia and fall in love and get married, but neither knows what the other does for a living. Unfortunately, when their respective organizations discover that they're now a couple, they order them to kill each other, and when that doesn't happen they join forces to eliminate them both. That sounded creative and intriguing. I also liked both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in the title roles. They worked pretty well together and they brought a lot of energy to their roles, as well as doing a good job of portraying the mix of emotions required: bored in their marriage after ""five or six years"" (John doesn't seem sure!), desperately trying to kill each other one minute after they find each other out, then desperately in love the next. The opening and closing scenes in the therapists' office (mostly the opening) were also quite humorous. For all those positives, though, there was a lot here that didn't work.The pacing was off. The humour here seemed sporadic and inconsistent. Actually, aside from that opening scene there really wasn't that much that I found funny. This movie would have worked well as a comedy with some action thrown in; instead, it seemed to want to be an action movie with a bit of comedy every now and then. The action itself was restricted largely to the last third or so of the movie, and then consisted mostly of a gigantic shootout. If you like guns blazing I guess it was exciting, but I found it became old pretty quickly. To be blunt, I was expecting something a lot more entertaining.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Pitt and Jolie work well together and I would describe it more of a comedy than an action movie. There were several laughs from the crowd.

Plastic,"Stupid, unsexy and boring. The actors are unbelievable and basically just pose through the whole film. Vince Vaugh is unbelievably irritating, Pitt and Jolie are their usual bland selves; it's like watching mannequin robots for two hours. I guess my problem is that I have never found either Jolie or Pitt particularly sexy or interesting.One word to describe the script: childish. Apparently the old myth that all the Hollywood films are made for 12 year old girl really are true. Although this time the target audience seems to be a bit more precise: domesticated wives and husbands with the emotional capacity of a 12 year old girl who think it's titillating to equate marriage with competing hit men.And yeah, it seems the guy who wrote the script is the same one who managed to destroy X- Men III (along with Zak Penn and Rattner). So no wonder. From now on I really have to remember to avoid anything done by them.The stars I give are for the technical quality of the film which is pretty good.

A Future Classic With A Classic Pairing,"I loved, loved, LOVED this film. It was fun, witty, exciting and oh, so sexy! Director Liman delivered a fast-paced entertainment that had me grinning and laughing scene after scene. One of the things I love most about it is that it doesn't take itself seriously, so the viewer shouldn't, either. I was so surprised to see others commenting about how unbelievable it is, how implausible. Of course, it's unbelievable. But isn't that part of the ""over-the-top"" point of the film? From what I can tell, the film delivered almost all it promised along with a lot of surprises along the way. I also think it's a hilarious commentary on marriage and partnership and how hard it can be to lay yourself bare and share yourself and your life with another person totally. The message is delivered in an utterly outrageous way, but it's still there.The Smiths entered their marriage for myriad reasons, primary perhaps for both in their minds being that they needed covers for their secret careers as assassins. Deep down, though, you could tell they really loved each other. When they find out that they've been living a lie for the past 5 (or 6) years, they are both hurt that they placed their trust in the other person and that trust was betrayed (ironic considering that they've both been doing an awful lot of lying) and to top it off, they've been ordered to kill each other by their agencies. They react to the hurt and betrayal (while carrying out their assignments) in the only way two volatile people with weapons training can. The result is the most beautiful demolition of a mini mansion ever conceived. I mean, really. The person that you are closest to can evoke the most passionate feelings in you that run the spectrum from deepest tenderness to flat out homicide. As much as you've wanted to hug and cuddle them, how many times have you also wanted to grab your significant other and choke him/her? This film takes it there and beyond. I think my favorite scene in the film was when the Smiths tossed away their firearms and went at it mano a mano and tried with all that was in them to stomp each other into the ground. I loved that! Mrs. Smith gives as good as she gets and I just cannot stretch my brain to fit Nicole Kidman (original Mrs. Smith) in this role that seemed to require so much physicality and attitude.As to my feeling that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are a classic pairing, I don't think Mr. Pitt has burned up the screen this thoroughly with anyone besides George Clooney . . . and certainly not to this degree. Before this film, I wasn't what could be called a mad fan of either of them, but I liked them both. I am now ready to declare them the ultimate match of all the contemporary Hollywood stable has to offer. Not only are they both gorgeous, they're perfectly-matched in talent. I mean, you can toss two beautiful people together in a film and your results can vary (see Pitt and Julia Roberts in The Mexican), but this pairing was downright combustible. The script was good, but I think the film coasts by primarily because of the two leads. I really don't think it would have been this entertaining with Kidman. My first love will always be classic films and I'm so blown away by the pairing of Pitt and Jolie, I'm likening them in my mind to other classic pairings like Hayworth and Ford, Bogart and Bacall, Ladd and Lake, Hepburn and Tracy (okay, and Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas because I love them so much I just can't leave them out) - so natural, it just doesn't get any better. Pairings you will still be talking about for years to come.Yes, there were holes in the story - it wasn't perfect. It would have been nice to have had the heads of both agencies revealed in the end for a face-to-face showdown and I personally found the way Mrs. Smith found out about Mr. Smith's day job to be a bit vague, but to me this is forgivable. It's not meant to be Hitchcock. I went with escapism and a bit of fun in mind and the film delivered that and more, so I'm happy. My personal definition of a ""classic"" is a film you can watch over and over again and never tire of the magic you get from it. I'll most likely see it one more time before it leaves the theatres and I'll be among the first in line when this DVD comes out just so that I can have it at home to watch over and over again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Tolerable Popcorn Film,"The action/comedy ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" succeeds only when it focuses on its charismatic lead actors, who trade verbal barbs like punches. Whenever Mr. Smith (Brad Pitt) and Mrs. Smith (Angelina Jolie) are on screen together, their chemistry makes up for a paper-thin plot. However, the film loses its course when fulfilling the action obligation of the genre. The action scenes are loud and filmed with a trembling hand by director Doug Liman (Go, The Bourne Identity). Further, the unnamed foe is altogether disinteresting: all the baddies are 'jobbers'; not one is a 'real' character in the film (heck, we don't even see their faces!).Thankfully, the comedy half is much better. There are times when this film is genuinely funny (again only in the scenes with Mr. Pitt and Ms. Jolie) and times when it is not (usually those scenes with Vince Vaughn, who is cast as the clichéd best friend).Overall ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is dumb fun. It's the kind of film you won't regret paying money to see, but not one that holds up well under scrutiny. Then again, this sort of film isn't supposed to be analysed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I also liked how their gadgets and guns were hidden all around the house, that was pretty awesome. What I liked most about the characters was that they were believable. They still had feeling for each other and humor was seen. I think the levels of humor and action was good.

Predictable and ignorantly biased,"Watching a marry-go-round arouses more emotions than this completely predictable movie. Besides, it's an insult to the people of Bogota, Colombia, depicted in the first scenes as a hot Mexican shanty village with gunfire, smoke and chickens in its streets, untidy hotel rooms and golden toothed police officers. Bogota is in fact one of the most modern, beautiful and safest metropolis in Latin America with nothing to envy to Chicago, Berlin or Buenos Aires, a murder rate lower than Washington D.C., and a springtime, somewhat cold weather. Director Doug Liman either is too disrespectful or never made any research for his film, at least on the wikipedia website. Whether they want it or not, Hollywood filmmakers are trendsetters and form opinions, so they have a great responsibility especially when referring to actual places or cultures. Otherwise they might reinforce biased stereotypes and unnecessarily hurt susceptibilities.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I smell a sequel,"This is a killer -excuse the pun- movie! This movie is a great twist to the kind of romance that we typically call a chick flick. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as a married couple who live like ships passing in the night. I love the scene in the beginning where they are getting ready for work. They wake up in the same bed, get dressed in the same closet, and all the while they say about ten words to each other. To finish the scene, they drive out of the same garage but turn opposite directions out of the driveway. How much more disconnected can a married couple get? Anyway, this movie is definitely a guy's romance.Some of the scenes may be a bit flaky at times but the plot is well thought out and keeps your attention. The ending leaves a bit to be desired and critics may count this as a flaw to the film, but I think it serves as a good cliffhanger.I also would like to vent my frustrations toward critics. The fact is they are just that - CRITICs. Their job is to tell us what sucks about a movie and how the production crew could have done a better job. If a critic's job involves telling us why decent movies suck, then why do we regard them as movie gods? It seems a little hypocritical to think that they can tell us how a movie could be better when most critics have never even been involved in the production of a major motion picture. Have you ever noticed a theme among movies that critics give good ratings? A ""good"" film is almost never a comedy, action, horror, or kid's film. ""Good"" movies are almost exclusively sappy dramas that are hardly entertaining to many moviegoers. I may be a bit critical of critics, but the point is that YOU know what kind of movies YOU like so use your own judgment before you let some guy in the newspaper tell you what movie to see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
a bright comedy about marriage,"I think many married couples would appreciate an angle at which long-term relationships are shown in this movie -- spouses as hidden assassins who do not know much about each other is an interesting analogy. This movie is a great entertainment, although has weaknesses -- some scenes are too protracted. As some reviewers noted, the plot is not always believable -- nothing is wrong about it! Most of Hollywood movies are fairy tales by nature, just expressed in modern language and making use of modern technology. But the essence and purpose of a fairy tale has not changed over centuries. Nobody would expect a fairy tale to be exactly realistic, so why take comedy plot twists too explicitly? The analogy can be extended -- the characters are somewhat simplified, so the actors play more types than persons, the situation as a whole is implausible, etc. But the film has a very strong drive, Pitt and Jolie are a perfect duet, the humor is sharp and the tale has its moral. I believe this film would both entertain and make you think for a minute (or more) how strange are manifestations of life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

He will love it. She will love it. Jen will despise it.,"As an action movie, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is explosive with trigger happy gun brawls. As a romantic comedy this movie is as charming and as funny as any Meg Ryan Tom Hanks collaboration. This movie has the ability to meet the needs of all types of moviegoers, but be advised to leave the kids at home.The movie opens with our couple at a marriage counseling session that updates with the progression of the movie and the status of their relationship, which turn out to be some of the most hilarious parts of the movie. Mr. and Mrs. Smith like any marriage, has its secrets. But to Mr John Smith and Mrs Jane Smith, these secrets can be deadly. At home they lead the normal lives as all couples do: agree with or disregard his sense of interior decoration, like or pretend to like her homemade cooking. At the office they lead, not just secret lives, but top secret lives as Mr and Mrs Smith both turn out to be top hit men (or woman) at two different organizations. However, after getting assigned the same mark, they get involved in each other's business and soon after get their new assignments: each other... developing into a dangerous, and hilarious relationship.The premise may seem like True Lies without the Austrian Accent. True Lies also showcased a superspy whose secret life intertwined with his personal life. What sets Mr and Mrs Smith apart is less focus on their missions and more focus on their interaction and the suspense and hilarity of their relationship's development.Doug Liman has definitely come a long way since the independent days of Swingers. However, even with his move from Swingers and Go to his bigger scale movies of Bourne Identity and Mr and Mrs Smith, he maintains his keen ability to connect with the audience. In other words, despite the bright lights and razzle dazzle, for lack of a better term, necessary in an action flick, he finds room for the audience to get engaged into the characters and what will come of their relationship... of its continuity or its termination.One person who wouldn't bear to watch a single minute of this is poor Jen Aniston. Publicity stunt or not, all the tabloid gossip about Mr and Mrs Smith off camera has definitely helped it in the box office. But more importantly the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie on screen set the foundation for the movie, and without that chemistry the movie wouldn't have worked. Both actors have proved to be tremendously talented actors (See Fight Club and Girl Interrupted) not to mention eye candy... I'd sell my soul for one night with Angelina and I'm not afraid to admit that anyone would kill to have abs like Brad.Their chemistry, acting ability, and sexual appeal were all necessary for this movie to work. Imagine if instead they clashed like Mr Smith played by Tom Cruise and Mrs Smith played by, I don't know Katie Holmes? Or if their acting needed polishing like Hayden Christensen alongside Paris Hilton. And not to say anything about their sex lives, but what if they had the sex appeal of Horatio Sanz with Chyna. No nothing else seems to work. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were made for this movie.With a duo of that magnitude, this movie was certain to be a hit. It was refreshing to find that it wasn't misleading and that Mr and Mrs Smith delivered a package that was able to charm you, hold you in suspense, make you laugh hysterically, and make you want to wet your pants and make out with the girl next to you.I can't think of anything wrong about this movie. Whether your fix is gunfire and cracking necks or if its enchanted moments and steamy sex appeal, you will be satisfied. To top it off Doug Liman reached back into the vault of the legendary Swingers world and resurrected good old T money Trent. Not only should you see it but see it again. Bring a date or two, and then tell your friends and family. This movie is classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Espionage for two,"Doug Liman, the director of Swingers and The Bourne Identity to name a few brings us a pitch perfect action, romantic comedy about lies and deception in a marriage based around two spies working for different agencies that send them to kill one another. The idea while simple is executed brilliantly and this movie is fun from start to finish. The movie is like a cat and mouse game between Jolie and Pitt as they both discover slowly throughout the course of the first half of the movie who the other one is.The script is extremely hilarious and brings out the best and worst in any marriage. The chemistry is striking between the two actors who are as convincing as any couple who are faking their marriage one day at a time. While not every married couple can relate to the whole spy and espionage business, one cannot deny how dead on the two act as a married couple and the things they argue and agree on. Bringing Hollywood's best and brightest might have been a stretch for another film trying to get people to see a movie that 95% of all major studios said no to, but the brilliance behind this movie is how well the two work together and the dynamic scenes they create with energy and enthusiasm of that of professional actors. I have see a lot of movies with both of these actors and I honestly think that this film is the best movie either one has been in simply because it is a simple role but still requires skill to pull off which these two certainly do. There are some great action set pieces that will shock and awe as well as a heart pounding car cash that's better than most in film like this.

They pull it off well, and the entire movie comes together very smoothly. And in addition to a great story, the chemistry between Jolie and Pitt is absolutely evident ~ a perfect way to add fire to an already great story. If you like love stories but frequently find them too sappy, or if you like action flicks but frequently get bored by gratuitous violence, you'll probably like this movie, which strikes a nice balance between both. Pitt hasn't exactly been praised to the podium in his decade of performances, but personally I love his dry sense of humor in every role he does. He is very smooth, and has an endearing smirk throughout this movie towards her which drives her nuts. Both stars cut it up, with Angelie playing her vintage hard body beeotch like she always does. She really helps my reflexes when it comes to finding the mute button. This makes for a great date flick for many reasons. One obvious reason is you both have something to look at, but it does entertain, and is almost Roger Moore cheesy funny Bondish in a good way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"The ""Whole Nine Yards"" revisited!","Thinking that a Brad Pitt - Angelina Jollie movie would be pretty good was our first mistake. This movie had some sizzle at the start with some good flashbacks, a little sex, and some humor. But after that, there was very little to keep us interested.In fact, this is one of the very few movies that we actually considered walking out of after only 45 minutes.This movie does have some funny spots, and a couple of good action sequences. One pretty good car chase was a hi-lite, but its a sad day when your #1 rated movie of the weekend.... leaves you wanting ""less"".We ranked this movie a ""4"", only because we stayed until the end. Had we followed our instincts and left early, we would have been able to beat the rush home and not missed a rerun of the WHOLE NINE YARDS on Cable. Which incidentally, would be a pretty fair comparison to MR and MRS SMITH.... IE: Top actors ... poor movie!Giving this a rating of 4 is fair.... there are enough fun spots to keep you interested. Just don't go see this movie if your expecting the Pitt-Jolie factor to make it one of the better movies of the year.Save your $$ and wait for the Rental...",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"My favorite film of 2005 (the first half, anyway)","Doug Liman's short directing career is remarkable. Look at his track record. An instant classic in ""Swingers,"" then two movies later an unexpected blockbuster ""Bourne Identity"" due in no small part to his guidance, and now another overachiever, ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith."" I have to say I wasn't overly impressed with the trailers i had seen for this. But with Liman's name on it and an interesting premise, and because my girlfriend and I missed ""Cinderella Man"" by five minutes, there we were watching it.From the beginning I had a feeling I was going to like it. Its humor seemed to hit the mark and it had just the right tone. It starts out appropriately enough with the couple (who unfortunately we know from the trailers are both assassins) in marriage counseling. Both actors seem fully invested in their characters. A strong start.Sure there's a lot of killing and the film seems to sort of make light of it. But this is just a big fantasy, a huge stretch of reality as any good action/adventure film should be. It's a study in the marriage relationship and reminds those so wed of how they just want to wring each other's necks sometimes, even thought they love each other deeply. Why? Communication. Turns out real problem with the Smith marriage is that they're hiding the biggest side of their lives from each other. They're the only ones each other has to talk to about assassination-related issues buy they can't (how frustrating is that?) Then once their occupations are discovered and their pitted against each other, the film slides toward the couple's reconciliation--or rather, will they or won't they? If they do, will it stick? Will one kill the other before they give it a fair shot? There's a lot of possibilities during this section of the film, a great luxury for a film to have.This achieves for ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" one of the most important elements of a good film story most these films days are lacking: a true sense of jeopardy for any main character. At any point during this film I thought it was possible for either of these characters to get bumped off. Somehow, it would've made thematic sense for it to happen to either of them. What's more, you give a damn! This suspense lasts to nearly the end of the film until the satisfying conclusion is reached.""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is my favorite film of the year so far and one of only a few I actually want to see again (a definite DVD purchase).",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Mr. and Mrs. Gunman Don't Really Score **12,"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie do make a nice couple.Their marriage has its hangups but whose doesn't? Trouble is that their life has been a lie. They are both hit people for different organizations.They live in a magnificent mansion and he complains about her cooking.The fun begins when they are both given the assignment to take out the same person. When this fails, they discover each other's real work and the fireworks start. A memorable fight ensues in their home similar to what we saw in ""War of the Roses."" As they point the guns towards each other, they realize that they love one another.Finding out what is really going on becomes the main theme. Unfortunately, the movie soon deteriorates into a huge shoot 'em up battle scenes on a highway. We get some funny lines between the shots where they confess their ""real lives.""

First comment,"To me, I was excited through the entire movie. I saw it with my mom and even she, as critical of movies as she is, loved it. I enjoyed the overall plot and i believe Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were a good choice for the main actor and actress in this movie. Sure their lives don't seem much like a hit-man's...and how they meet is a bit awkward, those is the only weird parts to me but it did not prevent me from enjoying the movie. I would suggest seeing it while it is still in theaters (it adds to the excitement). Oh and one more thing, don't see it JUST because Angelina Jolie is in it, then you might find yourself looking at her every scene instead of paying attention to the actual movie ;)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A funny and action-packed good time----8/10,"Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a refreshing alternative to to the kiddie CG flicks and stale comedies that have filled the multiplexes recently (and the only other movie i wanted to see this summer besides Star Wars). It's a classic action-comedy that pits two big stars against each other and about a thousand baddies, bickering all the while. Though usually action-comedy means cops, Smith adds a twist and makes it a pair of married assassins, played by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The chemistry between the two stars is why Smith is so entertaining. Not only do they look good, but they seem to know the married life well, and deliver their sharp lines with hilarious punch. If you don't acknowledge the existence of idiotic tabloids, you will enjoy this chemistry a lot more.The actions scenes are good for being PG-13, (though an R rating would have given us some gratuitous Jolie skin shots) and with this kind of movie you don't really need blood, though it wouldn't hurt. The fight in the Smith house is my favorite scene because it is funny and has them beating the crap out of each other. Same with the freeway chase.While the movie is a lot of fun, the plot is paper thin and predictable (mostly because of the film's trailer) and ends kind of abruptly. Still, this is what an action comedy should be like; plenty of bullets, great chemistry between the stars, and hilarious dialogue. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is one of the best movies of the year.---8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Had to fast forward halfway in.,"I love all the actors, but the plot just doesn't stick. It's a marketing project more than a work of art. ""Hey let's put Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as a couple, but really.... They are assassins. Genius ! And let's make sure we don't miss a single product placement opportunity.""",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Underwhelming,"Mr. and Mrs. Smith had just about everything one could ask for. Two actors who, when cast correctly, could excel. If you dispute that, you obviously haven't seen Fight Club or Girl, Interrupted. A premise that, if executed properly, could translate into an awesome story. A budget that, if utilised properly, could fund a no-holds-barred, knuckle-down action sequence or four. You may have noticed by now that I am qualifying every one of those statements. The reason I did so is because the people responsible for this film did none of these things. The actors, while doing a credible job, get to capitalise on few, if any, of their strengths. Jolie does a great job of acting out the conflict she feels at her assignment, but Pitt is not even able to play to the sick sense of humour that he showed he had down to an art in Fight Club (which is somewhat amusingly referenced late in this film).The story is as deep as a puddle, which is the first strike against the film. Two mercenaries meet while on assignment in a South American country where the police have the power to detain anyone they feel looks suspicious. Two mercenaries get married. Two mercenaries live together for six years without any idea of what the other's real profession is. Fast forward six years, and both mercenaries are seeing a marriage counselor because they are starting to tire of their union. Then they both find themselves on the same assignment. Once they learn the truth behind one another's cover stories, all hell breaks loose, and both of their agencies decide they are a liability. Cue some Rambo-esquire scenes where both professionals hit their enemy with two or three out of four shots, while the enemy cannot hit the sidewalk with a can of paint. Admittedly, one of these sequences where four cars are progressively destroyed was a clever idea, but the lack of any depth to any of the characters leaves one checking their watch as the frames roll by.The second problem, which merely serves to compound the first, is that the director seems to have a major problem with letting the audience see what is happening during his action sequences. The camera weaves about in so many directions during the climactic battle that one cannot help but think the director was drunk. I've heard the defence used for this technique so many times that it is meant to place the viewer in the action. It does nothing of the kind. Fortunately, it only gave me headaches this time, but as one popular critic puts it, the first rule of any action scene should be that the audience gets to see the action. The second rule of any action scene should be that ***the audience gets to see the action***. How many times do we have to point this out before Hollywood gets the message and realised that replacing the current MPAA with one whose colons aren't able to produce diamonds is the answer, not producing films these morons consider ""safe"" by shaking the hell out of the camera?Apart from the shaky-cam, which has caused me to bite chunks out of my tongue in some films, Mr. and Mrs. Smith also suffers from a distinct lack of structuring. It is almost as if Simon Kinberg decided we would automatically care about his married heroes, and decided they did not need any background. You know about as much about them when the film ends as you do when the opening credits roll. Compare this with Grosse Pointe Blank, where John Cusack's character starts out as your everyday man in a job he is bored with, reunites with an old girlfriend, starts comparing his past with a number of more domestic possible futures, and discovers he is wanted to hit a target that makes him have a crisis of conscience. I doubt that the people who put Mr. and Mrs. Smith together would even be able to spell the phrase ""crisis of conscience"". Neither of these assassins even indicate that they know what a crisis or a conscience is. When both actors do scenes in which they indicate they feel their marriage is boring and formulaic, their body language suggests that they believe this of the film. The audience certainly will about fifty-five minutes in.There are films that are so good they achieve immortality, both for themselves and the people who made them. There are some films that are so stupid they are brilliant, or so bad they are excellent. Mr. and Mrs. Smith fits into neither of these categories. It is not even good enough to pass for a mildly distracting action film. Nor is it good enough to pass for a saleable Mills & Boon. By failing to fall into any of these applicable categories, it falls into No Man's Land. See it if you can get in cheaply, but otherwise, it is not worth the effort.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Let's put this in perspective,"I did not enjoy this movie, despite giving it 60 minutes to capture my attention. My wife is a fan of Brad Pitt (looks over talent, to which she'll agree) and I rented the movie as a surprise for her. My choice in films usually tends to the more serious; I guess this is a reflection of my age (32) and the reasons I watch them, which include a desire to be immersed in another reality, like fiction, but with characters or situations I can identify with. However, if I cannot directly identify with the plot I am open to learning more about myself through characterisation and the themes of the writer and director.This week I also saw 'Batman Begins', and I found this to be dark, engaging, and well worth the rental price. 'Mr & Mrs Smith' was more like an extended music video, or trailer, and I could not continue watching after an hour. My wife soldiered on, but even she was disappointed. Having two attractive actors does not make a film! I found the discussion on other posts distracting when they became immersed in whether one can state ""This movie is really bad"" or likewise. Surely the point of this forums is to provoke debate about the merits of each film? Many people read these before spending money on seeing a film, and I am happy to put my opinion across in a constructive manner to allow them to make informed choices.I fear that Brad's best days are behind him (12 Monkeys) and he is content to be a major box office draw who performs in below-average films (see Oceans Twelve - an unmitigated disaster). Compare Clooney's ouevre with Pitt's for an idea of a man who is both handsome and talented.Lecture over.

Good mixture of action and comedy,"When i stepped into the ""Kino I'm HB""-cinema in Zürich, Switzerland, to watch one of the first screenings of MR. AND MRS.

Here's my comment:The beginning is quite funny and despite my dislike of the male actor I have to admit that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt complement each other perfectly. Even when the bullets start to fly all over the screen, the movie maintains it's fun atmosphere.The only part I was a little bothered by was the scene in the shopping center and that's why I gave MR. AND MRS. SMITH only 8 out of 10 stars, but all in all I enjoyed the movie and I think I have to revise my opinion of Brad Pitt.The best thing of this movie is without doubt Angelina Jolie, who is once again so attractive and sexy that you ask yourself why she hasn't found a husband 'till now.Maybe it works this time with Brad Pitt... :)",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Mr & Mrs Smith wreck hovac,"It now all seems pretty obvious that some films would bring two main cast members together for the part they play. Rarely, this would lead to real-life romance and a fairytale marriage. Sometimes, it would lead to lengthy legal battles through the process of their divorce proceedings and Mr & Mrs Smith is a classic example that starred Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. On the film itself, it seems to be the stuff based on Jason Bourne or James Bond about a married couple whom wreck hovac in their property by trying to kill each other after learning about their espionages.Of course if the reality was so glamorous, real-life espionage usually isn't like that with the way we see it on film. Most people working in undercover would mainly lead to basic living and slipping the net. On Mr & Mrs Smith, the film contains some ridiculously unworkable plots and extreme violence while some of the action is unexciting and dreary. I'm pretty certain that some users might disagree undercover work but this is how it usually turns out to be.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not everything is always what it seems -- living double lives -- the spy game continues,"What do you get when you cross a Tomb Raider with a Troy? Another Spy Game and even better! Mr. and Mrs. Smith is one of the best movies ever made about the subject of espionage. In addition, Angelina Jolie is an amazing actor and one of the most gorgeous women in the history of the world. Brad Pitt, equally, is one of the most talented and top fifteen, best actors of all time. There was no way this movie could lose. It won. Five stars. Hands downthe quintessential and unequivocal, ""spies next door"" movie. Perfectly scripted. Perfectly cast. Perfectly executed. Perfectly choreographed. Perfectly balanced. Perfect length. Perfect. Mr. and Mrs. Smith could not have been any better. Badass, kick ass fight scenes. Matrix style moves. As high tech as could possibly be. Truly intriguing. The cinematography is brilliantcrisp and rich. Sharp. Greatly defined. Bold. Daring. Extraordinarily textured. Breathtaking. Heart racing. Pulse-pounding. Suspenseful. Explosive! Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a movie that's so good, so remarkable, so incredibly exciting, that even if you're law abiding and non-violent, you want to hurt someone who says something bad about it. It's that darn good. Jolie and Pitt, two marvelous, thoroughbred, top ranked, world-class pros, blaze the silver screen with their prowess and leave all opposition and would-be haters in the dust. Their characters, coined some of the most deadliest operatives on the planet, are no laughing matter despite a hearty menu of well timed and interlaced jokes. The rocket scientists (Simon Kinberg and Doug Liman, et. al) who developed the formula, which powers this wonder, deserve a medal. The chemistry is unparalleled. The recipe must not be destroyed and must be protected as a matter of national securityand of course, audience morale. Such ought to be an executive, presidential directive. The movie leaves you wanting and craving more actionmore adrenalinemore scenes. And to think, that somewhere, there are in fact, people who really do the kind of work that these characters do in Mr. and Mrs. Smith is nuts.

Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"There's just something too cool about spending two hours or so just looking at Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Talk about a Barbie and Ken couple!!! Whoever had the idea of putting the two of them together in what constitutes a loose and naughty remake of 1989's Kathleen Turner/Michael Douglass outing in ""War of the Roses"" must be basking in the glow of a brilliant idea. The classic ""husband and wife bantering repartee'"" movie is in the house once again. Directed by Doug Limon, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) and ""Swingers"" (1996), ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a delightful albeit darkly ironic allegory of the modern marriage.Beginning and ending in the therapist's office, this film comes full circle in its panoramic treatment of married life in the twentieth century. In the beginning, the couple is obviously going through relatively normal relationship growing pains. Having been married for six years, they seem to be experiencing what most married couples experience (remember ""The Seven Year Itch?). It quickly becomes apparent that their problems are far from normal and their ""growing pains"" far from traditional. Like most couples, each of these two individuals is keeping some secrets from the other one. Unlike most couples, their respective secrets are far more serious than the average ""cookie jar theft"", or ""lust in my heart"" type of omissions. They are both secretly hired assassins. Yes killers, snipers, hit-men/women!! They met during a hit, fell in love, and simply avoided showing one another their true colors by slipping into a boring off to work in the morning/home for dinner in the evening routine. Now after six years of marriage, they are bored with each other because they obviously can share so little of their ""real"" life with their mate. All this makes for a great dilemma. Don't misunderstand, this movie is far from perfect, but what it is is entertaining and really pretty to look at.Now, back to the stars. Both of these ""mega stars"" had great notices in small parts at the start of their careers. Pitt's memorable turn in ""Thelma and Louise"" and Jolie's performance in ""Hackers"" are the kind of unforgettable little parts that one doesn't easily forget and that set one up for success. Both have gone on to become big stars with bigger expectations. Both actors are ""supposed"" to make their movies make money. Unfortunately they have both had their share of questionable vehicles, but that goes with the territory. Both are well established and incontrovertibly talented actors. It truly gives one pause to wonder just how well the chemistry so fondly bandied about Hollywood circles will gel between these two strong personalities. Well.suffice it to say, the fireworks abound. Throughout this movie, these two click on all cylinders. In the indomitable style of Tracy and Hepburn, Pitt and Jolie intellectually and physically spar from beginning to end making for a raucous and undeniably satisfying jaunt through the intricacies of their erstwhile complicated lives. The plot is relatively simple - with a twist. Their chosen occupations are exposed to one another when they are sent on the same job. Because of the interference of the other ""half"", they are equally unsuccessful in their assassination attempt and are therefore tasked with the unpleasant job of ""taking care of"" the renegade intruder in their respective operations. Of course, it is soon revealed that their nemeses are indeed themselves. In order to not give away a couple of cute little twists, no more will be revealed here. The important thing is that the movie is two hours of grand fun. Never taking itself too seriously, this vehicle is a kaleidoscope of enchanting little surprises. Smooth and non-interfering direction combined with seamless and skilled acting make for an enjoyable and entertaining respite from the hustle and bustle of life. To be able to immerse oneself in the altogether more complicated existence of these two characters makes the moviegoer wont for more. The success or failure of this type of movie rests on the ability of the film to leave the viewer breathless. In that respect they succeed. Rampant with lots of action, chases, and cool stunts, ""Smith"" is engaging entertaining.Bottom line, the chemistry is there, the action is there, and fine direction is there. As in his previous outings, Limon is able to carry the characters through the action sequences without sacrificing depth of character in any way. This is as much as testament to the acting ability of his stars as to his directorial prowess, but the amalgamation of the two makes for a very likable film.

Best Pitt-Jolie movie! For now...,"Mr. & Mrs. Smith was everything!!!! Comedy, Romance, and a lot of other stuff. Da good stuff. Angelina Jolie did an amazing job as Jane Smith and I really couldn't picture anyone else in the role. Also considering the relationship Brad and Angie have right now. The movie went more as Brad having the smarts and low tech. While Angelina was more go with a plan that involves as much high tech gear that we have a possible. Both were evenly matched and I think the best scene was when they were fighting in the Coleman's van against the bullet-proof BMW's. That's when all of there lies spill out. But the fighting scene in the house was also very well done. Very tricky and amazing how assassins act so fast. Very few people can secretly do what they do.

Well-casted and hilarious!,"Above all, the term that defines ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is ""silly."" That is fairly apparent from the time you learn the basic plot: John and Jane Smith are a typical, upper class suburban couple who are both secretly assassins working for rival agencies. The catch is that neither of them know about the other. The only possible direction you can take that plot is comedy.Having seen the mediocre 1941 Hitchcock comedy this is a loose remake of, I can tell you that they are quite different. The biggest threat in the original film is divorce. Here, it's assassination. Practically the only similarity between the two films is their name. That said, I consider this much better than its predecessor.First of all, this is not a serious film. What makes it so fun is the fact that it understands that and doesn't care. It's got the cheesy spy-ness of a Pierce Brosnan Bond film and the action of a Lara Croft movie (Angelina Jolie included). Overall it's just a very light-hearted movie that doesn't require much emotional investment or stress.Second, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are PERFECT as a couple onscreen (made evident by the fact that they later married). They've got serious chemistry, which actually makes the many fights they have all the more enjoyable. It's literally modern-style Bonnie and Clyde except they frequently try to kill each other.Beyond that, really all I need to say is that it's hilarious.

And points out every stare and move that suggest the attraction between the two stars. Can't blame them, the star wattage of the two on screen is so huge! Had it not for the high profile of the ""affair"" the movie will be seen as it should be - lots of action and fun - truly enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
This is a GREAT movie for all people.... MUST SEE!,"WOW! I can't remember the last time I was satisfied with paying $10 to see a movie. This is SUCH an amazing film and I can't believe that Nicole Kidman was originally going to play the role of Jane Smith. That is crazy to think because Angelina and Brad's chemistry throughout the film is right on target. She plays the beautiful, but sneaky, bad girl. Brad Pitt plays the sexy, daring, but funny, John Smith. If you have not seen this movie, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?!?!?!?! I think I would actually pay to see it again, lol.*Also, this is a great film to take ANYONE to see... grandparents, parents, dates, teens, even kids (if not too young.. (language))",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
More hype = less movie,"I think a lot of people have been fooled by the massive hype around Jolie and Pitt's ""relationship"". Judging by the chemistry between them in this movie this is a total sham. My feeling is the producers realised what a dud this was and decided in order to make the money back they would have to hype it via something external to the movie. Opportunity presented itself with Pitt and Aniston's split.This really is a tedious, uneventful movie. At times it looked as if the pair were reading their lines from scripts on their laps. There is no passion from the acting, script or direction. Instead we get some silly Thunderbirds moment and the posturing we all know from the two leads. Angeline Jolie is Lara Croft, in tight gear, lips pumped up toting maximum ammo. Brad Pitt is the cheeky chappie, pissing in the desert. Mix that with the boring premise of hit-couple pitted against each other.Dud is written all over the cover of this. I have no right to feel disappointed.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Pitt and Jolie compliment one another perfectly in MR. AND MRS. SMith,"MR. AND MRS. SMITH (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) meet in Colombia amidst a social upheaval, enjoy a whirlwind romance, and marry rather impulsively, settling into a suburban life. Both hold lucrative but apparently banal jobs, although this is just a veneer for their true careers as professional assassins, which each hides from the other. MR. AND MRS. SMITH (Jane Smith and John Smith) seem to be the perfect couple. Eventually, this secrecy backfires, and they find themselves pitted against each other, despite their attraction. They must decide whether to eliminate each other or team up to defeat their common enemy, apparently their one-time mutual employer. This film might have used the vacuous television formula of espousal teams , such as MACMILLAN AND WIFE, but it manages to dodge that bullet. The acting styles of Pitt and Jolie compliment one another surprisingly well. Neither actor strives to upstage the other; Jolie's vitality and no nonsense persona and Pitt's penchant for quiet understatement make a perfect combination, in scenes of apparent harmony and those of enmity. The pace is very good, too, weaving deftly suspense and humor, much of which is provided by the intermittent frames with a marriage counselor. MR. AND MRS. SMITH also features a great supporting cast, but it does so without cluttering its story unnecessarily. Its soundtrack, especially ""Mondo Bongo,"" performed by the late Joe Strummer (formerly of The Clash) is also a winner, lending alternately energy, poignancy, and ironic humor. The film's only discernible flaw (a minor caveat) is that it slights its explanation of the sinister organization (the villain) for whom the two work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
an insult to Freres Lumieres,"well, i really don't know how to reach 10 lines of text, as it is stated on the guideline. i could talk about myself, that i live in Italy, which is quite a beautiful land (apart from Mr. Berlusconi) I have a video rental shop and from time to time I see some movies, well this was one of those nights. I was very skeptical about this,all the stories about the Jolitt love story and all that. What I'm so sure about is that too many movies are produced nowadays, and there are people ready to fork out loads of money to create this. I've seen the vote on the front page and I really couldn't believe my eyes. This is an insult to Frères Lumières. Ciao",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Now That's Entertainment!,"I caught the 6:25 and 7:20 shows at a local suburban multiplex. It was showing on two screens and they were packed. The audience applauded at the end. Personally I thoroughly enjoyed everything about the movie. First, who can complain about well shot close-ups of two such charming and physically appealing stars? Second, the riffs on marital verbal and non-verbal repartee were hilarious and on the nose. Take for example the passionate love-making post house-busting shoot-out. A little over the top, perhaps, but who hasn't felt that overheated hormone rush following a physical altercation with one's lover? Best sex ever, right? And in this case the scene even made literary sense -- one could see the original spark re-ignite the Smith's dormant passion for each other. It plays to the main themes of the movie -- why does marriage fail, and how to jump-start a stale one. ""War of the Roses"" was not so insightful. Third, the action was well choreographed, especially the Smith's pas de deux with guns during a shoot out in the final 10 minutes. This film has nothing to do with the other couple failures (Ben and Jen in ""Gigli;"" ""Kidman and Cruise in ""Eyes Wide Shut"") which were flawed films, plain and simple. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a genuinely entertaining action flick with smart writing, superb cinematography and editing, and two talented stars who know their material and can communicate the emotional nuances of love with sarcasm, irony, and humor. Not to mention the splendid chemistry between them. Brad and Angelina seemed to genuinely at least like each other. This film has nothing to do with what's wrong with Hollywood and the current box office slump. A film or two like the Smith's might in fact, be Hollywood's salvation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Subtle, Funny, Sexy, and Savvy Action","A must for action film buffs, especially for female action film buffs. Sexy cast, savvy action, funny script and a great soundtrack. It's the funniest and wittiest action film since True Lies. (The action scenes are right up there with The Matrix 1). I had no idea Brad Pitt could be so funny.The director knew exactly how to deal with both Angelina and Brad's reputations and acting styles so that it came off subtle and smooth. Keep an eye out for the homage to Fight Club.For all the feminists out there, Angelina Jolie pulls off a great addition to female action star role call. She kicks butt as much or more than Brad does in the film, (and the film even has a subtle take on Brad's character dealing with that).There are even some great in-jokes about Brad and Angelina, as well as suburban life and the traditional roles of married couples. (It is even funnier than the bits in The Incredibles when they have to deal with normal life) and is just enough to support the character driven base of the plot without being boring.Much better than expected. A gem in the action film genre, and great relationship film too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Repeat...,"Out of 10, this movie is worth a big 5.5... Just AVERAGE! Not a great movie, not a bad one either. The thing that annoyed me the most is that it's totally predictable because they do the same thing all over again during the entire movie.Summary: Mr. and Mrs. Smith met ""just like that"" in another Country while they were both on mission. They ""do it"" and next thing you know, not only are they married, it's been 5 or 6 years since they're husband and wife... BUT, even after all these years, they still don't have a clue about the occupation of the others! And all of a sudden, they are on the same mission, recognize each other, try to kill each other, make out, form a team and end up being a couple of heroes!Even if this movie brings nothing new to cinema, it's full of action and the actors do a great job. Plus, they're both hot! :)If you haven't seen this movie, you're lucky, you won't have to pay 10bucks to see it on a big screen! Rent it. If you like action, you won't love it, but you'll like it!",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Excellent, expectations met!","I thought that this film was amazing, i saw it today in an advanced screening and was left surprisingly satisfied. Jolie was amazing at playing a femme fatal/housewife whereas Brad Pitt did an outstanding job at playing a more laid back character by day, and a dedicated works-man when it comes to the job. The on screen chemistry was definitely visible between Angelina and Brad due to the recent speculations, this should grab a lot more viewers as it is evident in their performances! I think that this film is very entertaining with fresh witty comedy and great action sequences! In all i would recommend this film to a mass audience that are interested in a roller-coaster spy movie, but don't watch it if you take films too seriously as some of the domestic issues and violence may upset.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Terrible attempt as an action movie,"Well, my grandparents picked up this movie from Blockbuster. The guy said it was great, so taking the employee's advice, my grandparents rented it...it was terrible. I've never seen a worse mockery of an action movie than this. This movie was absolutely terrible. There was barely a plot, and hardly a setting. The director just relied on sex and violence...which doesn't make a good movie alone. He took two ""celebs"", put them into a bag of awfulness, and beat all of the good acting out of them...which was never really there. Now, if this movie had a plot at least like one of the new Bond movies, it would of been mediocre. This was a sorry attempt at making a romantic action movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Mr & Mrs. Smith is Great fun!,"I loved the movie. Those two are hot together. There is definitely natural chemistry. The little jabs they make at each other are way funny. I plan on going back and seeing it again. Very engaging movie!!It was also great to see Stephanie March after her character was written out of Law & Orders SVU. Vince Vaughn is a crack up, a mommas boy who is a assassin.I hope that they will maybe make a sequel. I liked the movie because it was a blend of action and romance in a crazy sort of way.I think that the movie was pretty original in the plot. I can't think of any movie in the recent years that had a plot like this. It's nice to see something different Mr.& Mrs. Smith was a very entertaining movie. Plus it was very nice to watch two gorgeous people together! I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
war of the roses meets true lies,"For what it is, this is a great summer action flick with heart. Charming, cheeky, and poking fun at itself, the movie also actually follows an underlying plot line that questions modern male/female, wife/husband, and female/society issues, and it handles everything in a light but touching way that includes lots of butt-kicking and big-hearted ego.We see Jane Smith chafe at the bit of male assumptions of female strength and capability, and John struggle to prove he's not an idiot and can be counted on to do something right (for once). Domestic bliss gets a twentieth century wake-up call as an independent woman struggles to be the perfect wife while really wanting to prove she can also be the perfect husband. We get to see a husband and wife really kick each other's butts (which, realistically, most partners aren't legally or physically capable of doing) and learn some hard lessons about themselves and each other by the time everything is over. For something people in long term relationships can't do, it sure is fun to watch. :)A fun cast (Vince Vaughn is the bomb as always), some unrealistic details (don't look too closely at the ending or it'll break), and some bad mumbling on Brad Pitt's part. They could have given more depth to Angelina's character - they sum her up as a Type A, bitchy, anal-retentive personality, which conflicts unreasonably with the woman John Smith fell in love with in the first place.Good summer fun, and, you get to bring your kids cuz, sadly, they cut out the steamy stuff. Maybe the DVD will add it back in ...",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Non-romantic romance,I did not like the movie. I had to quit watching half way through. There is absolutely no love for each other. Can you believe she almost killed his husband twice. He was trying to be nice to her though. Too much of unnecessary violence between the couple. I could not appreciate such film.,1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Action comedy at its best,"This movie is an amazing mix of excellent action sequences and unique humor. The only movie that comes close to this type of achievement is ""The Rundown"". Pitt and Jolie work very well together and if you are a fan of either of them, then you will definitely enjoy this. If, however you don't find yourself enjoying unrealistic movies, than you probably won't enjoy this, as the movie stretches beyond what could really happen in several occasions. I also feel that the 2hr time limit is far to short as it seems like the movie moves way too fast and I would have liked to have some more story development. Anyone who enjoys a good time could definitely like this. Um, gee, how much more can I compliment this great flick?",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Serial killers portrayed as ""cool"" and ""funny""","This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not because of the bad jokes, terrible acting and stupid plot. But because of two serial killers are being portrayed as adorable people living cool and fancy lives. I really hated this movie because I can't stand the fact that Pitt and Jolie are bragging about how many victims they have on their consciences. It has nothing to do with moral, rather common sense and the fact that everything is not funny. What is it gonna be next time? Two Nazis bragging about their killings in Auschwitz while trying to live a normal family life. This movie underlines an apparent lack of decency in Hollywood and a blatant greed of the former couple.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Pleasantly Surprising,"I wasn't dying to see this movie; I'm not a fan of ""Spy vs Spy"" type films--James Bond puts me to sleep. SO I wasn't really looking forward to seeing this, but I got dragged along with my friends.But I was really pleasantly surprised at this movie! Jolie and Pitt have an amazing chemistry, that makes the movie sexy; the music is great, and really hightens the suspense of the film; It's really funny. There are many parts that had me laughing out loud. The audience loved it, everyone was clapping at the end. I give this movie two thumbs up, and then one more, because Jolie and Pitt made a great team!I recommend this movie to anyone. It's great!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A one-sentence plot,"Frenemies spend two hours trying to kill each other.There. That's the movie. You may remember that plot from movies/shows/magazines starring Tom & Jerry, Itchy & Scratchy, Spy v Spy, et al.Except, given America's sick, twisted, demented fascination with guns, there is a lot more bullets flying here. Oh, then then the stupid s3x scene.This is Hollywood at its most crass and greedy. It lowered my estimation of Brad Pitt. It did not change how I feel about Angelina Jolie since I already think she's a one-woman freak show.It also breaks my usually iron-clad measuring stick: If Brad Pitt bleeds in the movie, it's a good movie. If he stands around looking like a pretty boy, it bl0ws.Also, since I haven't seen it mentioned in any of the reviews I've read so far, this movie spits on the graves of Robert Montgomery and Carole Lombard, who starred in the original Mr. and Mrs. Smith, a witty, fun romantic comedy. If you can stand B&W movies, watch the original instead.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great movie but too long!!!,"From the first scene of the movie you can tell that Mr and Mrs Smith is going to be a fun ride - and it is, but the fun was slightly ruined by just pushing it 15-20 minutes too far. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie prove that they are absolute geniuses at making a film interesting and fun with their roles as Mr and Mrs Smith. Their obvious actual connection and witty lines make this movie what it is. Scenes such as the one where Jolie bends down on her knees and Pitt smiles to the camera get the director a great mark from me because he obviously realized what this movie needed to be - fun (and yes I know I'm sounding like a stuck record).In all seriousness Mr and Mrs Smith was well done on everyone's part, not just Jolie and Pitt's and there is not possibly a type of person out there that could honestly say they didn't enjoy this movie at least a little bit after they watched it. So watch it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Loved it.,"I totally loved this movie. Brad and Angelina have great screen chemistry. I'll definitely go see it again. A+ from me. The action sequences were fantastic, and the comedy in the movie was just as great. I loved the love hate relationship between the two. Vince does a great job as well, and even though his role wasn't as vital as Brad and Angelina's he was a memorable character. It was also nice to see Adam Brody in the film. What a doll. It being a PG-13 flick, I wouldn't recommend making it a family day at the theater to see this one. But teenagers and adults will love it. It's comical, adventure, action, and a bit of romance all wrapped into one. My kinda film. Not to mention the all star cast. Two thumbs up from me. It definitely will appeal to both genders.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One Of The Worse Movies Ever Made..,"I'm Not Even Gonna Write About This So Called 'Movie'. I Have Watched Plenty Of Movies In My Life Time And This Is Undoubtedly One Of The Worse If Not The Worse Movie I Have Ever Seen. It Is So Bad That I Don't Even Have One Decent Thing To Say About It. I Watched It With Family And Friends And Everyone Aggreed It Was Horrible And A Waste Of Time. I Am Saying It's One Of The Worse Movies Ever Cause When The Movie Ended I Really Felt That I Spent Almost Two Hours Of My Life In Vain, Felt Bad About Wasting My Time And Watching It, A Feeling I Don't Recall In Many Years.Three More Comments: 1. Sorry I Didn't Write About The Movie Itself But Honestly If You'll Can Skip It Just Do So!! 2. The Only 'Good Thing' I Can Say About This Movie Is That It Brought Together Pitt And Jolie (Ofcourse Others Might Say It Had A Negative Side). 3. I Really Don't Believe At All The Average Grade This Movie Has Received, I Am Sure People Are Not That Stupid And More Than That, The Higher Voting Is From People That Are A: Die Hard Fans Of Pitt/Jolie B: Related Somehow To The Production. I Can Say That My Biggest Mistake Was Not Entering IMDb And Reading What Others Have Said And Written About This Movie, If I Would Have I Am Sure I Would'nt Watch It As Over 80% Of The Comments Are Totally Negative.Just Avoid This Horrible 'Movie'",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
