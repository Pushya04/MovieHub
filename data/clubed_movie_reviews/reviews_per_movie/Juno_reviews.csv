Complex...,"When I first heard about this little film I wasn't particularly interested. Being a high school teacher, I wasn't impressed with the idea of seeing a movie concerning a teenage mother. Believe me, I know enough of them already! However, on a lark, I decided to finally watch the film--almost two years after it debuted. And, in hindsight, I should have just gone and seen the film when it came out, as unlike my ASSUMPTION, it was not really a glorification of teen pregnancy but a very complex film--a film with a lot of different messages and possible interpretations. This is definitely NOT a by-the-numbers (formulaic) film--there is a lot that is original and new. And, if you were worried that the film would be pro-teen pregnancy or abortion or whatever and it might offend you, don't think that way....the film is great for anyone, conservative or liberal alike. And, it might just be an excellent film for you to see with your teens. Excellent, simple and very effective.I could say a lot more about the film, but considering the huge number of reviews already and the film came out some time back, I'll be brief and stop here.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Every good thing you've heard and more,"""Juno"" is an incredibly cute movie, and for once I don't even mean that in a patronising sense. If the movie universe was some sort of gigantic petting zoo, ""Juno"" would be the adorable little lamb standing in the corner making the jealous other lambs look like death incarnate. It's not a sugary sweet tale by any means, in fact it's a real down to earth kind of story that's not always pretty, but the approach to it couldn't be more right. It's humble, it's little, it's low-budget, and that's exactly what makes it so great. What I also liked about it, hell what I like about a lot of independent movies, is that it's never predictable. There is no formula, you don't know what's coming, you don't sit there quietly ticking of all the clich√©s: you just enjoy yourself tremendously. Finally, one last addition to the heap of praise and I swear I'll stop: it's been ages since I've seen an ending scene this beautiful. It's exactly the way you want it to be, and the camera zooming out at a barely noticeable speed is a brilliant touch. I quite liked ""Juno"".",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This movie has stayed with me,"I saw this movie at a preview in St. Louis about ten days ago and can't stop thinking about it.I had no expectations going in (as I was given three free passes) as I took my teenage daughter and her friend. Learning about the subject matter, I was quite anxious how it would be shown and frankly I thought it was done very well.First of all everyone has gone to High School with a Juno. That smart alec independent tomboy, cute, refreshing & fun to be around but not cool to date or be seen with. And the further removed from high school you are, you look back and wonder why? The acting by Ellen Page was outstanding (I had no clue who Ellen Page was - I have since watched Hard Candy). I can't remember a film that I was so drawn in by the main character.I've always told friends for me the mark of a good movie is the character actors and their performances. They all deliver in this movie. I'm not going to go overboard and say its the best movie this year but it is one that I would recommend. Its rare I go to a preview and actually want to go see it again. Count me in come Dec 14th.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Too Clever by Half,"I was expecting a really honest movie where the humor would come from the funny ways we deal with bad situations. Instead I felt like I was watching the Gilmore Girls. For most of the movie (and it got better in this respect toward the end) Juno's character was devoted to witty commentary, replete with randomly inserted Spanish words (""silencio, old man!"") and hipster slang (""rad"",""boss""), rather than showing any kind of emotional insight. I kept thinking: ""Someone needs to tell this girl that she is not Janeane Garofalo."" Michael Cera was good as always, but he could have been used a lot more before the latter parts of the movie, particularly in some way that would indicate he was fazed in the slightest by fathering a child. Meanwhile, if anything saved the film it was Jason Bateman's performance. Dead on.Bottom line: This looked like a film that would be funny because we could all imagine we'd act the same way in a bad situation. Instead, the lines were too pretentiously witty and the characters, particularly Juno, too emotionally numb to strike a chord.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
from the art house to the megaplex,"The thing that separates ""Juno"" from so many other films about teen pregnancy is that, in this case, the 16-year-old who finds herself in that predicament refuses to become a victim of her circumstances. From the moment she confirms the unwelcome news, Juno studies her options - abortion, raising the child as a single teen parent, adoption - then takes matters into her own hands. Like the Roman goddess who is her namesake, Juno is a bright, often sharp-tongued individual who prides herself on her observant cynicism and her way with a sarcastic quip. However, she's not above appealing to the adults in her life when the problems of the world get to be too much for her (though, in some cases, the grownups are coping with more serious issues than she is). Yet, Juno makes certain that it is she and she alone who will have the final say when it comes to determining the course of her own future and that of her child.""Juno"" is that rare low-budget, independent feature that finds unexpected success in the mainstream by striking a chord of recognition in audiences across the demographic spectrum. First-time screenwriter Diablo Cody hits pay dirt with a clear-eyed, largely unsentimental script that is not afraid to go off in unexpected and interesting directions and that avoids patronizing its Middle American characters. Juno's father and stepmother manage to take the news in stride, while the yuppie couple Juno alights on to be the child's adoptive parents are given a depth and complexity far beyond what a lesser writer might have afforded them. Director Jason Reitman keeps the quirkiness to a minimum and allows the scenes to play out in a naturalistic, unhurried way. Confident in the strength and appeal of his material, he lets the gentle human comedy speak for itself.In a star-making turn, young Ellen Page takes a daring approach to her character, often bringing Juno right to the brink of un-likability, then pulling back at just the crucial moment, making us see how utterly likable she truly is. As the child's father, Michael Cera is virtually the same lovably passive nerd we found so endearing in ""Superbad,"" while J.K. Simmons and especially Allison Janney give rich shadings to Juno's supportive parents. Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner also make their mark as the couple who post their picture in the ""baby wanted"" section of the local throwaway.""Juno"" faces the downside of any independent film that unexpectedly finds itself ripped from the confines of the art houses and suddenly duking it out at the multiplexes with all those high-budget, high-octane, testosterone-laden blockbusters - namely the risk of over-inflated expectations. Thus, my advice is to look beyond all the hype and box office records and simply let ""Juno"" sneak up on and take a hold of you in its own quiet, inimitable fashion. I think it works best that way.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sorry to say...overrated.,"It was different and refreshing when I first watched it. If I wrote a review the very moment I saw the film, I would have given it a 9 out of 10. Now, after almost half a year, the feeling has passed and I feel the film is very overrated.Ellen Page does give a very good performance. It can be seen she cares about the role and she gives the role all her energy and devotion. Yet...is her performance Oscar worthy? That is up for debate. Like the film, her performance is good but forgettable.The rest of the cast is solid. Jennifer Garner does her job rather well, and is there a more awkward kid than Michael Cera? He is born to play Bleeker. Nevertheless, Diablo Cody does not deserve her Oscar. Truthfully, her writing is shallow and empty. There are more deserving candidates.""Juno"" is good, but empty. There is no deep or life-changing message within the film, and this film is just like the language within the film and the western culture: a fad. After the initial awe and surprise pass, it will not stand the test of time and will not be remembered.I would recommend Waitress, because it has more ""heart"", or Knocked Up, because it is more funny. Juno is somewhere in between, and quite frankly, it remains there. It takes the quality of both films, but it does not exceed or stand out from either films.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Review of Juno,"Juno has an effect on you. You can tell by the opening title sequence that this movie has a lot of heart. The unique dialogue may come off as annoying to some but I find it to be one of the reasons the characters feel so real and likable. I felt as if Juno was a real person throughout the whole film, thanks to Ellen page. Her performance is perfect and there could not have been a better pick for the lead role. All of the casting choices are great. Including J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's Parents. Jason Reitman did his best directing in his career by far on this film, in my opinion of coarse. Diablo Cody's perfect script would have been ruined by any other director. But Reitman has an amazing control of tone. On a personal level Juno has left an impression on me and I will truly never forget it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tries too hard to be relevant.,"Juno is the kind of fun, refreshing story that is extremely good the first time you see it and for about a year or so after.That said, it will never stand the test of time. The movie tries so hard to be relevant to today's youth that in 5 years it won't be funny anymore. The teenage pregnancy storyline will still have impact, but no one will laugh as they watch it.The majority of this is the fault of Diablo Cody, who tries far too hard to inject teenage dialogue that is indeed embarrassing to any normal self-respecting teenager. By trying to appeal to the teenage population she instead alienated many by portraying our age group as snarky and witty and using ""hip"" language (""Home-skillet"") that just made me and my friends (ranging in age from 16-18) groan out loud.The movie also contains many obscure, unneeded references that seem to be added in just so Cody can showcase how cultured she is.Although the film does have some priceless lines that kept me laughing throughout (""I'm already pregnant, what other shenanigans can I get into"") every few minutes Cody throws in another forced line that takes me out of the film. One minute I'd be immersed in the story of Juno McGuff and all of a sudden she'd transform into Ellen Page struggling to get through a particularly cheesy line (It's Morgan Freeman).I don't blame the actors for this, they are doing their best to get through the lines they are forced to spew and they do well with it.The movie would have received a much higher score had Cody just left her holier-then-thou attitude at home and written something with substance instead of parading her ideals, butchering the way teenagers talk and promoting her favourite movies and songs every few minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Great Beginning to the Rest of Your Life,"Juno ID# 1677I saw this movie at a special screening at UCLA, just as a last resort for something to do on a free Thursday night. I'm so glad I went, because it was amazing! I had no idea what the movie was about; I only knew Michael Cera (Superbad, Arrested Development) was in it, which was enough incentive for me to go.I walked out literally skipping alongside my best friend, both humming to the tune of the great original songs from the movie. The theme of love existing in so many forms where you least expect to find it just lifted me right out of my doldrums, and made me look at life again from a different perspective. There's just too much to love about life, so many places you'll find it, and the only way to do it is just to live. Juno shows you reality, but it highlights the tiny details about love and life that you might start missing or forgetting about.Excuse me for sounding so corny, but that's exactly what this movie did for me. To put it easily, it's a ""feel-good"" movie that leaves you FEELing GOOD. If you're down or just in the mood to be lifted up even higher, I recommend this movie for you.Enjoy it :) and remember, love is always worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not Something To Really Laugh At,"Juno was a good movie at the most but certainly not anything close to a great movie. This movie tries too hard to be witty and cute when in reality it comes off as annoying and unrealistic. For example: If your teenage daughter gets pregnant I doubt you will start cracking jokes about it especially 2 minutes after you hear it. There were a few nice aspects of the film.The acting of Ellen Page was pretty good and a had a nice warm feeling surrounding her. There was also Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner who came off as the only realistic characters in the film as a married couple about to adopt Juno's soon to be born baby. The rest of the characters (partly because of the writing and acting) in the film who were supposed to be quirky and unusual were just too laid back at the situation at hand. This movie plays itself off a realistic to a tone of that of Little Miss Sunshine yet the characters come off as corny and unaware of the delicate situation that is the central theme of this film.Despite many of these flaws I do not think there was much of an area the film could have been improved upon. The film's idea was a bit too ambitious in trying to make a comedy out of a teen pregnancy in the way it was. This film has been often compared to Little Miss Sunshine yet there is a reason for why that movie is considered original. Of course it is because of the balance it was able to create between comedy and a realistic drama. Juno tried to do this as well but failed to accomplish simply because the idea of the film simply isn't that funny, at least not in the way this film presented it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Smart, funny, and many positive messages","Full disclosure, I would probably see Ellen Page and Jason Bateman in anything, I love them both so much. Page is of course in the starring role here, and delivers an outstanding performance as the quirky Juno, a high school who finds herself pregnant after spontaneous sex with her nerdy friend (Michael Cera). The film is very well made, with clever dialog and composed of countless little moments that are amusing, despite dealing with a serious subject. Juno resolves to give the baby up for adoption to a yuppie couple played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner, but things get complicated with Bateman's character begins getting close to her because of their interests in rock music and slasher films, kindling long-standing desires on his part to do more in life before becoming a father.This is a very well-cast movie from top to bottom. J.K. Simmons plays Juno's father who is generally kind and supportive, but expresses his disappointment by saying ""I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when"". Page's facial reaction, followed by her response, ""I don't really know what kind of girl I am"" is priceless, and just one of many great scenes for her. Allison Janney plays her step-mom, and has a powerful moment telling off the ultrasound technician while sticking up for Juno, and then later quipping ""doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream"". Cera plays awkward teenage dorkiness naturally, and Olivia Thirlby turns in a solid performance as Juno's friend.This is a 'teenage film' that is smart, and has so many positive messages; it's accepting of unorthodox kids and difficult situations, which everyone deals with as Juno does, with humor and head up high. It's an empowering film, and a love story. The scene of Cera and Page strumming guitars and singing 'Anyone Else But You' (by The Moldy Peaches) is a sweet ending and caps off a nice alternative/indie soundtrack. Page really established herself with this film, and is well worthy of the Academy Award nomination she received.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
If only I were as cool...,"Ever wish you could say the perfect thing every moment of your life? Screenwriter Cody Diablo pens a world where your wish is her characters command. After the first viewing, I was sold...after a few more viewings I'd rather have my ears stabbed by Celine Dion than sit through this hipfest again. Not only is the dialog painfully clever, most of the wall-to-frikkin-wall soundtrack is adolescent hipster pop-rock garbage. Remember the band Cub? If you're as haunted by their cloyingly amateurish Shonen Knife-ness as I was, then you'll loathe listening to the preenie angst chimed throughout Juno. A shame since great bands like B&S have songs cutting into the over abundance of squeaky juvenilia. Best Picture nomination? Hard to believe THIS was chosen over Superbad, let alone a film like The Assassination of Jesse James. I really do hate watching films that feel like a window into the screenwriter's slave-like devotion to cool.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
FilmCreature Reviews 'Juno',"Juno MacGuff is a sarcastic, cynical, tomboyish teen played by Ellen Page in a fantastic, perfectly tuned performance. After sort-of-spontaneous (but not really) sex with her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera of 'Superbad'), Juno receives an unwanted package--a pregnancy. Woops.Juno decides to give her baby to an affluent couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). All seems well at first, but it will be a bumpy road until birth.I can spend hours gushing about how terrific a movie 'Juno' is, but I'm not really the greatest writer on the planet, so I'll just express the fact that 'Juno' has a strange effect on you. After seeing it, I almost felt as if I would walk out of the theater and see Juno MacGuff just standing there, as if she were a regular living, breathing teenager. That's how good Page is. In fact, every single performance in the film is absolutely tremendous. I liked how Allison Janney's stepmom character isn't turned into a whiny she-demon like most formula stepmoms, instead, she's far more friendlier (if a little unsure of Juno's odd ways) than we would ever expect. And J.K. Simmons finally gets a role where he isn't a total jerk; instead, he's a sensitive father who truly cares for his wacky daughter.The soundtrack is awesome, I'll be buying it as soon as possible. The wait for the DVD will be truly agonizing, but worth it in the end. We can see the chain reactions here when a group of truly ambitious individuals (such as Jason Reitman, Diablo Cody, and Ellen Page) get together and make a movie such as this. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.I give 'Juno' my highest recommendation possible.Sweeeeet, man. 4/4",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Overdone, overbaked writing","I liked Juno, I really, really did, swear to blog I did! But when a 16 year old mentions Soupy Sales (yes, she did), the believability meter drops to sub-zero. As awesome as Ellen Page is, I never felt it was her talking. It seems like we are listening to the screenwriter 100 percent of the time.Sure, it's witty, funny, and sharp....but everything is so densely packed, that we feel like Diablo Cody was frightened into thinking this would be her only time to say EVERYTHING she feels about EVERYTHING. A lot of it was just too much. A little too anxious, a little too much. We get it, we get it, don't hit us over the head with everything.I was really disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Despite the massive popular success that Juno has deservedly received, it is still a small film with a big message at heart.","While the teen comedy genre has been littered with the fine works of directors like John Hughes and Paul Weitz, most entries are poorly written and acted affairs that fail to capture the world of teenagers. With Juno, director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody have managed to create a realistic portrayal of teenage life without being dreary or overly artsy. The intent of Juno is to tell the story of a sixteen-year-old girl who deals with a responsibility ""way beyond her maturity level"" and the people around her who care. The filmmakers succeed in not only creating the most realistic teenage comedy ever produced, but also in bringing characters who the audience trusts and knows. Juno is down-to-earth and grounded in reality, never over-the-top and intelligent enough to not rely on cheap gags to gain laughs. The naturalist feel of the actor's performances also gives the film a sense of being there with the characters as they charm the audience with their whimsy. Juno is bold and smart and is always entertaining and comfortable.Juno McGuff (Ellen Page) has found out she is pregnant with the child of her on-again, off-again boyfriend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). After choosing against aborting the infant, she chooses to give it to a young couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). That's a gist of it, but what makes the simple plot so winning is the material provided to the ensemble cast, who works with some of the freshest dialogue ever afforded to a teenage film since Alexander Payne's Election. Diablo Cody does not rely on the quirky to make her screenplay succeed, because the characters feel so real and while the dialogue to some may seem odd, it is able to realistically show the vocabulary that teenagers speak every day to their peers. The subtlety of Jason Reitman's direction adds to the scope of reality by not over-doing it and allowing the characters to speak for themselves. Reitman is intelligent to not let the environment take over and he commands control of the production. Even the clothes worn by Juno and her friends reflect themselves. Juno's baggy trousers and loose clothings represent her independent and free mind as well as the gap between child and adult-hood. Paulie's running uniform signifies his attempts at running free like Juno, while Leah (Olivia Thirlby), Juno's best friend, tends more towards Uggs and other commercial clothes, showing how she attempts to blend in with the crowd rather than be herself. Even Mark Loring starts to evolve into more juvenile clothes as he gets closer to Juno. It is this attention to detail that makes Reitman's direction succeed with ease.The performances from the ensemble all serve as excellent portraits of Diablo Cody's characters, managing to bring the right amount of warmth to each part. Ellen Page is the stand-out, shining in every scene and showing that there is a little bit of Juno in all of us. She has spunk, heart and plenty of humour making her one of the best written and acted young female roles to ever grace the screen. The chemistry with Michael Cera adds even more to the power of the character. Michael Cera is known mostly for playing meek, awkward characters, but in Juno, he goes even beyond his role as George Michael Bluth on the comedic masterwork Arrested Development. Cera plays Paulie with both strength and courage, making him a great companion for Juno and a scene where he confronts her is pure genius on the part of both Cera and Cody. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are equally as good, helping in making their character's conflicts and differences un-forced. As Mark evolved throughout the film, so does Bateman who develops the character in key with Cody's writing.The only aspect of the film where Reitman and Cody depart from reality is actually a smart choice. Nowhere in the film is a character shown talking on a cellular telephone, the opposite of today's world where every single teenager appears to be talking into their hand. The absence of such a device expands on the theme of innocence that Juno displays. In an age where teenagers are trying to grow up too quickly, Juno is given the ultimate test of female adulthood by carrying an un-born child in her pouch. In yielding this responsibility and promising to give it to a loving couple, she grows as a character into realising that she is still a child herself and decides to wait a while before she grows up. The touching and poignant final scene, a guitar duet between Juno and Paulie, shows that she needs to hold onto her youth just a little longer before it disappears like track runners rushing to the finish line. Despite the massive popular success that Juno has deservedly received, it is still a small film with a big message at heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I do try hard to be cool,"OK, get this. Juno was written by a lady called Diablo Cody. How cool is that? That's got to be one of the coolest names of all time (after Max Power of course.) It's a shame she didn't channel her coolness into the film's script, which, though charming and fuzzy and consistent, doesn't exactly go for the jugular. Juno tells the story of a sixteen year old girl named Juno MacGuff, played by the breathtakingly beautiful and rather talented Ellen Page, who finds herself pregnant after enjoying spontaneous sex with her best friend. Her eventual course of action is to put the baby up for adoption and soon finds the seemingly perfect couple, Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, respectively.) However, and this came as a total shock, things don't all go to plan and Juno finds herself reassessing the situation and her life in general. Now, everybody knows that this type of film (Zach Braff's Garden State also instantly springs to mind) involves a dramatic event prompting the protagonist to meander their way through the film and eventually learn a valuable life lesson, all the while accompanied by an indie-based soundtrack. That is not important. What IS important are the things occurring around the story and for the most part Juno gets it right. The majority of the characters are quirky and funny, the highlights being the eponymous heroine and Bleeker (Michael Cera), the guy responsible for getting Juno in the pudding club, so to speak. Their actions and dialogue may not elicit spasmodic fits of laughter but they are responsible for placing the smile on your face which remains from beginning to end. Plus, I found myself actually caring about Juno's plight. Director Jason Reitman does not shy away from the subject matter (good job too, because he'd have little else to work with) and avoids making the mistake of asserting that teenage pregnancy is funny. The jokes are made parallel to the pregnancy, not at the expense of it. For example, at one point Juno is visiting the prospective adopting couple, staying a while when Vanessa suggests that she should be returning home on account of her parents worrying about her, to which Juno replies: ""Nah... I mean, I'm already pregnant, so what other kind of shenanigans could I get into?"" It's sentences like that that make Juno a worthwhile film experience.However, there were a few elements which, though inoffensive enough on their own, when combined over the 96 minute running time annoyed the hell out of me. Why do independent productions always have to have title credits that look like they were designed by somebody who failed to gain entry into art school (Hitler, for example)? And always with the Red House Painters guitar pop played over the top. It doesn't look or sound good. The music all the way through was pretty bad actually, especially the frequent name-dropping conversations between Juno and Mark to firstly show how much of a cool guy Mark is and secondly to show just how damn quirky Juno really is. Mentioning Sonic Youth and/or the late seventies punk movement will never earn you any esteem. Also, the burger phone was irksome. It isn't enough that it appears several times; it has to get a mention too, as though we haven't noticed it. ""Oh, sorry I'm on my burger phone, it doesn't work very well."" Yes, great. We can see you have a phone shaped like a quarter-pounder, NEXT.Although Juno does try its hardest to feed the audience a novelty communication device, it is one of those films people should watch now and again to confirm that they are not indeed emotionally dead but are actually still able to remember what happiness, however faint, feels like. Ellen Page seems like a lady who would be cool just to hang out with, the dialogue is intelligent and snappy, a Gibson Les Paul makes a welcome appearance and, of course, the ending is the equivalent to swallowing a tablespoon of sugar while swimming in a bath of syrup. You cannot go wrong.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Don't get caught up in the hype and you may be able to enjoy it.,"I'm not one of those high-and-mighty indie kids who scoffs at any film or artist as soon as they reach mainstream success (see: Andrew Bird, Animal Collective, Feist, Cat Power, The Strokes for recent examples). I *do* get annoyed, however, when people follow trends they aren't really a part of. You know, like the teenagers who walk around wearing Che Guevara t-shirts talking about how great Bob Marley is? It's all social pop culture rubbish that irritates me on many levels.So I flinched when Juno (Ellen Page) says her heroes are Patti Smith and Iggy Pop and the Stooges in this film. Is Iggy Pop awesome? Of course. Is ""Raw Power"" a great album? Yes. Do fans of The Stooges refer to the band as ""Iggy and the Stooges"" and leave out ""Fun House"" when praising them? No. ""Raw Power"" is the album people often associate with Iggy and the Stooges because it had the most success out of their three albums (I'm not counting ""The Weirdness"") and is often considered the best, so it's the obvious empty choice someone who is unfamiliar with their actual work would choose to define them; but a *real* self-respecting Stooges fan would know better, and they wouldn't refer to that band as Iggy Pop. And don't get me started on the Patti Smith reference.Or the Sonic Youth stuff.""Juno"" plays like a film made by people who are jumping on a trend and attempting to popularize it. Wes Anderson already did this but he knew what he was doing and didn't market his films that way, and they've been thriving as far back as a decade now in indie cult status without 45-year-old soccer moms rushing out to stores to buy the ""Rushmore"" soundtracks. I can still listen to the Kinks without feeling like I've bought into some kind of marketing fad. But ""Juno"" has done a lot to make me feel guilty about driving around blaring ""Raw Power"" these days.Is that my own problem? Certainly. But that smug, cutesy ""fakeness"" that permeates this entire film is the reason I don't think it's worthy of half the acclaim it's garnered.Maybe I'm too cynical. But what I see happening here is the following: the film is popularizing a social trend that, by its very definition, is anti-mainstream. Sonic Youth and other indie music began two decades ago and ""Juno"" is giving a thrill to Wal-Mart shoppers who are suddenly hearing all this ""different"" music (like the Moldy Peaches) that they never knew existed before. And they're fascinated by it. Moldy Peaches shot to the top of the digital charts after ""Juno"" came out (Kimya Dawson's MySpace has taken a sudden revamp) and my local record store sold ""Raw Power"" and ""Horses"" both for the first time in two years.I have nothing with turning people on to good music. I have a problem with programming people to follow social trends (e.g. the aforementioned Che Guevara issue) almost entirely unaware of what they're really doing. If people knew half the stuff Guevara had actually done they probably wouldn't feel comfortable wearing those shirts. Likewise, I have to question whether the sixty-something-year-old man I saw buying a soundtrack for ""Juno"" a couple weeks ago is really going to appreciate Sonic Youth.Maybe I sound like an elitist? I'm really not. I think Sonic Youth are fairly overrated, for example (although they're still very good) mainly for the same reason I think ""Juno"" is overrated: people jump on certain trends and follow them.""Juno's"" dialogue, as such, is derived from this self-conscious hipster crap that grates on my nerves so much these days. (God help us if Diablo Cody continues this massacre.) It starts from the very first scene (using spins on pop culture phrases or items such as ""Eggos"" - har-har) and doesn't let up.Ellen Page is a convincing actress but then you realize she isn't acting and she becomes less convincing. She's playing herself. Watch ANY interview with her from before or after ""Juno"" - she is this character. Is that a problem? No, because to the extent of playing herself - a smug, condescending indie kid who doesn't know half as much as she thinks she does - it works for the film. But she's going to quickly reveal herself to be a one-trick pony as more people catch on to the fact that this character is actually her. Jay Leno didn't look too happy when he found out last week on his talk show.I suppose my rant took up most of my review but I think it explains in many ways my feelings towards this film's content. I found it somewhat amusing/entertaining and it had a few genuinely nice moments, but it's far from the masterpiece some like Roger Ebert would have you believe. It's popularizing this new-age indie hipster sarcasm and the film's going to influence a LOT of films on down the line over the next few years. NONE of them will have as much impact or success as ""Juno"" and then trends will change and it'll stop. But first we'll have to put up with a million clones of the same formula and more ""witty"" pop culture puns and dry sarcasm. Spielberg did this with the kids in his movies back in the '80s and the dire response of ""Hook"" finally caused him to cease and desist. Hopefully the transition for filmmakers right now won't take as long.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A heartwarming and bittersweet little comedy,"Following all of the hype, it was impossible for me to not want to see Juno. Everyone has raved about it for months, and I waited patiently for it to be released somewhere nearby. And the wait definitely made it worthwhile.Juno chronicles the story of the titular sixteen-year-old girl (played by Ellen Page), and the fallout of her accidental pregnancy. After deciding to not have an abortion, Juno decides that she will give the baby up for adoption to would-be parents Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) after finding an ad in the local classified section of the newspaper.It may not sound like a deep film, but right from moment one, the film draws you into Juno's bizarre world of teenage angst and wonderment. It progresses through the stages of her pregnancy (and the seasons that pass), and through the various problems and issues that arise as a result of the pregnancy.This is aided almost exclusively by the commanding presence of Page. Her work here is simply astounding, and watching her mature as the film goes on is the stuff of movie magic. She plays Juno with a chip on her shoulder, and a keen sense of tongue in cheek. She is very in tune with the role, and even though it is not wholly original, she makes it her own and gives it a grand sense of earnestness (and pathos when needed). She plays it even better during the more hormonal aspects of the pregnancy, and she makes her undeniable mark on the movie-going public as she does. After seeing her intense, calculating and downright terrifying work in Hard Candy, I knew that she would be a presence to be reckoned with. And in seeing Juno, I now know that she truly will continue to grow into a great actress.Supporting turns from just about everyone only further complement Page's terrific acting. Garner and Bateman, while not as well written as Page, do great as the would-be adoptive parents. While Bateman taps into his not so over-the-top side (which he used to his great advantage in scene-stealing roles in Smokin' Aces and The Ex), and gives a great character performance, Garner does even better as the over-domineering wife. She gives the role a slightly creepy tinge in a few cases, but for the most part, delivers one of her best performances. While not as commanding as he was in Superbad, Michael Cera, as the father of Juno's baby, gives his character a glossy sense of naivety as the film begins, but slowly falls into a grander sense of geeky goodness as the film goes on. His shy teenage chemistry with Page is astounding, and helps give the film its greatest moments of heartfelt drama. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney round out the cast, lending the film some of its deeply funny and dramatic moments as Juno's parents, and relative newcomer Olivia Thirlby does very well as Juno's best friend.But for how great the cast was, what I was really anticipating was the screenplay, by current sensation Diablo Cody. I was a little apprehensive at wanting to jump on the bandwagon of praising her, but the script is truly wonderful. While the start of the film feels a little forced with its witty and sarcastic banter, the film gradually progresses into a very fair balance of hilarity and drama. Its gradual depth does not go unnoticed, and as the film packs into its most dramatic scenes, it really becomes apparent that Cody has a great sense of how to write really well. First time screenwriters (or even screen writing hopefuls) can take notes in how well expressed the wording is here (and how obscure pop culture references can still be funny), and just how greatly written the film is. When dialogue comes so natural to some of these characters, it becomes very obvious that the writer knows what they are doing. If she keeps up like this, than I think she could truly be the prodigy that everyone is making her out to be (although Jennifer's Body really does not sound like a step in the right direction).I think what only slows the film down is the near forced relationship between Page and Bateman that grows as the film goes on. I understand its importance to the film and understand why it is here, but I just think they play it a little too loosely and way too longish to make it feel as worthwhile as it needs to be. The two work off of each other well, yes (although not nearly as well as Page and Cera, or even Bateman and Garner), but the dialogue and scenes between them just sound like an afterthought, and do not seem in sync with the rest of the film. They have the humour, they have the references (maybe a few too many), but they just do not jive nearly as solidly as they should. Maybe a little less focus on these scenes, and more with the likes of Cera (who is not underused, but probably could have been used a bit more) or Simmons or Thrilby (who are not used nearly enough) could have helped make the movie even better than it already is.Juno is not perfect, but it is heartwarming and bittersweet all the same. I laughed and almost got choked up by how exquisitely written and how superbly acted the film was. Page is marvellous in the lead role, and Cody just might be on the right path to be true greatness. If only all small Indies could be nearly as memorable or nearly as astonishing as this one is. An obvious candidate for being one of the best (and funniest) films of the year.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Movie,"I saw this movie and was really looking forward to it, because I liked the director's last offering, ""Thank You For Smoking"". I was completely knocked off of my feet! The humor was completely entertaining and didn't dwindle into a perverted cuss fest like some other comedy offerings of late (Superbad). The actors did a tremendous job - J.K. Simmons (no longer will he just be remembered for Spiderman), Ellen Page was incredible (finally a movie to like her in - Hard Candy was just too creepy, sorry), and Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner are paired up once again (also paired in The Kingdom) and play the embattled parents to be of this new child while facing their own demons in their struggling marriage. The movie was just very real, and also gives anyone hope that good things can come out of seemingly bad and insurmountable odds. Go and see this film!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Mixed Feelings but overall happy ending,"This movie was a bit of a strange one, to be honest i really didn't like Juno at all for most of the movie but for the purpose of the movie and the statement about ""True Love"" it was making, i think her character did a good job of showing how people aren't perfect but they can still be happy and really it's just a coming of age movie, she's 16 years old and she's making big decisions and it's a nice little happy ending.Overall production was good, pretty solid, well made, great cast of characters, the dialogue and plot was pretty comedic but realistic enough for me to enjoy the movie.My favorite thing from this movie was the songs that would play every time the season would change, i thought all of the songs were wholesome.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What a wonderful movie!,"I have been blessed to watch almost any movie I want at the Toronto Film Festival this year.. and so far this is the best out of all of them! And this I am comparing with Rendition, The Brave One and Michael Clayton.. You can imagine how good it was. Everyone in the audience was laughing their *ss out. It was hysterical and at the same time the director was able to put the points across. The movie is filled with slinks but its the new kind of slang.. LOL.. You have to see to understand what I mean. It would be the next hype at high schools..The subject of the movie has been portrayed so well that it is unbelievable. The screenplay was superb and Diablo is the next lady to watch out for. Also to watch out for Ellen Page.. Oh my go, what a superb acting! She's another lady to watch out for in the next few years. No one could have taken the role as Ellen did. Hands down, no one other than Ellen could have done it.I hope the comments I made stays in the top.. because this movie will certainly rock the theaters.. and peeps will come here to see the review.. And this is exactly how it is.. This movie will make you laugh all the way.. You'll be so absorbed with everyone's acting.. And you'll be so happy after the movie! Go watch it as soon as it comes out.. There is absolutely no way you will be disappointed.. It's just impossible.. The movie is too hilarious to make any one laugh.. Now go out and try to find the movie! You'll love it!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Icky,"Plays like an ad for the anti-abortion movement. As for the much-touted dialogue, is it really any different than an average episode of Gilmore Girls? Not that there's anything wrong with Gilmore Girls, but would you give the writers of GG an Oscar? At least that TV show's improbable banter is in keeping with its light family drama. Even the logic of Cody's dialogue is flawed. It the confession scene with the parents, the girl thinks her father is asking who the baby is, rather than who the father is. If she were a ditz, the confusion would have some logic. Or even if the pacing or emotional pressure of the scene were at a real farce level, one might buy it. But the girl is bright, and the direction is naturalistic, and it just gives me that icky, phony feeling. Commenting on the writer's marketing savvy, a Hollywood executive said ""Look at the name she chose for herself."" Indeed! The whole thing is emotionally untrue.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Simple, but Sweet Coming-to-Age Story","In the winter, the sixteen year-old teenager Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) finds that she is pregnant after having intercourse with her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera) on a chair. She first decides to abort the baby; later she changes her mind and decides to give the child for adoption. She seeks for a cool couple in the newspaper and she finds Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) and Mark Loring (Jason Bateman). Juno tells the news to her father and stepmother and they support her decision. After successive meetings with Vanessa and specially with Mark along the months, Juno finds that Mark has not grown-up and is not ready to raise her son. Juno comes up to a final decision about the destiny of the baby.The low-budget independent ""Juno"" is a simple but sweet coming-to-age story. The narrative is original and effective, with witty and funny dialogs and the characters are believable. Ellen Page performs a typical teenager, annoying most of the time, with moments of maturity and others naive and silly, chasing the ""perfect world"" that unfortunately does not exist for her baby. The calm and supportive reaction of Mac and Bren is quite unusual but I liked it. Based on a glance in the reviews, I dare to write that this is the typical love or hate movie without mid-term. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Juno""",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Juno,"Movies about quirky, off-beat characters have been a staple of American indie cinema for years. And lately one of them has been a fixture as filler Oscar nominee, usually snabbing Best Screenplay. But what makes Wes Anderson movies different from Punch-Drunk Love, and what makes those different from Little Miss Sunshine, Napoleon Dynamite and this year's Juno? Well it depends on the degree of sell-out quality which, in the script, translates into how much do the off-beat, quirky characters end up happily integrated into conformity. Little Miss Sunshine, for example, is an idiot's feel-good movie, about a bunch of subnormal losers ruining a girl's life, and finally getting their chance to shine in an extended candy-flavored, undeserved, overlong catharsis scene. I think Tim Burton is the most honest (ironically a Hollywood director) craftsman of this type of story - his characters are unapologetically weird and they never end up accepted and subdued by society under any circumstance.Juno is about a so-called geek, sarcastic teenage girl that ends up pregnant after having sex with a meek, feminine looking boy she's secretly in love with. Unlike what might be expected from a lesser movie, her parents accept the burden with maturity and actually collaborate with their daughter in her goal of giving the child to adoption. In trying to find the perfect couple, Juno comes into contact with a pair of yuppies, played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. She's so crazy about having a child I'd never, ever in my life allow her to even touch one, while he lives mostly in the relics of his past, when he didn't have to hide his rock memorabilia and comic-books from view in a room, specially prepared by his wife for that purpose. Problem will not arise from conventional sources in this script, and that was one of the things that made me judge Juno above the type of garbage it definitively looks like from the ads and trailers. This is not the Little Miss Sunshine type - nothing will get so wrapped up by the end, neither can you see every scene coming from the first one onwards. Also, I gotta admit Ellen Page is an ugly-looking nothingness, but she's not without her acting chops.And still, the Cody/Reitman team manages to fall into some of the independent director's traps. For example, in a movie written by a blogger, I guess it's to be expected that every character talks like they're press articles instead of people. This is not being intelligent, this is being annoying - if I knew someone who talked like this, I'd kick him/her on the genitalia. ""Honest to blog"", ""silencio!"", ""your eggo is preggo"" and other unneeded cutecisms populate every single line of dialogue. Every character is some kind of quirky pop culture savvy talking head. Of course, Juno is the worst - you're supposed to relate to her because she's covering a heart of gold under that stand-up comedy exterior. How come a cashier at an abortion clinic has her face covered by body piercing and cracks jokes at Juno's condition? Is that supposed to be so out of place it's funny? I see it more as overcrowding in a movie that's already bursting with forced oddity.And still, the drama exhibits a level of maturity rarely seen in that colorful, rock-soundtrack sub-Hollywood that's ""edgy"" US film nowadays, most of it evident on the script's surprise development about the adoptive couple. Even though she's a psycho and he's an inmature dork, we understand both of them and the effect they have on Juno's already troubled mind. I also thought it was nice that Juno's parents weren't a couple of ogres. That her hero's journey has her saving the day by the end is predictable yet to an extent needed, but it brings to me another pet peeve - Juno has not in her one inch of the insecurity that's to be expected in any teenage girl, not only a knocked up one. That makes her a way too convenient protagonist and of course, smarter than everyone else around to an unrealistic extent.I remain lukewarm on this one, although it's not a bad movie by any means. The soundtrack, the characters and the dialogue are annoying as all hell, but the actors really elevate the material (specially J.K. Simmons) and the script finds itself comfortable in that moral grey area where none is too perfect or too lousy a human being. I guess it's not good stuff either, but I can't bring myself to hate it 100%. I've seen far worse.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best of the year!,"Since I got to see the theatrical cut of the film last night I figured I would finally post my thoughts on this great flick. This was my third time seeing it and I still dug the heck out of it. The dialog, which could have come off as pretentious and/or downright stupid, is fantastic. When I wasn't laughing at the jokes I was smiling at its charm. The performances are really what makes the movie shine. Ellen Page as Juno is just great. I can't believe she is only 20 years old. If you're not already keen on her, definitely put her on your radar. We'll be seeing a lot from her in the future. Michael Cera, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner, J.K. Simmons, Olivia Thirlby, and Allison Janney round out the cast and are fantastic. Simmons and Janney especially shine as Juno's father and step-mother.The soundtrack is also great. Kimya Dawson of the Moldy Peaches did a lot of the soundtrack which really sets the mood and pace of the film quite well. In addition to Dawson's track's there are also some great tunes from Belle & Sebastian, Cat Power, and The Velvet Underground.After this viewing I would definitely have to say that Juno is on my short list for best films of 2007. It's a comedy with a lot of heart and enjoyable quirks. Folks seem to be comparing it to Napoleon Dynamite quite a bit. This is understandable due to the ""feel"" of the movie but as far as story and characterization goes I think there is a lot more substance. Definitely check it out when it hits theaters or check out one of the many screenings offered across the country.brendoman, Junoverse ID 1522",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not That Bad,"I don't understand the venom toward this film. It's about unconventional kids who act in ways that test their believability. I taught middle school kids for 43 years and had no trouble picking out some names who would match the people in this film. We tend to apply our own standards on the parents, thinking they should act a certain way. I thought that Ellen Page's Juno was quirky and spontaneous, and that she was also incredibly insecure. Even in people who are eccentric, there are causes and effects. This is a decent story. It's not a typical one and that grates on some.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
HORRENDOUS MOVIE; I'd rather eat paint!,"I would rather watch water evaporate! Any male with normal testosterone levels will hate this movie, I promise you that. As for females, you all better be able to relate to a girl (Ellen Page) who behaves less like a high-schooler and more akin to a S&M freak from the Bowery. Page's performance is lackluster, much like the development of her relationship with other characters.If you came in looking for comedy, prepare to be disappointed. Page has her witty quips, but by the end of the film personal drama has engulfed the movie. I will not spoil the ending (as if it isn't completely devoid of meaning), but Juno chooses a path mostly disconnected from the plot. The choice of what to do with the child she is carrying (I don't believe this qualifies as spoiler seeing as she is clearly pregnant on the movie poster) takes a bizarre turn when a five minute scene reverses all we knew previously about several characters. Is anyone in this movie worthy of selling us on the fact that they have emotion? I don't believe so.The soundtrack is so anemically bad that I was wishing I had been born deaf by the end of this film. I cannot understand what if any are the positive aspects of this film. My assumption is that it has a niche quality, defying logic for intelligent film-goers. This has been compared to Napoleon Dynamite, which I believed to be brilliant film. The same is not true for Juno. I felt like I was watching a bad painting. I would only recommend this movie to people who enjoy extreme mental torture.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Juno,"Diablo Cody penned an insanely well-written story of a sixteen-year- old individualist who becomes pregnant with her friend/crush in her 2007 film Juno. Directed by Jason Reitman and starring Ellen Page, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman; Juno is fantastically crafted with enough pop culture references to place it until the end of time. The uniqueness of each person is fostered and treasured through Juno, going to show that if you can find that one person to make you feel comfortable with being you, do whatever you can to be with them.After becoming pregnant with her best friend's baby, Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is unable to go through with an abortion, so she begins seeking an adoptive family for her baby. After meeting with prospective parents Vanessa Loring (Jennifer Garner) and Mark Loring (Jason Bateman), the ""Pennysaver Loring's"" Juno is convinced this is the family to raise her child. Over the course of her pregnancy, outlined by the changing Minnesota seasons which surround her, Juno grows close to Mark a commercial composer who is adjusting to prospective parenthood at a much slower rate than his eager wife Vanessa. Mark takes the opportunity of Juno's company to indulge in some of his interests and hobbies that had been suppressed since his marriage. The more he listens to his old music and plays music, the more hesitant he is to tie himself down and father a child. The changes in Mark and Vanessa's relationship becomes difficult for the two of them to handle. Juno's many changes create difficulty in her life as well, as she watches her friends enjoy prom and high school life, oblivious to the adult issues Juno must face as a pregnant teenager. Each person has been injected into the lives of those around them for a purpose, and it is up to each of them to find that purpose and grow through the transformation thrust upon them.The opening scene showing where it all started, with a chair, instantly shows the audience what type of film they will be in for. Then, the opening credits shown through animation create a beautiful glimpse into the type of moving art placed before the audience. One can see after the first 10 minutes of the film that its shining star is its script. Not enough good can be said about Diablo Cody's witty pop culture laden beauty of a screenplay. Juno is a fantastic ensemble piece that is so much better, by the way, now that I have had more exposure to the supporting cast. Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons are incredible standouts in the film, even more now that I have enjoyed Janney in The West Wing and Simmons in Whiplash. The music and wardrobe in this film are top notch and fit with the realism of Juno's world perfectly. A movie centered around pregnancy is perfectly outlined by the changing seasons, an excellent decision on the part of director Jason Reitman. But not only Juno was changing, Mark was also going through changing seasons of his life as he was intimidated to let go of his past, and Vanessa as she was looking forward to spring into motherhood. An exceptional and underrated film, Juno is just as good 8 years removed from its release as it was the night I saw it in theaters.Motherhood comes in many forms. Juno knew she was ""ill-equipped"" to become a mother at the stage in her life when she became pregnant. She also knew that since she was unable to go through with an abortion that she could bless the life of another with her baby. In the least sentimental way possible, Juno traverses the struggles of unplanned teenage pregnancy. Vanessa's supreme wish in life is to become pregnant when she is unable to, and after a failed previous attempt at adoption due to Mark's ""cold feet"", Vanessa is more determined than ever to become a mother. The conclusion of the film with Juno reflecting upon the notion that Vanessa was always the mother of her child was strikingly powerful, proving that motherhood s not exclusive to those that give birth.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I enjoyed every bite,"Reading the reviews here, I've noticed that a lot of people don't like ""Juno"" so much. Now if Juno (the character) could be aware of this--well, she wouldn't care. That's what I love about her. She really doesn't care what anyone thinks. She simply speaks her mind, and what a delightful, snarky little mind it is.People have complained about the unrealistic dialogue in ""Juno,"" that it's too witty to portray teenagers accurately. When I think of realistic teenage dialogue, my mind travels back to high school art class, where I sat in front of two freshmen who spent every class period calling each other various curse words and shouting, ""You killed Kenny!"" every couple minutes or so. That is realistic dialogue. Is it what I want to hear? Of course not; I'd rather be amused.""Juno"" isn't a slice-of-life movie, but purely comedic. If I had wanted a more realistic movie about teenage pregnancy, I would have watched the next dreary sob story on Lifetime, where perhaps the lead character might toss her baby into a dumpster. Instead I watched this. Who knew that a movie about a pregnant teenager could be so uplifting? As a feel-good movie it worked for me, because I definitely felt good afterward.I saw Juno as a strong character, the type of person who wants to know and experience everything life has to offer, much like Diablo Cody herself. As a result she possesses an incredible knowledge of pop culture, but also ends up pregnant. Was that foolish? Sure it was, but Juno wisely turns the pregnancy into something very positive. The point of this is not that teenage pregnancy is a wonderful thing, but that lamenting our mistakes is a waste of time, as mistakes are a part of life; and sometimes, as in the case of Juno, they can serve to make life a richer experience, for ourselves as well as for others.""Juno"" is the cinematic equivalent of pie. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. You never eat pie for its nutritional value but simply to indulge yourself once in a while. If I had wanted the cinematic equivalent of steak I would have watched something else. Yes, ""Juno"" is sugary and sweet. But those are the qualities you would look for in a pie, and as pie ""Juno"" is very, very good.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good, but No Credibility","I was somewhat disappointed by ""Juno"". Going into it, I expected a deep study of the emotional/psychological storm women, especially 16 year old girls, go through when becoming unexpectedly pregnant. Instead, I got an ABC After School Special, ramped up a bit with some edginess. Jason Reitman's direction is good. The problem is the screenplay by first time screen writer Diablo Cody.Obviously Cody has seen both ""Ghost World"" (2000) and ""Waitress"" (2007) because Juno's character is Enid from the former and her situation is Jenna's from the latter. She is the 17 year old Enid pregnant with Jenna's 25 year old maturity level. What is missing is the emotional investment in Juno's character, largely because of a lack of credibility that Cody did not bring over from those two films.While watching ""Juno"", at times I felt Aaron Sorkin wrote the dialogue. Very slick, everyone knew exactly the right thing to say at the right time. Juno herself knows more cultural reference metaphors and similes than Dennis Miller. She is quick of mind and tongue, almost too quick to sound like a credible 16 year old. No teen awkwardness, no rough edges, except those necessary to progress the story. Juno sounds like a 50 year old Madison Avenue advertising executive and just as world weary.Cody does try to make Juno and her friends sound like 16 year olds by having them say ""dude"" and ""totally"" over and over ad naseum. Now admittedly at 44 years old I am an ""old man"" and maybe out of touch with the speech patterns of todays high school youth, but I know my 16 year old never uses the words ""dude"" and ""totally"", implying there is a lack of environmental influence at school. My 23 year old and 21 year old, at that age back in 2000 and 2002, also never used those slang words. And I maybe heard one of their friends say ""dude"" one time.Cody also neglected to explore certain plot elements that would have added more credibility to the film. Where is Bleeker's father? Why does her mother dislike Juno? Why does she not know about the pregnancy even though Juno's parents and the whole school knows who the father is? Where is the scene between Bleeker and his mother discussing the situation? If that was a creative choice to edit out by Reitman and Cody, why dosen't Bleeker at least mention to Juno how his mother feels about the whole thing?The strength of the screenplay comes with the bittersweet emotional longing Juno carries like a heavy backpack for a mother we never see who abandoned her as a six year old. It is clear from the start all her actions regarding the baby she is carrying are influenced by this event. It was this character examination that made ""Juno"" somewhat involving in spite of it's flaws and interesting to see through to the end. But still, ""Juno"" is not a film I could sit through a second time, dude. Totally.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Emotional and Character Depth that Blows Away Your Typical Teen Comedy,"Premise: Teenage girl gets pregnant and learns about life and relationships with her new ""status."" Significance: Anyone calling this a movie about teenage pregnancy has completely missed the point of the movie. The pregnancy is nothing more than a vehicle to provide an important contrast across several different relationships. Case in point: there is not one moment in the movie where Juno evaluates or considers her pregnancy. As such, those looking for a pro-life/pro-choice agenda in the movie will not find one -- because there isn't one.Similarly, while the protagonist is clearly an intelligent, sharp-witted, and proactive, young female -- leaving some to believe this movie has a feminist agenda -- that is also not the case. This would not even be discussed if it were a male lead. Moreover, Juno by the end sees that she needs both her Dad and her best friend, Pauly. Most importantly, the career-driven adoptive mother's struggle is that despite her career success, her life is dominated by wanting to be a mom -- clearly not a feminist point.Instead, the movie highlights that people and relationships are not always what they seem. Through the story, the heroine realizes that her best friend is someone she loves. She realizes that her quirky and off-beat Dad and step-mom, are actually ""good"" people. The adoptive parents have the biggest character change in the movie, with the soon-to-be Dad swinging from hip to shallow and selfish, while the soon-to-be-mom swings from cold to warm and loving.Boiled down, this is a simple, feel-good, love story. The heroine realizes that her best friend, whom she has taken for granted, is someone she loves. Overlayed on this simple, heart-warming and timeless story (you realize you always had what you thought you were missing) is witty dialog and significant character development -- providing much more depth then the typical teen comedy -- like ""Knocked-Up"" or ""Napoleon Dynamite"". In fact, this is one of the best movies of the year and probably one of the best comedies to come in years.With this movie, Jason Reitman has established himself as one of the great young directors in Hollywood. Diablo Cody has also seen meteoric rise in her stock, although it will be interesting to see how she follows up with such immediate initial success. Every life probably has one good movie in it. And Ms. Cody apparently borrowed heavily from her own life in creating Juno. As such, her next endeavor will be crucial for determining if she is a ""one-hit"" wonder or one of the next great screenwriters.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
meh.,"I can see why people like this movie, honestly. Its well done for what it is. The problem for me is that it felt forced. Lets make a movie that seems like this movie or that movie. Lets make sure it has this visual style, this simple music soundtrack, lets make the soundtrack important like the soundtrack from Garden State. It all fit, it was fine but the characters and their talking and their persona's didn't click for me. Maybe it was the over abundance of subculture references. Seriously people, stop adding punk band names into your movies to get ""street cred"" or to make people who are not in the know wonder whats so special. Every gdamn magazine in the past 7 years has done a history of punk special. There is no underground anymore, go find something new to add character to your.. characters.Anyway, I know film and theater and writing in general is about building substance out of stick figures.

It left me sobbing,"I've never written a review for anything on IMDB before but I couldn't ignore this one. I'm an amateur film enjoyer at best but Juno is something truly special. Never has a film made me smile, laugh and cry so much before. I was left in pieces in so many ways but mainly it managed to really touch my heart. It's an incredible, quirky, fun exploration into the harsh reality of teen pregnancy and manages to provide some really interesting insight without losing its charm that makes it so utterly enjoyable. Not only that, every character is interesting, well thought-out and impactful and really ground the film in its message. The direction is also fantastic, with some gorgeous camera shots, perfect pacing and great editing.But the soundtrack.The only word I have for the soundtrack is perfect, and I hesitate to say more than that for fear of not doing it justice. And it culminates in the most beautiful ending to a film I have seen in a while.Overall, whilst I understand I am more than likely overlooking any flaws with the film, I enjoyed it far too much to care.

Sarcasm to the max,"Lighthearted, with not much of a story or drama, what the movie really is about and what the audience will derive the most entertainment from, is, as the title of the movie reads, - Juno.A unique character is created. Juno actually is a good role model for young girls even though she unexpectedly got pregnant. She is independent, strong-willed, mature, smart, unaffected or moved by High school's socializms, truly her own person (a character correctly calls her. ""different""). Mostly amusing is her somewhat nasty sarcasm. Juno's constant snide sarcastic remarks permeate the whole movie especially towards the beginning and despite the burden she must deal with. This makes Juno appear totally devoid of innocence in sex, pregnancy and just about everything. Her ""been-there-done-that"" vibe seems far fetched for a 16 year old and more like a women 20 to 30 years older who has lived through life's agonies and ecstasies.Not a hilarious, laugh out loud movie, unless you are really into sarcasm, which Im sure a lot of people are.What starts out with a lot of sarcasm merges into a somewhat heartwarming story, as things don't go exactly as planned (and a good thing they don't otherwise this movie would have gone nowhere).Also the dialogue was intelligent and witty. Perhaps too intelligent and witty for its own good which made it seem extremely contrived. On the spot one-liners from Juno actually felt as though they were planned and edited months in advance. Dialogue and wriitng are believable when they have more of a naturalistic flow.Overall a bit blah but cute.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Any Bones That Need Collecting?,"I didn't know what all the hype was about and some friends recommended 'Juno'. Thus, I finally watched it yesterday. While I agree with some that it is slightly over-hyped, I liked it as it was a very pleasant watch. However, my only problem is that a lot of the themes are a bit too sugarcoated and slightly a bit too manipulative. I liked how Juno is shown as this selfish, self-centred, careless teen who gradually grows into a caring and considerate person. Cody's writing is solid but while this film centres around Juno, the supporting characters could have been further developed and used a bit more focus (as I found them very interesting). The dialogues are noteworthy (most of the time) especially the clever one-liners. The film has a very young feel and the soundtrack adds to the youthfulness. Another strength of 'Juno' is its performances. Ellen Page acts well although, in the beginning, she does not look interested in the role (However, I don't think it's an award worthy performance as 2007 had stronger female leads). Moreover, Juno wasn't an easy role to play but Page does a decent job in the end. Michael Cera too does well as the tic-tac addict but one will recognize George-Michael Bluth from 'Arrested Development'. J.K. Simmons is fun to watch in a lighter role. Allison Janney is marvelous as the supportive and friendly step-mom. Jason Bateman is great as Mark the composer who, where through Juno, is reminded of himself at a younger age and the dreams he had. Jennifer Garner is likable in a different role. For me, 'Juno' was a nice fun movie but there were so many other films and performances that deserved more accolade. It's a great movie but not a masterpiece. But, anyway, the Oscars are overrated most of the time. It cleverly avoids clich√© and melodrama but the issues that it deals with are handled a little too lightly. Nonetheless, it's a nice watch. Director Jason Reitman has made a movie that keeps a smile in the end.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Extremely watchable, and re-watchable","This movie has a certain charm that is rarely replicated in film, making it a delight to watch. The acting is just flat out superb. Page, Simmons, and Janney in particular stick out above the rest with standout performances. The film has some genuinely funny moments, but doesn't overdo the humor to the point where it gets in the way of some very tender and touching character moments. A very well told coming of age film, one that contains relatable characters that are well written and well acted. A true feel good film that I will surely revisit every few years going forward.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Peculiar, quirky and as funny as it can be","It took me a long time to actually watch it. It had quite the buzz back in the day when it was released. Yet I never really came around watching it. And when I did last year and reviewed it ... well seems like somewhere along the road my review got deleted, either by accident or because someone flagged it. I am guessing it is the former ... I almost hope I reckon ... although both options are horrible to imagine.Which is my segway to the movie ... being a teenager and not really ready to have a kid ... getting pregnant is something that you could call a horrible thing to imagine. Having to live through it ... well that is another story altogether ... but Juno, the main character here, seems to have found a solution. Which brings in more characters ... so we have quite the bucket full of people in this. All played by incredible actors. No matter their gender - to talk about the elephant in the room: back when the movie was released the main character was played by someone called Ellen Page - he has since come out as man and is going by the name Elliot Page. That should not take anything away from your movie watching experience - but it also shouldn't be something we should tip toe around.Having said all that, maybe that was a reason someone felt uncomfortable with the review. Can't tell - doesn't really matter. What does matter is the witty and super funny dialog in this - combined with the incredible performances from the above mentioned really good actors ... you got quite the great independent movie at your hands. Not everyones cup of tea, but those who are down for it, will love it!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Very funny, smart movie","I've seen this movie as a teenager before, but I just rewatched it again.Juno is about an eccentric teenager who gets pregnant. The story is divided into four ""chapters"", told through the four seasons.Juno must be one of the most hilarious and smartest teen comedies I've seen. The cast is wonderful and Page is just amazing here as the offbeat teenager Juno. The dialogues are simply the funniest, and the story has some wonderful lessons to give. There are some moving moments as well that warms the heart. One of my favorite aspects of this film as well are the score/songs used. I think this is why I began to love those kinds of indie songs.This movie has always stayed with me, and always will.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Brilliantly Subverts Expectations,"A heartwarming movie about a teenage pregnancy and the life that follows of the titular protagonist.Ellen Page gives a great performance as Juno.

The supporting cast members also bring their A-Game to the film, as each performance is sight to behold.The screenplay of the movie is clever and subverts our expectations. The tropes that come with the premise such as this are all thrown out of the window. Leaving a genuine heartwarming story, that I didn't see coming.The movie also goes by a breeze.

Disgusted,"Completely pretentious. A neo-hippy boho rendition based on the ideals of being a high school outcast, of which is completely ridiculous because there are no ideals in that label.

Absolutely straight out of Urban Outfitters, a pretentious look at the rising hipster movement. A hamburger phone? Good god, can you get more ridiculous?I understand that after the first forty five minutes the film does have a good deal of plot strength, but the caricatures of being an outcast and loving it, along with the overtly hipster themes were too much for me.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Excellent Teen Movie,"Out of all the best picture nominees for 2007, I liked Juno the most.It was smart, funny and entertaining and I enjoyed it.Did it deserve a best picture nom, I really cannot say, it's a good comedy(not the best) and the academy do not usually give best picture noms to comedies.The film is about a teenager who gets pregnant, wants to keep the baby and give it up for adoption and looks for a good family.She finds one but likes the husband a lot as they have the same interests in music and horror films.Juno is a funny, quirky comedy.

My Favorite Indie Movie,"After the credits rolled, Juno had me asking myself the question I don't ask too often, ""why did I wait so long to watch this movie?"" It is heartwarming, witty, original and unpredictable in all the right ways. The film broke many of my stereotypes about an unwanted pregnancy and all the attitudes that surround it. It was as if Diablo Cody knew my assumptions on what was going to happen or how a character would react to a situation, and then turned my assumption upside down in a satisfying and thought provoking way. This was achieved through the depth of each of the characters, and how my opinions on many of the characters changed throughout the film. While Cody plays with our assumptions on certain characters, Juno herself is pure gold from the first scene. Ellen Page does an incredible job in the lead role, taking Juno's character and witty banter in stride and holding the film together very well. The supporting characters are all memorable in their own way, and most of them win you over by the time the film is over. Props to the filmmakers and actors for really challenging and exceeding our expectations. This is easily the best independent film I have had the pleasure to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A good movie.,"Teenage pregnancy is a quite complex and hot topic today. Each one will have their opinion about it and I have mine, but I will keep it to myself, I think this is not the time to talk about it. In any case, the film is neither for nor against. It limits itself to creating a very interesting story around this theme, and the way two young people, clearly unprepared to be parents and who had sex just because of a day of boredom, face the imminent arrival of a baby.The story is quite good and the script deserved an Oscar, but what stood out the most for me was Ellen Page's superb interpretation. She was an unknown actress until this film and deserved all the recognition she earned. She is simply ultra-convincing in the role of a sixteen-year-old girl, still quite childish in her way of being and thinking, but who is experiencing a moment of maturation by force. I loved the way she spoke using teen slang, and the way her character seems almost unaware of the seriousness of what happened in her life. Michael Cera is also very good, but his character is simply amorphous, he doesn't have half of Juno's sharp and irreverent personality. However, both characters are simply too credible and really look like many teenagers that I have met in my life. Much less credible, for me, was her parents' quiet reaction... most parents would simply have had a heart attack. At that point, the film lost a little bit for me, but maybe it's the difference in cultures that speaks louder.Technically, the film didn't catch my attention, but I liked the cinematography, the way the film manages to follow the months of pregnancy and give us the perception of the passage of that time and the transformations in the body, life and mentality of young Juno. The sets and costumes are very good, sometimes with some implicit ironic or comic load. The soundtrack is also quite interesting and fits well with the spirit of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Different..,"""Juno"" is not your typical coming-of-age film; it's a heartfelt, witty, and poignant exploration of adolescence, unexpected pregnancies, and the complexities of relationships. Diablo Cody's sharp screenplay, coupled with Jason Reitman's adept direction, brings to life the story of Juno MacGuff, a smart and independent-minded teenager navigating the challenges of unexpected motherhood.Ellen Page delivers a standout performance as Juno, capturing her character's wit, vulnerability, and resilience with authenticity and depth. Page's on-screen chemistry with Michael Cera, who portrays her awkward yet endearing love interest, adds a layer of sincerity and charm to their unconventional relationship.What sets ""Juno"" apart from other films of its genre is its nuanced portrayal of characters and relationships. Rather than resorting to stereotypes or clich√©s, the film delves deep into the complexities of adolescent emotions, familial dynamics, and societal expectations. Juno's interactions with her family, the prospective adoptive couple (played brilliantly by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman), and her best friend provide insights into the multifaceted nature of love, sacrifice, and personal growth.Additionally, the film's eclectic soundtrack, witty dialogue, and visually engaging cinematography contribute to its overall appeal and impact. Each element, from the quirky humor to the poignant moments of reflection, resonates with audiences, eliciting laughter, tears, and moments of introspection.While some may argue that the film's portrayal of teenage pregnancy and adoption could be viewed through a more critical lens, ""Juno"" succeeds in sparking conversations about autonomy, agency, and personal responsibility. By presenting Juno as a resilient and empowered protagonist, the film challenges audiences to reconsider their beliefs about adolescence, relationships, and unexpected challenges.In conclusion, ""Juno"" is a refreshing and heartfelt film that transcends its comedic elements to deliver a poignant exploration of adolescence, relationships, and unexpected choices. With its standout performances, sharp screenplay, and memorable soundtrack, the film resonates with audiences, reminding us of the transformative power of authenticity, love, and resilience amidst life's myriad complexities.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"""Desperately Seeking Spawn.""","Juno is the story of how a 16 year old girl (named Juno, played by someone who is now supposedly no longer who they were, but that's a whole other deal) finds herself in a pickle of a predicament, and how it affects her life and the lives of those around her in the most offbeat, quirky ways.

Don't be fooled by the stellar reviews,"This movie is decent, but it does not even come close to being the best movie of 2007.The dialogue is stilted with Cody, the writer, attempting to resurrect bad 70s, 80s, and 90s lingo and even create some new bad lingo. There were a few chuckles, but no one in my theater (which was packed) rolled in the aisles. The only laughter was small, nervous, and slightly forced.I've heard people rave about the soundtrack, which I personally found annoying. The music dragged me out the action of the movie instead of complimenting the movie.The acting was fine, and I think that Ellen Page has a great future in movies. In fact, it's her acting along with the fine ensemble which makes the film decent. With a better soundtrack and less gimmicky, unfunny one-lines, this movie could have been more.Sadly, my biggest complaint is that it glamorizes teen pregnancy, even making it seem cool. Even if this movie had been hilarious, I would still have that complaint. Teen pregnancy should never be cool or cutesy, even if you pack it into an edgy, oddball comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Review of ""Juno""","Jason Reitman's ""Juno"" is a dramedy about a teenager (Page) who faces an unplanned pregnancy and decides to put her unborn child up for adoption. Now, I've heard a lot of good buzz about ""Juno"" since it's 2007 release, and I've been rather excited to finally see it. First off, I can say that the film itself is pretty good. I enjoyed most of the aspects of it. The acting on all fronts is great. Ellen Page is hilarious as the titular character, and Michael Cera is equally as funny as her awkward friend. The facet of the movie that I admired the most was the film's brilliant, Academy Award-Winning script written by Benet Academy Alum, Diablo Cody. I found every line in this movie to be delightfully unique, and Cody's use of modern dialogue devices really helps to give this movie a certain authenticity. Although this movie is labelled a comedy, I found it to be more of a heartfelt drama love story - especially towards the end. Overall, I felt that ""Juno"" was a very sweet addition to the comedy genre.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Very good Indy film,"There are certain things one must expect from the standard Indy film.1. Witty dialogue that doesn't exist in real life2.

Cute and real,"A little over a month ago, I was watching one of the movie channels on TV and Juno's premier was being shown and I recognized a few actors, obviously Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, and Ellen Page who made an incredible performance in 2005's Hard Candy. They started talking about Juno and what it was about and I just had to see this movie. It seemed like a great movie that was real and funny, just like last year's big hit Little Miss Sunshine. Finally after they finally released Juno in my town, I saw it a couple days ago and Juno truly did live up to my expectations, it's a very good film. Being Diablo Cody's first script, this was a great story, despite how common it is in real life, it shows the anxiety of being a pregnant teenager. Diablo shows this girl who isn't sure of herself now having to protect a human life growing inside her.Juno is a 16 year old girl in high school, kind of a rebel who's in a band, she's just found out that she's pregnant. Paulie, her best guy friend, is the father, he wants to be with her and take care of her and the baby, but she just plays him off and says she'll just abort the baby. But when she goes to the clinic, she realizes something, maybe she could do something better, by giving the baby to a loving couple who will take care of it. She meets Venessa and Mark Loring, very rich, very put together, and offers them the baby pretty much immediately. But when she learns that Mark still has to grow up and Venessa is just dying to be a mom no matter what, she has a big decision to make while still trying to figure out what is love and who she is.Juno is a great movie to start off 2008, it's cute, funny, heart warming, and real. Ellen Page was so terrific, I just know she's going to make it, I've been rooting for her, and I think Juno is the right kick off for her. Her performance as Juno was fantastic, she was so believable and you couldn't help but feel for her and feel bad for her on what she was going through in her high school. Ellen Page and Michael Cera are two young actors are shinning in today's films. Jennifer Garner, in my opinion, gives her best performance to date, she was so pretty and a wonderful character that had so much love to give. I highly recommend Juno, it's a well put together film that has a terrific story and was just a pleasure to watch.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ellen Page the Aristocrat,"On the whole, I enjoyed this movie. What distracted and annoyed me throughout was the clenched-teeth nasal aristocratic east-coast accent and attitude that Juno (and/or Ellen Page has - I can't tell which). Is she Jewish elite? This doesn't really go well with the middle-class angst-ridden teen that she is suppose to portray in the film. I get that she is much smarter and wiser than her years (really the whole schtick of the movie). But it is a bit hard to buy.And what's with the ""geeky is cool"" boyfriend? Are we supposed to accept that he would wear velcro headbands and short shorts (ala 1970) in 2007? This is contrived stupidity - not hip.I did enjoy the performances of Jason Bateman as the adoptee father and J.K. Simmons as Jumo's father.Nice blip of a movie to forget later.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Great, witty, funny movie","I wasn't expecting much out of the film, but was very surprised how well the lines were delivered. The story wasn't typical. It wasn't just another teen age movie. All ages were in the audience. The older audience loved the film. It was poignant and funny. The actors were perfectly cast. The lead characters delivered their lines with perfect timing and accuracy. The step mother was her usual funny character. She has been in many movies and always delivers her role with such accuracy and perfect comic timing. The dad also was a good character role and his role added some typical dad/daughter characteristics. The emotions portrayed were real. I laughed so many times. It stirs the emotion especially as the movie draws to a close. It never makes it into a real downer though. Life goes on passed the crisis. It's a must go see.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"All Heart, No Substance","I walked into Juno expecting light comedy, perhaps a tear or two - and that's exactly what I got. My friends and I left the theater talking about it - we all agreed that it was very 'sweet.' But perhaps 'sweet' isn't befitting enough for a movie with such a theme as unplanned pregnancy. Then again, Juno doesn't exactly go anywhere near where it should in heaviness. A very bland tell-not-show mechanism is used in telling the story, and most of the issues vital to a plot are merely foreshadowed and never resolved sufficiently.Characters are introduced and get their fair share of screen time - but there never seems to be any struggle between them relationship wise. There are many threads in the social web left dangling - Juno and her stepmother, father, and selected adoptive parents of her unborn child. At most, they're realistically portrayed in the way that complications are never explicitly made into the drama they deserve for on screen presentation - but it leaves the whole film relatively dull and anticlimactic.The good in this film include the actors, namely the girl who played the title role. She far out shined Jennifer Garner, who seemed almost as without taste as the rest of the movie. Perhaps that was just her character. At least with her, there was a real conflict - but too easy a resolution. There wasn't any large bumps in the way. None that she had to climb over herself, anyway.The music for Juno fits it very well; it sets the tone and gives it part of its charm. The odd, semi romantic lyric content and guitar instrumentals provide a very down to earth but dreamlike background to a suburban setting. They're quite catchy songs, as well.Overall, I'd say Juno earned a 9/10 if it were going for realistic scenarios - a documentary, if you will. Anything else - a six.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
For Realz,"Ellen Page (in a star-making performance) plays an accidentally pregnant smart-alleck 16 year-old named Juno (named after the Roman goddess, not the town in Alaska) in the latest hyper-smart comedy from Jason Reitman (director of ""Thank You for Smoking""). ""Juno"" follows the latest Hollywood trend of quirky comedies that actually deal with some heavy issues. Unlike most of those films, ""Juno"" manages to stay funny even as it gets serious and treats its characters and audience with respect by keeping the jokes coming even as it gets cutesy or plays for tears.Screenwriter Diablo Cody (a pen-name destined for greatness) has a knack for writing hipster dialog that doesn't wear thin or get annoying. She manufactures big laughs from both quasi-goofy pop culture references and nervous situations inherent to adolescence. She keeps things fresh even when the film starts showing its sweet side. Think of her as Judd Apatow without as much of the raunchy humor. Director Reitman gives the film the appropriate indie-feel and populates the movie with a great soundtrack of songs whose lyrics perfectly match Cody's storyline and dialog.Ellen Page is eternally likable in the lead role, and the decision Juno makes in the end feels totally organic and true to her character, giving the film a ring of truth instead of feeling manufactured to make the audience feel good. Michael Cera proves again to be one of the most amiable and subtly funny young actors working today. His performance is a perfect companion piece to his more overtly hilarious work in the riotous ""Superbad"". The rest of the supporting cast is equally likable, and even Jennifer Garner, and actress who always seems to try so hard, seems perfectly cast here as an adoptive mother-to-be who tries way too hard.Though not as laugh-out-loud funny as most of Apatow's films, ""Juno"" swings as one of the best of the quirky indie-comedies of the past five years. It's funny and has a heart, but it doesn't beat you over the head with it like ""Little Miss Sunshine"" did, and instead, thanks to Ellen Page and Diablo Cody, feels like the real deal.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Reaches our hearts,"We learn early on in Jason Reitman's comedy Juno that ""pregnancy can lead to an infant"". This is exciting news. Of course, most teenagers already know this and use condoms but if Juno (Ellen Page), a feisty sixteen-year old, and her boyfriend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), a straight A, high-school track star, realized this, there would be no movie. In that case, we would be spared a Diablo Cody screenplay that inundates us with hipper-than-thou dialogue, overly obvious pop culture references, and cutesy one-liners like a drugstore clerk (Rainn Wilson) telling Juno that ""Your eggo is preggo"" and ""This is one doodle that can't be undid, home skillet"". One or two of these one-liners are tolerable but a whole string of them leads us to question whether or not the author has a working relationship with how real people talk.If the excessive quirkiness doesn't overwhelm you, Juno may ultimately be redeemed by the outstanding performances of Page and Cera, excellent support from Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner, and some genuine emotion and sweetness that leaves us remembering only the good things. While the film has much humanity, Mike Huckabee would have no problem with its anti-abortion subtext. After Juno and Paulie do it in a chair, abortion is considered but it is quickly dismissed as the filmmakers skew the odds against it by showing us a depressing waiting room at the abortion clinic, a disinterested receptionist who jokes about her boyfriend's junk smelling like pie, and a lone protester looking like a brave warrior instead of an obvious kook.Carrying the baby to term seems like the only ""wise"" decision and Reitman/Cody display it as something of an inconvenience at worst and a pleasurable experience at best. There is no morning sickness or vomiting, no embarrassment at school, no pain and little trauma. Expecting the worst, Juno tells her parents (Allison Janney and JK Simmons) that she is pregnant but surprisingly dad and mom transcend the movie's flirtation with clich√©s and provide a thoughtful, supportive response. Dad comments that he didn't think Paulie Bleeker ""had it in him"" and mom, who works in a nail salon, thinks of the immediate ¬ñ vitamins, and prenatal care.The film works its way to a level of burgeoning responsibility and maturity but to get there, it moves through an unlikely adoption scenario in which a willing couple. Mark and Vanessa, is found through a newspaper advertisement. The couple seems more than eager to adopt but somehow we don't know what to make of them or where their real motivations lie. Our suspicions grow and become cringe-worthy when Mark takes a more than passing interest in Juno after they start comparing notes on rock stars and horror films. Ultimately, however, Juno overcomes our fears and our aversion to its smart-alecky cleverness and the film becomes a statement of generosity and unconditional love. Perhaps a bit too quirky for its own good, Juno is still a lovable film that works and works until it reaches our hearts.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"With a story and script that are light years above most others, don't put off a showing of this film, as I did!","Juno (Ellen Page) is a sixteen year old student who lives with her blue-collar, kindly father (J.K. Simmons), her down to earth stepmother (Allison Janney) and her little half-sister, Liberty Bell. Although she is smart, funny and cute, she is not a member of the ""in-crowd"" at school but exists on the fringes in her own unique way. A crush on a fellow classmate of the cross country team leads to a sexual encounter that leads, in turn, to an unwanted pregnancy. What to do? Her first thought is abortion but, once at the clinic, she can't follow through, as a classmate-activist tells her that even fetuses have fingernails. That leaves her with few real choices so, very sensibly, Juno tells her parents of the situation and informs them that she is already seeking a nice couple to adopt the baby. One day soon after, her father accompanies her to the would-be adoptive parents lush home. Upon meeting the Lorings, they seem ideal. Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) is a lovely businesswoman who confesses that she was ""made"" to be a mother but is unable to have children of her own. Husband Mark (Justin Bateman), also, seems kind, intelligent, and ""cool"", that is, he has a music room with classic guitars, etc., and he writes melodies for advertising commercials out of their home. A contract is signed and everyone begins to wait for the perfect outcome of Juno's pregnancy. But, will everything, indeed, be perfect or is reality about to come calling? This brief description can NOT convey the true wonderment of this film. Yes, this is an outline sketch of events but the awesome script, by Diablo Cody, that embellishes the story is so funny, the buttons of your own pants will come flying off between spasms of laughter! From the fellow science lab student who says she can't concentrate today due to a ""menstral migraine"" or the convenience store owner chiding Juno for shaking her pregnancy test stick ""it's not an etch-a-sketch!"", this is a screenplay that is lights years above most others. In fact, the great one-liners come so quickly that a second showing will be a requirement! Then, too, the performances are great, with the petite Page leading the way. But, the film is much more than a laugh or two, as it tackles a touchy subject, teenage pregnancy, and treats it lovingly, with humanity, dignity, and naked reality. If you have put off a showing of this film, for whatever reason, don't delay any longer! This is a film that, absolutely, confirms that life is worth living and that our connections to others are the means to help us through it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Juno was great as a cynical, hard-ass high-schooler, but the rest of her life was not consistent with her own. The school scenes, with disapproving teens swarming away from Juno....come on.... I went to high school in the late 70s and no one reacted that way, no students at least. Allison Janney, Ellen Page, the actor who played the father were all excellent. The adoptive parents had roles which the actors, or the writing, couldn't sustain... I suspect it was the writer.....",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Wonderful Cast and Writing!,"Last night, I finally got to see Juno, which I had been looking forward to for maaaany months, as I am a big fan of Michael Cera. Now I realize just how much of an amazing actress Ellen Page is! I still need to see Hard Candy, even though I know the character will be so different, but she really blew me away. Her lines alone carried enough of the dry, sardonic flavor of the film to temper the perfect amount of winsome sweetness, which is present mostly in the last third of the movie. The character of Juno's father is also a standout, and a totally realistic portrayal of how a loving father would react to the situation. The final couple of scenes are incredibly affective, as well, and had more than just me shedding a few tears. I can't wait to see it again! Junoverse ID #1446.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ultimately Explotive,"Certainly its not taboo to make a comedy of a teen pregnancy. Rather, its how its done. This is a serious subject. The makers are allowed to believe that, because of the subject matter, there is a certain portion of the population that they'll NEVER be able to push a teen-pregnancy comedy past. However they appear to have ignored the portion of people (myself included)who can appreciate the human comedy of manners involved, if only a small nod is given to the reality of the circumstances. Instead JUNO goes straight to the folks (read, ""young"") who'd find all behavior acceptable and believe in the justification and likelihood of a happy ending for all.The script is hilarious, especially Juno's dialog. Though her witticism, arrogance and intelligence are a bit too unbelievable, such serves as a good set-up for her comeuppance. Therein lies the problem - the ending. No messy consequences here! All characters are served, all is roses. Nothing to it. Back to teen idle. Happy motherhood. Guitar strumming romance.I was a high school teacher who witnessed a rash of teen pregnancies. I've daughters 16 and 18 whose friends were ""knocked up"". More critically, as a lawyer I've been appointed to represent 100's of trouble juveniles, an overwhelming majority being of nontraditional family structure. A birth to teen parents can turn out well but MORE OFTEN THAN NOT results in economic and emotional hardships. I've done two private adoptions; i.e., one of the ""happy"" endings. The impact on the teen mother and her parent(s)was devastating. No devastation here.Its a shame. Again the script was funny, e.g. To Juno:""Won't your parents be worry if you're home late?"" Juno: What for? I'm already pregnant"". Unfortunately, the outcome is exploitive.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Engaging tale of a pregnant teenager and the choices she faces,"Engaging tale of a pregnant teenager and a married couple looking to adopt a child from her. This movie has a very ""indie cinema"" vibe to it. I really liked the quirky, sort of folk music this movie utilises, though I could understand some people finding this a turn off.Juno is very much a 'star vehicle' for the charming Ellen Page. Page pretty much gets all the good lines to herself. This movie will stand or fall depending on whether you are open to the character of Juno.To my mind, Juno shares DNA (metaphorically speaking) with characters such as Darlene from ""Roseanne"", which was a classic U.S. sit-com. Juno isn't as bleak as Darlene though. Another reference point for this film would be the delightful if short-lived U.S. comedy/drama series ""Freaks and geeks"". In fact, I was tempted to describe the character of ""Juno"" as a ""freak"" but thought better of it...until she uses the term to describe herself. For those of you not familiar with the caste system in the US, people fall into castes such as ""jock"" (a sport oriented person), ""nerd"" (an academically orientated person), ""dork"" (socially awkward) and, amongst others, ""freak"", meaning a person who doesn't really fit the 'desirable' caste category of ""jock"" or ""cheerleader"" (guys want to be jocks and girls want to be cheerleaders in the U.S. apparently).As an Australian, I tend to view ""freak"" as meaning ""normal""-people like Juno are infinitely more interesting to know and seem like people you would like to hang out with, as opposed to the more desirous castes, who seem really obnoxious.A pleasure of this film is the interaction between Juno and prospective adoptive father Mark, played by Jason Bateman. Their conversations on the merits of movies/music is a highlight. Be warned, you do see a scene from a graphic horror movie for a few seconds.Juno is impossibly witty and sensible-as if rewritten by a mature adult. I'd give this film 7/10 but suspect it will have repeat viewing value, hence the 8/10. In fact, as my reviews for this that years Oscar contenders shows, this movie would have been a worthy 'dark-horse' to take out the ""Best Movie"" Oscar. Not to be though.Anyway, must say how cool Juno looked in that scene where she is sitting on a couch, with a smoking pipe in her mouth, Sherlock Holmes style. Impossibly cool!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It Shows the Side of Teen Pregnancy We Never See!!,"I'm not sure why a lot of people do not like this movie. I mean, yeah it's a little different, but that's what makes it so cool! First of all, the teenagers in this movie look like ACTUAL teenagers, which is a refreshing change of pace from all these movies you see where the teens are easily in their 20s or even 30s!! Second of all, Juno herself is just a really fun character! She gives the whole ordeal of being a pregnant teen a new, more entertaining edge. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm kinda sick of all those Lifetime-like movies where they make you think being pregnant at 16 is like the end of the world! Yes, I know being a pregnant teen is a very serious issue, and I am not by any means gonna go out and get knocked up cause I saw this movie. I just like the fact that this movie showed that you can have a normal life even if you become pregnant. I give this movie a 10!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Overrated,"One of my biggest annoyances is when people try to be different or off-base simply to send a message to society that they are different. There is no need to flaunt the fact that you beat to a different drum, and many times it is only for attention, so other people can think ""yeah, wow, they're really just different than everybody else... they're artsy, they're cool, they know exactly who they are."" that's bull. (this is applying to the writers/producers or whatever and their music and perception of high school life and society)... anyway, I was quite annoyed with Juno's character. it is NOT GOOD when watching a movie and you find yourself knowing that it is scripted. don't get me wrong, much of the dialogue was very funny, and I love sarcasm and wit as much as the next guy, if not more, but NOT when it is not believable. Juno's lines were way over the top and for me, simply unrealistic, while almost every other character seemed to be ""normal"". now this has to be the writer(s) trying to portray their ""independent"" lives and flaunting their ""differentness"" to the world with Juno's ridiculous attitude, behavior, and clothing. I found myself very confused as to the identity of this movie and what they were trying to do. I see, a very serious subject matter (pregnancy, abortion, adoption) laced with humor and sarcasm to lighten the mood or to mask true feelings or even fear and uncertainty. I call shenanigans on many people who rave about how they can relate so much to these characters... i will admit that of course there are really people out there who may be just like Juno, but it is very unbelievable to hear so many people say they feel that way. This is a good movie, with a good concept, and Ellen Page did a great job as an actress, but Juno the character was, let's say, horrendous. Even if Juno's dialogue was toned down just a bit with a little less quirky one-liner, off-beat phrases and a little more seriousness (you're pregnant! and yes, I know some will say ""oh but that's just her defense mechanism... well it was way overblown). I couldn't tell whether this movie wanted to be a comedy or a fable. I can definitely see a combination being worked out quite well, but I do not think that they succeeded in this instance.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Fantastic Film,"The words hilarious, moving and realistic came to mind as I sat in the cinema watching a film which I strongly recommend. I entered the cinema completely unaware of what I was about to watch. To begin with the graphics were excellent and made the film more entertaining and understandable.Furthermore the sound track was unique and catchy, and for days after my first viewing I was still humming the tunes, not at all irritated that they were still rolling around in my head. But the acting alone could have turned the film around, because all the actors were on time and comical (Ellen Page especially). The film touched base on a sensitive subject which is discussed commonly , but it made it fun and enjoyable. And most of all it made you feel special in your own way, It made you feel positive and well, good. I seriously suggest it. 100 stars positive.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Impressive and touching,"Juno Macguff is a sixteen year old teenage girl who faces unexpected pregnancy and makes absurd decisions regarding her unborn baby.This is an exceptional film. A movie like this comes once or twice every year. A low budget and subtle movie but then becomes exponentially popular.At first I had low expectations for this movie and it was for reasons. One reason is that the cast is fledgling and the second and main reason was because of who wrote it (no offense).But seeing it winning an academy award and hearing all the hype about it led me to finally give it a shot. And boy, was I wrong about this movie. I was in a complete awe. What makes Juno exceptional is the fact that the main character, though facing many problems both internal and external, manages to fix a smile on her face and acts as if the whole thing was just a joke. Many other pictures with the same tone of teenage pregnancy all have one aim, and that is to show the audience the darker side of teenage pregnancy and possibly try to make us cry and no laughs.however, in the case of Juno, the main character, Juno, was both hilarious and the audience felt sorry for her at the same time. There were lots of laughs, sarcasm, and indeed sobs.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A mixed bag,"On a superficial level, I liked the film. It was an enjoyable little story with some character growth and unusual choices and some fairly well-established characters. The problem was that however firmly a character is established, I have trouble getting the movie if I don't like them. Juno is acerbic, quirky and mildly interesting, but I also found her largely unlikable. The voice overs all were enjoyable, but her actual dialog I found grating. It felt like having a conversation with that person who is only ever talking to try and land a joke. The only actor who seemed to be playing a character in the real world was Garner, who by my estimation was by far the most unsung cast member. That said, I found most of the supporting cast decent enough, all the acting well above average and as the Juno character did actually make some transitions in the course of the film, it is much better than it should be. I'd be interested to revisit it at some point.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Didn't like it at first, but it seeps in.","I committed the cardinal sin of seeing this movie just because it was so hyped up and was nominated for a kajillion awards. It didn't measure up to my inflated expectations. But since then I've seen it 2 more times, and I really like it.It's been a while since I've watched a coming-of-age teen film (the last probably being ""Sixteen Candles"" in the theater, so that ought to give you an idea of how frequently I do this sort of thing). If you belong to my generation, the humour of ""Juno"" may seem low-key and on the sarcastic side, but I guess the world isn't about cutesy Molly Ringwald anymore.Ellen Page is cute & engaging, though in every scene she seems like she's 2hrs late on her anti-depression medication (she's not nearly as fun as she was in ""Whip It""). I thought her co-star Olivia Thirlby stole the show as the slightly flakey, slightly slutty cheerleader. It's ironic that Olivia Thirlby would star in the shameless 2008 ripoff of this film, ""The Wackness"", which left me with a horrid impression of her. But I blame that on The Wackness's lame script and weak presentation and utter stupidity and total lack of reality and a douchenozzle for a director. But I digress...""Juno"" on the other hand is solidly crafted, with a surprisingly powerful performance from Jennifer Garner. My only real criticism is that they shouldn't have cut out all the deleted scenes (included on the DVD). The theatrical version didn't really cover everything--for example, the big fight & sudden tension between Juno and Bleeker--and as a result you may think certain characters are overreacting to nothing. However, if you watch the deleted scenes, you get more of a feeling why things are so tense.For now, I'll give this movie a 6, and if they release an extended director's cut, I may bump it up a point or two.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

But I have to say, what I liked most about this movie was none other than the main character, Juno MacGuff. The character's lines were spunky, and they were all said at exactly the right time. Also, the character Ellen Page portrayed was a teenage girl that I would like to be friends with, despite the mistake she made. She wasn't too laid back about the pregnancy, but she also wasn't too worried. All in all, this movie was awesome, and I like to watch it over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Performances,"Juno (2007)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Delightful comedy about a 16-year-old girl named Juno (Ellen Page) who finds out she's pregnant and decides to give the baby to a happy couple (Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman). This is a touching little film that certainly has its heart in the right place and I don't think there was a single second where there wasn't a smile on my face. The film has a terrific screenplay that allows for plenty of laughs as well as some nice and tender moments. Page gives an excellent performance as the teenage who gets into a situation over her head. We follow her character for nine months and we see her go through all sorts of changes and Page perfectly captures all of them. She's got a great comic timing but she also handles the dramatic scenes very well. Garner also turns in a very good performance but the real shock is Jason Bateman who turns in a wonderful performance. It's good to see him doing something different and I guess this performance proves that an actor can do much more if they are offered something different. J.K. Simmons also deserves a mention as Juno's father. I think some of the over the top humor keeps this from being a great film but it's certainly an original film considering how many pregnant movies are out there.",,Anonymous,Comedy
An intelligent and touching comedy,"When Juno (Ellen Page) discovers she is pregnant at 16 she embarks on a life-affirming journey in which she discovers much about the reality of relationships and, of course, parenthood. After discovering perspective adoptive parents willing to raise her baby as their own, Juno tries to maintain a semblance of normalcy during the nine months of her pregnancy in the hope that once the baby is born life can continue as if nothing had happened.This film is all about Ellen Page and her wonderful portrayal of the slightly twisted social misfit, Juno. Her performance is sublime and despite her older looks she plays the sixteen year old brilliantly. She delivers the intelligent script naturally and with razor sharp wit. Without her this film would have had half the impact it did.This doesn't take anything away from Diablo Cody who has written a superb social commentary which is genuinely funny. This is an intelligent comedy and definitely for the more mature audiences out there, it never resorts to low-brow humour and is never crass, there are no cheep laughs, no gratuitous nudity and no high school clich√©s. The humour is observational and many laughs stem from the dialogue, more importantly the humour feels natural, never does it feel forced or contrived. This is genius writing.All of the support performances are equally superb. Michael Cera (Paulie) is excellent as the awkward teenage father who is not only dealing with the pregnancy but is suffering all the more because of his unrequited love for Juno. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are perfect as the adoptive parents struggling with a marriage on the brink of falling apart and Leah, the vastly more popular friend of Juno's, is played effortlessly by Olivia Thirlby.There is very little to dislike about this film, you can't help but get swept away by Juno herself and the vast array of colourful and rich characters that encircle her. It's nice to have an intelligent and thought-provoking teenage comedy once in a while, especially in the sea of American Pie and American Pie wannabes. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The script was really over-written and some of the conversations just didn't seem natural. Which confused me when I saw the film because after all the praise Diablo Cody has been receiving, I really didn't think it lived up to the hype.Other than that i really enjoyed the film.

And Juno's parents gave the best laughs.All in all a good, amusing film, even if it does try a bit too hard.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Snarky Serious!,"When Juno, a single and pregnant teenager, announces that she is ""losing faith in humanity,"" her long-suffering father asks if she can narrow it down a little. This scene, as serious and poignant as it is funny and charming, provides a glimpse of the tone and tenor of the film throughout. Everyone, even a convenience store clerk, has something snarky to say. Tense situations are disarmed by humor and sympathy.Juno is obviously not ready to be a mother, yet she handles her situation with inherent panache and a curious blend of independence, optimism, sarcasm and diligence. In searching for a well-off and decent couple who will provide a good home for her baby, Juno displays more maturity than most adults. The childish antics of her elders and the serious nature of her situation cause Juno to do some serious soul searching along with attempting to discover someone who loves her for who she really is.Ten years after the release of Juno and it is still original, cute and exceedingly snarky. The untraditional plot and dialogue are refreshing. Ellen Page (Juno) carries not only a baby, but the film as well. She is a natural for such a role and perfectly cast. Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons are wonderful in their supporting roles. I wonder how much their future success depended on their roles here? Depth and nuance (beyond being snarky), however, are lacking. There should be plain English subtitles for the language of other generations, young and old (ha, ha)! Maybe the wait is another ten years for such an app.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Things that make you go ""Awwwwwwwwww"" Volume #665221","Back in 2007, a little Indie flick rises from the ashes of obscurity and finds its way into the underground pop culture. A small yet charming little story about a 16-year-old giving away the baby still inside her womb won the hearts of audiences and critics across the entire globe. Even the story behind the making of the story was something else, as Diablo Cody, an ex-stripper works her way up from humble beginnings as a well-known blogger. But, with every grand film that makes a surprising amount of money, comes the backlash. The screams of ""overrated,"" ""not that great,"" ""Propaganda,"" among other lashes have been hitting this film, and hard. So is Juno a film that was riding a wave of praise that suddenly crashes after the hype is gone? Or is it actually a decent film?I've had my share of being in the backlash end of highly-praised and lower-budgeted independent movies like Sideways, Little Miss Sunshine, and especially (especially) Napoleon Dynamite. However, Juno doesn't quite fit the mold with the other movies previously mentioned. The story is indeed unique, the characters and their reactions are definitely different, and the script (despite unrealistic dialogue) is spectacular in its ability to blind you from what's happening next. While the morality, themes, and decisions are definitely up for debate and may find you cursing the screen, Juno is one of those little movies that can actually deliver. Few times can a movie run on purely amazing acting, but Juno has easily the best acting ensemble of 2007 and among the best this decade.You should all know the story by now: Juno (Ellen Page) sleeps with her best friend (Michael Cera) and of course, winds up pregnant. However, the story twists in another direction because Juno decides to give up the baby to a couple (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) the second it is born, no questions asked. The rest of the movie deals with the struggles (emotional mostly, rarely do we see the physical side effects) Juno and her closest people face as the baby is one step closer to arriving in the real world. While Juno pursues the right ending to the ordeal, the conflict complicates itself, and emotions start running on overdrive at all the wrong moments.One major complaint is about how easy Juno treats her pregnancy. To the observant eye, you can see that Juno hides her emotional stress underneath her sarcasm and bitter tone. This is the strongest and weakest point of Juno: the writing. The script itself contains layers upon layers of great dialogue, subtle themes, smart surprises, and wraps up the whole piece nicely by the end. However, there is such thing as a script being too smart and trying too hard, and Diablo Cody wrote herself into a corner. Juno herself is interesting, spunky, smart, but too smart for her own good. It is almost impossible for a 16-year-old to be able to have any sort of knowledge of the first punk movement in 1979, especially when it seems like she is the only one in her social circle that even knows of this. Her constant pop culture references are to things that existed way before she was born; her usage of words is much too strong for someone her age. Everyone else in the movie is believable, but Juno herself is sometimes too over-the-top.While Juno is unbelievable, Ellen Page is not. Ellen Page does a great job portraying the sly main character, as she can also shed layers of emotion much like the script. However, we cannot forget the incredible performances of J.K. Simmons, Allison Janney, Michael Cera, and best of all Jennifer Garner. The persistence of Vanessa in the movie is perfectly done by Garner, who should at least have gotten some sort of Oscar nod. The acting carries this movie, and gives it a heavy dosage of realism and gritty passion that you will not find in the typical Hollywood flick. The movie tugs at your heart as the final act rolls around and we see everyone trying to be at their strongest spiritually.Bottom Line: The backlash comes mostly from those who don't truly understand Juno. Juno isn't trying to beat a message about abortion over your head, its trying to give you a charming and distinctive tale about having to face maturity several years too soon. Juno was forced to ""grow up,"" albeit temporarily, because an ""adult"" event is occurring in her teenage life. Yes, her decisions may seem a bit strange, right from the getgo, but that's who Juno is. If we can accept a man killing people while wearing a mask resembling a clown, why can't we accept a teenager that enjoys moving furniture from inside her home to the front yard of someone else's?With that said, its not the best script in years, like the Hollywood underground was saying. The movie was too smart, Juno was too smart, and relied a bit too much on pop culture. It's like Family Guy, except with actual heart and no randomness whatsoever. Diablo Cody obviously has the talent, now she has to tweak upon her mistakes made here. Juno is entertaining, will deliver laughs, is highly-quotable, and has a delightful little ending. You just want to hug this movie with all its cuteness. This movie is a bit on the overrated end, but isn't disappointing, unlike the average indie flick riding praise waves. If you want a different motion picture experience, I recommend Juno.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Don't believe the crappy reviews,"Gee, it seems like this movie has ticked off a lot of people. I must've seen another movie, as the ""Juno"" I saw was fun, witty and touching. That might be because I'm not an uptight prude... ;-) Anyway, while Juno might be just a bit too smart and wisecracking for her age, one should view this movie as a comedy with a serious core. But just as ""Garden State"" has divided the viewers, it seems like some people have a problem with quirky humor coupled with serious themes. Those who want their comedies (or drama) nicely defined and without surprises, featuring predictable people like themselves, should watch something else.

Short and very sweet,"Juno - Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) becomes pregnant by her best friend Paulee Bleeker (Michael Cera) and considers letting couple Vanessa and Mark Loring (played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) adopt the child.Firstoff, this movie's marketing felt like a clever ploy. A limited release almost a month ago? Then a bombardment of trailers giving away about 40% of the movie's best jokes. It was almost in danger of being like that Hercules cartoon for me.That said, the movie nearly lives up to it's hype. The acting is great, with a very good performance from Ellen Page. She plays the whip smart-except-for-being-a-pregnant-teen Juno. Page handles what could have been a slightly irritating character in the hands of a lesser actress. I enjoyed her commentary about high school and would have liked more. She is incredibly quirky, as is the rest of the cast. To the point where some characters sounded semi-alike at times. We must have stumbled into Napolean Dynamite land a few times. Aside from Jennifer Garner, who largely plays straight-man, there isn't a non-quirky character in the cast. This is all well and good, but occasionally it felt a little surreal. Michael Cera plays the same character he did in Arrested Development and Superbad, but like with Christopher Walken, it's such a great awkwardly funny character that nit-picking seems stupid.The movie succeeds at both the comedic (and lord are some bits funny) and dramatic bits, but possibly my favorite scene-stealing bit would have to go to Alison Janney as Juno's step-mom for the great ultrasound scene. I also loved JK Simmons as her dad. The shop owner at the beginning of the movie has possibly the greatest bit-part ever.The movie is short and very sweet.

Part-time Lovers & Full-time Friends,"When I first heard of ""Juno"", I thought it would be a sweeter version of Alexander Payne's ""Citizen Ruth"" (1996, starring Laura Dern). After seeing Jason Reitman's (""Thank You For Smoking"") new indie gem, I realized that Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), the 16 year-old who gets pregnant on her first time, has much more heart than the outrageous Ruth Stoops - Juno could actually be Enid Coleslaw's (Thora Birch in ""Ghost World"") younger sister, a girl who's smart for her age and who looks incredibly confident but, naturally, realizes that being a mother at such a young age is something she's not ready for. Her dilemma through this unexpected and unwanted pregnancy gives Diablo Cody, a former stripper in her fine first script, the chance to create a quirky dramatic comedy with equal doses of sarcasm and warmth - which makes it even superior to Payne's merciless satire.Ellen Page, after her amazing turn opposite Patrick Wilson in ""Hard Candy"", proves that she's not a one-hit wonder and that she has potential to become one of the finest names of this generation. But the entire cast is fabulous: Allison Janney (as Juno's stepmother), J.K. Simmons (as her father), Michael Cera (her part-time lover and full-time friend), Olivia Thirlby (her best friend who's into older guys - ""Me too, I love Woody Allen!""), Jason Bateman (as a possible adoptive father for Juno's baby) and, particularly, Jennifer Garner, who impresses me here as an actress for the first time. As Vanessa, the possible adoptive mother, she's human and moving, making you feel all of her character's sorrow for not being able to be a mother - unlike the sweet but immature Juno, who wants to get rid of her baby as soon as possible.Plus, not only the cast, script and directing are top-notch, but ""Juno"" also has a terrific soundtrack: The Moldy Peaches' ""Anyone Else But You"", Velvet Underground's ""I'm Sticking With You"", Cat Power's wondrous cover for ""Sea of Love"", and songs by Kimya Dawson and Belle & Sebastian, among others, help to tell Juno's whimsical journey. ""Juno"" is easily one of the best films of the year, and to those who are comparing it to the TV show ""Gilmore Girls"", as both Juno and Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) have the sharpest tongues out there, I'd say there's a big difference between them: Juno is actually funny. 10/10.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Juno hits all the right notes,"Juno...where to begin. Went to see this tonight with very high expectations. I was overjoyed that Juno payed up, and how... First of all, Ellen Page. What a wonderful little actress. I already enjoyed her smart and bitchy turn in Hard Candy, but in Juno she's a treasure to look at. The way she talks, the way she looks, the way she moves, she IS Juno. Being both naive and aware at the same time makes her a breath of fresh air to look at...to gaze at. If Ellen doesn't get her statue then no one should get it, the Academy should show some cojones and go for Page, not Piaff or Julie Christy. Going on, Juno has a great little story. It was original and sweet. Just like the characters. Juno's dad (JK Simmons) is adorable, just like Michael Cera's Bleeker. Jason Bateman is also very likable as the adopting father, and Jennifer Garner pulls it off as the desperate mom-wannabe. It's all a joy to watch, with the right pace and the right variety between drama and comedy. Juno is supported by an excellent soundtrack, with every song matching the screen.After 96 minutes, when the credits rolled past, I was crying my eyes out.

Cute but nothing special,"Well, I must confess I'm rather shocked by the extremely highly rating given to this movie by the IMDb users. In my opinion, this movie is too overrated. It's only a teen-movie, for god's sake, filled with all the elements we're tired of seeing in any other teen-movie: The stupid dialogs (seriously, does any kid speak like that in real life?), the catatonic American-rock songs, the not-so-funny jokes etc.Anyway, it sure is cute, light-hearted and positive. One thing I don't understand though, is how in the world did this movie won an Oscar? We may as well start considering if the Oscar-thing faces steadily its decadence.A couple of elements of the movie I would like to comment, are the following: a) The structure of the movie, divided in the four seasons, is quite interesting; The girl changes her moods according to the change of seasons. b) The symbolization of the running students is also well given; the boy, who is an athlete, finds happiness when he stops 'running' (from his responsibilities, that is). c) The dialogs (as mentioned above) aren't very realistic; perhaps they hide some irony or they intend to make a parody out of the standard teen-movie. All these elements, that reveal a movie well worked, save the whole thing from being a failure. But they aren't sufficient to create a movie deserving a 8.2 rating either!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Didn't believe the hype, I was very very wrong. (Unusually)","Well I never did see this because the new thing seems to be the huge promotion on the little independents. I thought ""Little Miss Sunshine"" was promoted fantastically for a very mediocre film. I held out longer than anyone because I was sure this was another of the so-called independents that wasn't worth it. However the script is very much like ""South Park"" with a lot of it's irreverent although oftentimes both true and sound like I still talk. (Yes I will be saying Dude probably till the day I die) I related to all of the characters, and thought that they were very similar to the way I felt and many of my friends did as well while in High School. I will never doubt Jason Reitman again, although Diablo Cody's script is great, I'm still not convinced w/her. Reitman however did the absolutely excellent (yet very little seen) ""Thank You for Smoking"" which everyone should see. That is just my two cents, and please take it from a guy who has seen more movies in his lifetime than everyone I've ever known combined. OK that sounded braggy, but I watch a minimum of 2 a night.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Quirky,"The movie is quirky..... Maybe ya don't wanna see it on the big screen, but in a quirky styled offbeat stage rambling... it's funny.Somebody wrote in the previous complaint review of the actress as being a 16 year old nothing reading from a script.... and I saw a 21 year old Canadian actress who had already won awards starting back in 2004 from the TV series (ongoing) Regenesis. And her acting was clever according to the script.Locally ... I couldn't believe, however,... when they had a full size poster of the DVD release of this movie portrayed in YOUR local bible belt bigoted idiot ignorant arrogant judgmental know it all territory (which I reside in) .... it was a Wal-Mart.Thank God we still have freedom of speech and stuff.Again, the movie was quirky ; ... but sorta lame. ....

Dealing with stuff way past her maturity,"This is a hugely enjoyable film. Juno is a high school kid who has to deal with an unplanned pregnancy. She does this in a very matter of fact way and after toying with the idea of abortion decides to find foster parents. The remainder of the film takes us through to the birth of the child.The real pleasure in the film is the acting and the interplay between the characters. The supporting cast including father (J.K. Simmons), step mother (Allison Janney), best friend (Olivia Thirlby), boyfriend (Michael Cera), and potential foster parents (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) all put in fine performances. Ellen Page will obviously take most of the plaudits for the lead role and deservedly so, as she makes Juno into both a very strong and sympathetic character.In many ways Juno reminds me of Leon. It is a testament to Ellen Page that her performance certainly stands comparison with Natalie Portman although I suppose Portman was at then other side of the teenage years when she filmed Leon. Juno is also considerably more upbeat and whilst an unplanned pregnancy normally leads to much angst in movies it is simply something else to deal with for Juno. My only slight reservation is that it may run the risk of glamorising teenage pregnancy.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Walks a fine line between being clever and smug but mostly is smart, funny and touching with more to it than just superficial quirkiness","Juno is a sassy but geeky teen who is ""sexually active"" at age sixteen. When she gets pregnant with friend Bleeker, she decides to have an abortion but somehow the clinic just doesn't feel right and she goes for the adoption route instead. With ""perfect"" couple Mark and Vanessa Loring set up, the father kept secret and Juno's family supportive, it is only a matter of the seven or eight months between now and then to go.Juno had me a bit worried and I wasn't really planning to see it. Indie-spirited and described as ""this year's etc etc"" I didn't feel sure that it was being praised because it was good or praised because it was just a bit different and quirky. It took me about twenty minutes to get an answer to that because, although very cool, the opening credits and soundtrack selection do scream ""quirky"" and ""kooky"" as if it was having a sale of those qualities. Indeed this does continue across the whole film as the dialogue is smart and rapid, the characters ""off-beat"" and the music slight and quirky. With this sort of material it is very easy to fall into the trap of just getting by on being cool and quirky and other similar films have done so. Fortunately Juno just about makes it work even though it walks a very fine line at times.For this director Reitman owes writer Cody a drink because the script produces great characters and interesting scenarios across the ensemble approach. Ultimately it will feel too insubstantial and quirky for some viewers but for me I was impressed by the way it drew out the various characters and twisted things to be more downbeat and realistic rather than the upbeat, sassy stuff that makes up the majority of it. Not that there is anything wrong with this though, because it was the quirky touch that got me into the film. In this area Reitman pulls it all together really well and, aside from the cosmetic touches, brings out good performances from his cast. Page dominates the film and seems to find sassy Juno effortless; however she is also good in the harder, more emotional moments ¬ñ my favourite being in the basement scene where she betrays her fragility. Cera is currently hot so makes the poster but really his role is small and mainly relies on him looking funny in shorts (which he does). His Arrested Development father Bateman is good and I liked how he held his character constant while allowing circumstances to totally change the perception of the audience. Garner does the same but in the opposite direction and her damaged, stressed character is convincing and real. Janney and Simmons are both strong in smaller roles on the ""quirky"" side of the material while the rest of the cast tend to be well observed minor characters (eg Su-Chin, Vijay, Bleeker's mum) that continue the quirky independent feel.Overall then, Juno does walk a fine line and I totally understand why some viewers will find it unbearably smug and full of its own cleverness but for me it actually has enough going on within itself to avoid being just a load of quirky characters, songs and dialogue. Page is great in the title character and the ensemble cast all turn in good performances while the script gives everyone plenty to work with. Not the second coming that some proclaim it as but certainly not the superficial quick-fest that others say it is ¬ñ the truth is somewhere in the middle and it is very enjoyable and effective while performing this balancing act.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"A Genre Should be Named after this Movie - because it will fit in Romantic, Teen, Comedy  & Drama & all of that","Review: This is the most enjoyable movie so far in 08. Sweeney Todd is good too, but this is more of the feel good kind. The centric role of the movie, played by Ellen Page, as Juno, is a 16 year old teen high schooler and a hard ass at that. She is not the gorgeous cheer leader or the slutty bitch every guy wants... She is the girl next door or even less average compared to the girl next door if you will. Her mom is divorced and sends her a cactus every valentine's day... Her dad, who is actually very cool, is into hardware, she has a step mom who has a liking to dogs and a sister by way of her step mom.. This is more than you would want to know about everyone except Juno.... Juno is the cool, smart and laid back teen that you see everyday and gets pregnant the first time she tries IT with Bleeker (Michael Cera)...The movie begins with Juno performing a multitude of pregnancy tests.. After confirmation, she tries to get the baby undone and later decides against it... She wonders about giving the baby to adoptive parents who are in real need... The scene where Juno breaks open the news of her pregnancy to her parents is a laugh riot... Her friend, played by Olivia, is the remarkably naive and equally aloof friend of Juno and does a nice job.. she is one the many characters who fit the bill and makes you wonder ""Casting is seriously a department in Movie Making"". Juno finds Jennifer Garner and her husband to be her child's adopters.... The emotions, funny ones mostly, that Juno goes through and her daily routine up until she delivers the baby is the movie in its essence.... Juno takes a liking to Garner's husband because both of them have a lot in common when it comes to topics ranging from the wood used in making the guitar to the Wizard of Gore... The movie, fortunately does not take the ugly turn, if you know what i mean.. A little later, Garner's husband gets cold feet when the delivery day nears and they actually files for divorce for reasons not shown in broad light...Juno, unable to find faith in humanity after being a spectator to Garner's life, has a talk with her father.... Juno, as the teen who realizes the fact that life is not all about being cool and smart and witty mouthed, expresses her confusion so vividly... After the talk with her father, she finds real love is actually with Bleaker.... In the meanwhile, a few other incidents happen which i might have missed in this review... its simply because all the scenes were natural and felt important and obviously i cant remember them all.... Ellen Page's performance as Juno might well be the best female lead performance you might see this year.... She is so cute.. at least to me :) When she finally says ""Bleaker is the cheese to my Maccaroni"", you know you have seen a good movie... The only minus to this movie could be, some times at hind sight, i feel that Ellen might have tried a bit harder to be cool in the movie... but thats OK.... and also, May be the movie was so real, actually, overdose of reality may be, could be the other drawback if you need a reason to reduce the points of this movie....See this movie at any cost, for, what ever your frame of mind is, its only bound to improve on the positive side.... Please watch it................................bye!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Half-baked bun in the oven,"There are many things that are redeemable about this film, but there are some flies in the ointment, as well. Let's start with what is not so good: The screenplay, which is hugely uneven, and has Juno and Leah spouting off one round after another of conceited but hugely clever, sixteen-year-old assessments of the world, in ways that no sixteen-year-old I have ever been around is able to do. Most sixteen-year-olds are anxious to sound adult, but what usually comes out of their mouths are carefully rehearsed, oft-repeated catch phrases that make the utterer sound and seem irretrievably stupid. Some of the quirkiness (and therefore attractiveness) in Juno has to do with her individuality, but she doesn't sound too terribly original when she insists that Iggy Pop made the best music that ever was (this sounds like something a teenager desperate to be different might have read and latched onto in Rolling Stone magazine), nor does she strike one as all that cool when she is shown with a cheeseburger phone that would certainly have seemed more fitting in the hands of a five-year-old. Worse yet, she decides to seduce the school dweeb, Bleeker, a boy with very little going for him except for his genetically inherited propensity for study and quietude. Unfortunately, the resolution in the film concerning Juno's relationship with Bleeker is far from satisfactory and left me wondering if I had just been to Disney. Juno's parents aren't nearly as upset as one would expect when she reveals the rather tawdry consequences of her seduction to them; but it's the heroic gesture made by Juno, to find good, loving parents for her soon-to-be-born child, that is the most muddled in this film. We are shown the characteristic suburban homes in the neighborhoods of the nouveau-riche (where the adoptive parents reside), all cookie-cutter in design and therefore lacking in originality; and I do believe that we are meant at first to dislike the adoptive mother, who comes off looking like a control freak who has stifled the last remnants of love out of a childless marriage. But then the screenwriter makes a U-turn and suddenly this woman is the victim, and the baby hers to keep, despite the break-up of the loveless marriage and the departure of the ex-husband for way cooler digs, a loft in the city. The screenwriter was at pains to show the class differences between Juno's parents and the adoptive parents, but he fumbles the ball by putting all the foul language in Juno's step-mother's mouth and by showing her out to be a hoyden most likely to take umbrage if you cross your eyes at her step-daughter: the tirade she engages in against the technician at the hospital, for example, is pointless. If it's meant to show the white working-class animus toward Hispanics, it doesn't quite work. And, it sounds terribly contrived, at the end, when Juno admits, as she's lying in her hospital bed with the dweeb, that the baby had never been her own from the start and had always really belonged to the adoptive mother. Good things about this movie: the performances of Alison Janney and J.K. Simmons, who were given precious little to work with, but who manage, just the same, to give the film some backbone; Jason Bateman's scenes with Juno are marvelously delivered. Ellen Page, on the other hand, needed to tone down the staccato rhythm of her interjections and give her character breathing room.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great film,"Great film, the dialogue was quick, witty and intelligent. I took my 12 year old and was worried about the content but it was handled very well.

After seeing PS I Love you, I was disillusioned about what is coming out of Hollywood but was glad to see this. I might keep going to the major cinemas again!

"Lighthearted teen comedy, nothing more.","The cinematography and colours were quite good and the dialogue somewhat accurately portray the way teenagers speak, and the composition of the shots are quite appealing - perhaps typical of such a high-budget modern movie.However, the message of this film is rather stomach-churning: Teenage pregnancy is undeniably an important social issue and this film appears to trivialize it - Bearing a child at the age of 16 and yet everything turns out happy and fine. Not a very good influence, is it?A good movie for a lighthearted Saturday night viewing but not something particularly memorable or worth such high acclaim.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Juno? I think you do.,"Juno is instantly charming, witty, and just plain a lot of fun to watch. You wouldn't think a movie about teen pregnancy would be much of a hoot, as the topic generally lends itself best to movie-of-the-week weepers and movies with a moral message. Juno has no message, really, other than perhaps ""It's okay to be different"" and ""Love is sometimes found right under your nose."" It's not steeped in raunchy behavior; instead, it's sweetly charming, almost daring you to find fault with it.Juno (Ellen Page) is a self-assured sixteen-year-old junior in high school, and she's just learned - after taking three home pregnancy tests - that she's in the family way. Juno is your slightly atypical caustic, sarcastic teen who takes issue with everything that society offers. To her, being popular is tantamount to being covered in hives. She's into old-school punk rock, not old-school grunge or boy-band music. She's a rebel without a cause, coping with her individuality by virtue of her quick wit and quicker tongue.Juno knows who the father is - it's wiry Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera of Superbad). The question of whether Paulie and Juno love each other doesn't even come up; even they know enough to know that their relationship isn't at that level.After some soul searching, Juno decides she wants to have the baby and then give it up for adoption. She and her best friend Leah find an ad in the Pennysaver, which leads Juno to the house of Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), a thirtyish couple that desperately wants to have a baby.But again, this is no movie of the week. There's no teary confrontation between mother-to-be and mother-wannabe; there's no tone of Great Importance about how adoption would be Right for the unborn child. The situation is what it is, and it's played for tender laughs. Juno herself says that all she wants to do is pop the baby out and hand it over - but we adults in the audience know there's always a chance that when she does give birth, she'll experience remorse and reneg on the deal. We know it might happen, because we've all seen the similar true-life stories.Juno, though, immediately takes a liking to the couple, so she plows wholeheartedly forward with the deal: she gives birth, and they get the child. Easy peasy.Supporting Juno in her decisions are her taciturn dad (J. K. Simmons) and stepmom Bren (Allison Janney), both of whom alternate between offering advice and acting exasperated at Juno's latest exploits (in a memorable early scene, Juno recreates the room where the conception took place - outside Paulie's front door). For those of you who know Simmons through his role as Spider-Man's nemesis J. Jonah Jameson, you might be surprised at how tender and loving - although still gruff - Simmons can be. He's a lot like Harry Dean Stanton in Pretty in Pink; he obviously cares very much for his daughter and wants badly to help her, but he's out of his depth as far as pregnancies go.And at the center of everything is the truly remarkable Ellen Page, a twenty-year-old petite Canadian who wins the audience over with her first appearance. As Juno, Ellen is unique, a girl dancing to the beat of her own different drummer, eschewing the rigid mores of society for a more enlightened, free-spirited outlook on life. Juno is not a delightful, happy-go-lucky girl; she's cynical, arch, and distrustful of popularity. But she's also sweet, honest, and loving, and not just any actress could be shoved into this movie like some cookie-cutter cutie from Central Casting. That's why Page's outstanding performance is such a treasure; she brings out the good and bad in Juno (which, ironically, is one of the ""messages"" the movie has for us).Juno is not a low-brow comedy about impending birth. It does not involve a wacky obstetrician, and there are no panicking grandmothers-to-be. The difficulties that Juno faces along her journey to the delivery room are firmly rooted in reality, and they're difficulties that Juno faces with aplomb. There's hardly an insincere note in this delightful gem.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The One Calorie Breath Mint,"Junoverse # 788There are comedies, there are the comedies with heart, and then there is Juno which could be referred to as either, but really deserves a class of its own.The quick dialogue never comes out of context, and the way the cast manipulates Diablo Cody's great script is as refreshing as a dose of orange tic-tacs.This movies has all kinds of laughs; those that are all out riots that cause the theatre to erupt as well as those that seem a bit more like an inside joke between you and the screen which make you chuckle to yourself. But despite all the jokes, this film still manages to deal delicately with the theme of teenage pregnancy. Juno may not know what kind of girl she is, but from the beginning she knows what she's not. In the end it a story of one girl's trust in the world, and ultimately honesty with one's self.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Spitfire ""Juno"" kicks ""Knocked Up"" to the curb","2007 has been the year of the overrated pregnancy comedy, with last summer's ""Knocked Up"" and now ""Juno"" as recipients of hype and high box office. Unlike most of the critical populace (save for a few clear-headed writers like Maryann Johanson), I found little to like in Judd Apatow's film, and was particularly turned off by its lack of realism¬ñin spite of the critical accolades it received, I found its plot machinations (and jokes) to be the stuff of stale-sitcom artificiality and Hollywood Happy Endings. I approached ""Juno"" similar to how I approached ""Knocked""¬ñit's getting a lot of press, so I'll see it.And while ""Juno"" has its share of problems (which I'll get to later), it knocks ""Knocked Up"" to the curb. The story follows 16-year old Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page¬ñ""Hard Candy""), who finds herself impregnated by soft-spoken track star Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera¬ñ""Superbad""), and the ensuing ups and downs that come from the appraisal of her classmates, her parents, and even the couple who volunteers to adopt the yet-unborn. Whereas ""Knocked"" carefully blew off issues like abortion (hit the punchline, cut to next scene!), it is the first thing Juno discusses with her best friend¬ñand while there is an undercurrent of humor to her visit to the clinic (where a classmate holds a solitary protest outside), this setpiece never ventures into cartoon terrain.While Juno herself comes off as the lost sister of the ""Ghost World"" girls, and her character and dialog can be incredibly caustic for caustic's sake (first-time screenwriter Diablo Cody's hipper-than-thou barbs are frequently over-the-top and almost trivialize the more controlled elements of the story), there is a surprising relativity in Page's performance that eventually transcends what, at first, seems like an immature, one-note teenage character.The same can be said for the ensemble cast surrounding her. Cody's script and Jason Reitman's direction cleverly works the characters from straightforward caricatures (the perpetually-perky adoptive mother; the dog-obsessed stepmother; the cheerleader friend; the dim jock) to fleshed-out, three-dimensional people whom we genuinely care about. For its first hour, ""Juno"" made me smile a lot, even laugh a few times, but only in its last third did it take on a level of complexity that gave way to a humbling maturity in Juno and those around her. I honestly did not expect the dramatic elements to kick in with such wrenching force, but they do, and they are seen through to their most logical conclusion. By the end, ""Juno"" had touched me in a manner that made ""Knocked Up"" seem all the more clueless.While I'll grant that ""Juno"" earns its laughs and tears honestly, it can also be pretentious in spots. Reitman, whose ""Thank You for Smoking"" struck me as a slick yet show-offy ensemble comedy, frequently seems to be cribbing Wes Anderson's stark aesthetic and twist-of-fate life lessons. Additionally, the soundtrack of indie songs with the minimalist guitar and faux-poetic lyrics is overincorporated¬ñwhile I understand that it's symbolizing the mentality of a teenage girl who's a bit pretentious herself, too many scenes are punctuated by it, to the point of redundancy. And even the animated opening-credits sequence seems to be invoking the Daniel Clowes-created ""Ghost World"" with another nod toward the distinctive portraits that appear in Anderson's films. On a plot level, the relationship between Juno and Paulie is developed in brief snippets throughout the film, but the plot turns in the last act don't jell quite as well as they should¬ñwhile there's a satisfactory (and perfectly believable) closure for the characters, it seems to be missing a few steps.But ""Juno"" is ultimately a modestly endearing film despite its aesthetic missteps, using a deceptively simple plot device to tell a tale that cuts to the heart of a teenager's emotional core, and presents the leap into maturity as something as painful as labor, albeit with its rewards in the end. Not one of 2007's best films, but easily the best pregnancy comedy (of errors).6.5 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A real smart girl comedy,"Like The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Superbad, Juno is partly an offshoot of the now increasingly seminal-seeming TV series ""Freaks and Geeks,"" with a loosely unified point of view, with certain actors recurring, and above all with Judd Apatow as presiding Master of the Revels. That this is, overall, a fortunate turn of affairs for American film comedy has never been more obvious than in the charming and revelatory new film about a teenage girl, Juno.Juno is a sixteen-year-old in high school who gets pregnant. She's an extension of Linda Cardellini's ""Freaks"" character, Lindsay. She's not quite a Freak or a Geek, but she refuses to conform and she's provocative, articulate, and aware she doesn't know who she is yet. In her every burst of repartee Juno's striving to define herself, stay honest and sane, and not take any crap off anybody. The important thing is the character more than the issue, though it's the measure of the fluidity and smarts of the writing that you can't really separate the two.Though his character Paulie is marvelously understated, Michael Cera, the tall young Canadian who's also one of the principals of Superbad, also defines the frame of reference a little differently from previous comedies. He's Juno's boyfriend--or her non-boyfriend, because that's still undecided too, and he's the father of her child. He's not a bad guy nor is he capable of making things alright. He's just a kid, like her. But he's sweet and decent. Juno tells him he behaves well and makes it look easy. But he says actually he works really hard at it.After an icky visit to an abortion clinic and a chat with an Asian classmate picketing it, Juno and her girlfriend Lea (Olivia Thirby) decide she's going to have the baby and they find a yuppie couple seeking adoption in a local free paper. When Juno visits Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) they're yuppies living in a McMansion, but they're sincere. Right away Juno bonds alarmingly with Mark, because he's a musician, even if he's sold out, writing for commercials.We can't tell how this all pans out because Juno is first of all a journey with surprising bumps along the way, but aside from the very funny, very smart writing throughout by Diablo Cody (that's a lady) and the fact that Ellen Page's sharp tongue is sweetened by the fact that she's completely adorable, this movie is rounded out by alternative points of view. Juno's dad (a very strong J.K. Simmons) is wholly supporting, but she has a stepmother (""The West Wing's"" Allison Janney) whose remarks are tinged with acid. Most importantly for a good while in the middle Vanessa and Mark draw the viewer's attention. How are they handling all this? What does it mean to have to adopt? What strains is their marriage under? The movie takes a good look at them before going back to Juno.""Freaks and Geeks"" ends with members of the two groups hanging out together. To begin with Lindsay was a bit of both. If she hung out with the Freaks, her younger brother Sam, the number two character, was 100% Geek. Paulie is a kind of geek: he does extremely well in school. But he's also a jock, perpetually seen in running togs or with the cross country team. The essence of the ""Freaks and Geeks"" point of view is that though categorizing in youth is a relentless social process, categories are essentially limiting and false.Juno comes across as smarter and less lame than Knocked Up. It's not a fat Jewish boy's fantasy of being accepted by a cute girl. It's ending is a bit of a cop-out, but essentially what matters is the way the prevailing voice encompasses young attitudes and realities As in the Apatow comedies the message remains that it's hip and okay to be a good person. But since this is a collective kind of comedy that's been emerging, there's no one truth and some of the scenes and ideas in Juno too are lame while some others are exceptionally humorous and witty.These new comedies are cool: they devise a loose system where it's hard to go wrong, and Juno goes particularly right. This is the real woman's version of Knocked Up: that's why the title is the name of the girl. Juno remains Juno¬óeven ""knocked up."" This is the essential point. How Mark and Vanessa turn out is left hanging. The ending feels a little bit incomplete. Partly this is TV series thinking, where it's assumed there's always another episode coming along later to tie up loose ends. It's in the classic nature of comedy to embrace people and reconcile us to things. Juno like the best new American comedies provides a framework to see contemporary reality and embrace it. Director Jason Reitman, whose first film, Thank You for Smoking, was more satirical and political, has come into the fold.When Juno's had her baby, she and Paulie go back to playing in a band together. In high school, it's a lot better when music is the most important thing, not having babies. Yes, this is ""feel-good"" stuff, but it's smart, even if its sitcom-casual structure has some holes in it. Maybe Apatow has peaked as a comedy impresario with this one. Word is out that he takes a dive with Walk Hard.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
So overrated,"This movie is completely overrated. The dialogue was like an episode of Dawson's Creek taken to the Nth degree. It was trying so hard to be 'quirky' that it felt completely contrived. Um, you guys need to figure out that REAL quirky people are NOT trying so hard to be quirky. Real 'creative' people just are. That's it. This is somehow failed to be grasped by the general populace. Somehow this 'seems' authentic to many, given the predominance of positive ratings. Granted, I am an artist, like many indie films, and actually am a fan of Belle and Sebastian (which weighed heavily in the soundtrack). You'd think I would have appreciated this effort. But, it honestly seemed like a half-hearted Napoleon Dynamite rip-off that was in need of heavy revisions. It just didn't ring true. The guy who was complaining about Page's flat chest just needs to get a life. Maybe he should compensate for his lack of 'junk' (as per Juno dialogue). I actually thought much of the acting was good. The script was the weakest part. I only laughed at about 10% of the jokes. I consider myself to have a healthy sense of humor. I feel that the person who wrote this was arrogant and was not self-critical enough. But considering the 'rave' reviews, why the flip would that person bother? People are stupid. This is further proof.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Cute and likable.,"Independent films are an interesting breed. Made outside the mainstream studio structure, the best ones compensate for their lower production value with a better story and characters. Every year an indie or two does captures the collective fascination of critics and the public by doing so. This year's darling is ""Juno"", the name of the newly pregnant teenage girl around whom the simple story revolves.Like many such films, ""Juno's"" strengths lie in its unique characters. Foremost among them is the titular one, who has a singular vernacular and attitude that carries the movie. As she decides what to do with the child, she must also deal with the various reactions from her family and friends. But rather than become depressed or reclusive, Juno instead chooses a positive approach, dealing with her issues directly and responsibly. This leads to a relatively sunny take on subjects often approached in a dark or politically charged manner. The movie does tell you what to think about issues; it does not argue strongly either way; it just tells you what characters are doing, and gives a little of their rationale, somewhat like Clint Eastwood's phenomenal ""Million Dollar Baby"" a few years back.On one hand, making light of serious situations like abortion and divorce feels wrong. Conversely, the ability and opportunity to laugh at potentially overbearing situations is a relief, and it is part of what makes us human. While such reactions likely would not be appropriate in reality, movies are not reality, but an escape in which a little levity is more than appropriate.From the guitar-laced harmonic strains of its soundtrack to the aforementioned quirky characters, ""Juno"" is a quintessential indie flick. Like ""Garden State"", it has a few transcendent glimpses into the human soul, but they are too few and far between to carry the movie to extreme heights. Like ""Little Miss Sunshine"", it places quirky characters into unusual and often comic circumstances, but the humorous moments here do not approach the hilarity of ""Little Miss Sunshine"". Most of the comedy is based upon the unique dialogue or the continual series of culture clashes between Juno and everyone, which are amusing throughout.Some critics (Roger Ebert) are hailing ""Juno"" as the year's best film, which is a drastic overstatement. Such grand labels are a joke, and a statement on how monotonous comedies have become. Its ipseity amidst the dramatic leanings of most Oscar contenders makes the movie better and more enjoyable than it actually should be. Juno is a cool breeze drifting through an open window, not an eye-popping blast from the air conditioner. It is enjoyable and well-crafted, not the best film of the year, maybe a fringe contender for the top ten.Bottom Line: The movie is equivalent to its main character: cute and likable, but lacking in a few areas. Recommended primarily for indie fans. 7 of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Juno Is Perfection.,"I first saw Juno on the night before Valentine's Day, and I instantly fell in love with it. It became one of my top 10 favorite movies as soon as it ended.This morning, my Grandma channel surfed the TV guide and it turned out that Sundance was airing Juno. I saw that and said: ""Oh, Juno! That's a great movie!"" So she turned it on and watched it, and I saw half of it with her(since I was getting ready for the day.) She loved it too. In fact, when I joined her, she told me that she was hooked.Juno is about a teen girl, who after a one night stand with her best friend, gets pregnant. After rejecting an abortion, she finds and befriends an adoptive couple, and a relationship blooms.I personally find Juno to be a flawless movie. If I had to nick pick anything, it would have to be the one pointless F bomb that's used in the labor scene. That would seriously be it.Juno works on many levels. For starters, the character development is a pleasure to witness. Juno and her friend Paulie have great chemistry together and their transformation from friends to a couple is very realistic and heartfelt.Vanessa and Mark also work well as the the to-be adoptive parents. There is even a change in their relationship at the end, making for a great twist in what otherwise might have been a cliche or simple pregnancy story.Juno is also a very effective comedy. For instance, my favorite joke happens in a scene where Juno asks her father if true love can really last. He describes what a person who truly loves you does, which includes: ""The right person will still think the sun shines out your a$$."" It's funny, but so true!Juno has many witty jokes and one-liner like this, and that's part of it's charm. Even when a joke isn't cracked, it's still a pure delight that never fails to make one smile.The camera work success most with the color contrast. Jason Reitman, the director, blends clothes with backgrounds and sets in a way that it's pleasing to the eye, even if it's just everyday looking.Juno is not just great entertainment, it can be a great educational tool. If you have a teenager, know a teenager, or you ARE a teenager, this is a movie you should get around to seeing. This wonderfully shows what pregnancy is like, and why, while it's beautiful, it should be saved for someone special and at the right time.As I mentioned in the plot summary, Juno considers and rejects having an abortion. As someone who is pro-life, I really appreciated that aspect. Juno did have a choice, and she chose to benefit another couple before herself, which is really moving.The movie doesn't really condemn abortion though, it just shows that it wasn't the right choice for Juno. That makes for a nice balance that wouldn't cause rallies in front of Fox's movie studio.People like to say that there is really no such thing as a perfect movie. I offer Juno as my rebuttal. It's a masterpiece in a way you wouldn't expect. As a teaching tool or a piece of time-killing entertainment, Juno succeeds on all possible levels. It takes true talent to make a movie this special. I'm grateful that such talent exists.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
a tempered response...,"the ""teen movie"" certainly lends itself to stylized dialogue (see: Heathers, Clueless, Brick), but unlike in those films, Juno finds its footing rather awkwardly. the first ten minutes or so are patience-testing as the patois is established, and too often veers into hipster-posturing. but once the ""adults"" show up, things brighten considerably. the ever-reliable J.K. Simmons and Alison Janney are perfectly cast as Ellen Page's parents and provide most of the film's most effective moments. (Page continues to display an impressive promise.) there are funny moments/lines through-out, some nice bits of film-making (my favorite being the sequence of the busticated mini-van driving past a series of upper-class suburban manses), and a great soundtrack (extra points awarded for using Buddy Holly's obscure gem ""Dearest""). the crucial flaw for me was the fact that Juno was the only complete character in the movie ¬ñ most of the surrounding characters (despite how well-played they were) amounted to little more than sketches, and without them being fleshed-out more thoroughly, the movie ultimately felt solipsistic. i had other, more minor qualms as well (for example, i definitely felt the abortion/choice issue was handled rather glibly, and several of the pitfalls of the amerindie-whimsy trend were far from avoided). but overall, it's an enjoyable picture ¬ñ i don't understand the ecstatic reception it's receiving, but i do think it's worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A gem,"this is one pop culture touchstone that has aged super well. i can't believe this came out 10 years ago, because it feels as relevant and funny as it did when it first hit screens in 2007. Diablo Cody's writing mingles perfectly with Jason Reitman's soft handed direction and this remains the high water mark for both creatives. acting is great across the board. if you've been dodging this particular piece of americana, now is the perfect time to give it a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Juno is a mostly enjoyable comedy about teen pregnancy and its aftermath,"I just saw this movie with my parents. My dad complained about the title character's lines saying they're more likely to come from an adult than from an actual teenager. My mom just seemed to like the wittiness of the whole movie. During much of the beginning, I was ready to agree how overrated and pretentious some of this movie was based on reading many of the comments I've scanned through here. But while not every pop-culture reference was funny and I half wondered how many viewers would get the comparisons of Dario Agento to Herschell Gordon Lewis (with a scene from one of his movies, to boot!), I was enthralled by the various relationships between the characters and actors and the way they mainly flowed under Jason Reitman's direction of Diablo Cody's Oscar-winning screenplay. While Ellen Page also deserved her Academy Award nom as Best Actress, the most compelling performances to me were the potential adoptive parents played by Jason Bateman and especially Jennifer Garner. As an ""Arrested Development"" fan, it's also a little strange seeing Bateman and his TV son Michael Cera here and yet since they're not related in this film, they don't have any scenes together. But that's not too much distraction to me. Add in J. K. Simmons as Juno's father and Allison Janney as her stepmother and this movie is nearly perfect. There's also an amusing turn by Rainn Wilson in the beginning. While perhaps not a great lesson on pregnancy and its choices, Juno does manage to consider there are such choices. All considered, this movie is mostly enjoyable enough that I may consider seeing it again sometime soon.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
jason reitman did it again,"first was thank you for smoking then this gem... JUNO this was a very surprising little movie... well i don't know if you can call being the #2 movie in America little, but for an independent staying above some of the Hollywood big budget movies, its holding its own... actually its winning in some areas! like story, acting, directing, etc. reitman surprised me with thank you for smoking and i went into this thinking i would enjoy it and i did. maybe one of the best movies of the year so far. jason bateman surprised me with his great acting here and he gave the scene stealing performance of the movie, every scene he was in, he stole in my opinion. everyone else did what i expected of them, jennifer garner was alright, but in my opinion she was the weakest link in all of the actors... she got alittle annoying during the whole thing, maybe that was the point. my review goes well on the acting, directing, story, script, and overall i give it a 9. top 5 of 2007-08 so far!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

real life ride,"Just finished watching that movie. I found it enjoyable and it made me feel good about life. I was especially impressed by the way Juno handles her sensitive situation. Unexpected pregnancy at such an early age is something that may be too much for a teenage girl and she could easily crack up. However, Juno weighs up the options available to her. She has to choose between abortion, having the baby and putting it up for adoption or raising it by herself. The last option isn't really considered and at first she wants to have an abortion but soon she decides against it. Her close friend suggests finding a foster family for the baby in one of the ads from married couples wanting to adopt a baby. Unfortunately, the couple she chooses isn't going to become a wonderful family she longs to provide for the baby. Juno becomes disappointed and wonders about the relationships people have. That's when she gets closer with the father of her baby. She starts to notice the things about him that she didn't see before, and she falls in love with him. First she regarded him as just a friend she happened to have sex with, but now she finds that they really could be together.The movie is very optimistic. It shows that a pregnancy at a very early age is not the end of the world and a pregnant teen doesn't have to choose only between abortion and struggling to raise the baby by herself. She can have the baby and give it away to a couple that will take care of it. That way, the girl can go on with her life as a typical teenager and at the same time she can fulfill the dreams of people who cannot have a baby but would love to adopt one.I liked the reaction of Juno's parents to the news about her daughter getting pregnant. They didn't condemn her at all. On the contrary, they proved very supportive of her and helped her deal with the situation she found herself in.I found the movie very uplifting. It shows us that even in such difficult circumstances you can find the right solution.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Excellent Film,"I have been reading a lot of comments here, and people seem way off base in most of the criticisms directed at this film. Due to the pacing and bare-bones approach, I can understand how this might not be everyone's cup of tea, but to attempting to justify disliking this film by calling it unrealistic smacks of insecurity.To those who feel that the dialogue is unrealistic, well, you must not know many teenagers! If you did you'd know that they speak (amongst themselves especially) in a dialect all their own, and they do it effortlessly and constantly. The dialect varies due to regional, ethnic, and class differences, but Junospeak is appropriate to a certain middle class suburban/small city/large rural community in the midwestern or western US. Would every teenager drop cultural, literary and musical reference at a machine gun pace? No, but the small percentage that does actually prides itself on the ability in such a way that they secretly (and obsessively) practice and research the habit. The reason that this film is perceived as having a certain agenda is not because it has one, but because it doesn't! It is distinct because most Hollywood films DO, and the fact that this film is not in lock step makes it appear to have its own agenda.Overall, you may or may not like this film, but I think that there is very little in the script, directing, or acting (which is extremely strong) that you can fairly say is not well-done, and therefore deserving of the praise that many have heaped upon this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Juno in translation,"The comedy who triumphed at Rome Film Festival finally got to Italy, accompanied by Fox's great box office expectations, although I'm nearly totally sure ""Juno"" will flop here: for example, in my local theater there were only twelve people or maybe less. I don't care about it, because I enjoyed every little scene. The dialogue's translation tried to maintain the original liveliness, and even if they could result less hilarious than in English, I think a good job has been done: in fact, it mustn't be a very easy process. Ellen Page deserved completely the Oscar nomination: her simplicity, her passion, her sweetness and her irony trasude from every line, bringing a new light to the screen. Instead, Jennifer Garner really surprised me: she showed noteworthy acting skills that comic-book movies never require, and she made Vanessa's character natural and nicer. I cared for Vanessa as much as I cared for Juno. The movie doesn't take a clear position about unplanned pregnancies, but I felt as if Diablo Cody and Jason Reitman wanted to say that those are personal choices that mustn't be questioned, that's why I thank them. They gave me emotions I'll never forget.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

movie about abortion?,"someone above commented about watching a movie about abortion? if you know it has Oscar nominations(well, had at the time) then maybe before you comment you should actually read the synopsis of the movie. look at the movie cover, since you obviously didn't watch the damn thing. there's obviously no abortion. i always figured that maybe the people giving a review/critique/etc about a movie had the vaguest idea of the plot line. i have to admit that it bothers the hell out of me when people actually try to give a professional critique of a movie that they obviously haven't seen. and as far as the comment about it being a comedy goes, Jesus man watch the freaking movie. don't try to act as if you're so much better then a movie that accidentally went mainstream. if you want to stick a comedy label on it i'd go with dark comedy because it's a serious movie. i think you're pretty much the only one to label it ""another teen comedy"". get real. it's not something that you watch if you want to have a good laugh. i think the thing that makes me smile is reading about how such and such a movie swept europe when we all know you're in your underwear watching superbad. don't even try to play.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Balance,"Juno is a very sweet film, many would think that this film is just more comedy and juvenile delinquency, but it is a big mistake,Although there are indeed many negative actions here, but at least there is a moral and there are many moral messages that can be taken from this film, so this film can be said to be balanced in the story.Ellen Page (Eliiot) is one of my favorite actresses, but unfortunately she's not what she used to be, watching this movie reminds me of a sweet and cute ellen.I highly recommend this film, even though many think this film is inappropriate at the beginning, but believe me they will immediately understand what the purpose of this film is after the film ends.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best Chick Flick Motion Picture Ever Made!,"Juno is a cute brilliant tale about a teenage girl, Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), who's faced with an unexpected pregnancy, and enlists the aid of her best friend in finding the unborn child a suitable home in this coming-of-age comedy drama from Thank You for Smoking director Jason Reitman.At first I thought it was a cheesy chick-flick, but truly, I was astounded especially by the fantastic role of Ellen Page who definitely, or in other words, should've won the Oscar for best performance by an actress in a leading role. This film was nominated for 4 Oscars including best direction Jason Reitman, best picture Lianne Halfon, Mason Novick, and Russell Smith. Also including best original screenplay Diablo Cody, and best actress Ellen Page. All of the main and major categories of the academy awards. But just won one for best screenplay original! Which really surprised me. And when this masterful teenage genuine classic released on DVD, I bought it for my family to enjoy that night. Turns out, it was perfect. The humor was continuous and hysterical. The pace was of the picture was very well layed-out. And, with Page's performance, she gave you deep inside emotions when the story continued on into a more emotionally draining picture. Then went straight back to the comedy Juno just has a blast with as the audience rapidly soars into the teenage world of MacGuff's extraordinary bizarre high school life.Juno is my 3rd favorite film of all time, next to Schindler's List and Lord of the Rings 1. I was extremely surprised this masterpiece never won best picture. Because from my opinion, I thought it was better than No Country for Old Men. And when Page never won that Oscar, I was truly disappointed, but other than that. Juno is not the, but one of the best motion picture's of all time. But for its category and genre, it is the best. Highly entertaining, and greatly recommended even for people who don't enjoy chick flicks, you'll still like it. Breathtaking movie masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Lot Smarter Than You Think.,"Plot:When 16-year-old Juno MacGuff (Page) gets pregnant by her not-quite-boyfriend (Cera), she elects to have the child adopted by a wealthy suburban couple (Bateman and Garner). Then the problems really start...Review:Teenage pregnancy, tough note to some, more of a tough note to the parents of the supposed victimless teenager whose new found realisation is bestowed upon. Juno is a witty and very clever tale of a down to earth 16 year old who comes to age, so to speak of her really, really unplanned pregnancy, in a film which receives more coverage than the other two films put together.The second film from director Jason Reitman, following from his smooth debut piece' Thank You For Smoking', and the first script from multi-careered Diablo Cody, of details we won't go into right now. Juno has the first trouble for being compared in the same demeanour and style as 2007's 'Superbad' which, in addition, stared Michael Cera prior to Juno. Some gloat that it tries to impress, but be like any other film loving viewer and go see it to judge. A three-act structure that follows the emotional highs and lows of Juno's winter-to-summer pregnancy, the film saves its aces for last.A touchy subject is the main brunt from audiences to try to wonder why to approach a such a 'Serious' subject, all too common in the UK, which will cause some segregation. The first ten-fifteen minutes will possibly have you confused with ayes and nays.Our heroine? She is our cool-old school- rock loving teen who happens to be more retro than todays rampant bunch, more so on Ellen Page' part for a playing a younger role. Thankfully she plays it well, showing perhaps maybe there is hope for the next generation. Juno has her cheerleader best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) to discuss to for the big news, offering support for the ride to come, the pace and tone shifts to a more floating setting and full of more warming scenes.One of the surprises of Juno's character is her unwavering wit, it just so happens to act as a blanket for her insecurities and a strategic defence for people's opinions; she is definitely given the main spotlight for a reason, her witty, cunning and self-sufficient manner. This is the key to when she breaks the news to the old Step-Mum and Dad, (you knew it was coming) played by J. K. Simmons and step-mom Allison Janney, who add a lot of depth on their part to the story, not grief stricken about their daughters lack of control and immaturity but her maturity to give the unborn baby to adoptive parents, everything is planned out well, what's to worry about? Juno's up the duff, big time, the more is shows the more problems it brings, but carefully written scenes and moments show Juno's softer side, and is first glimpsed in her relationship with the baby's father, Paulie (Michael Cera).Here come the crazy adoptive parents! The wife, and soon to be mother, Vanessa (Jennifer Garner), uptight high-class control-freak, leaving our sympathies to side with, albeit relaxed, father Jason Bateman's Mark, a former grunge musician who matches Juno's personality so well, from music, to living style.""I'm dealing with things way beyond my maturity level,"" she tells her dad, as an example of the type of conversations Juno has with her understand father after she finds herself drawn to Mark and his collection of, music, gore movies and manga comics. This does really show how young she is. Scenes like this that gives the film depth, as Juno gradually discovers who's on her side in life's battle. The almost wholly without dialogue, scenes shows the greatest achievement in emotional impact and restrain from making it too dramatic, it also bodes well with Juno's character when in the midst of all hell on earth, she keeps that whit, that fast-talking loudmouthed mind to a closed silence.Verdict:Sharply written, funny in the right places, heart-warming and 'edge-of-your-seat' enjoyment. What you need for a great time. 8.5/10.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Hits mostly true notes,"A sort of small movie that made it big. The film hit mostly true notes. Ellen Page showed much talent, carrying this movie on her shoulders. Her way of speaking, while a bit annoying to me (at my age) did bring back remembrances of teenage years, mine and others, where young people are trying out a lot of things, trying to establish their individual identity. I would have thought that cell phones would have been ubiquitous among teenagers in 2007, even in Minnesota. I didn't really notice if there were any (other) cues (car models, etc.) that the setting may have been some time prior to that. Anyway, I liked the film, but do not find it as big of a deal as some others have. Oh yeah, and interesting how the Hollywood Left crowd is militant on abortion, but I never heard any criticism of how the clinic was portrayed, and how it influences Juno' decision.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A Complex Tale Told with Humor, Tenderness, and Simplicity","Teenage pregnancy is frequently a starting point for myriad philosophical arguments: some see it as a major problem, some see it as an argument for the need of early teaching of contraceptive technique and sex education, some see it as a reason for championing abortion, and some see it as a piece of life that confronts families in both positive and negative ways. JUNO is a beautifully written (Diablo Cody) and directed (Jason Reitman) version of unplanned pregnancy offered by a splendid ensemble cast: it is a movie that could modify the sociologic outlook of many people in a very strong fashion.Juno (Ellen Page) is sixteen and talks her best friend Bleek (Michael Cera) into having sex: the result is a surprise pregnancy that Juno shares with her girlfriend Leah (Olivia Thirley) and the store clerk Rollo (Rainn Wilson) even before informing Bleek, a likable kid who seems fairly flat about the situation. After discarding abortion as a viable solution, Juno informs her father (JK Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney) of her status, and tells them she is going to complete the pregnancy and give the baby to some loving and needy barren couple. Her parents are at first flustered by the news, but quickly become supportive in a way that tells us many things about the durability of successful families. With Leah's help, Juno answers an ad for 'wanted: baby' in PennySaver and visits the Lorings (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) who desperately want a child and embrace Juno's gesture of adoption with eager excitement. The remainder of the film follows Juno as her abdomen increases in girth, finding new respect for her parents and for Bleek, and inadvertently walking in the troubled waters of the Loring's marital discord. Without giving the story away, the ending is so tender and free of clich√© that it allows us, the audience, to appreciate all the vigor and sensitivity and humor and warmth of Juno - an example of developing maturity that is a fresh breeze compared to the usual teenage movies.Ellen Page does indeed deliver a pitch perfect performance, but her co-stars are equally fine: Simmons and Janney break away from their usual type cast roles brilliantly, and the other members of the cast (the entire cast) flesh out this well written story with great skill. The mixture of animated graphics and the imaginative musical score enhance the flavor of the tale. JUNO offers an unbiased look at the topic of teenage pregnancy and wins on every level.

Delivers slightly more than you'd expect but still very much only for an audience that 'likes' this kind of film,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe titular Juno (Ellen Page) is an off-beat young woman in a small US town who finds herself unexpectedly pregnant. Although the father, Bleeker (Michael Cera) is someone she is on good terms with, this isn't how she planned her life and so she tries to sell her baby off to wealthy suburban couple Vannessa (Jennifer Garner) and Mark (Jason Bateman) whilst dealing with all the emotional complications along the way.Despite the mostly favourable reviews this has received, Juno didn't look like the type of film I would plan to see. But, ma and pa ordered it along with another film and since it was lying around I thought: why not, I may as well. While I haven't seen a film that I'm likely to remember or that I can honestly say is one of the best films I've seen this year, this is undeniably an intelligent, well written comedy film from director Jason Reitman.Clever though the writing is, ironically it also created some problems with me. Firstly, without stereotyping, from what popular culture has lead me to believe, American teenagers are certainly not this smart or talk in such a smart and sophisticated way. Further-more, if Juno is this intelligent and worldly wise at her tender age, why has she not heard of contraception, which would have stopped her problems in the movie altogether?Not really my type of film, then, but better than expected and one of the better comedies of the year, probably. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Language Barriers,"The largest issue that I have heard people complain about is how unbelievable the dialog is. I don't buy that.Two of my friends and I speak using words and phrases that we essentially invented when we are around each other. We crack jokes given the smallest setup. It is just how we communicate.I am used to everybody being witty, pop culture references being commonplace, and people talking about things outside of their age group.I guess it also depends on the group of people you hung around when you were that age. I can see parts of myself reflected in many of these characters, which is probably why I connected so well with the movie itself.In addition, this is another example of the importance being shifted away from the story itself and towards the way it is told.

Ellen Page delivers the goods,"Having enjoyed Ellen Page's performance in Hard Candy I looked forward to seeing this. Once again Ellen's performance was first rate, this time playing a sixteen year old who gets pregnant after having sex with her friend Bleeker (Michael Cera). Her initial reaction to the situation is to seek an abortion but changes her mind when she is unimpressed with the clinic.Juno realises that she is too young to raise the child so seeks a couple to adopt it. The couple she finds finds seem perfect, she is desperate to have a child and he is a cool guy that Juno relates to as the discuss their tastes in music and horror films. Of course there are some problems along the way but I won't go into details as I'd rather not spoil the film too much.If you haven't seen this film yet I'd certainly recommend it, I enjoyed it from start to finish and laughed out loud a few times. The acting is top notch, both from Ellen and from the supporting cast. The dialogue is sharp through out, perhaps a little too sharp for a girl of Juno's age but I don't think that matters as it is delivered believably. I'm not surprised that Ellen Page got an Oscar nomination for this film, I'm sure it is only a matter of time before she wins one.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"It is never conventional or predictable, just a joy to watch.","While 'Juno (2007)' sometimes tries a little too hard to be 'quirky', this is an enjoyable and unique comedy that's never conventional or predictable. There's been quite a bit of backlash against it since its initial release, but I think it handles its subject matter with maturity in general. This push-back against its presentation is, to me, undeserved as it's the outer-layer of the flick that allows it to stand-out but it's the inner-layer that contains all of its heart. It doesn't preach and, as such, is an entertaining experience. Its ultimately an experience essentially enhanced by its 'quirkiness', too, and is a general joy to watch. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Entertaining and cute - and extremely desperately trying to be hip and indie,"I think there are two major problems with this movie.The first thing is that the movie really tries to be cute on the one hand, but one the other deep and moving. Therefore those two aspects somehow collide into kitsch. The characters, even the married couple often cited as the ""only convincing and authentic characters"" in this movie are not realistically portrayed. I mean the problems all those characters are going through are extremely hard to get by. It's way more complicated, especially a teenage pregnancy followed by adoption can lead to serious problems. I just think that its not convincing that Juno or bleek didn't even wanted to see the child. Also the dialogue seems often stylized which can be annoying at times.Then the other problem is that Juno is desperate to look like a independent movie, ""stealing"" from both - indie-rock and indie-film-culture. there are plenty of references to rock-culture that are rather superficial and pointless than smart and subversive. Every Minute of the movie you see that they somehow try to create those authentic aesthetics indie-movies often have and also tries to appear as a film with rather complex relationship dynamics. However, it doesn't work. This is an good ol√© Hollywood flick, i would even call it family entertainment. It cannot hide the fact that it is. People expecting something else will eventually be disappointed.Nevertheless, the movie has many strong points (I remember myself saying """"this is the best movie ever""). I loved the movie for its dry humor. The dialogue may be stylized, but is also quick and refreshing, making you laugh and thinking ""geez, why can't people in real life talk like this?"". Furthermore, i think the characters, at least most oft them, are very likable. They make the movie really cute and warm.

Whats all the fuss about,"Im not saying this is a bad film, however how it deserves the title of one of the greatest films of 2007 is beyond me. the plot is very poor and follows another film involving pregnancy in knocked up. whereas knocked up deals with both emotions felt by the man and the woman with an unexpected pregnancy, Juno's character was the main focus of the film with the other roles being quite minimal in contrast. the comedy element is also lacking especially for a film as short as this. apart from childish quotes from Juno herself the comedy element is in short bursts and is not fluent throughout the film, and the emotional aspect isn't really touched upon either. there is no way this film deserves to be classified as better than other comedy/emotional of 2007 and how it gained all this critical acclaim is a question i keep on asking myself.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A great feel-good movie!,"I love it! Not since Stranger Than Fiction have I thoroughly enjoyed a movie in this genre as much as Juno.It's a deceptively simple plot line (teenager gets knocked up and puts it up for adoption), but never has teen pregnancy been portrayed in such a comedic yet sweet manner. Sure, the dialogue is too witty and clever to be mouthed off by practically the entire cast but that's part of the reason why Juno is such a nice surprise; it's self-effacing and doesn't take itself too seriously but bothers to leave a great message anyway.Playing the titular character is Ellen Page, who is wonderful as an incredibly pretty tomboy who looks like she's straight out of a Judy Blume book. The rest of the cast are just as amazing: Michael Cera (Superbad, Arrested Development) plays Paulie Bleeker, the unassuming geek-next-door who knocks up Juno, Rainn Wilson (The Office) as the acerbic storekeeper Rollo, Jennifer Garner (Alias) as eager mum-to-be Vanessa Loring and Jason Bateman (Arrested Development) as her hubby stuck-in-the-90s Mark. Even the parent characters (Allison Janney as stepmom Bren and J.K. Simmons as Juno's dad Mac) who are normally stereotyped get their share of the good lines.The direction of Jason Reitman (Thank You for Smoking) is wonderfully light and moody, matching the offbeat but lovable script by stripper-turned-screenwriter Diablo Cody. The soundtrack, set and costume design all helped fortify the overarching mood of this feel-good movie. I look forward to seeing more material from Reitman, Cody or Page!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Classy & Cute,I enjoyed the film a great deal because it was classy. It took the lives of two very realistic characters and put them into a very realistic problem. The characters were believable and touched on subject's student's embrace these days in high school. The comedy itself swings around the lifestyle of living in a somewhat small town vs. the larger city lifestyle. Where everyone knows everyone and everything you do so nothing goes unknown. But the main character has a funny way of dealing with all the issues at hand with her fast pace humor or quick jokes. So no matter the situation it seems nothing will ever be a let down. Life is never simple as it goes though and even when things seem as perfect as can be things can change on you. Through the strength of true friendship and trust along with the deeper understanding of love one can find ways to over-come what burdens the heart. You can find that with time problems can be resolved with careful planning and discussion. In the end everyone found their rightful place to be with lessons well learned.,6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"a smart, believable little film","Having just seen this film Christmas eve, to what I thought was a surprisingly packed theatre, I feel quite satisfied. I had heard some mixed chatter heading in, although it was mostly positive, and the film did not disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed the intro, but after the credits I felt that it did lag for about 15 minutes. A few of the initial exchanges between juno and her friend felt strange and forced, but overall it laid a solid groundwork for introducing us to Ellen Page's Juno. And it must be said that Ellen Page is excellent. I had only seen her briefly in the throwaway X3 previously, and she thoroughly impressed me here. Her performance is certainly what anchors the film. This isn't a typical ""teen"" movie, nothing over the top happens, it isn't absolutely riotous (though it is quite funny). It is, if nothing else, very real. And this all centers on Page's utter believability. She is witty and confident and quirky and unique, but also acts very much her age, and is vulnerable as well.The other standout performance is the always excellent Jason Bateman. He certainly has a feel for comedy, but he plays it rather understated here to great effect. The subtlety of his reactions both around his wife, and then the effect Juno has on him, were impressive. I was certainly hoping to see him and Micheal Cera together in a scene once again, but was left disappointed.I would definitely recommend this film. It is being compared to Garden State and Little Miss Sunshine by many people, and I would have to agree that all three films possess at least some of the same characteristics. Jason Reitman has gone 2 for 2, having followed up the effective Thank You For Smoking, with this excellent sophomore effort. It's definitely worth checking out, especially when confronted with the relatively terrible film selection at present.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Overrated? True. Worthless? It is not.,"Wow, it looks like everybody's getting very political about this movie. I did not think being pro or against abortion was such a dividing and decisive issue in the States. But so it seems. However, I'd rather not take sides, if you don't mind.Juno definitely is overrated. But is it any surprise to anyone? It is not a new phenomenon that movies, the merits of which are scarce or disputable pocket a swath of coveted awards. Being politically correct or articulating an opinion popular with those setting the rules can by itself be very fruitful. No elaborate plot, sophisticated camera movement, sublime dialogue or unforeseen twists are needed to get the collecting of statues and shiny artifacts of all sizes started. Juno is lacking most of the above qualities, but still I did not feel that deceived to have sat it through. Yes, it is cute, and it is not very likely that a 16-year-old, music channel led teen would own up to her situation this maturely, but I'd be lying if I said I did not enjoy Juno at all. A few lines of conversation are quite funny, Juno's cynical remarks are sometimes rather witty (and likable, provided you can put it aside that they are more likely to come from the mouth of a thirty-something intellectual), while the acting of Ellen Page is far better than average. She is a natural. You still can tell she is playing a role but given her age and her tendencies of always making the most of it, no great imagination is needed to predict she will be world-class very soon.Juno would have made a funny, lightweight comedy even the most unrelenting, most critical, stone-faced film buffs could have enjoyed to a certain extent had it not been for the fragile and divisive issue it brings forth. 'Cause yes, it was meant to be a comedy. So don't tell me that Jennifer Garner's tears are about the only thing in its right place.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Do you have a crush on Juno?,"When's the last time do you remember laughing at a teacher putting a condom on a banana? Or a teenager peeing on a home pregnancy test? Or quote ""Thundercats a go!?"" Diablo Cody writes her intimate character portrait Juno, starring Ellen Page in the title role as a young teenager who gets pregnant and decides to give it up to a family unable to have children.Thank You for Smoking's director Jason Reitman helms this ship of laughter, tenderness and Hamburger phones. The narrative is absolutely fantastic as it keeps the viewer engaged at all times but in essence, it's the hypnotizing dialogue from the screenplay by Diablo Cody that makes the film work so well.Ellen Page turns in one of the year's best performances as the young na√Øve and charming Juno MacGuff. She'll steal your heart with her wonderful one liners and equally break it with her character breakdowns and insecurities. Even though this has no measure to her Oscar snubbed performance in Hard Candy, this does hold some time of candle to it and is complete contention for an Oscar nomination. The role however, doesn't possess that extra mile to steamroll any other female performer this year. But its not only Page that makes the film succeed.Some of the supporting players turn some of their best performances of their careers. Michael Cera popularly known as the innocent ""Evan"" from Superbad, plays Paulie Bleeker, the ""father-to-be-not"" and gives a charming comedic performance. His role however doesn't require much out of him with the exception of tiny yellow shorts.Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner play Mark and Vanessa, the couple waiting for their chance at parenthood. This dynamic duo turn in the best performances of their careers. With layer upon layer of emotions these two actors possess, its amazing how they ever came to know them. Bateman's charisma and immaturity to say the least, fits well with the picture. His awkwardness is embodied quite well. Garner who tears at you from the inside out is so effective as Vanessa, the hopeful mother-to-be shows acting range which we have never seen from her before. Heartbroken, worried, and disenchanted engulf Vanessa which makes Garner sensational at her job.J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney play the lovable parents of Juno. As she tries to come to terms with her new pregnant lifestyle she spends time with her stepmother Bren, (Janney) the sarcastic, hard-nosed woman that is coming to terms with her new stepdaughter. Janney is lovable and utterly hilarious but its Simmons who is the stronger of the two and is more authentic in his character and traits. There is a good breakthrough performance lying in Olivia Thirlby as the ""teacher obsessed"" best friend of Juno. She turns in a beautiful humane performance and encompasses the young teenager persona wonderfully.What are Juno's Oscar chances? To quote Tom Houseman as he told me after the film was over ""That is not Little Miss Sunshine."" Completely true and well said, it is not Little Miss Sunshine but it is a great picture, very reminiscent of past teenage icon films Fast Time at Ridgemont High and Weird Science. Diablo Cody is a definite threat for the Original Screenplay Oscar and Ellen Page is a strong contender for Best Actress. (I feel it'll be between her and Amy Adams for a spot) Best Picture isn't out of the question but it's rather small in a year full of big films and bigger stars. The film is a gem but I think expectations were too high and it fell a little short. But alas, I love Juno.Grade: ***¬Ω/****",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Simple Story Packed With Laughs,"Juno? Like the city in Alaska? No. This film starring Ellen Page as a pregnant teenager and Michael Cera as Paulie Bleeker (the father and best friend) will indubitably make you sob in laughter. The story is a simple one; it follows a 16 year old, eccentric girl named Juno, who gets pregnant. The plot follows her nine months of laughter, hardships, and new found friendships as she keeps the baby so she can give to an eager couple played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. This film was well received by critics everywhere, winning a total of 38 awards, one of them being an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Juno got it all for a great reason: it's a pretty good film.The movie introduces the characters in the best way possible. At once you feel a connection with Juno and everyone else she interacted with. Ellen Page and Michael Cera worked adorably together, you can see their charisma but also feel a sort of tension between them during the film, especially during the scene where Juno moves a living room set on Paulie's lawn, that was fun to watch. Mark's scenes (Jason Bateman) were refreshing, but often uncomfortable due to little thing going on with Juno there, but the character himself was great all because he owned such pretty guitars.The music in this movie was unique, strange, and refreshingly simple. Had I heard it anywhere else I probably would have hated it, but it's just right for this movie. It fits the weird characters and overall the oddness of the movie. It's mainly composed of simple guitar strums and drunk sounding people singing about whatever, but also features bands such as Sonic Youth.I loved the acting. It's just eerie how good of an actress Ellen Page is, she really made the character lovable and funny. The way she defined relationships with other characters was fantastic, they seemed authentic. I also commend Jennifer Garner for breaking reality, she's talented enough to make you forget she's acting, which was a problem for me in the film. Leah's character (Olivia Thirlby) was interesting, but made the film seem just a bit artificial, we could have done without her.I generally enjoyed this film. It was a great laugh with a simple story line. Usually something like that doesn't work out, but the way it was composed made it a refreshing watch. The actors and actresses all worked well together on the screen and they were fun to watch, the movie was just a little weak when it came to personal character development. And it was hard to forget that they were just actors on the screen. However, the music makes up for it, the simplicity of it gives the film the whole quirky feel. If you're looking for a movie for a good night-in on a Friday night, then this would be a superb choice. Its comedy is what makes it up, but it does it well.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Film of the Year,"Juno asks questions about life that engages the viewer in parallel thought throughout the whole flick. The soundtrack completes the film, equipping many different emotions experienced throughout the movie with their musical and lyrical counterparts. Not a single actor falls short in their role, drawing the viewer into Juno's world from the first scene on, and leaving the viewer no choice but to root her on the whole way through. The standout actors in this movie are Ellen Page and Jennifer Garner. Never has Jennifer Garner (as far as i've seen) done this kind of a character, its very entertaining watching how paranoid and stressed she is. (Junoverse ID #1776)",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Superb,"Diablo Cody, name not familiar? it will be for she has just written her first screenplay and it's a corker. Directed by Jason Reitman who you may remember did the excellent 'Thank you for Smoking' and the not so memorable 'Kindergarden cop' it tells the story of Juno MacGuff a wise cracking teenage who accidentally becomes pregnant and has to make some serious decisions about her unborn child. Michael Cera, famous for playing George-Michael in the vastly overlooked TV show 'Arrested Development' and as hapless student Evan in last years Comedy 'Superbad' is brilliant as the unwitting father who everyone believes 'I didn't know he had it in him'. The supporting cast are a collection of faces that include Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner and Spiderman's own J. Jonah Jameson, J. K Simmons; all are great but its Ellen Page as Juno who steals the show firing off one liners like they were written by Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). Some have called the movie this years 'Little Miss Sunshine' and they wouldn't be far wrong, it's sharp and funny and may just be this years surprise Oscar winner and box office smash.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the most realistic coming of age movies,"This coming-of-age independent film warmed the hearts of many viewers in 2007 and has made a name for itself to this day. Juno deservedly won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for its witty and realistic dialogue and action. The plot is quickly explained: a 16-year-old, slightly rebellious girl, finds out she is pregnant. It is clear to her from the start that she does not want to keep the baby and she then goes in search of buyers, which she finds in a seemingly perfect couple. As it progresses, she is closely followed through her nine months of pregnancy and encounters unexpected obstacles.Elliot Page, then still Ellen Page, stunned the world in the leading role. His character Juno MacGuff is perky, not afraid to make an inappropriate and curious statement, and goes through life unconcerned. As she progresses, however, even she reaches her limits and discovers what it means to take responsibility and make grown-up decisions. Page's performance breathes an enormous amount of closeness and kindness into the character. Michael Cera plays a simpler role as Juno's best friend and love interest Bleeker, but is very relatable too due to his slight scatter brainedness and insecurity about interpersonal relationships. J.K. Simmons has only a few scenes as Juno's father, but shines with great one liners and hilarious dialogues with his daughter. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are also convincing as the predestined adoptive parents of Juno's baby, with Garner as mother-to-be providing the most emotional moments.Despite its difficult subject, Juno is a film with a lot of heart. Although it has a lot of depth and also contains scenes that are not so easy to watch, you carry a good feeling with you for the full 90 minutes. From time to time the plot gets lost in its strict chronology and gets a little superficial. The soundtrack, especially the title music, is very appealing, but sometimes used too inflationary. What makes the film so worth seeing is its proximity to reality. The story has probably happened similarly in this form thousands of times in real life. This is all thanks to the ingenious script, the great directing by Jason Reitman and the brilliant acting. Juno, a great film!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Juno- not up to hype,"As somebody who saw this movie about 3 weeks after its release date, i for one was not jumping out of my seat for this movie.It had a fairly simple plot. Young teen gets pregnant and must decide what to do with baby. In my opinion this film got way to much recognition just for being an independent film. A major problem i had viewing this film was that it just couldn't keep my attention at the beginning.

All of the casting choices are great. Including J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's Parents. Jason Reitman did his best directing in his career by far on this film, in my opinion of coarse.

Juno's reaction to her new-found pregnancy was not believable. She acted as though it was 'no big deal' when in reality, it was and any teenage girl would agree.For example, if you have seen 'Riding in Cars with Boys'; that reaction was flawless. ""My daughter's a tramp"" <- makes me laugh every time.Also, her parent's reactions were unrealistic as well! In fact, after that event, I turned off the movie and did something else which I have only done one other time in my life, ""Epic Movie"". I am not trying to degrade Juno to that level.

There is absolutely no human emotion whatsoever for the first forty minutes of the film.

Also, the characters are so poorly written, especially Juno's dad, who has nothing to do but make lame jokes and give typical fatherly advice to his daughter. Jason Reitman's bland direction feels as if he is trying to imitate Wes Anderson (a far superior filmmaker), yet doesn't really want to put in the effort. For the most part, the acting is pretty good, especially Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman. And the last thirty minutes are decent, but can't save the rest of the film.

"Do we need more ""feel good"" movies?","Sure, a film about teenage pregnancy can be funny - I recall a film about a Nazi concentration camp being funny. I think the next candidate should be ""Youth in Asia"" (sound it out). Maybe it's beneficial to have ""feel good"" movies about serious issues, but to portray such a happy ending suggests that teenage pregnancy is a really rewarding and maturing experience. Even Benigni's ""La Vita √® Bella"" doesn't suggest that being in a concentration camp is such a wonderful experience.On second thought - there is a baby shortage. With so many couples seeking babies from abroad, a domestic supply could be useful. This could even be extended to other areas of shortage - a fun movie about soldiers in Afganistan might result in a rash of new recruits wanting to join the army to serve in Afganistan.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Juno why this film is so popular? I don't.,"Jason Reitman's ""Juno"" is the kind of movie that splits audiences. In it, a sixteen year old girl who is supposedly incredibly mature for her age nevertheless finds herself pregnant. After initially cavalierly settling on abortion she has a change of heart and decides to have the baby and give it to a pair of loving parents.For me, a big problem of the film is believability. If Juno was so wise beyond her years how did she manage to get herself into this situation in the first place? She seems so jaded that there's just about nothing that phases her. That's hard to believe from a sixteen year old with apparently no hard knocks in her life but considerably easier to believe from ex-stripper screenwriter Diablo Cody. It's like Cody said to herself, ""Teenage pregnancy? Big deal. If I had gotten pregnant when I was sixteen this is totally what I'd do."" That she won an Oscar for her work is amazing, in a pathetic sort of way. I also have a hard time believing that Juno cares about the child at all since she basically wants nothing to do with it. Obviously, if she can foster such feelings toward her own offspring then that pretty much proves that she's unfit for motherhood.In my mind, another problem is the oh-so-hip dialogue that I find extremely grating. Everyone has a quip ready at a moment's notice no matter the situation. None of it is really meant to be laugh-out-loud funny, more like ""Look how clever I am!"".Nevertheless, the film does manage to wring some actual emotion out of its material. The ending is fitting though to call this a coming of age story strikes me as ridiculous since I can't imagine that Juno actually learns anything. She seems to embody the Oscar Wilde quote, ""I am not young enough to know everything"". That makes her, as a character, quite unlikeable in my eyes.On the other hand, Ellen Page herself is cute as button, which goes a long way in off-setting her character's know-it-all attitude. Michael Cera is a fine choice for her partner in crime; his character and his performance is much closer to reality. The rest of the cast is solid but not really noteworthy, even J.K. Simmons who is usually hilarious.The direction by Jason Reitman is well done and was not undeserving of the Best Director Oscar nomination that he received. The music is pretty good too, even though it smacks of the same sort of ultra-hipness as the dialogue. In the end, I think that the film is worth watching but I shudder to think that there are young women out there who see Juno as a role model.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A touching and heartwarming comedy with fantastic writing and performances!,"I admit it, I used to be one of those Juno haters back in 2007 and 2008 when Juno was getting so much praise and awards. It certainly was a good film, but I always thought that it was so overrated. Watching it for the second time now, I can see that is is a really great film. Diablo Cody gets a lot of hate from some people, and while I was used to be one of those, I have to say this- Diablo Cody really knows how to write dialogue. Seeing Juno again, her dialogue reminded me of great dialogue from films like Pulp Fiction. Yes, it is very different, but just as catchy. The dialogue is full of quirks here and there, memorable lines, and while I do see why many people say it is 'too much, I love the film for that now. The character of Juno, while being all of this, is a greatly developed character, played brilliantly by Ellen Page. She is perfect for a role like this, and she was worthy of that Oscar nomination. But the whole cast brings Cody's screenplay to make a film that is truly great. Michael Cera, Allison Janney, J.K. Simmons, Olivia Thirlby, Jason Bateman, and especially Jennifer Ganrer (who in a truly amazing scene between her and Juno's belly, she proves how great of an actress she is, and how subtle she can be) are all amazing and fun to watch. The music of this film is brilliant as well. So I am now a big fan of Juno, and I now think it gets way too much hate. One of the best comedies of this decade!",,Anonymous,Comedy
Interesting but hard to care about,"Despite all the hype (mostly by women, I suspect), Juno is not that great or interesting of a film.Granted, the production is top-notch, as is the soundtrack. And the performances by all the supporting cast were so believable, they made the movie worth watching.However, the writing (for Juno, the main character) was odd and unbelievable. While the actress playing Juno was able to play the character competently, it just wasn't a realistic, or sympathetic character. Juno is kind of a boring jerk, spewing cynical and trite one-liners we've all heard a thousand times before on sit-coms. It's as though the writer of the movie envisioned this character as the coolest thing since sliced bread and gave her the ""i'm too cool to be cool"" dry one-liners and made everyone else her straight man. But ironically, I think it backfired because it made Juno, the girl, uninteresting right from scene 1, and it made all the characters around her compelling and tangible. I found myself ignoring Juno's often-pointless quips and honing in on her boyfriend's acting (and his amazingly subtle performance), or watching how real pros Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman acted. In fact, everyone BUT Juno was fun and interesting and I'd like to see more of them.But I understand from reading a bit about Diablo Cody the writer that Juno herself was just an idealized extension of herself and that just didn't work for me. Juno came off too flat and too tired and too into herself to be a character I cared for. I mean, the instant Diablo wrote that all jocks secretly lust after the weird goth girls in school, I laughed my ass off at how Diablo must really think that the jocks really despised the hot pre-playboy blonds and instead thought that a greasy-looking, scrawny, tattoo'd chick with pale skin and a bad attitude was attractive. HA! lol. I think that just epitomizes how the main character was written about Diablo and for Diablo and frankly, Diablo's just not that interesting unless she's saying the word sex every now and then to keep the curious around.The movie is well put-together and the supporting cast and soundtrack are worth the rental. If you like indie little feel-good flicks like Little Miss Sunshine, you'll like this. Though, I believe Sunshine had much more interesting dynamics in the relationships and I cared about the main character(s) right from the start.thanks for listening.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"This movie warmed my heart. Sooo touching, yet sooo funny simultaneously. The best mix of small human tragedy and comedy.","How I love this picture. I have seen it so many times now, and I am so smitten with it, that I rewatch it every year, to the same joy and delight.The good: brilliant story and hilarious dialogues. The characters and their small problems are so recognizable, so endearing, so funny and simultaneouly so fascinating to watch.It's a lighthearted drama, it's part silly and funny and yet it's still somehow totally true to life however absurd this portrait about this ""dysfunctional"" family might be.Highly recommended for anyone who is into quirky comedies, with a kind heart and a blessed soul.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Juno"" (2007) is a smart, witty, and heartwarming gem of a film that will leave you smiling","""Juno"" (2007) is a witty, poignant and charming film that won the hearts of audiences and critics alike. Directed by Jason Reitman, the film tells the story of Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), a smart and sarcastic teenager who becomes pregnant and decides to give the baby up for adoption. The film is a clever and heartwarming take on a difficult subject that could have easily become clich√©d, but instead is delivered with genuine warmth and humor.Ellen Page's performance is the film's driving force, delivering Juno's witty and sarcastic one-liners with perfect timing and a vulnerability that makes the character easy to root for. She's supported by a strong cast that includes J. K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's parents, and Michael Cera as the baby's father. The chemistry between the actors is excellent, and their performances are a highlight of the film.The screenplay, written by Diablo Cody, is sharp and funny, but also has an emotional depth that elevates it above most teen comedies. The film explores themes of identity, family, and responsibility, but does so in a way that never feels heavy-handed or preachy. The dialogue is clever and often hilarious, but never at the expense of the characters or the story.The film is also visually engaging, with a distinct visual style that sets it apart from other films of its genre. The use of bold colors and playful camera angles add to the film's overall charm and create a unique visual language that complements the screenplay perfectly.""Juno"" is a gem of a film that manages to be both funny and touching, while never losing its authenticity or heart. It's a coming-of-age story that speaks to audiences of all ages, and a testament to the power of great storytelling. Don't miss this charming and delightful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best Film of 2007,"After seeing the trailer for ""Juno,"" I went in expecting it to be the best film of 2007. Anything else and I would have been disappointed. I was not disappointed.The entire cast is excellent. It is easily the best ensemble in any film this year. Ellen Page is in every scene and she is able to carry the film. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman give their best big screen performances ever.The trailer makes the film seem like it is going to be a laugh a minute. The trailer actually uses some of the funniest lines from the film, but it is more than just a comedy. It is a touching film that leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling afterward.If you are looking for an uplifting film to get away from all the drab, downbeat films coming out this holiday season, you should see ""Juno.""",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A nice surprise,"This is the kind of movie nice girls have strong problems getting their rough boyfriends to. But even they will find it was worth it. A charming comedy with this brilliant Ellen Page as the main character.You maybe don't expect much from a movie about a 16 year old pregnant girl. Especially not since this is not supposed to be a drama. But it is in a trustworthy way. This working class girl is going to have her child adopted by the yuppie couple.

"indie-movie preggers, yey!","Juno is an adorable sort of movie because, for the most part following its first third (which is ""hip"" on parade), the genuine impulses of the characters come out without contrivance. As this and Knocked Up have shown us in 2007, a movie where its main character gets pregnant is, for the writer and/or director, like a Western in approaching the form: you know where it will lead (duh, waa, waa, it's a fill-in-the-blank), but the fun is filling in the blanks of the characters and sharp dialog and story points.While, as will be quite arguable with some, Knocked Up might have a better hold on its tone from start to finish, writer Diablo Cody is a sharp cookie, with a sense of wit that knows no bounds, as if someone dug into the latest indie kid at a high school and learned all the little ins and outs of what is really cool in what should be usually the outcast (which, by the way, is what ends up being ""hip"" in that Ghost World kind of way). Her script starts off with scenes and dialog that, actually, don't ring entirely true as reality, but it is fun to hear the actors say such dialog that would give Daria a run for her money, some of it even laugh-out-loud funny ('oo, Woody Allen!"")But as the film goes along, particularly in its last third, it really deepens in the sense of the weight of the situation at hand- there's a baby, hello parents! What starts off as genuinely (and please I mean this as a compliment) quirky stuff turns into sweet and tragic-comic. Reitman ends up striking it out of Cody's material with a similar freshness he brought to Thank You for Smoking (there's one little scene involving the 'type' of girl some guy likes that Juno points out, and it's just like his quick style from the former film). He's a good chip off the old block, as it were.But lets get to acting, which most have raved about a lot in the press and online. Ellen Page is, indeed, the breakout actress of, well, the moment I guess. She just clicks with this character, as she did (maybe more frustratingly so) in Hard Candy, and through Juno's slings of comebacks and pop culture references she's never misses a beat- by the time we see her layers peeled away as a scared, frightened pregnant teen, she's perfectly vulnerable. Meanwhile, Bateman breaks out after a string of bad comedies, Michael Cera stretches his legs (so to speak) pretty well, and JK Simmons and Alison Janney steal any scene they're in, bar-none, with Simmons especially playing one of the most realistic dads in any teenage comedy I've ever seen.It's huggable at times, and endless with its ""indie"" appeal- hence the cute songs from Kimya Dawson- and had Cody just tightened the reins on that first third, where she goes for broke in trying to impress anyone who's to read her script, she'd have a really great genre-bending hit. As it stands, however, it's really, really fun, and did I mention huggable? Preggers rock, woo! 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Calculated but Entertaining,"A pregnant teen thinks about having an abortion, but then agrees to let a childless yuppie couple adopt the baby. This is generally entertaining but seems too calculated to be a genuine comedy-drama. Juno is meant to be an endearing young woman but she seems artificial. She's too much of a smart-ass for a sixteen-year-old, too nonchalant about the pickle she's gotten herself into, delivering one-liners like a stand-up comedian. It appears the filmmakers are trying too hard to be hip, but end up with something that feels like an after-school special. Page, Cera, Garner, Bateman, Janney, and Simmons all deliver good performances.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"What a great movie, seriously you gotta see it","You think you know every movie plot but not with Juno. It is such a great movie for everyone. I saw this with my parents and we both agreed that it was so well-written. The cast was very good unlike some others movies that have some great actors but they do not being the movie to life. This movie does that job and more. I recommend seeing this movie with anyone. Hopefully there will be more movies just like Juno. If every movie was just as alive and funny as Juno it would be awesome. I might see this movie a few more times before it stops showing at the cinema. I have never seen such a small movie be so good.

Rounded Edges All Around,"Juno made quite a bit of noise upon its original release, being a small indie film and getting a mainstream audience, put both it and in particular Ellen Page. Juno is well acted by the entire cast well directed and the script is good, all solids that are definitely going in the film favor. There are two reservations though contained in the film: while the film in no way glorifies teen pregnancy, it definitely leaves out many of the challenges, fears, difficulties, and ostracization that can accompany many teen pregnancies. Her parents are completely understanding and supportive from the get go, it was about as much drama as me telling my parents when I got my first cavity. The second is that they go to such lengths to demonstrate that Juno is so completely cool, chill, ironic, and wise beyond her years that she doesn't behave as a teenager most likely wold in this situation, regardless of how hip, cool, sarcastic, and sardonic they are. Still, despite its shortcomings it's worth a watch if your curious.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Totally surprised,"I'm not going to lie to you and pretend like I knew anything (at all) about this movie before I went to it. I was invited (very last minute) to see a movie about ""some pregnant teenage girl"" (as it was so accurately described). The only other thing I knew was that it was written by a fellow Minnesotan. I was expecting a drama about the struggle that a pregnant teenager would be faced with.FAST FORWARD (I don't want to give anything away)I left the movie very happy with my decision to tag along. It is refreshing to have a realistically humorous look into the life of a pregnant 16-year old without losing focus of the seriousness of the situation. Kudos to the cast and crew for being able to do so.I have been singing it's praises and recommending the movie to whoever I have talked with today (saw the movie last night). The actors were perfect in their roles and the characters were quite believable. The film didn't over-do the high school atmosphere as is done in so many movies. The soundtrack was fun and went along with the movie very well. The only criticism (I don't want to use the word complaint) is that the use of slang in the movie was slightly overdone.I will be going back to see the last two screenings in Minneapolis and would highly recommend that you attend a screening if you can. If not, see it when it comes out in theaters.BRIAN - Junoverse ID #1592",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Special odd-cute movie on teen pregnancy,"This is one of those movies you can't say too much about without giving away what's meaningful and what happens. That being said, let's start with the setup: Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is 16 years old and in a moment of curiosity decides it would be good to check out the sexual intercourse experience with her similarly artistic, offbeat, low-key, precocious boyfriend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). We're somewhere in Seattle-land, and I read that the movie was filmed near Vancouver, BC, Canada. (What is it with the movie industry making so many movies up there? Do they get cheap motel rates?)Of course, she really does like the boy and she's smart enough to know that sex without protection can lead to pregnancy, but for some reason......For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2008",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hip and shallow,"This well-reviewed film left me somewhat cold. It's a pleasant enough comedy about teenage pregnancy, with some whippy lines; but none of them really cut very hard. There's a drippy soundtrack, a geeky guy who the smart-alec girl eventually falls for (note that you very see films that work the other way around), and a fairly shallow portrait of emotional and family life. Director Reitman previously made 'Thank You For Smoking', which was right-wing and facetious, but which at least tried to make you think: this movie is frankly soft by comparison. Even one-liners are funniest when they come from the heart; but although the characters talk about heartbreak, none of them act like they know what it means.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A good movie with super performances,"I went into this film feeling like I would almost HAVE to like this,since the buzz was nothing but good(save the scads of less-than-flattering posts on the JUno IMDb message board). I came away from the film genuinely impressed with the make-up of the film,even if the overall end product maybe left some things to be desired.Whether you regard Minnesota teen Juno Maguff(Ellen Page,fast-walking and fast-talking through this gem role)as a typical teen might say as much about how you define the term ""typical"": a sardonic,artsy,semi-lonerish girl who is never shy to share her opinions about anything,her fateful encounter with the boy she loves(Michael Cera,who was probably better in ""Superbad"" and TV's ""Arrested Development"")gets her pregnant and,after initially wanting nothing to do with the pregnancy,decides almost impulsively to keep the baby,at least until she can find adoptive parents. Her search isn't particularly long as she stumbles upon an ad in the penny-saver for an attractive couple(JAson BAteman and Jennifer GArner,probably following each other from the set of ""The KIngdom"" to do this)who seem to be more than willing to adopt.FAntastic performances by PAge,BAteman,GArner and J.K.Simmons(one of the more taken for granted actors in the biz)as Juno's equally sardonic but loving DAd are complimented by adequate,fine performances--if perhaps not exceptional--from Allison Janney(As JUno's step-mom),Olivia Thrilby(as her best friend)and Cera. Director Jason Reitman throws the curve by helming this(his previous flick was the scathing,sharp,slick ""Thank You For Smoking"")project,off a script by exotic dancer Diablo Cody. Both Reitman and Cody make a humane and funny(if perhaps over-written and too ""quirky"" by half)film,and the performances make the difference.While I cannot,truly gush over this movie as many have(among other reasons:the super-quick,quirky,too-cool-for-school dialog and the sometimes annoying music scoring by Indy band Moldy Peaches),I am still impressed enough by the pacing,humor and general intelligence of the story to recommend it.

He certainly deserve many awards but was definitely shadowed by Javier Barden in ""No Country for Old Men"" also a great supporting performance. Jason Reitman was what got me into this movie since really like ""Thank You for Smocking"" and this well be the movie that well but him on the A list.

Juno - the little movie that could.,"Juno is best described as a dramedy where the plot is driven by character development rather than external events. It is fascinating to watch the very gifted Ellen Page as she goes from a very bright but rather typical sixteen year old smart ass to someone who matures into a young adult as she deals with an unwanted pregnancy. The way she can convey a teenage ""could care less"" sarcasm and then a barely concealed scared vulnerability within the space of one sentence merely by a subtle change of expression, the tone of her voice or the flicker of an eye is worth the price of admission alone. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent and while the dialog is somewhat quirky at times, it only adds to the enjoyment of a movie which constantly surprises your expectations. The best movie of 2007 in so many ways that it's not surprising that this indie film, which cost only about 7 million to make eventually grossed about 150 million at the box office. That many customers (not to mention 90% of the critics) can't be all wrong!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A real Page turner,"An unusual title for an unusual movie but one that is an absolute delight. Juno is a 16 year old girl living in Minnesota, USA who is named after a Roman goddess and she is played by 20 year old Canadian Ellen Page in a wonderfully mature and quirky performance that achieved an Academy Award nomination. Early on in the film, she becomes pregnant and the rest of the story is how she - and her parents and the intended adopted parents of the baby - deal with the situation. J K Simmons, Allison Janney, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner bring real texture to the adult roles.The witty script is a cracking one and comes from Diablo Cody, a pen name for one-time stripper Brook Busey and it won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Shooting was in and around Vancouver, standing in for Minnesota, and the tiny budget of US$6.5 million was recouped within three weeks of (limited) release. Personally I could have done without the songs from Kimya Dawson, but in fact the soundtrack was very successful in its own right.The director is Canadian-born Jason Reitman whose father Ivan directed such movies as ""Ghostbusters"".",,Anonymous,Comedy

Juno review,"""Juno"" is a funny, down-to-earth comedy-drama about a 16-year-old girl who gets pregnant by accident. It is Ellen Page who plays this strong-minded main character while Michael Cera gets to act as the young guy she slept with. The movie shows us the life of a normal, yet very independent young girl whose life totally changes over the news that she got pregnant. It starts with the act itself (although we do not see anything) between her and ""Paulie Bleeker"", a sort of nerdy guy she's good friends with. After understanding she was actually pregnant, she starts thinking about her options. The choice is hard but she finally decides to keep the baby but give it to what seems to be the perfect couple. All along the movie we see how her relations with some people change a lot. Though she first doesn't want to go out with Paulie, she soon realizes there's something she can't deny between them. She also starts to be too close to the couple (and especially the husband) she's chosen to raise her baby, which leads her to know some things she probably shouldn't. Anyway, Juno always manages to take good decisions. I really enjoyed watching the light, funny movie. Though it's not the movie of the year, it is really nice and cute little story to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Her family is intelligently funny, the whole theater was laughing so hard at some points that some times I couldn't hear the next line. Juno is so well written, it's not just some teen movie about being knocked up it's so much more than that. It really makes you think about family, relationships, and friendship. I'd recommend this movie to anyone. A review I read on here about this movie talked about how a ""30 something stripper wrote it, that's why it's getting so much attention"". Diablo Cody is so brilliant and her being a scrutinized about being an ex-stripper is just proves the point that most people can't see beyond the surface of things. You know¬Öshallow people?

It all started with a chair,"And that is how this movie started. The story of a sixteen year old girl named Juno who was knocked up by a kid on the track team. But obviously, if that were the case of the movie, I give this movie worse than a seven.So the movie starts off with Juno testing to see if she is pregnant at a pharmacy (special guest appearance of Rainn Wilson and a hilarious appearance if I may say) and then it is a official when Juno sees the plus sign on the reader, she is pregnant. So she tries to go for abortion, but is somehow scared out of doing so. After that, Juno and her friend decide that the best bet for Juno is to look for a couple that want to have a child. And they find the Lorings, who are in complete joy after having the offer to have Juno's baby.This movie was alright to watch, but not the most entertaining. For one thing, the movie was a bit artistic and acted like an indie movie. And to tell you the truth, the indie-like portrayal would work great for a film like this one that has a rather simple plot. However, the creativity that I was looking for was not supplemented in this film. Maybe it is creativity other moviergoers would like, but definitely not me. And the soundtrack was annoying. It is basically alternative folk music and while at times you can zone it out, other times, it can really be in your face.I watched this movie to answer the question I had in mind: how did this movie win an Oscar for best original screenplay and got nominated for best actress (Page), best director, and best picture? And by the end of the film, there was no answer. Because this movie really did not deserve those Oscar nominations. Page's acting was not terrible, but certainly not Oscar-nominated worthy. Juno in this film was supposed to be a rather sarcastic girl. At times, she would be funny. At others, she would be annoying. The overall movie really was not special because I believe that if some movie has the potential to win best picture, the plot or storyline should be more than just what Juno gives. I wanted more depth in this film.For the other actors and actresses in the movie, you got Micheal Cera being, well, Micheal Cera. I do not have a sound sample in this comment, because according to my friends, I make a good Cera impression. But if you have seen the other movies he has been, do not think that since this movie has to do with deeper matters than his other movies he has starred in, Cera is going to perform any different. He is the same. Also, you can not go wrong for J.K. Simmons in this movie. He acts alright with being the father of Juno. And the cameo of Rainn Wilson was cool as well (being a fan of the Office). The rest of the cast is just decent acting to me.Overall, if you really want to contemplate about your teenage life (if you have one), go ahead and knock yourself out in watching this film. I do not care for teenage drama that is portrayed in this movie or in real life. Call me ignorant if you may, I still thought this movie is alright and not the way I wanted it to be. But there were some parts that I found somewhat amusing.I am pondering over a high 6 to a low 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
How did Ellen Page not win an Oscar for this?,"It's not like I'm a huge Ellen Page fan, I think I've seen one other movie she was in, but despite that I've never seen a more worthy performance.

It's not just her either, the entire cast did a great job in the movie I saw it strictly for Michael Cera (I know he does crap movies, but the man is seriously funny) who had a minor role. Jason Bateman, if nothing else, proved he could play an extraordinary straight-man (again). If there was a weakest link it was Jennifer Garner & that's a pretty high bottom of the barrel.

Feel-good movie of the year for Film Appreciation teacher,"Java Man Reviews ""Juno"" (Rated PG-13). Directed by Jason Reitman. Written by Diablo Cody. Starring Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney, J. K. Simmons & Olivia Thirlby. Running Time: 92 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW:Juno MacGuff (Page) is a 16-year-old girl who decides it's time to have her first sexual experience. In an inelegant seduction scene, she persuades her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Cera) to participate in her adventurous experiment. Of course she gets pregnant. After a touching trip to an abortion clinic, she decides to put the baby up for adoption. Her girlfriend Leah (Thirlby) suggests looking at the ads for potential parents in the Penny Saver... ""They have 'Desperately Seeking Spawn,' right next to the pet ads."" When Juno breaks the news to her mom and dad (Janney and Simmons) their reaction is both priceless and hilarious. Her dad accompanies her to meet the upscale prospective parents, Vanessa and Mark Loring (Garner and Bateman). Vanessa seems overly obsessed with becoming a mom, while Mark is a jingle-writer who always wanted to be a rock star. Juno and Mark have similar tastes in music and hit it off -- almost too well. The film follows Juno for the full nine months as we get glimpses of the deeper feelings beneath the teenager's wisecracking exterior. What will she eventually do? The film has too many surprises to make that an easy guess.REVIEW: 4 out of 4 Java MugsWhen Jon Stewart hosted the Oscar telecast earlier this year, he commented on the dark themes that characterized the other four Best Picture nominees: war, betrayal, murder and greed. Then he said... ""Thank God for teen pregnancy."" Though this film doesn't quite qualify as ""feel-good movie of the year,"" a picture this well-made makes a film appreciation teacher feel pretty good about the state of cinema.First of all, the screenplay is smart, and so are the characters. Though a serious subject, there is plenty of humor, which comes from witty dialogue and inspired plotting and not from people taking pratfalls. Director Reitman has also done an exceptional job of casting the film with such old pros as Janney and Simmons who play Juno's parents to perfection, and newcomers Cera and Thirlby as Juno's perceptive pals. Garner brings unexpected depth to a character we originally perceive as hopelessly shallow.While all the parts are well-acted and well-written (by Oscar winner Cody), the movie belongs to Ellen Page. With dazzling brilliance, she portrays a very bright girl who makes a mistake, lives with it, and attempts to solve her problems in unique and imaginative ways. A star in the making? The 21-year old Nova Scotian has actually been around for a few years, burning up screens in Canadian theaters and on north-of-the-border television.My Oscar class debated whether or not this movie has a political axe to grind. Pro choice or pro life? We couldn't agree. We did agree on one thing... Juno is one of the year's best.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Reitman directs exactly how Cody writes: dryly disengaged for a cute effect...,"Middle-class teenager--brainy, precocious, and mordant rather than cynical--is both surprised and dryly amused at finding herself pregnant after just one sexual experience; after ruling out abortion, she decides to have the baby and give it over to an upscale childless couple advertising in the Penny Saver. Sweetly attuned to cult media and teen-slang, screenwriter Diablo Cody writes sitcom dialogue far superior to what is heard on most sitcoms; influenced, perhaps, by John Hughes and ""Heathers"", Cody goes her own way when setting the tone for her second-act, and the results are pleasantly grounded and genial. As Juno, Ellen Page's mature resolve is entirely embraceable, and the supporting cast is equally fine--although the character of the would-be adoptive father (Jason Bateman) is just a sketch, a writer's contrivance. Director Jason Reitman ultimately plays things a little safe, softening the material's edges and making the scenario prettier and friendlier than it might have been in other hands. Still, the director and writer are on even ground when developing the characters, and overall the film has a keenly-judged balance which makes for a blithe, tender-hearted frivolity. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Amazing Film,"I was able to catch this movie as a pre-screening in Detroit. The performances were amazing, we laughed and we identified with the characters. The relationships with Juno and her parents and with her (is he or isn't he) boyfriend added a wonderful change of things. The humor was well placed and not overbearing, I don't think there was any moments that dragged at all. The soundtrack was wonderfully arranged with various tunes that will make me look for the soundtrack. This is not meant to be a kiss-up or anything but I must say it was an enjoyable evening. A wonderful job by everyone involved and I would expect that folks will take notice. Diablo Cody had a Q&A after and totally blew us away.. I look forward to her future projects. Give Juno a chance and you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great movie,"First, this movie is a great work of cinema, not a political statement. It doesn't make sense to argue whether it's pro-life or pro-choice, whether high school kids do talk like that, whether it's realistic to expect parents to accept their kid's pregnancy so wholeheartedly, etc. In the end, the movie is neither pro this or that, or against. It's just life; smart kids do stupid things, hormones' call at the certain day of month pushes the girl to get intimate with her best male friend; the result we know. Yes, there are kids who talk like that; and not all kids talk like that. The screenwriter didn't invented those characters, pretty much like Anton Chekhov didn't invent characters for his dramas. Just sit back and enjoy the story. Don't judge the characters; and after the movie ask yourself, what would you do. If you are a parent, would you help your daughter in such ""garbage pile of a situation""? If you are a high school boy, and got you GF pregnant, what would YOU do?",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Juno has a great storyline,"The movie Juno is about a high school girl who becomes pregnant. She is only sixteen and she can't raise a baby so she finds a married couple who plans to adopt the baby. She had originally planned to have an abortion but then she decide to have a married couple adopt the baby.It was a really great movie with a great storyline. It really reflected some of the things that happen when you're a teen.Before she became pregnant she had sex with a guy at school Paulie Bleeker but they weren't together in a relationship and she did not want to be his girlfriend until later on.She searches for families who would like to adopt a child and she finds a wealthy couple and she goes to their home to meet them. She becomes really good friends with Mark and she learns that they have some things in common, she becomes shocked when she finds out that Mark and Vanessa are getting divorced and she tries to convince them to stay together so they can be the baby's parents. Mark says that he's not ready to be a father and Juno tries to convince him to stay with Vanessa. Mark decides to divorce Vanessa and he asks Juno what she thinks of him showing that Mark has romantic feelings towards her.Juno then has to decide what she's gonna do. She is upset about the news that Mark and Vanessa are getting divorced and she leaves angrily and then comes back with a note that says ""Vanessa if you're in, im in"" Vanessa agrees to adopt the baby as a single mother.Juno then decides that she likes Paulie and wants to be with him and they get together.The movie really reflected on some things that people go through when they're a teen and had a really great story. It was a great movie It had a really great story because it did a great job showing some of the things that happen in a teens life. It also did a great job showing what its like when a teen gets pregnant.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Overrated but enjoyable anyway,"Taking a different tone entirely to the other recent accidental pregnancy movie Knocked Up, Juno comes from the viewpoint of a 16-year-old girl. It's a comedy, but is played with the thoughtfulness that such a subject matter probably deserves. The cast is excellent, and the script is generally well-paced. Also, Rietman's direction is near faultless.Sadly, the film is let down somewhat by possibly the most annoying protagonist in the history of cinema. Ellen Page is clearly a capable actress, but Juno is a ridiculous caricature of a world- weary teenager, full of pessimism and 'witty' one-liners, but with no particular redeeming qualities. Even by the end of the film, when you're supposed to sympathise with her, I still felt like she deserved a punch in the face.Of course, if you can stomach this kind of character and the odd atrocious bit of dialogue, it's a decent movie with some great performances and an interesting soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Supirsingly awesome,"I went into this movie with semi-low expectations. I had heard good things, but it didn't look like a movie for me. Boy was I wrong.I haven't laughed so hard in a movie theater in a long time. It's a good clean comedy as well. It has a bit of a Napoleon Dynamite feel to it but has a much stronger plot. But just because Juno is a comedy, doesn't mean it doesn't pull at your heart strings.Ellen Page was fantastic. She had perfect comedic timing and you fall in love with her character. The rest of the cast was also very impressive. The acting in this movie was outstanding.I also loved the quirky music in the movie. Very cheesy but freaking rad.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Is it really THAT charming?????,"It does have a witty dialogue, it is unique, but somehow I could neither relate to it nor get really entertained. First of all, Juno seems to be the right teenager to get pregnant. She's strong, high headed, down to earth and convincing. And at the same time she does not always play it safe. Her family is extremely supportive and the boy that she sleeps with is her best friend (sensitive type) that loves her. Also, she manages to find the PERFECT person (Jennifer Garner) to adopt her to-be-child. In all reality, a person is not that lucky. It is ten times worse to be pregnant as a teenager. But then again, Juno is the type of person that seems to have it all and can pull through, even with humor, love and charm in her life. Another important thing is that she is still finding herself and is not sure about her future or her goals. So it wouldn't be a life long scar, discouraging her to be the way she always wanted to be. I am sure that in general people will have a lot more pressure to face when they test positive. Anyways, the background music is so attuned to the main character and the movie's flavor that I was impressed. I am positive that this is not a let-down movie but if you are highly religious and are against the main theme of it, PLEASE don't take your chances and go watch it",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
don't let the snarky comments put you off,"This is a great film -- the few negative IMDb comments were a surprise. I think the positive buzz seems to have combined with its sarcastic dialog and indie-like offbeat tone to really agitate some of the hipsters posting here. ""It looks like an indie but it isn't independent enough!"" ""All of the wit is so scathing that it doesn't sound real!"" ""If everyone likes something it must be bad!"" ""We are independent film hipsters and we are threatened!"" However I went to the film without hearing anything about it first, and luckily it didn't occur to me to think too hard about its studio status. So I loved it. The real gem is that at first it feels like a plastic sort of movie, but it tricks you. It ""outgrows its own mannerisms"" as A. O. Scott wrote in the NYT review. That's a nice turn of phrase. All of the characters develop a surprising depth.For the criticisms: When I want to watch a good film, why would I care how independent it is? When has realism in dialog ever been the crucible in which we test a film? Why would I object to a film that references pop culture A LOT? It is true that some parts were not cast with brilliant character actors -- there is not much of a detectable difference between Ellen Page and Michael Cera when they are in interviews (or in Superbad) vs. ""acting"" in this film. But other parts ARE filled with excellent character actors (like Allison Janney) and the whole ensemble works brilliantly.It's funny, clever, touching, complex, and the best film of 2007.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My thoughts on Juno,"Its not often a movie zooms into my top 5 after just two viewings, but then its not often a film like Juno comes along.The logical place to start would be Ellen Page. I can imagine some would find her performance somewhat smug and overly self-assured. But for me, she nails down the expectations of this razor sharp script in an effortless way. A brilliantly confident and hilarious lead as Juno, I found myself rooting from her right from the off whilst the whole time knowing things would work out in her favour.The supporting cast is faultless. I've long been an Arrested Development worshipper, and Michael Cera and Jason Bateman bring all their finest qualities from the Bluth roles to their characters here. Despite his young age and apparent typecasting, Cera is the king of understated heroism. He has stolen just about every scene of his career so far and none so much as Paulie Bleeker. Bateman as Mark Loring is everything you wanted Michael Bluth to be; living out the dreams and ideals instead of simply fulfilling the family expectations in exchange for a peaceful life. Its almost enough to make me give Teen Wolf II another go. Almost.I vaguely recognised JK Simmons, but had seen little of Jennifer Garner and Alison Janney prior to this. Which makes it difficult for me to label this the 'performance of their careers', but I'll blindly do it anyway. Simmons I'd always pictured as a bad guy, but his turn here as Mac was one of the most endearing paternal portrayals I can remember. Quite touching, and award-worthy. His scene with Juno as she realises her love for Paulie was beautiful. Garner's shopping mall monologue to the 'bump' and Janney springing to life as she lays into the ultrasound technician are other examples of actors right on top of their game.The setting is perfect. I've never been to America, but this Fargo-esquire Minnesota backdrop is what I picture every time. The kids are cool, but not too cool; the families are functional, but not too functional. The symbolism of the seasons and the underlying theme of the high school runners allay perfectly into my totally-unfounded-and-unresearched ideology of Minnesotan life... just carrying on, whatever the drama inbetween. No time for politics or grander social issues here. The film has drawn controversy for its apparent pro-life theme but I see it as merely a story-telling mechanism rather than any kind of social statement. My one concern throughout was Juno's lack of self-realisation about the obvious emotion such a predicament would bring, and it was a relief to see it all come pouring out towards the end as she laid crying on the hospital bed.This film is the ultimate compromise between funny, bittersweet and cool. The music is sublime throughout. The pace and length are perfect. The characters are just the right distance into leftfield from what you'd expect them to be. The ending is happy without being horribly predictable.For me, and my own peculiar tastes, I can't fault it. Ten out of ten.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Juno is a Winning Film,"If you have even seen a single poster or commercial for this movie you know the plot. Teenage girl gets pregnant and deals with it. She deals with it in a smart upbeat and quirky way with loads of funny lines, plenty of quotable teenage banter and cool pragmatism. So it's pretty unrealistic. She gets pregnant after a one night stand. When faced with abortion she decides instead to have the baby and finds a couple on her own to adopt the baby. Now comes the nine months and the moments to string together a teenage comedy smarter than most.Winning 2007 Best Screenplay Oscar, while handling 3 other nominations, was incredible for this small comedy made for only $2.5 million. This is typically unheard of for the Academy.Much of the success of this film is placed on the shoulders of the films young stars Michael Cera and Ellen Page. Along with proved director Jason Reitman, the hot light of Hollywood shone on this movie certainly due to the three of them.There is no doubt this movie is funny and good for some belly laughs. The topic matter is controversial. Writing is fresh, hip and witty. But in the end the film still feels like a small comedy and the surprise is still socking that it has won so many awards across so many agencies. It's funny though. ***/****.The poster is good since it conveys the movie's story pretty quick Some of the International posters offer a broader range, but I think it is the first style from the U.S. with the orange stripes that appeals to most people.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ellen Page Is Wondrous,"""Juno"" may not be the film of the year and Ellen Page may not be the best actress. But, if enjoyability were the principal criterion, ""Juno"" and Ellen would have walked away with the top prizes. Juno, a teenager pregnant from a single encounter with her high school boyfriend, is a quirky kid, out of joint with her classmates and with the world at large. In Ellen Page's extraordinary capable hands, she is also one of the more vivid personalities you are likely to encounter on the screen in many a year. Helped by Jennifer Garner as the young woman who will become her baby's mom and by J.K. Simmons as her supportive but befuddled dad, Ellen Page makes ""Juno"" into much more than a slight comedy. It is at once poignant, funny, sad and memorable. The soundtrack, like Juno herself, is also quirky and unforgettable. Go enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Juno,"Juno has become ONE of my favorite movies of ALL TIME! I type this as I listen to the soundtrack I just bought today.I was once asked, if I felt there were any perfect movies. I have often wondered about that. I am not sure I can say yes with complete confidence. But in the case of Juno, as I see it, I can say YES! To me, Juno is a PERFECT movie.It began well, played well, ended well.Like Superbad, the opening credit sequence does well to open the stage of what to expect from this movie. It also lets you know quickly that you are about to watch something original and outside the norm. The first 10 minutes contains some of the best banter I have ever heard on film.Juno is quick witted and smart with out being pretentious. You may think, going in, that you are going to see a movie about teen pregnancy. Even though there are some educational moments, they are directed at Juno, so they don't come off as preachy. These moments serve to tell the story. Not to present a Pro Life agenda. Even though I feel this movie is more about change and relationships than about teen pregnancy. The complexity of being together.There is not one performance that isn't fantastically delivered! In my opinion Jason Reitman has surpassed his father, Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters fame, as a director. Of course Reitman junior doesn't have the long track record of his father. But I cannot recall anything that Reitman senior has done that was this simple and complex all at once. I say this being a big Ivan Reitman fan.I am afraid to give away too much in this review because, even though you may know where this movie is going, the journey is what you will enjoy.Ellen Page gives a performance that COULD NOT have been delivered any better. In Juno, she creates a character you want to hang out with. Making the film feel like lunch with a friend rather than a two dimensional projection on canvas.There were many times I almost squirted tears of laughter, sorrow, and joy. At the end I did loose it. But being with a friend and being a MACHO DUDE, I quickly wiped those tears away.In the booklet that comes with the Juno soundtrack, Ellen Page's contribution to the film is proved to be more than just in her fantastic performance. Jason Reitman states that two months before shooting, he asked Ellen what music she thought Juno listened to. Her response was The Moldy Peaches. They sing the song 'Anyone Else But You'. The same song sang by Ellen Page and Michael Cera at the end of the film. So in my opinion, Ellen Page not only carries the film through her performance, but she also becomes it soul. The unseen element that cannot be written.Incidentally. The last shot of the film was actually the last day of shooting for Juno. With mics hidden in bushes, Ellen Page and Michael Cera perform 'Anyone Else But You', while the crew cry from behind the cameras. It was at that point they realized, the shoot was over and this was the end of their family.Please don't take any of this to mean you are going to see a sap fest.Juno is NOT a chick flick.When it is released on DVD, it belongs on the shelf with ANY of your Seth Rogen Kevin Smith Judd Apatow DVDs.Make a new friend. GO SEE JUNO!",,Anonymous,Comedy
A dark funny look at everyday life.,"You would think that teen pregnancy is no laughing matter. Some films would tell you that like For Keeps(1988), and Fifteen and Pregnant(1998). But this film I was completely blown away how funny it was, it's funny without getting completely silly, and at the same time it manages to keep from being overly dramatic. This film is very light on it's feet. Ellen Page(X-Men 3) gives quite a memorable performance as the pregnant teen Juno, You just really like her, on moments when she is being nice or cynical, you just so drawn to her, she really makes you care about her. J.K.Simmons(OZ) is memorable as Junos loving dad. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are also great, so is Michael Cera(Superbad).",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"JUNO (Jason Reitman, 2007) **1/2","This film is a classic example of just how out-of-touch with modern cinema I find myself these days: while most critics seemed to fall over backwards in praising its simple qualities (a prerogative of so-called ‚ÄúIndie‚Äù film-making, and which here has more to do with a certain freshness of approach and the insight it gives into the problems effecting today‚Äôs youth than for any intrinsic artistic merit), I wasn‚Äôt sufficiently engaged in any of it to be more than slightly bemused by the plight of our spunky heroine. If anything, I was more concerned with the fact that a 16 year-old girl ‚Äì and in her condition to boot ‚Äì is allowed to drive a bulky motor vehicle!Still, though about (and presumably aimed at) kids going through Juno‚Äôs same predicament i.e. the unforeseen repercussions of becoming ‚Äúsexually active‚Äù at a tender age, the Oscar-winning script (by an ex-stripper!) is rather too smart for its own good: are we to honestly believe that girls so young could ever be into vintage Punk music and Euro-Horror films? Besides, it‚Äôs too often overwritten (being somewhat obsessed with product placement) ‚Äì thus making the would-be authentic dialogue feel more than a bit awkward at times. The film, at least, is short enough at 96 minutes not to overstay its welcome‚Ä¶even if, in the long run, it‚Äôs mainly tolerable for Ellen Page‚Äôs genuinely disarming Oscar-nominated lead performance.The other female characters that feature in the narrative tend to be outspoken (Juno‚Äôs stepmom), bossy (the intended adoptive mother for Page‚Äôs child played by Jennifer Garner) or kooky (the protagonist‚Äôs best friend). In this respect, our heroine‚Äôs symbiosis with Garner‚Äôs failed rocker husband Jason Bateman (from TEEN WOLF TOO [1987]!!) was a nice touch ‚Äì though Juno‚Äôs own continuing relationship with the geeky boy who impregnated her isn‚Äôt exactly interesting or even credible. Finally, the whole is so obviously the work of an inexperienced director: in fact, he relies way too heavily on pop/rock tunes (via an admittedly eclectic, if occasionally bizarre, line-up) to expound on the characters‚Äô feelings throughout ‚Äì which, then, has the unfortunate effect of diluting whatever comment was intended to be made in the first place! Indeed, why do today‚Äôs film-makers keep shoving their musical tastes in our faces ‚Äì especially when, as in this case, he (or any of his main characters) wasn‚Äôt even around when some of that music (for instance, The Velvet Underground‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sticking With You‚Äù) was originally released?",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It all started and ended in...greatness.,"The absolute ""must see"" Indie movie of the year, cause it has one of the most wittiest screenplays of recent times, it's so honest, so poignant, so fresh, young, original, smart and on top of that, funny as hell.Juno is a strange amalgamate between a Jared Hess movie and a Judd Apatow movie, but, this is not a complaint, being compared to such is a great compliment, but, that doesn't mean that Juno is a movie that just takes those two formulas, the Hess movie and the Apatow movie, mixing them and giving birth to some strange mutant movie. Juno has it's own beat, rhythm, laughs, and most importantly, wit and heart.Diablo Cody's screenplay for Juno is undoubtedly one of the best screenplays recently written. It's so rich in details, characters, situations, drama, comedy, and some of the best, most original, and truthful dialog. Diablo Cody is definitely the main protagonist of this movie's reputation as the ""it"" Indie movie of the year.The other incredible protagonist is it's protagonist, Ellen Page as Juno is incredible, an acting tour De force, what this beautiful 21 year old has accomplished in the movie is truly amazing, a character so complex, rich in details and mannerisms, and as an audience member you can't help but love her, with all her inequities, she is one of the most lovable characters on film. I will certainly keep an eye on Miss Page from now on. The supporting cast was incredible, it was a casting made in heaven, and it played out beautifully, the great veterans Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons were so funny and effective as Juno's parents, Jason Bateman from Arrested Development was very effective, it was great to see Jennifer Garner take this role. And of coarse, the always funny Michael Cera was so convincing and funny as Juno's male counterpart, it truly seems like casting destiny, he was great in Superbad, and he was great in Juno.Another element that people probably won't notice too much is the skillful direction by Jason Reitman. He made very clever choices with the film. His vision made the film even more poetic than what it already was. This movie, oddly enough was very easy to mess up, by trying to make it more funny, but Reitman sticks to the story, the characters and just let's things play out with a slight touch here and there that make the film look so effortless, which is fantastic.Another element that was truly inspiring was the Production Design, Art Direction and Set Decoration, Steve Saklad, Michael Diner, Catherine Schroer Shane Vieau created one of the most unique and realistic looking films in a very long time, again, everything looks so honest, so lived in, which is very hard to do when Designing a film.I know that this movie doesn't seem like the smart, intellectual Indie movie that makes it big every year, 2003 was Lost in Translation, then came Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind then Little Miss Sunshine, and now, we have Juno, which is just as great as those films I mentioned, and a lot more, trust me, it's a film experience that should not be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It represents a changing generation,"Juno is a different movie that is I believe aimed at a niche market. It shows themes and ideas from a newer generation and pop culture and is not meant to be understood by everybody.The previous comments I have read on this site seem to miss the point, that this movie has been made according to newer ideas and different ways of thinking than 10+ years ago. The western world is a fast paced place and is hard to follow popular culture today. Juno is a good representation of those people who are alternative, those people that don't quite fit into the mainstream population. It takes a different type of person to understand this movie. Someone who has come from a broken family, who relishes in being different from everybody else.I enjoyed this movie thoroughly and I believe it does touch on a very important topic in popular or alternative culture today. There are people out there who do think like Juno did in the movie and some people may be too one minded (no offense and everybody to themselves) to comprehend this.Juno represents modern and alternative lifestyle amazingly well and I would like to see more movies made like this.

Surprised!,"Once I saw the trailer, I did not want to see this film. In fact, I was reluctant even now to pick up this film. I am glad I did. This is just a great movie with something you might pick up on.The story is about a small town girl named Juno. She and her best friend have sex in a chair and that gets Juno pregnant. Now she has to face the realities of teenage pregnancy and she must find loving parents for her child.For a movie that expected to be an indie film, there are a lot of A-list actors and they were brilliant. I liked Ellen Page as the sarcastic Juno. Michael Cera is excellent as the nerdy boyfriend. I liked everyone else especially J.K Simmons, Jason Bateman, and Jennifer Gardner.The music certainly adds to the mood of the film. Most of the songs are feel-happy songs.

Juno great comedy and social movie about relationships,"I took my gf to this movie, it was great.The movie struck me as it dug into my psychie movie on how you perceive the world and the relationships we have. Not everything is what it seems. The director/write did great job putting this together, from the cast to dialog story itself. Emotional roller-coaster that Juno has to go thru, dealing with issues which would not normally be dealt with with her tender age.Only quirks i though were little unusual, was Juno herself was incredibly rare. A girl, 16 into so many old old rockin roll (1970s) and pop culture things stuck me being cool but high unlikely. However, its still movie not suppose to be dead on.

Cute. Period.,"What Juno is is a cute film. It's not great, it's not beautiful, it's not hilarious. It's cute. It's from the Wes Anderson/Jeffrey Blitz/Dayton-Faris school of film-making, an eccentric independent comedy made on a so-so budget that prefers the deadpan and understated way out. It puts to good use tangible social touches like the hamburger phone, the different expressive clothing styles of the teenage characters. But let us please stop giving Juno so much kudos. I simply do not understand this. 2007 is a year of almighty standard-setting American films. Why are we putting this one so high up on a pedestal? If American audiences are to praise a film of this effect, why has there hardly been any recognition congratulated to Blitz's Rocket Science, a funnier and much more insightful film within this said school of recent indie cinema?At first Juno seems almost socially handicapped with the way the title character acts when first meeting two prospective adoptive parents for her unborn child, played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. It seems as if Juno intends to shock them with her opposition to verbal self- control or formality. It's not unclear as the story builds that she is unaware of what kind of person she is thus her approach to people is like a take-me-or-leave-me compensating attitude. The scene is not directed to par.Overnight Hollywood success story Diablo Cody's script gives Ellen Page, a great young actress who gave an unreal performance in Hard Candy, a machine gun barrage of zingers, one-liners, and wry comical references to music and cinema that she turns out to be Woody Allen reincarnated as the hip, cocky, middle-America teenage non-Jew.The ending also goes in the wrong direction for a film that we all are finding so touching. It does not leave me with the right spirit its ending should have. I will make it clear though that I do not want my resentment for this film's random accolades and popularity to distort my view of the film itself. I will close with my overall verdict on Juno, which is that it is a cute teen movie with just enough laughs, decent performances, and obscure references for me to have enjoyed myself.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
JUNO is my favorite.,"Junoverse ID # 809Well, to begin with, i'm a somewhat obsessed fan of Ellen Page so going into this film i was already too excited to speak. I expected the film to be a wonderful movie but nothing too life changing. I went to a promotional screening in Atlanta last night and i have to say that i was overwhelmed with how much i liked it. Every time i think of the film i smile and want to watch it again, right now, but can't because it's not readily available to me. I have decided that JUNO is my most favorite film of all time. AND THAT IS SAYING A LOT!!!The film begins with a chair.Juno(Ellen Page) is standing in a random front yard drinking a gallon of SunnyD, staring at a chair and contemplating the situation she's in; that all started with a sexual encounter with her friend and band mate Paulie Bleeker(Michael Cera, Comedy GOD). She then ventures through a beautiful opening credit sequence to a convenience store to take her 3rd pregnancy test of the day. The plus sign once again appears and the shenanigans begin.After deciding against an abortion she finds a rich couple looking to adopt a child. The Lorrings, Mark and Vanessa(Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) are the seemingly perfect recipients of Juno's unborn child. But the dysfunctions that are beneath the service may change Juno's mind about them.The film is wonderful. Ellen Page gives the best performance of her career, so far. Diablo Cody, the writer of Juno, is going to be one of my favorites in years to come, i'm sure of it.The director of the film Jason Reitman(director of Thank You For Smoking) proves himself, at least in my mind, as one of the best directors out there. The two films that he's directed are so different, story wise and in the over all look and tone.JUNO is my most favorite film ever. Go see it on December 14 when it opens.Wandering off...",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Delightful movie.,"This is a delightful movie. Ellen Page does a fantastic job. She has a great supporting cast but there is no doubt that she is the movie. The dialog is fast-paced and every piece of it is wonderfully executed. If you miss any of it, you'll just have to see the movie a second time.Juno tells the story of a pregnant teen-ager and how she copes with the news. The story is told with empathy and humor. In many ways, it is reminiscent of The Waitress which dealt with a similar situation and was likewise carried by the star, Keri Russell. Like that movie, you leave the theater with an upbeat feeling. I can't think of a better way to spend an evening than watching a double feature consisting of Juno and The Waitress.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A nice little movie,"Every once in a while there comes along a nice little movie which becomes a cultural phenomenon. When this happens all perspective tends to get lost and amidst all the breathless hype people overlook the fact that it's really just a nice little movie. And then comes the inevitable backlash as those who didn't like the movie get fed up with all the hype and declare it to be the worst thing they've ever seen. Such is the case with Juno. It's not the best movie of the year. It's not revolutionary. And it's certainly not the abomination its detractors would have you believe it to be. It's a nice little movie.Seeing as the movie's a cultural phenomenon and all a plot summary seems rather unnecessary. Everyone knows the story...teenage girl gets pregnant and decides to give the baby up for adoption to childless yuppie couple. It's an incredibly simple story which plays out in such a way that the movie ends up being rather enjoyable and entertaining. Screenwriter Diablo Cody took home an Academy Award for her efforts but the film really is not brilliantly scripted. It is however brilliantly performed with director Jason Reitman coaxing wonderful performances out of his talented cast. All the performers are spot-on, falling into their roles perfectly. Of course the most important role belongs to Ellen Page playing Juno. The whole enterprise would have been sunk if Page was not up to the task but she does a truly outstanding job. With Page holding everything together everyone else around her offers brilliant support. Michael Cera as Juno's best friend (who happens to be her baby's father) is terrific. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney have some very witty moments and some very loving moments as Juno's parents who are rather understanding given the circumstances. As the prospective adoptive parents Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman do a great job in bringing to life two characters who have very different motivations, hopes and dreams. It's apparent as soon as we meet this couple that something may not be quite right and Garner and Bateman are pitch-perfect as the couple's story plays itself out.So what we have is a simple but ultimately surprising and charming story. And that story is brought to life wonderfully by the cast who make it so easy to embrace these characters. As always seems to be the case in these teen movies music plays a key role and so many of the songs chosen here fit the film perfectly. It really is a very good movie. But is it truly as great as the hype would lead you to believe? Probably not. It's a movie which certainly has its flaws. The script may have won an Oscar but too often it seems Cody is trying way too hard to make her teenage characters sound cool or quirky. There's only so much ""cool"" teen dialogue one can take. Honest to blog. For her next script one hopes Cody will realize not every line has to be a potential catchphrase. Sometimes people, even ""cool"" teenagers, just need to talk like normal people. And again the story is not at all a deep one, in fact it's often rather mundane. With a lesser cast and director this movie could have been entirely unremarkable. It's the performers which inject life into this story and it is the performances more than the story itself which you will really cherish. If you go into it expecting the best movie of the year you almost can't help but be disappointed. But if you have realistic expectations you'll find that this is a rather enjoyable and charming movie. It's not the greatest movie you've ever seen. It's a nice little movie. And there's nothing wrong with that.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Mixture of Romance and Comedy,"Juno is about a story with a girl and an unplanned pregnancy. Juno faces many challenges trying to find how two people stay together their whole life. I was very surprised to experience how much this movie got to me. This movie got to me the most because Juno made the best solution possible to her situation. What are the first thoughts that come to mind when you hear a 16-year-old girl pregnant? The most common words would be a troublemaker getting into shenanigans. Juno completely turns this around and she overcomes the challenges of society with flying colors adding the cherry on top known as comedy to the situation. The main surprise I received from this film was the unique mixture of romance and comedy mixed into one film. I never saw another film that pulled this off so effectively and if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I would not have believed it was possible to do. I don't believe the advertisement was good enough for this film, but nonetheless I guarantee this film will touch anyone. Many people say that unplanned pregnancies are no joke and comedy should not be pulled from it. However, I say that Juno picked the right path and people have no right to declare this. This just proves that anyone can make a terrible situation into a terrific situation. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and I guarantee you will enjoy this movie no matter what and I definitely give this a hard earned 10/10.Jake",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Juno: Humor with a Heart,"Here is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed. ""Juno"" stars Ellen Page as a sixteen year old high schooler confronting an unplanned pregnancy. Now this may not seem like fodder for a comedy but it works on many levels. When Juno finds out she is ""with child"" courtesy of here semi boy friend, she breaks the news to her parents, played wonderfully by Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons. After considering the options, Juno finds her unborn child a ""perfect"" set of parents: an affluent suburban couple, Mark and Vanessa played by Justin Bateman and Jennifer Garner. Between the laughs are some serious moments as all of these characters learn lessons about life and do some growing up. Ms. Page is wonderful in her role as is the Michael Cera as the boyfriend who remains loving and loyal through it all. I did think Bateman over played the Dad to be with a secret to the point of being creepy and there were some scenes that were a little unbelievable.. That said this one gets a good three out of Fordyce. I think you will enjoy it. And while it is rated PG 13, it is a movie for mature audiences. Jim Fordyce www.MIentertainment.biz",,Anonymous,Comedy
Juno:  a role model for   teens,"Juno MacGuff is a fun loving and stable 16 yr old girl. It's very rare to see a teenager have a healthy relationship with her parents. And even rarer than that is a 16 yr old having a healthy relationship with her father and her step mom . Alison Janney as Juno's mother is kind and not judgmental of her step-daughter's lifestyle. Juno is extremely bright without the air of arrogance or an invisible halo around her pretty face. She is bold enough to discuss her teen pregnancy condition and explore potential solutions. When Juno learns of her pregnancy, I liked the way she converses with the father of the baby(Michael Cera from Arrested Development), her own father,her step mom and her best friend(Olivia Thirlby, United 93). Her interactions with Jason Bateman ( Arrested Development)were appropriately handled. Jennifer Garner/Afleck as Vanessa had a very pleasant and realistic approach to a woman wanting motherhood with a passion. Ellen Page as Juno is very convincing as a teenager with her head on her own shoulders and feet firm on the ground. Her intelligent response to Vanessa's abandonment by her own husband Mark is superb.Juno stayed true to her character and continued to live a free spirited life. She did what she thought was right for her and let others get what they want. Diablo Cody as the writer and Ellen Page as Juno deserve nominations for the Oscars.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not the Easiest Movie to Like,"Let's face it: Juno was a piece of indie-pop that was manipulative, forced, and different to the point of being completely in-genuine. Still, while this movie was far from the best movie of the year, I can't say that I wasn't entertained.If you asked me about a year ago what I thought of this movie, I would have told you it was great and I would rank it up there with last year's 'There Will Be Blood' and 'No Country for Old Men.' There was a problem with that assessment, and it is the fact that both Anderson and The Coen Brothers were creating something that embarked on something much deeper and moving than the typical teenage reality show. In all honesty, 'Juno' could have been the answer to MTV's 'The Hills.' However, the operative phrase here is 'could have.' Meaning that it might have been had it been directed and acted in different hands.In a nutshell, this is a film about a 16 year old girl named Juno McGuff (*facepalm) who is unexpectedly impregnated by her best friend Paulie Bleeker. (By the way, writer Diablo Cody clearly has a knack for plucking names out of the strangest corners of her mind. Could she have deliberately been writing this FOR an Oscar?) Juno must then face unspeakable hardships as she decides to bring the baby to full term, and put the baby up for adoption to Vanessa and Mark Loring, a couple of upstate yuppies who suppress a secret that is so obvious you want to shout Vanessa in case she may actually hear you.There are two reasons why I enjoyed this film as much as I did before it started wearing off after subsequent viewings: they are Jason Reitman and Ellen Page. Reitman, for starters, has proved himself to be quite a director and satirist, and while Juno is FAR from any kind of dark humor or satire, 'Thank You for Smoking' was just that. Still, Reitman was able to bring a style to this film that took the 'cool' down a couple notches and turned up the 'normal,' almost as if he's saying to Diablo, 'I'm sorry, but these brats are just too annoying and self- centered.'Cody's screenplay offered little empathy for Juno because she is such a smart-ass, a manipulator, and one of the most self-assured teens I have ever seen on a movie screen. This is where Ellen Page steps in and creates a dimension that I personally don't think Cody saw. Page was able to create a sub-conscious fact of Juno not being nearly as smart as she thinks she is, making Juno more grounded in reality than stuck in Cody's fantasy. Still, Cody got the Oscar, so what does that say?Is the story touching? Hardly, and that is because of the fact that the story in it's entirety is bogged down by this new (and dreadful) hipster-speak. Hipster-speak, for the record, is not cool. It never was cool. It's fool-hearty, annoying, and it makes you want to smack the protagonist for being so damn ignorant and disrespectful. What also doesn't work is the fact that Juno's parents are hardly realistic. Other than the initial confrontation (Dude, just tell them) the parents had almost zero concern. They were loving and supporting, and that is a virtue in a family that is very, very real, but they were lacking in concern and control, which is very strange considering their child was impregnated. This is especially emphasized in the conversation after the initial confrontation.Dad McGuff: Next time I see him, I'm gonna punch that Bleeker kid in the wiener.Step-Mom McGuff: Mac, you know it wasn't his idea.There is something to be said here about the amount of distrust and inaction this family has over their daughter. Sure, it could be real in a family, just like the name Liberty Bell McGuff could be real in suburban Minnesota, but it is hard to look at them and think 'what a wonderful, wholesome, and supportive family.'The biggest downfall of this movie was how it condescends and manipulates the audience. Another movie that did this was 'One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest,' and it clearly took a side in whatever culture war was going on at the time. The difference here is in 1978, the war was between tradition, and kinking the system for a new state of mind. Here the 'war' is Hipster and everyone else who isn't hipster. There is legitimacy when there is viable context, but Juno really doesn't display any of that.In short, 'Juno' was a movie that Diablo Cody written for her own self-gratification. It was her saying, 'look at how cool I am. I know all of these cool things and you can be cool too if you liked them also.' Sorry Diablo, but were not interested in being new age hipster clones. I think I'll stick with Jack Nicholson and watch 'Cookoo's Nest' one more time. Besides, I love the Chief more than I love Olivia.Though I did like Jason Bateman.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Acerbic dialogue balanced with poignancy,"I don't think I've immediately loved a movie more than Juno.This film was perfectly cast, perfectly paced, had the perfect amount of cynical language while still being balanced with enough poignancy and heart to make it believable and relatable.It's so easy to say that Ellen Page is the stand-out star in Juno, being the eponymous role. I agree that her portrayal of the whip-smart, maturing 16 year old was excellent. However, the art of the film was really in the collaboration of all the actors. Everyone hit the right note. I would say that most surprising was Jennifer Garner's performance. This is not because I don't usually like her (I usually appreciate her presence in films), but she turned what could have been a caricature of a WASPy, barren career woman and made it genuinely heart-breaking. Her husband Jason Bateman portrayed the character of a sell-out would-be rock musician stuck in an unfulfilling, but lucrative job. J.K Simmons and Alison Janney were perfect as Juno's father and stepmother. They were caring without being cloying... but also sarcastic without seeming like they were making light of the situation. Michael Cera was great in his role, he seems to have nailed the role of the awkward, but sweet teenager; he knows what he's good at and sticks to it. The only really superfluous character was Juno's best friend Olivia Thirlby. I don't like how she was written, but she still provided much needed support to Juno.Diablo Cody starts the film by trying to fit in as many quips and references as possible. This would usually be annoying, but since it was delivered so believably and naturally by the characters, it made sense. It is made even more bearable once we are drawn into the heart of the film. You really invest yourself in these characters and each of their individual positions. Jason Reitman did a nice job in his light-handed direction. He seemed to let the characters come to life by the actors' own abilities.I went in to see the film with very high expectations and really, it went above and beyond all of them. If you can forgive the first 15 minutes of the film trying to find its pace, then I highly suggest this entertaining film. I want to make everyone see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I fell in love with a pregnant girl named Juno,"Right now, Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody have a perfect record when it comes to great film making team-ups. I want it to last, I want this film to succeed, and I don't want Juno 2: Should we keep it this time? The problem I face in writing anything about Juno is that this could very easily turn into an embellished recall of the plot, a bit where I gush on and on over my favorite lines and comedic timing. That would be great fun for me, but little interest to those who have not had the chance to see it yet. This film, this story, these characters, they all just work for me. When you hear the plot you first will think of Knocked Up, but that would be like comparing the lesser American Me to the greater Blood in Blood Out, or The Stoned Age to Dazed and Confused. I loosely use those examples to make my point as the driving point of Knocked Up and Juno is an unintentional pregnancy, but they explore the conflict of sperm vs. egg and the responsibility that comes with that chance completely differently from each other. I loved Knocked Up, but I adored Juno.Ellen Page plays in her breakthrough role as Juno MacGuff, a self aware 16 year old girl whose sarcastic wit is saved from no one. Michael Cera as Paulie Bleeker does exactly what we have seen him do so far, a reserved kid with a quiet disposition. Cera is perfect in this, being the great introvert for Page to play off extrovertly, but he has to be careful not to fall into that role much longer. Get him in a Meth comedy, like Spun meets Half Baked. I want to see Cera show us a little more, just so he has some longevity past the Apatow machine that is at its peak right now (Someone get me to see Pineapple Express now!). He is used sparingly though, Bleaker is pretty much just a sperm donor; the real star is Juno and her growing tummy. In the film, we go through the seasons of change as Juno deals with the consequences of unprotected sex. The burden of coming clean with parents, dealing with a social Scarlet letter in High School, and hormonal flushes roll right off Juno's back as she decides how to deal with the baby growing within her. She answers an ad in the Penny Saver for a couple looking to adopt and finds what she believes is the perfect loving home in the upper class marriage of Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner). An arraignment is struck, and the papers are signed. The baby will be theirs.There will be those that say such a plot is inconceivable in the modern world. These might be the same people that could not believe Seth Rogen would ever hook up with Katherine Hiegl. I have no qualms with that pairing, but maybe that's wishful thinking on my part, fair enough. I like the message of this film, the quiet notion of choices. I knew a couple like the Loring's once, wanting a child so bad, maybe under false pretenses. I won't soap box here, but while I am pro-choice on the abortion debate, I wouldn't mind seeing more local adoptions out there. Just a thought, from a 20 something single male with no wife, no girlfriend, and no kids¬óso take it for what it's worth.I predict this film will do amazingly well on DVD as the buzz continues to grow past the theatrical release. There is a Napoleon Dynamite quality to the film. Page doesn't play a droll character like Heder did; there is this charming quality about the film, from the story to performances that just makes you fall for the whole thing. The music by Kimya Dawson and others pairs so well that if you like this film in the slightest bit you will be compelled to pick up the soundtrack as soon as possible. I certainly am adding some more female artists to my male centric playlist because of this film.As stated, this film will move the discs when it finally hits shelves, but don't wait for that. Juno is a film that had me laughing a day after the credits finished. Small moments would pop in my head and a soft chuckle could be heard coming from my gut. Around Christmas time they will have 800 to 1000 theatrical releases(hell, call yours and tell them you want it), so look to the official site for the coming availability in your area. Juno got me, I hope she gets you.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Adorable Juno,"An unusual topic taken as the main plot of the movie. Yes it delivers much to the expectations. The whole script is very unusual and carried out well. Ellen Page as Juno makes the offbeat movie survive with a brilliant act. She's witty, funny and fun to watch. There are some comical conversations which keeps the movie on lighter air throughout. Though the screenplay is adaptive to develop interest in the female viewers more, men must still find it likable, a little less may be. Its about emotions, friends, situations, parenthood and decision making. The movie never gets stretchy and is enjoyable. Juno as a character is likely to stay deep in our hearts and you can't ignore but adore her throughout the movie. Though I feel it could have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Ellen Page is definitely talented and played her part so well. The role really fits her. I loved the music from the Moldy Peaches and can't wait to watch Juno again when it comes out! Go watch it if you have a free screening near you! Michael Cera was adorable and Jennifer Garner was wonderful. Diablo wrote a great script and the dialogue was perfect. Rainn Wilson was hilarious even though he has only a few lines and Jason Reitman did a great job of directing!

Great Juno,"As ""Juno"" opens, Juno MacGuff played by Ellen Page downs a gallon of Sunny D, while lamenting the chair where it all started. Juno is filling up, so she can verify a drug store pregnancy test¬ófor the third time. Director Jason Reitman's ""Juno"" catches you completely off guard in a bitter sweet and moving tale about living with life choices. ""Juno"" is perhaps the best movie of the year. Reitman also directed the excellent ""Thank You for Smoking"". With ""Juno"" the same wit shines along with a touching humanity. ""Juno"" is so smart, maybe a bit too smart at times with the crisp and biting dialog of Diablo Cody's amazing screenplay. Even some of the smartest people around, don't routinely create such stinging rifts. Regardless, the effect is hysterical as ""Juno"" celebrates the best in people. The greatest thing in life is when the people closest to you surprise you with their loyalty, compassion, and love. Yes, ""Juno"" is about a pregnant 16 year-old girl out to correct an error in judgment. However, it is not about the pregnancy itself, rather who the people become as they step up or not.Applaud ""Juno"" for being very smart, embodied by the heroine Juno played by the remarkable Ellen Page. After Juno tells her father Mac (J.K. Simmons) and step mom Bren (Alison Janney), that she is pregnant and the father is Bleeker (Michael Cera), she confesses to her Dad, ""I really don't know what kind of girl I am."" The punch line is that her parents expected it. Bren admits that she was hoping the issue was that Juno was expelled or she was ""into hard drugs"". Ellen Page is awesome, and deserves an Oscar nomination. She is brilliant. She personifies Juno as this very smart and smart ass-ed kid who makes a mistake, and takes a responsible course of action. In a wonderful moment Bren (Janney) cautions the ultrasound technician to mind her judgment, because even her ""stupid ass step daughter"" could raise her child, but she has wisely chosen to give the baby a more capable couple.Juno finds the ideal couple: Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). Juno located Mark and Vanessa in a PennySaver ad. Juno and her Dad meet the Lorings' and their attorney. Juno is a little chagrined¬óshe would like to ""kick this old school"" with the baby basket and Moses river deal. Mark and Vanessa seem the ""Stepford"" couple. However, fissures in their relationship are exposed. Vanessa (Garner) seems wound a few degrees too tight¬óeven for type A. Her desire to be a mother is all consuming and humorless. Mark (Bateman) is the cool and supportive husband, but unhappy just below the surface. He composes music for commercials. He and Juno, also a wannabe guitarist, form a friendship.Meanwhile, Juno is a pregnant 16 year-old making it through high school on her resounding spirit and smarts. This soon is not enough. She wonders what will happen with her and Bleeker (Cera). The Lorings' are not what she expected, too. There is the wonderful conversation Juno has with her Dad, ""Why can't two people stay together forever?"" This is hysterical and touching all at the same time¬óan epiphany for Juno and the audience. Ultimately, Juno is about finding true love and copping when it is gone. In a great line Juno says, ""He is the cheese to my macaroni."" Rietman is natural and understated in his direction. All the performances are compelling and amazing. T.K. Simmons is the perfect Dad, who keeps surprising with his irreverent compassion and strength. Alison Janney is awesome. Her Bren is smart, funny, and unexpectedly loyal to Juno. Michael Cera gets the right balance of geek and big hearted. Jason Bateman is great¬óhe is subtle in his charm and suffering. Jennifer Garner is a total surprise playing against type. Her Vanessa is nearly insufferable, but Garner imposes her humanity that transcends the taut character. There is a moving scene where she feels Juno's baby kick. Ellen Page is vulnerable, smart, and hysterical. Page is an amazing actor. She completely captivates ""Juno"".""Juno"" is one of the year's best. ""Juno"" refreshingly and humorously tells a story of the very best in people as they step up in life, and of true love. Definitely see ""Juno"" and be surprised.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Everything was easy for it seemed like, except for the day that mark had told her he was breaking up with Vanessa and she was mad at Pauly Bleaker, and it wouldn't really be like that.

I've never been in a situation like this before, but it really does show what can be the outcome of teenage pregnancy. Diablo Cody did a great job of having the plot be serious, but have funny one-liners that can keep you laughing throughout the movie but still be aware of the situation.

Most intelligent dramady in a long time,"I'm tempted to call Juno a comedy, but that isn't really correct. It's a dramatically gripping film, with real characters, that happens to be quite frequently funny. The humor generally comes through acid-sharp dialog, which is both sublimely human and thoroughly well written. The drama, however, comes out through characters which are neither black nor white. One moment a character will be portrayed engaging in a creepy and negative act, the next they will be viewed in a sympathetic light. Everyone is behaving with the best of intentions, and we as the audience get to ride along as those intentions twist the characters into an ugly reflection of us all. The excellent acting across the board helps this tremendously.It's a quite sympathetic movie overall, and nobody comes off looking like ""a bad guy."" It's a solidly written, acted, and directed piece, that all comes together to feel grander than a simple family story. This may very well be the best coming-of-age film for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sixteen Going On Thirty-Six,"In Roman mythology, Juno was the Queen of the Gods, and is normally portrayed as a tall, voluptuous woman, hence the adjective ""Junoesque"". The title of this movie was therefore presumably intended ironically, as the slim, petite Ellen Page, who stars as the title character, is about the least Junoesque actress one could imagine. She not only looks younger then twenty (her actual age at the time the film was made) but even looks younger than sixteen (the supposed age of her character).The Juno in question is Juno MacGuff, a sixteen-year-old schoolgirl from Minnesota. (At least, the film is ostensibly set in Minnesota, although for financial reasons it was shot in British Columbia, that corner of Canada which is, at least in Hollywood's eyes, forever America). Juno discovers that she is pregnant by a boy named Paulie Bleeker. (Paulie is not quite close enough to be her regular boyfriend, but their relationship is obviously more than just platonic). Juno's initial reaction is to have an abortion, but is persuaded by her pro-life friend Su-Chin to change her mind. Deciding she is too young to care for the child herself, she makes arrangements to have it adopted by a wealthy local couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring. (The film suggests that in America, or at least in the state of Minnesota, adoption is a much more informal process than it would be in Britain. Juno actually finds the Lorings through an ad in the local paper).At first, the Lorings seem like the ideal adoptive parents, although it soon becomes clear that there may be trouble ahead. The problem is that Mark and Vanessa are in many ways incompatible with one another. She is the ultimate conformist, whose ambition to become the all-American bourgeois housewife and mother has been frustrated only by the fact that she and Mark do not actually have any children. He is a non-conformist, a thirty-something teenage rebel who still hankers after the dream of becoming a rock star and, belatedly, sees the looming prospect of parenthood as a threat to that dream. Although not too much is made of it, there are clear hints in the script that Mark finds himself becoming romantically attracted to the child-woman Juno, something else which suggests he has never really grown up. Another strand in the plot is the progress of the romance between Juno and Paulie.The film has, paradoxically, been criticised by both the religious right, who objected to what they saw as a glamorisation of teenage motherhood, and by the pro-choice camp regarding its treatment of abortion, although I am not sure that either side really has all that much to complain about. Juno, who is not presented as a particularly glamorous figure, does, after all, make a free choice to give her baby a chance of life, and is not pressured into it. (Her parents would much rather she had an abortion).The film was the surprise hit of 2007. It was made on the very low budget of $6.5 million and featured only one major star, Jennifer Garner as Vanessa. Yet it earned more than $200 million at the box office, made a star of its leading lady, was highly praised by many critics and was nominated for several Academy Awards, winning a ""Best Original Screenplay"" Oscar for its oddly-named (or, since that is not her real name, perhaps I should say ""oddly-pseudonymmed"") scriptwriter Diablo Cody.The film does indeed have some good qualities. Cody clearly has a talent for writing witty dialogue, and Page has a talent for speaking it. Her ability to put across her lines with a deadpan face reminded me of the young Christina Ricci, to whom Page bears a certain physical likeness. The main problem with the film for me was that Juno always seems just a little too much in control, able to deal with every situation calmly, rationally and to greet every setback with a sardonic wisecrack which would sound better coming from a practised stand-up comedian going through his routine than on the lips of a teenage girl. (Juno to Mark and Vanessa:- ""You should've gone to China, you know, 'cause I hear they give away babies like free iPods. You know, they pretty much just put them in those t-shirt guns and shoot them out at sporting events""). Physically, Juno might look like sixteen going on thirteen; mentally she seems to be sixteen going on thirty-six.And emotionally she seems to be- well, actually, she doesn't seem to have all that much of an emotional life at all. Certainly not the emotions which one would normally expect a teenage girl to have when confronted with the unwelcome fact of an unplanned pregnancy. ""Juno"" is in many ways a smart, clever film, but its approach to its subject-matter is a bit too one-dimensional. It exploits the comic side to teenage pregnancy, but does no more than nod to the idea that there might be a more serious side. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Do you know what it's like when someone goes on for an extremely lengthy period of time just to tell you something they could have told you in 3 minutes?? Do you know what it's like to have to wade through a mound of garbage to find one singular element of value?? That describes this movie to a 'T'.I have never met anyone in my life, much less an entire community of people, like these depicted in the movie, ANYWHERE in the Upper Midwest part of our country. How offensive it would be to people from there being depicted in such an offensive, base, degrading manner. I thought the movie ""Fargo"" and ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" was BAD, but they are practically human praise reports in comparison to this piece of work. The Scandinavians I've met and gotten to know from there have been the KINDEST, MOST MANNERLY, ETHICAL, NON-OFFENSIVE, and CLEANEST LIVING PEOPLE in our country - Not the stupid, simple-minded, alcoholics like they are far too frequently depicted as. If they really were like that, the rest of the country wouldn't continue to make such drastic attempts to get them to live and work where they're living.I honestly tried to look beyond all the distractions of ill behaviors, vulgar phrases (to put it MOST mildly), & numb-skulled existence, but the volume of it was set so high that it drowned out any kind of message the Writer and/or Director was trying to convey. The acting was good, the execution of it was extremely poor.It just goes to show us, again and again and again, that enough hype and carefully chosen 'Critics' who'll script a response for the movie before it's even released, and enough 'plugs' on television shows, can indeed fully influence massive amounts of people into believing that garbage is a work of art.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Serious social statement?,"Reading through some of the reviews here, I wonder if we watched the same movie. Some of you seemed to think it was trying to convey a serious social statement on teenage pregnancy - it wasn't! It was a gentle comedy with some great performances from all the cast, in particular J K Simmons, Allison Janney, but especially Michael Cera as Bleek.So Juno wasn't a typical teenager - what is a *typical* teenager? I was into 40's and 50's music when I was in my teens, so for a girl to be into the 70's scene and classic horror films is not so unusual.If you're reading the reviews to this film before watching it, don't be put off by all the negativity here - take it for what it is, a gentle, heart-warming comedy with some great performances.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"I Fell Hard for ""Juno""","""Juno"" is this year's ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" a tiny film with a gigantic heart.Ellen Page plays Juno (NOT like the city in Alaska, as she makes very clear at one point), a sixteen year old who acts tougher and older than she really feels and who finds herself pregnant after one experimental romp in an easy chair with her best buddy, Paul Bleeker (the terrific Michael Sera). She decides to give the baby to a thirty-ish yuppie couple (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) living in a sprawling McMansion who haven't been able to have a child of their own. The rest is a sweet, very funny and refreshingly unpredictable comedy about what it means to grow up.There are dilemmas in ""Juno,"" but they may not be the dilemmas you're expecting. Diablo Cody has written a sharp screenplay that's fair to all of her characters. It was so nice for once to see a young, married, successful couple portrayed as something other than yuppies from hell, and both Bateman and Garner do wonderful work with their characters. Page is a revelation; this is one of those films that's so self-consciously quirky and in love with its own style that it could have been disastrous if not played just so, but Page nails the main character beautifully. She allows us to see Juno's vulnerability, and that's essential to the film's success. The film, unlike so many others, acknowledges that teenagers aren't equipped to deal with adult problems, and that there's a lot they could learn if they were only receptive to it. I give the film great credit for portraying Juno's parents (J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney) as something other than buffoons or losers. And Simmons and Janney as actors have some of the film's best lines and moments.Only someone with a heart of stone could leave this film without a lump the size of Alaska in his throat. And, can I just say bravo to the filmmakers for including a terrific opening credits sequence. Am I the only one who's saddened by the fact that movies don't seem to have opening credit sequences anymore?Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
OK but lacks drama or bite,"How ""Juno"" became a cultural phenomenon is more interesting than the film itself. A mildly amusing and mildly dramatic film it miraculously made many critics lose their minds. The movies faults come down largely to the screenplay. To put it bluntly everybody speaks too much and too ""wittily"" (the ""wittily"" is attempted rather than achieved much of the time). Their is little rhythm to the dialogue. The film improves somewhat after a truly dire opening scene in a pharmacists where the banter between Juno and the always unfunny Rainn Wilson is embarrassing in the extreme. The opening exemplifies the faults of the film though - the script is simply not as clever as it thinks it is. What saves the film are the performances. Ellen Page is fine in the main role. JK Simmons and Allison Janney (both exceptional character actors) have little to do as over-nice parents but do it very well. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman though provide whatever emotional pull the film has, Bateman in particular got nowhere near the praise he deserved. Michael Cera turns in another of his patented George Michael performances - it's all very well but it is impossible to imagine him and Juno having sex which rather negates the point of the movie. A tepid indie soundtrack adds to the underwhelming niceness of the project. Like ""Knocked Up"" this is diverting enough, if you get through the opening you will likely enjoy it. The film does not stay in the mind though and it's main achievement is to make unwanted pregnancy ""nice"".",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Being Pregnant and Growing Up,"Quirky, indie films are seen as reliable alternatives to the generic bubble gum blockbusters, but some of them could go head-to-head with the big boys. ""Juno"", a coming-of-age dramedy (drama meets comedy) is one of those contenders, and it should be proud that it is. Hell, it earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture for 2007. What more do you want?Spunkiness, sarcasm and maturity are wrapped up in the title player, high school junior Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), who's confronted with being heavy with child, after causal sex with track and field runner and good pal, the turtle-like Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera of ""Superbad"" and ""Arrested Development"").Abortion seems plausible, but the (inane) notion of a fetus having fingernails gets to our heroine, forcing her to admit a ""mea culpa"" to her parents and have the child put up to for adoption. Childless yuppies, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Emmy-winner Jason Bateman of ""AD"", ""Smoking Aces"" and ""Hancock""; Jennifer Garner of ""Alias"" and ""Catch and Release"") are the possible couple, but Juno realizes that growing up doesn't mean growing up perfectly.If you imagine subversive comic Jeanane Garofalo in her late teens/early adulthood, and having the brain of Oscar legend Kate Hepburn, you have Ellen Page, who approaches the role like a giddy sharpshooter and earned an Oscar nom for Best Lead Actress. Though he has the personality of a tadpole, Cera's Bleeker is basically unique. Being an individual, only Juno could befriend, let alone copulate with, a person who's so cool, he doesn't even have to try. Bateman and Garner are picture perfect, effective in hiding the deep chasm between them. They contrast with Juno's folks; caring Mac (J.K. Simmons of the Spiderman films and ""The Closer"" and he should have been nominated) and blunt step mom Bren (Allison Janney of ""The West Wing"") are domestically grounded.Other impressionable players include Rainn Wilson (""The Office"", US version) as a snarky pharmacy clerk; Olivia Thrilby (""Snow Angels"", ""The Wackness"") as Juno's wild-hearted, cheerleader gal pal and mousy Valerie Tian (""Long Life, Happiness and Prosperity"") as an amusingly exploitable pro-life classmate who's the impetus of Juno's change of heart.But the real star in is the film's scribe, Diablo Cody (nee Brook Busey), an ex-stripper (a lot of material she got!!!) who had fame knocking on her door after she wrote an Internet blog, displaying her sarcastic, non-conformist prose. It shows up in ""Juno"", earning Ms. Cody an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. This is the third time I've seen a movie whose story's so powerful, it reduces the director to a joystick (Taxi Driver and American Gangster are the first two). You could feel sorry for the film's helmsman, Jason Reitman (son of comedy legend Ivan; ""Thank You For Smoking""), but he won't mind. Being Oscar nominated for Best Director is rewarding enough.If you have animosity for ""Juno"", either because of Ms. Cody's success or the lead character's personality or both, you're wasting time. Like Travis Bickle of ""Driver"" (excluding the Mohawk cut), Juno's a force or nature, cutting through society like a hot knife through butter, and she mirrors her creator's disposition, whose maiden screenplay reminds me of mine own (no details, you thieves). ""I'm sixteen, pregnant and smart! Hear me roar and joke!"" is the film's mantra, and both are monoliths to be reckoned with.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Juno,"Juno is about an eccentric 16 year old girl named Juno MacGuff who soon discovers that she is pregnant. Being 16 and pregnant isn't that easy as Juno soon finds out and during these nine months and right till the end of her pregnancy, Juno matures as a person and learns about life, love and a lot of other things most people at that age would not learn until much older. I realize that I 'am not going as lengthily into the plot of this film as I may have in some of my past reviews, but Juno is really a great film to experience and I feel that if I were to give away any more it wouldn't exactly be giving away any big secrets, or plot twists because the movie isn't like that, but I feel experiencing the movie without having too much knowledge or idea of how it might turn out will probably enhance your viewing pleasure because you get to see the magic of it's wonderful script and performances unfold before you and that is a far greater enjoyment than having known about the film's many quirks and wonderful characters that you may otherwise not be able to enjoy as much. The film's script is quite literally brilliant and one of the most original and heartfelt to come out of the Hollywood system in awhile. Everything from Juno's teenage urban vocabulary, the pop culture references, or just the film's wonderfully unique and charming characters that are really a treat to get to know throughout the film. While the plot of the film is simple enough there are so many different layers to all of these characters and their personalities and true self portraits get to shine during the film. And like I said because these characters are so original and at the same time so human and realistic it's authenticity is really felt. The script also features a lot of humour, great one liners and a lot of human situations that show us just how real this movie is and it is done with a real sharp taste of what it would be like for someone in this situation as well as showing the emotions, drama and life lessons including love that these characters discover. All of this is told to us with the brilliant spot on performances and the wonderful script that will make us laugh and other times warm our hearts with the loving and caring nature that the main characters show off. This past year we had Juno and Knocked Up both dealing with unplanned pregnancies and making it very humorous and at the same time very real and touching at the same moment. This film is so rich with it's writing and acted out with sheer brilliance by it's cast and it deserves a spot on the list as one of the year's best films and a wonderful performance by lead actress Ellen Page (who will likely get an Oscar if Julie Christie, or Marion Cotillard don't get it) and a real and wonderfully written script by Diablo Cody which just gets me thinking about how much I loved it by just thinking about it. This film works as a comedy, a drama, a character study and a human interest story with a lot to give it's viewers. One of the year's best.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Entertaining,"Juno has two separate levels - when taken as an offbeat comedy/drama, it's quite enjoyable, cleverly written, beautifully shot and exquisitely acted. When looking a bit deeper though, you may find a pretty shallow exploitation of very important issues, which tries very hard - and succeeds - to be likable, but in the process delivers some very problematic messages.My advice is to not take it seriously at all, and then you'll find it a fun bit of entertainment with some very good acting and clever dialog. Ellen Page delivers a star-making performance, and Jason Bateman creates a surprisingly complex character.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A funny side of teen-pregnancy,"Don't think of me as weird, but I think pregnancy (and birth) is a beautiful thing in a woman's life. For a teenage girl, carrying a baby for nine months may seem like a big commitment. Consider the challenges of childbirth and raising a child. It is a bumpy road to take. Just ask 16-year-old Juno MacGuff in this exceptional film about dealing with growing up, tough decisions, and what I think is ""the funny side of teen pregnancy."" I do not mind the film's lessons at all.I love Juno's character and Ellen Page's performances. I do not know why; I just love her. I adore the friendship-turned-romance between Juno and Paulie Bleecker in the film. Indeed, I think this film is one of the best of 2007. It is full of wit, humor and some other scenes that are made so entertaining and enjoyable.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not bad,"I personally think that this movie is quite good. The only thing that I didn't like about it was (though it was her choice and I respect that) the preachy pro-life stance and the misinformation presented to her. A fetus does not have hair or fingernails until pretty much the ninth month of pregnancy. Yes, she's pretty much doing the Gilmore Girls thing with the annoying fast talking, but other than that, she does, in fact, represent a rarity among teenagers. Trust me, being one, I know high school. Pick a random girl out among a high school and most likely she'll be a huge sunglasses-sporting, ugg-toting, Louis Vuitton/Juicy Couture bootleg-carrying, abercrombie/hollister wearing Paris Hilton wannabe with a fake valley girl accent that she copied from watching the OC or High School Musical. An intellectual alt-girl like Juno is one in a million. Yes, everything that you say is judged. Yes, when you say it is judged too. I like her attitude and I like the way this was presented. The production was great, and the writing was real. Plus, Diablo is just such a cool name!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Cute movie that I would definitely watch again,"Juno shows the strains and decisions that a pregnant teen has to make, from the mundane, to the more life-changing, and I think Ellen Page really does the role justice. The writing is amazing, every line being delivered by Juno is blunt and to-the-point, and often hilarious. The rest of the cast compliment her well, and I especially like the scenes of Juno spending time with the adopting parents. The character of Paulie was a little dull for my liking, but his scenes with Juno were well acted, and showed a good amount of awkwardness which made them funny.All in all, I think it is a beautiful movie, and really gives you an insight in teen pregnancy.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Quirky, Humorous and Tad Risqu√©","Quirky, humorous although a bit touchy, dramatic, and a bit risqu√© with it subject matter this film walks a fine line between a being a distasteful teen comedy and smart comedy with a strong center of drama based around family and relationships. I will admit the beginning was a bit off humor wise, but stick through that rough patch and it will draw you in with an especially strong outing by young Miss Page. She is the core of the film without her slightly off beat sense of humor and strong will the film would probably fall off track. The surrounding cast is finely cast with Leah, Juno's friend being a bit more teenagerish than Juno, offering a funny sidekick and J. K. Simmons having a strong base as the rather rough around the edges father who ultimately cares about his daughter no matter what. Really the film did disappoint a bit from the hype, but that was to be expected. It had an off beat sense of humor which made for some great laughs and some strong drama moments making for a good balance, but nothing astounding. If there is anything to be loved about this it is Page's shining performance.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Simply amazing,"I have to say this is one of the best feeling and funniest movies that I have seen in my whole life. It's truly amazing how a movie can make you laugh throughout and also give you a case of the happy cry. I can only say that you need to see this movie. My best description would be if you combined Little Miss Sunshine and Superbad together and they formed a movie that was even better than you thought either of them could be combined (I thoroughly enjoyed both movies- but not nearly as much as Juno).I should also tell you that I had very high expectations for this movie, and it lived up, and surpassed in many ways every single one of them. I can only hope that you enjoy this movie as much as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
simplicity,"I've just commented on Aronofsky/Rourke's ""The Wrestler"". Also, i've seen recently a great simple Belgian film, ""Moscow, Belgium"". The reason why it matters to connect these 2 films to this ""Juno"" is one: all of them are what you see, none of them pretends to be more than it is. They are honest, visceral, and straight-forward pieces of cinema. The 3 films caught the sympathy of the audiences (though the Belgian obviously didn't have the distribution of the other 2). Is this important? Maybe not, or maybe it's the sign of a tendency. Maybe the audiences are expecting to be more touched and less impressed. To be led to feel, instead of being forced to rationalize. I think that recent years have brought beautiful intellectual developments to cinema, but there is a counter-point necessary to keep films on the entertainment level, to make them invite people to watch them. Something someone like, say, Medem, did a few times. (even though his ambitious Ca√≥tica Ana was so misunderstood by the public). This Juno is a non-intellectual, visceral piece of film. It's simplistic for better and worse. Why it had so much success is, i suppose, because it took heavy themes lightly. It avoided connecting teenager pregnancy to social breakdown, to personal lives limitations. Ellen Paige was a good cast having that in mind, as well as Simmons.Does a film like this make my day? Does it fully satisfies me? No it doesn't, i look for more, i want to find more in a film than what there is at first sight. I want to wake up in the middle of the night, wondering about certain things, finding out more about what the director meant with certain things. I want to carry images with me, i want the sensation that i met someone, that a director, or an actor, or a cinematographer showed something of what he has inside. But this is good enough for what it is. It's unpretentious in the way that it is what we see. It's intellectually honest because it doesn't moralize. I sometimes am tired of seeing films that are totally the opposite of what they stand for, films that pretend to encourage free-thinking but themselves are all part of a big mounting-line, all the same, all boring and made following formulas. I admit, and even welcome a film as this one, for it refreshes things. But i hope this doesn't become a rule. I hope we can still count in the future with the developments of Medem, I√±arritu or Kar-Wai.But this IS entertaining and honest, and that was its point.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Girl get's pregnant, girl deals with pregnancy and adoption.","""Juno"" is a whip-smart drama that's chock-full of dark comedy as well.

I thoroughly recommend ""Juno"" to everyone who loves dark comedy and intelligent family and social drama. Heck, Ellen Page's performance alone is worth the price of admission.

This is one flick that doesn't live up to its overheated hype,"I had been thinking of going to the Toronto International Film Festival one of these days, but after reading the following quote: ""I don't know when I've heard a standing ovation so long, loud and warm as the one at the Toronto International Film Festival after Jason Reitman's ""Juno,"" which I predict will become quickly beloved when it opens at Christmas time, and wins a best actress nomination for its 20-year-old star, Ellen Page.""-Roger Ebert, and after watching the film myself, all I can think is TIFF must be some sort of barely tolerable metrosexual self-adoration festival.Ellen Page is endearing, and capable of holding your attention, for a time, but she's also annoying, in this role, at least. What you are convinced of is, this young woman shouldn't be experimenting with motherhood. She's way too naive and inexperienced. That's not exactly a hard sell, though. So why should we take an evening to delve into this clich√©? I guess the answer is so that we can marvel at this young woman's apparent inner resources and irrepressible good humor. The wallowing is a little too unrewarding for me.I admit, thinking about it afterward, it is nice to see some of the characters found in this film displayed totally unadorned and unromanticized, but that's not exactly 'entertaining' without some insight or revelation to go with it. Here we get a somewhat plodding tale of a teenager in trouble surrounded by fairly good-natured but fairly boring types. Even Jennifer Garner manages to be somewhat lackluster here, as they no doubt wanted her to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A great comedy that suffers a little from the lackluster acting,"I accompanied some friends to see the movie Juno with little expectation. Michael Cera and Jason Bateman are incredible actors(see Arrested Development) so I figured I would enjoy the movie.The cast is phenomenal, and I enjoyed J.K. Simmons in his role as the dad. Ellen Page did give a great performance, but she became sort of the clich√© sarcastic teen that you would see on television.(There are a few scenes that stand out in particular which put her on the edge of annoying) This is my biggest gripe with the film, as the acting didn't seem real to me. It felt like I was watching a sitcom, which isn't bad, but it could have been better.The acting in general was OK, and I'm a little disappointed with Michael Cera's character. First off, Cera was advertised as being a huge factor in this movie, which he isn't. I don't want to spoil the plot, but his character should have had more say in the movie as his importance was ignored in the overall story. It's clear that his popularity from Superbad would bring in many people if they stuck his face on every Juno poster.In regards to the plot, there were some questionable motives and actions that didn't really develop all that well. It's very obvious to see what is going to happen next in regards to the story, but I thought that the writers would have approached it a little differently.Overall I think that the movie was a unique surprise, but that's all. Calling this the Little Miss Sunshine of this year is RIDICULOUS. That movie was amazing on all levels and Juno does not reach this quality at all in the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"If I make a mistake, I'll damn well try not to make any more . . .","Juno (named after a jealous Roman goddess of heaven and earth) is 16 and pregnant. She had a one-off thing with Paulie Bleeker, a similarly geeky type in golden running shorts. After being frightened off the abortion clinic by a tactless receptionist and placard-waving fellow-student, Juno opts for adoption. ""Can't we just kick it old school?,"" she says, interviewing rather posh prospective parents. ""I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds."" What sets the film apart is its intense performance by the lead star and a sparklingly offbeat and witty script. Juno is one of those teenagers who is thinking faster than everyone around her and extremely articulate. Like her heating-and-ventilation father, we hesitate before thinking we could know better.In mythology, Juno's deepest desire was for a happy union and proactive partnership. Our heroine having sought out the perfect couple is distraught when, surprise, surprise, they're not perfect. Her father might be on his second marriage, but he is devoted to her in a solid and sincere, role-model sort of way. Their humble, apparently dysfunctional family, is a more solid unit than the high-flying childless materialists who seem to lack for nothing (except a baby).Our film, with 'Indie' written all over its sleeve, has quirks like hand-scrawled chapters announcing the seasons (the Roman Juno was mistress of them). Juno and her best-friend/inseminator play folksy guitar and listen to suitably recondite pop music. She affects a Sherlock Holmes pipe. We have frequent reminders of its low-budget status - as if we should congratulate it on its miraculous existence. But skillful delivery rescues it from pretentiousness every time. And the heady momentum is kept up to the end.If acting and script save it from being high school cheese, they also save it from being a pro-life drum-banger. While hitting all the right notes to show that intelligent kids value abstinence and babies over promiscuity and termination, it is simply telling a story and telling it well. There are many excellent films demonstrating the need to allow choice the other way, and both types should rise or fall on their merits as films rather than the examples they extol.The visual palette of Juno is seductive, rich tones reflecting each season. Cinematography also includes beautiful touches: as Juno sits at the edge of the road, crying for a moment in her car, a slow freight train passes her by. She must do something with her life (and the life inside her), before it, too, passes her by. The story allows all her decisions, of course, to turn out spot on.We are constantly entranced to see what Juno will do or say next. As a standout film, it has the surprise and freshness of a Little Miss Sunshine. The soundtrack is full of whimsical pseudo-intellectual tracks by little-known bands, oozing the appeal of, say, Garden State.One might cavil that such a bright, educated and quick-witted young woman is hardly likely to have bypassed condom use in her underage adventure. Or that the ending is unbelievably pat. But this is still probably the cleverest, funniest, and most lovable bittersweet ode to teenage pregnancy you will ever witness.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Very Funny,"This is a must see movie for comedy lovers. During the first few scenes you don't know where the movie's going and you think that laughing at a teens pregnancy is not politically correct, but pretty soon the comedy rips everyone open and the crowd in the theater lets loose. Rarely I'm in a theatric where 100 people are all laughing at once. You'll have to sit through some emotionally drippy chick-flick scenes but, comedy alone won't bring my wife to the theater so it was worth it.

"Definitely original, Canadian feeling film","My wife liked it a lot, maybe because it concerns pregnancies and having babies and stuff. I like it because it showed people actually behaving like human beings, making fun of their own predicament, being able to put logic in front of instinctual feelings and all that.It is hard to describe the film. It felt Canadian, in other words without ridiculous clich√©s and everyone being in constant competition for money, attention, coolness or anything like that. It had a plot, too. And I didn't feel I watched a comedy. I mean, yeah, the characters are funny sometimes, but that's just like talking to a friend that says something pleasant, and you smile because you feel good, not because you consider your friends part of your entertainment.That's about it. If you liked Donnie Darko or Hatley High, this felt like a combination of the two. Without the psychotic bunny, I mean. It was a good movie and I am glad it took several awards this year, but I don't think it was too great either. Could have helped if I didn't dislike Hard Candy so much.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Heart Warming Original Story.,"I have to strongly disagree with some of these somewhat negative comments.All though the soundtrack was not the greatest i have heard, it was certainly not ""painfully bad"", Actually, it gives the film a character, it gives viewers fantastic outlooks on its individuality.It is not like any other movie I have seen before. I enjoyed the whole movie, I killed myself laughing at some parts, and some parts I merely snickered at some others.To people who believe that the dialog is unrealistic; is truly wrong. In fact, I speak like that, It may not be like the respectful way of putting things, but labeling the movie ""ill conceived"" is certainly out of order as well.The movie seeks into young viewers (and the older audicence as well) minds as it leaves a heart warming parable. Personally, I found it quite amusing and I feel I can relate to Juno very much. Its quirky humour raised a roar of laughter in the cinema I attended. It turns out to be one of my favourite movies, and a good message to all who wish to take it on board.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Female Napoleon Dynamite,"I saw this movie today, and found a sort of coming-of-age tale told with a large dose of campy humor. I thought this movie was on the whole a good movie, though not the stand-out dark comedy/drama that it's reported to be.The movie focuses on a vivid 16 y.o. pregnant teen named Juno, who is in so many ways a female version of Napoleon Dynamite. If you liked Napoleon Dynamite, you'll very probably like Juno; if you didn't like Napoleon Dynamite, you'll probably be well advised to pass on Juno.I myself liked Napoleon Dynamite ... although the constant sardonic humor and uber-Attitude becomes rather trying, both in Juno and in Napoleon Dynamite, the whole does kind of grow on me ... as on others. This is the kind of character that I myself find fun, if cloying. I don't myself enjoy sardonic put-downs as a part of my regular diet. One viewing is enough for me. But that's me; to each his/her own.The storyline I thought was very engaging, and the supporting script conveys it well. The acting ranged from solid to excellent. Ellen Page as Juno is perfectly cast and delivers her character perfectly. Michael Cera did a solid job as Paulie Bleeker. Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney, and J.K. Simmons all turned in decent supporting roles. Cinematography, sets, sound were all good.All in all, if you like teenage coming-of-age flicks in general, and Napoleon Dynamite in particular, this movie is for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Handled with humorous optimism instead of dread,"Kudos to Cody Diablo for penning something so strategically humorous we almost forget it is about one of the biggest social problems occurring in our time. Of course we can find lots of tragedy in teen pregnancy but why should we keep going there? The script was witty, and clever even though very peppered with clich√©s and overly mature dialog for teens to be speaking. Yes there are mature teens but way too many of them in this film. But there was definitely the youthful essence and naivet√© present at key moments in the film and the cast was perfect and the humor fresh and not re-hashed from other teen dramas that we are so tired of seeing. I know a lot of people who did not like this because they wanted to see a ""message"" to teen girls, or something to instill fear in them about becoming pregnant. It was handled well, I laughed, I cried a little bit and I told 20 people to go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A cute film that's enjoyable for everyone,"I have never been the only male person in a theater audience before. Ever. But now as I have gone to see ""Juno,"" I know what that feels like. From all the hype surrounding this movie, and Roger Ebert himself calling it the best movie of the year, I decided it would be worth walking down to my theater in below 20 degree weather to see it at a 2:45 matin√©e on a lazy Sunday afternoon. So I did.First and foremost--the film is over-hyped, but I still loved it. Juno (Ellen Page) is a weird, abnormal, yet stunningly cute teenager who messes up and gets pregnant by her best friend Paulie (Michael Cera). After choosing not to abort the baby, she decides to find adoptive parents, but in turn must face being pregnant at school, at home with her parents, and of course, trying to balance the everyday challenges of teenage life. As expected, there are bumps along the way, and that's why I think Juno is not so much a movie about teen pregnancy and the dangers that come with it--but as a dramedy about growing up.There are a lot of original, fun, quirky ideas that come along with Juno--one, primarily, is Juno's character, who you can't help but love. She's weird and rebel, and doesn't try to be popular, yet of course, she gets some unwanted popularity eventually. Ellen Page does such a seamless job portraying the character, I would not be surprised if she was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Then we have Juno's best friend Paulie (who gets her pregnant), who is the nerdy, skinny kid who dominates the track team, plays guitar, and puts deodorant on his legs. The adoptive parents--Vanessa, the baby-obsessed lady who wants a child so bad she's ready to jump off a building, and Mark, the musically obsessed Sonic Youth lover who forms a friendship with Juno. I could go on and on and on but you get the picture...the film is quirky and lovable by everyone.The film has a very indie feel to it that is paired up with a cute, indie acoustic soundtrack that I absolutely loved. The acting is without question some of the best I've seen in 2007 films--the dialogue is very witty, quirky, and entertaining, and forces a smile upon your face. Ellen Page gives a phenomenal performance as the weird, pregnant Juno and she is paired with outstanding performances by Jason Bateman, who you might remember from Arrested Development, and Michael Cera. Unfortunately, though I really liked the film, it is extremely over-hyped. It does not deserve a Best Picture nomination and certainly not it's 8.4/10 rating on IMDb. The strongest point of Juno is its indie -feel and originality--the weakest, unfortunately, is the way it is executed. I can't help but think Jason Reitman, the director, sort of mishandled the film and couldn't decide on whether he wanted it to be a comedy or tragedy. Also the first half hour or so of the film is very, VERY slow and lacks charm that is found in the second half. The idea, story, and structure for Juno is absolutely brilliant--but it could've been handled so much better.Contrary to popular belief, Juno is not just for preppy teenage girls who have dumb boyfriends who want to knock them up. Like I said earlier, this is much more than a story about a pregnant teenager--it's a story about growing up and facing the world's challenges. Paired with wonderful acting, superb dialogue, a cute soundtrack, and a brilliant story, Juno turns out to be a great, cute film, whether you're old or young or male or female.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Juno""","I love ""Juno."" It's the kind of movie you want to take home with you.That kind of magic is generated through several factors, the first being its actors. Ellen Page is a superstar; this film confirms it. She lives and breathes Juno so effortlessly it doesn't seem like acting. Ditto Michael Cera, whose beautifully-timed sense of humor is matched only by his beautifully-rendered sense of human truth. Jason Bateman is given a richer character than he's ever been allowed to play...and he's brilliant as usual. Jennifer Garner has never been better. Alison Janney and J.K. Simmons tackle the richest roles they've filled in years. This film is an acting showcase of the highest order.""Juno"" is also an example of film-making perfection. For this perfection, two people are responsible. The first is director Jason Reitman, whose previous film was ""Thank You for Smoking."" If that film was an assured debut, then ""Juno"" is a fulfillment of destiny. Every moment of every scene in ""Juno"" flows with the assurance of a director who understands the material as if he wrote it word-for-word (he didn't). There is never a false step...not visually, not emotionally.The second person responsible for ""Juno"" is its writer--it's mother, if you will--Diablo Cody. A more staggering screen writing debut has not taken place in recent memory. Cody writes in a style and a tone uniquely her own--Hollywood has a new, vibrant, brilliant voice. Her words breathe sweet, wonderful life to the world of ""Juno,"" and she understands the beats of human emotion and the complexities of character in a way that is equal parts completely sensible and utterly surprising. ""Juno,"" in its offbeat, deliberately verbose, stubbornly renegade way, is the most beautifully and delicately written film of the year. And after Ellen Page, Diablo Cody is the film's second breakout superstar.I want to hug this movie.(Junoverse ID#2428)",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Easily the best movie I have seen,"I don't know how anyone can dislike this. The acting in this blew me away, and the basic plot (teenage girl gets pregnant) is something anyone could have done; however, they put a lot of rather original things in there. Not to mention it is something that can happen and more than likely has happened. They added some twists to it to make it funny, but it isn't one of those movies where you laugh hard every two minutes. There are a lot of funny scenes in this movie though. Ir's one of those movies that you're sad it's over. I am definitely going to buy this movie in April when it comes out on DVD.Overall: 10/10 (great)- few problems.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Modern Capra,"I'm surprised at the vehemence of the people who dislike this movie for not making a Serious Statement about teenage pregnancy and/or abortion. Underneath the hipper than thou dialog, Juno is basically the kind of sentimental fable about decent, likable people that Frank Capra would be making if he were in his prime today. It has about as much to do with the actual consequences of pregnancy for a working class teenager as You Can't Take It With You did with unemployment during the Depression, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington with the rules of the Senate, or It's A Wonderful Life with the savings and loan business in a small town. That's pretty good company, and Juno belongs there.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

We were all wondering what all the talk was about so we went and seen this movie about a teen that gets pregnant and decides to give it up to a Husband and Wife that are desperately seeking a baby.The plot doesn't sound like that much, but once you get into the movie you cant stop thinking about it.The acting was perfect Ellen Page was nominated for an Oscar and lost, but i think she deserved it. She was so good as a lost teenager trying to find her way in the world. The Rest of the cast was perfect as well. The plot isn't really that much but you get into it fast.

Pretty Good Movie,"Rating: 7.2
Overall, a decent to pretty good movie that was a generic coming-of-age story that was masked with the backdrop of the teenage pregnancy and annoying, angsty moments.Pretty Good Direction (Did a fine job in moving the story forward, and the cut of the movie was fine, but nothing was really spectacle with the acting between the cast or showing the symbolism), Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good to Good from Elliot Page (Showed Good moments, but for the most part played the pretentious teenager who is filled with angst and overly blurts 00s slang), Pretty Good from Michael Cera (just played the Michael Cera character), Decent to Pretty Good from Jennifer Garner, Decent to Pretty Good from Jason Bateman, Decent to Pretty Good from Allison Janney, Pretty Good from J. K. Simmons, Decent from the rest of the cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (the generic coming of age story about an angsty girl, with the backdrop of the teenage pregnancy), Decent Screenplay (some of the jokes were decently funny, but there was an exaggeration of how teens talked in the 00s (especially with them cramming in way too much of the slang; also, the angsty parts were annoying to watch)), Pretty Good Score and Soundtrack, Decent Cinematography, Plot Structure was clear and clean as segment of the story was effectively shown, Pacing was good as the short runtime was effectively used to convey everything that was needed to be said (there was no need to add more time), The build to the climax was pretty good with the actual climax really showing the true nature of all the characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Smart, charming and daring comedy","The supposed taboo of teenage pregnancy is tackled full on in this smartly-written but still hugely enjoyable comedy. Rising star Ellen Page plays Juno, the girl in question, who discovers that she is pregnant at the age of 16. At first, she wants to abort it, but soon decides the best thing to do is give it up for adoption. Written by Diablo Cody, who has gained mass amounts of publicity for her previous career as an exotic dancer, Juno combines jug-loads of wit and charm with a brilliant cast featuring the ever watchable JK Simmons as the smart-but-firm father, Jennifer Garner as the uptight but well-meaning adopter-mother and Michael Cerna, who carries over his awkward nerd shtick, perfected in such laugh-a-thons as TV cult series Arrested Development and gross-out comedy Superbad.

Film 249 Final Exam question,In a college level Film 249 course Fall 2014 we studied the film Juno. What I suggest a viewer watch for during the film is the hidden symbols throughout the movie. The propose of reasoning behind the director's inclusion of may be to show the life of a pregnant teenager. While also using comedy and humor to lighten up the emotional scenes.This film was good but I honestly do not think its as good as everyone was saying. This was my first time watching it in class and I really just thought the movie was just okay at most yeah some parts of funny but that about it. So I probably wouldn't watch this movie again and I wouldn't recommend people to see it either.,6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Don't take the themes too much it to heart, be entertained..","I'm tired of seeing so many teenage flicks like American pie or scary movie around. It's was refreshing to find a film for this age with some intelligent dialogue. Ellen Page's character reminded me a lot of an old friend from school. Witty, bored and cynical. I really enjoyed Juno, and while clearly the film does deal with pretty serious issues, I wasn't overwhelmed. It's light-hearted approach was enjoyable.I actually watched the film with my Dad, we both found it to be highly amusing, more amusing though was an older man in front of us who was continually turning around throughout...he couldn't work out why we were laughing.I think the trick is not to think to hard about the underlying themes, just go to be entertained.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Smart script and wonderful performances,"Well, for a typical coming-of-age film, the quality of script and acting performances almost decide everything. And for this particular one, both the script and performances are noticeable, just as those from other brilliant coming-of-age films, such as The Edge of Seventeen, The Spectacular Now, Lady Bird, and so on. The casting is the base for the performances, which is also pretty well done. The most distinct feature of this film lies in the slight twist in plot and the novel topic, pregnancy for high school teenagers.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Not meant for me - but good,"Given that watching Juno was part of my college course I found myself being made to watch a film that normally I wouldn't watch and I had long since written off as a chick flick which I wouldn't like ‚Äì and I was right.I'm not saying it's a bad film by any means in fact the witty dialogue and likable characters make it very bearable for anyone who happens to find themselves watching it; but on the note of witty and likable characters, they are also quite hyper in some cases (Juno especially) which I can Imagine being extremely annoying the second time round.I can't get all preachy about Juno not taking teen pregnancy seriously because I don't think Diablo Cody wrote Juno with the intention of making anything remotely gritty, the whole film is colorful and trying to be cute so the themes are far removed from any message that there might be.What I would say finally about Juno is it's not for me and I'm not sure I'd recommend it given that it seems like the sort of film tat an easily annoyed person would hate, but I would say it's very stylish and cool. I can see why people like it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"An Adult Film For Teens, a Teen Film For Adults","A teenage girl gets pregnant, and considers her options. After turning down abortion (in an odd scene with Emily Perkins (""Ginger Snaps"")) her decides to give the child up for adoption. Hilarity ensues as we follow her misadventures as well as the relationship of her chosen adopted parents (played perfectly by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). This isn't Kirsten Dunst in ""15 and Pregnant"".I didn't know how to approach this movie, as I didn't know who the audience was supposed to be. Kids? Adults? It turns out the people who will love this most are fans of ""Dawson's Creek"" and ""Garden State"" most likely, as this film seems to be a blend of those two. The unrealistic (but enjoyable dialog) of Dawson, and the independent spirit of Garden State. And, thankfully, no Zach Braff. Just lots of fun pop culture references spoken by a kid with a grad student's vocabulary. (I really enjoyed the line about Morgan Freeman and the ""Bone Collector"" as well as the Thundercats reference, despite both being technically incorrect.) Surprisingly, it has little or no resemblance to ""Arrested Development"" despite having two of the stars in the picture (though never on screen together).The music was a strong point of the film, with the focus being Kimya Dawson and the Moldy Peaches. I'm not a big Kimya Dawson fan (my experience with her comes through a friend I can no longer call a friend), but this film sold me. The friend I watched it with was still pondering the next day whether Kimya is a genius or, to tone tone her language, a bunch of rubbish. I was leaning more towards a free spirit doing what she wants, not genius or rubbish, and I think that fits the main character in Juno, who is one of the most unique girls you'll meet.The best subplot for me was the relationship between Juno and Mark (Jason Bateman), which teeters between father-daughter and near-lovers. I really love how they worked music discussions into the film (Sonic Youth?) and the horror conversation -- what other film talks about Dario Argento and features ""Wizard of Gore""? Not sure about anyone else, but it hit home for me. That's the difference between a good and great movie, the power to resonate.As stated, fans of ""Dawson"" or ""Garden"" ought to see this. I think most people will like it (my mother did) but this group will like it best. The lead actress (Ellen Page, Kitty Pryde from the ""X-Men"" franchise) is going places (and I don't just mean starring in the new Sam Raimi horror flick).",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Juno"" has a baby and a heart for sure","""Juno"" is a 2007 indie film and it is about a 16-old-girl who has sex and gets pregnant. It is a good film and a great, emotional experience, with a good understanding of its characters and some rapid and funny dialogue.
Ellen Page is magnificent. She is badass, cool, relatable and nails the role.Her character was so fun to watch. Michael Cera was also great and quircky.
This film is quircky, risky and kind of touching and really easy-going at the same time.The script is good, though not perfect. The dialogue is clever and funny. There are a lot of funny references and details too. It just that two characters in the film were really weird. I am talking for the dudes who want to adopt the child. Almost every scene with them felt kind of weird, creepy and overall did not feet the tone. It might was bad writing or even some inconsistencies in the acting, but these scenes were my least favourite partof the film.The soundtrack is fine. It is ne of those soundtracks with a banch of unknown, slow, sweet song that fit the movie but feel all the same and I would have prefered if there was not a song in every single scene!Anyways, this film is definately not perfect, but it has a lot of good things and its lesson about self-discovery, relationships and love is nice and sweet. It is a touching, funny, rational and funky little film that feels kin of it's own messed-up thing. It's like an older version of Lady Bird or a sequel to ""The Perks of being a Wallflower"".It got me

"Juno reaches perfection, and keeps going.","Juno, written by stripper turned writer Diablo Cody is the story of a 16 year old girl, Juno, played by teen actress Ellen Page, who falls pregnant with her best friend Paulie Bleeker, played by teen actor Michael Cera.Juno decides to have a quick abortion, but when it comes down to it, she can't bring herself to doing it. With the help of her female best friend Leah, played by teen actress Olivia Thirlby, looks for advertisements for parents in the local newspaper.When Juno and Leah have been looking for a while, they see a photo and advertisement for a couple called Mark & Vannesa Loring, played by child star turned adult director Jason Bateman and Electra star Jennifer Garner, who have been looking to adopt and failed attempts for pregnancy.When Juno decides she wishes to give the baby to this couple she decides to go to their home to meet them, with her father by her side, Mac, played by J.K Simmons.Mark & Vannessa have a friendly and cosy home, with parts looking ultra modern. They live in a gorgeous neighbourhood, a surprise to Juno, who comes from a poor home with small homes.Juno is convinced she is doing the right thing by allowing these people to adopt her unborn child.Meanwhile, the story is showing how she is adapting to being pregnant with school life and how it has changed her life.This up-beat, quirky comedy drama is one of the year's best with outstanding performances by Ellen Page, not forgetting Allison Janney who plays her interfering step-mother. The movie won the Best Original Screeplay Oscar, a medal well deserved.The script is quick witted and is the best teen movie yet. Reason being, it's not patronising to younger people, it speaks the truth. Juno is sweet and kind with a bitchy layer, maybe hard to believe by the description but the opposite to Tina Fey's Mean Girls.This teen movie has more weight than most, breaks all stereotypes. Teen movies are traditionally about the popular kid in school finding love or going to parties. Juno is enjoyable, funny with plenty of parts young people like Juno will be able to relate to. With the lines Juno says ""Im in a fat suit I can't take off!"".Juno is a feel good movie which is a must see! The best movie, in my eyes, of 2007.

a marketing ploy,"Sadly after the success of such films as ""Napolean Dynamite"" and ""little Miss Sunshine"" the studios are attempting to market ""Indie"" as a brand. Those in Hollywood aren't stupid, they know that the less money they have to spend on a film in production the higher the profits if it pays off, however, what makes films great or charming that are small is that they aren't contrived to make 100 million dollars. The studios are attempting to bottle cuteness or preciousness, pass it off as original because a character drinks sunny d or chews orange tic tacs or watch out! has a hamburger phone! in order to fool the masses into believing that they are watching something fresh and original and those that disagree ""just don't get it"" or are ""haters"" however, the problem is not that people ""don't get it"", its that some people ""do get it"" and can see through this attempt at marketing a Twinkie like its moms homemade Apple pie. The entire film is so wrought with verbal prestidigitation that if anything resembling a true film were in there it was buried beneath cunning linguistic masturbation.Juno is the first movie of this kind, that is being marketed prior to wide release as a cult film. Shouldn't it be around for a bit before it's deemed cult or at least get a wide release into theaters? This insidious marketing ploy is an evolution of commercial advertising which is beginning to penetrate all forms of art and media and as long as people keep spending money and falling for this drivel they will continue to churn out plastic pictures under the illusion of art.This film wanted so badly to be something special yet the over written dialog and quirks stamped on the characters ruined what could have been a good story. Everyone tried too hard on this picture from the writer, director, to Fox Searchlight who has already stamped ""One doodle that can't be undid"" on t-shirts in an obvious and obnoxious attempt at creating dialog that will be echoed and reverberating in the high school halls of America like the latest Justin Timberlake album, who knows, maybe it will work, however I doubt something as saccharine as this will gain a cult audience but I was wrong with ""Garden State"" ""Napolean Dynamite"" ""Little Miss Sunshine"" to name a few, never underestimate the stupidity of the American public.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Something that we love for what it is,"This excellent film pulls off a trick that is harder to master in Hollywood than most people think, an original tale with enough bite to support its creative edge and plenty of heart to connect with even the most jaded in the audience. Most of its success comes from the lively turn by Elaine Page, a performer who can tackle a role better than 99% of her more famous contemporaries. She understand the dark side of comedy and how drama and comedy are, well, two sides of the same coin.In this delicious film, a pregnant teenager discovers that life can surprise all the time. She learns as her pregnancy becomes more and more evident how good her support system is, and her learning comes from observing the reactions of those people she is now interacting with. It might be her hypersensitivity, probably due to hormonal changes in her body, or it might just be that she is now forced to deal with issues in a more mature manner. Whatever the case might be, Juno learns to appreciate the best qualities in people, the diamond in the rough that she is, and she discovers that wisdom can only be achieved by careful application of her unexpected learning.Michael Cera and Jennifer Garner stand out in their supporting roles, but it's only fair to say that no one in this movie is not doing very good work. It is an ensemble piece, with plenty of heart and a sense of discover in material that we all thought we understood. These are complex issues and the resolutions are never by the numbers. Juno understand her uniqueness and has enough understanding of how far respect can go.2007 has indeed been a good year for movies, and it should be stated that great comedies don't come by so often.

Honestly, this movie never ceases to amaze me.

The story is unexpected, and has a real grit to it that so many people overlook. This movie was overall, very humble and simple compared to the very in-your-face movies that we as a society have become so used to. It has touched me in a way that no other story has, and it has done it in a very relateble, real outlook on life kid of way.

We were silent at the end,"I just saw Juno on a cold and dreary day. Theater a third filled, but that third almost all young girls, high school, late middle school, a few early college maybe, no older women, no older men. The movie is about a high school girl who has sex with her dorky boy friend, seduced by a chair she says, and the act is told in flashback as she tries again and again, with the Greek chorus of a convenience store clerk and customer, to make a pregnancy test change from positive to negative through sheer will and repetitive testing.It's one of those movies that touches your heart. With the actors speaking in a vernacular that rings true. Using language hidden from those beyond high school that is so descriptive and so natural that it makes TBHS (those beyond high school) think, for at least a second, beyond inherent cultural and age superiority, that true beings, as true as when they were in high school, actually walk the corridors and unlock lockers and have sex and become jealous and fall in love and make the same dumb mistakes that you made too. Juno the movie and Juno the person have true emotions, and show us real lives rather than the familiar dross of sit com exploitations, MTV reality shows, and adolescent sex comedies which appear with some regularity at our local multiplex.I remember experiencing what mass media said about my generation's life in high school when I was in high school. It wasn't even wrong. It was embarrassing and contemptible. They had no ear, no empathy, nor sympathy for what we thought or felt or were. Stories complete with glossaries of terms and definitions to hip their readership to what was today's teen world. Meretricious, utter crap.High school. Sex and love. Life. Situations requiring emotional understanding beyond one's age group, family, jutting up against adults trying to understand, wondering what is real and if love is real and if love can be forever...such is the stuff of Juno. You can argue, if in a cynical mood, that the language is too hip and too easy to the tongue of the characters, and that Dorothy Parker isn't a knocked up teenager in Minnesota in 2007, that Juno is as fictive as Jupiter's wife, but that would be missing the point of going to the movies.All of these characters are given the opportunity to live on the screen. I watched and wondered, not knowing, how much of this movie was the product of the screenwriter's life and how much of her imagination? It does not really matter, of course, but even asking such a question gives an indication of how good a movie Juno is.In most movies pregnancy and children are props or opportunities for one liners or just in the background. But, this movie isn't like that. In Juno, there are no big messages just the grand and glorious message that life is, that people live it the best they can, and that a good writer and a good director can use that big screen for small moments with big emotions and take the audience with them as Juno and her dad and step mom and best friend and boyfriend and surrogate couple get through nine months of her Junior year and summer.The audience laughed and sighed during the movie and there was a moment of silence as the screen went black as if we all wished Juno would stay around a little longer. Ellen Page, is wonderful, as much of a cynic as Joseph Gordon-Levitt in 'Brick', but like him as in all cynics, a thin protective veneer hiding the open heart of a romantic just below. Like all of us.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A great mix of the technical ingredients,"The movie presents us with a basic premise that sound somewhat common to the population in the western hemisphere, but it still sounds shocking for most of us here in the east. Nevertheless this kind of story startup point ignites viewers' curiosity of what will happen next. The movie nicely mix this with the dorky and goofy depiction of the focus characters, the really nice additions of comedy here and there, and some really nice twists and turns along the way. The movie nicely plays with the notion of viewer's anticipation of how it would wind up at times. I also really like how the soundtrack selection really completes the movie build up as its own taste. The songs really nail viewers' ears to the audio they are catchy in both lyrics and tunes. The acting overall is indeed worthy of an Oscar nomination at the least. Ellen Page nicely grasps her character and presents it, successfully deceiving viewers of her really age. Michael Cera is really comfortable with this kind of role so his performance doesn't seem that special. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney nicely adds up the crucial angle of the parents and Olivia Thirlby completes the whole set.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

good for drama students who are insane,"First and foremost this is not a comedy because it is not funny at all. There are attempts but they are all either understated (Cera) or overstated (everyone else).

I say that the groundswell audience for this movie is high school/college age student actresses/actors who like Ellen Page and Michael Cera (as have I) and regardless of what drivel comes out on the screen they will preen and heap accolades their way. Come on, this movie was terrible; much of the dialogue emanated from one of the rudest and quite surprisingly contrived teenagers in recent memory. I know many teenagers of all ilks and none of them act, talk or remotely resemble Juno, thankfully. You may say great, cutting edge, that's what were looking for, essentially though you may be out of your mind, nobody want's to be or have a world filled with teenagers that joke about drinking gallons of sunny d and taking pregnancy tests at a local convenience store, joshing with the all inappropriate clerk (stupid sequence), parents who allow their daughter to say whatever she want's to anyone and never ever, god forbid make a judgment! Juno is full of #*&!, she throws around hip names such as Soupy Sales, The Stooges and Mott the Hoople and it is quite realistic that a teen could have an affinity for these bands/people, although they are not related genre or era wise, so it seems forced, she is trying to be too cool. Do all you wannabe actresses really want to be knocked up and telling people off all the time? How about throwing up and then dumping Big Gulps down your supportive step mom's urn, come on! People keep comparing this movie to Little Miss Sunshine and Napoleon Dynamite and you know that's wrong. Those movies were funny, this flick was absurd as were the other two but unlike Napoleon and Sunshine this tormentor was without a real funny moment in the entire movie. This movie took a serious subject and took a talented cast and turned them all into a bunch of unlikable wise-asses including the transformation of Jason Bateman from a sincere adult to a possible molester in about fifteen minutes. You folks who are in the drama club and think that you have something here, take pause because the critics and fans of Ellen Page etc. may give this movie some awards for No Good Reason but if you buy into this drivel and try to emulate it, someday you may regret it.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Refreshing,"Hello Junoverse. Louise here reviewing what might be the greatest film of 2007. This film is witty, well written, and an overall charm to watch. Throughout the course of the movie, you will fall in love with the protagonist Juno (played beautifully by Ellen Page), and laugh at all the other zany characters in this film. And while they are quite off the wall, the level of realness is maintained. You never feel like you're watching a farce.I saw this movie at an advanced screening, and the whole audience lit up. Look out for a HILARIOUS cameo by Rainn Wilson and heartbreaking scenes with Jennifer Garner. You will laugh, cry and cringe at Juno.GO SEE IT NOW!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Comedy?,"I was hesitant to watch this film after seeing the leading male actor and hearing it was a comedy. I figured it was another teen movie that would be entertaining but have no significant plot to it. However, after watching this film, I cant understand how it was described as comedy. The little humor that was in it was cynical and sarcastic; not at all like a teen movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it was not at all what I expected.There were a very limited amount of actors and shooting locations, yet I never became bored or lost interest with the plot. This was a well written and well acted movie. I cant compare this film with any I have seen recently as it doesn't seem to fit into any genre. The plot was solid and interesting, there were plenty of humorous moments yet it always kept the overtone of the serious subject matter. Everything right down to the soundtrack was original and interesting; I strongly recommend it to anyone that is even remotely intrigued by the description. I am sure you will not be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Absolutely Fantastic,"I loved this movie. Plain and simple.The writing was excellent, there wasn't a single line that wasn't well written or unnecessary. It was well cast and well acted (and I don't understand why anyone found Ellen Page's voice annoying, or the acting to be stiff). The humor (though perhaps a bit 'unrealistic' as some have called it), was superb. The movie was touching and sad at all the right moments.This movie won't appeal to everyone. But if you don't try to make it an exact portrayal of unplanned teen pregnancy, and you can get over the fact that the writing isn't 100% realistic, you will enjoy it.A definite 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good story line,"Good story line. As for the much-touted dialogue, is it really any different than an average episode of Gilmore Girls? Not that there's anything wrong with Gilmore Girls, but would you give the writers of GG an Oscar? At least that TV show's improbable banter is in keeping with its light family drama. Even the logic of Cody's dialogue is flawed. It the confession scene with the parents, the girl thinks her father is asking who the baby is, rather than who the father is. If she were a ditz, the confusion would have some logic. Or even if the pacing or emotional pressure of the scene were at a real farce level, one might buy it. But the girl is bright, and the direction is naturalistic, and it just gives me that icky, phony feeling.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I should've brought a damn BOOK to the theater,"I don't feel completely comfortable being on the same planet with a race of beings that can actually generate this high of an average rating for such an empty waste of time.This is the most BORING piece of crap I've seen in a long, long time. I only chose it for 3 reasons: 1) it had Ellen Page, 2) J.K. Simmons, and 3) had a high IMDb rating of 8.4 at the time of this writing.A story about a teen getting pregnant, and how she deals with it- can't you do something with that premise? It's like the creators were more concerned with showing off their cool, modern dialogue they wrote for the movie, than the actual story itself. I was amazed at how many scenes could go by, and how much TALKING could be done by the characters, without anything interesting ever developing in the movie. I mean you literally have these scenes that go on for minutes, and it's showing all these inconsequential things that don't develop character or introduce the next beat to the story. I remember watching every scene and feeling like there was something that was about to happen, a lot of potential energy, but it goes nowhere. There were moments that were interesting to watch, like between Ellen Page and the lady's husband, which were well acted and genuine, but again, it's like the focus of these scenes are to show just how 'cool' these characters are, and it's at the expense of substance and realism.My 4 cents:**There's nothing worse than a movie that's supposed to be a comedy but not funny at all.**Cool, Ellen Page plays the same character she played in Hard Candy, even had the red hoody. That's where the comparisons stop between the two movies.**Jennifer Garner's facial reactions...failed. That was stupid and overdone. You got the camera showing her confused reactions and expressions to what Ellen Page was saying or doing, with this feeling that we as the audience are in the ""know"" of some joke, and her character is left out and doesn't get it, so we are laughing along with Ellen Page's character, except...there's no JOKE. There's nothing. So basically all you've got is this airheaded looking woman overacting and doing exaggerated contortions to her face, and it's just embarrassing and awkward.**The only pop culture reference that was missing out of this movie was the word ""Ebay."" Other than that they've covered it all.I should've just used the 10 dollars I spent on this worthless movie and just made a paper airplane out of it and tossed it right into the toilet.

Juno Really Heats Up ***1/2,"A really inspiring film despite the usual subject matter of an unwanted teen pregnancy.Ellen Page really gives a lot of herself in her Oscar nominated performance as a teenager in trouble.Fortunately, this girl has her head on her shoulders. She knows that she can't keep the child and is able to find what she thinks will be the ideal couple to adopt her baby. Unfortunately, the couple proves not to be what we're all expecting. It seems that Page has entered their lives just at a time when their very marriage is disintegrating rapidly.Ellen's father and step-mother play an understanding couple in this situation. I was a little perplexed regarding the stepmother part of Allison Janney. When hearing the news of Page's pregnancy, she begins to exhibit religious fanaticism that we saw her do so well on a comedy level in ""Hairspray.""

Juno ‚Äî A teen gets pregnant and goes off the beaten path for her happy ending,"Juno starts differently and ends the same way.The director gets us in right at the critical moment. Then the decision comes, and we're off into the thick of the movie. So, it's not about the decision, it's about making your own path.This is one of those movies that try to drown us in the ""perfect"" world of film making. We follow a small reconstituted family, that's not completely happy, but not at each other's throat. Everyone as flaws as well as qualities. All of the personas have depth, and layers, and you can feel it. The environment they live in is just as rich in details. The script is perfectly novel, the acting is great, without reproach, and the pacing just right.Ellen Page fits her role to a T. The unconventional teen who has thought, almost, everything through, with strong ideas, and a will to enforce it couldn't have been played any better. Jennifer Garner was born the be the perfectionist mom wannabe. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney are the perfect incarnation of the progressive yet simple blue collar parents.There are very few things I would criticize. The first one is the the teen lingo. It's appropriate, but heavily used. The second one is that all of those characters are pretty darn mature. I, for one, am very happy of this change of pace. It's like a balm after the so many face palm I've given myself while listening to your average Hollywood flick. The third and final one would be the slightly sappy music track. Not my style at all. As you can see all of those things are very inconsequential, and I must admit contribute to the flavor of the piece.It's a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A smile-and-tears inducing wonderwork,"A smile-and-tears inducing wonderwork full of endearing characters, emotional resonance, and, for me, inspiration for when I raise teenagers.At first, the supposedly hip dialogue seemed overwritten and thus grating, but about twenty minutes into th e film, I realized it had a purpose other than to set forth the movie's indie cred: to establish Juno, together with all the supporting characters, as unashamedly themselves. That character trait, together with its well-acted, not-overwritten portrayal of teenagers wrestling with a complex array of emotions and relationships (what teenager doesn't feel like they're wrestling with that), is why I like it (and Juno, the character) so much.A word about the soundtrack, which is selling briskly: It is thoroughly unimpressive, with the Kinks and Mott the Hoople samples coming across as overwrought as used in the film, and the Moldy Peaches offerings annoyingly undersung (like lots of acoustic indie music, I find). Perhaps high school in Minnesota sounds like this, but for me, it stands that the only musical highlight of the film is an affecting duet by the two main characters.Anyway, I love this movie, and I love its characters. Juno is my favorite among the 2007 films I've seen so far, with Ratatouille, 3:10 to Yuma, and Breach coming in as runners-up.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Are you kidding me?... Are you kidding me?!,"First let me start off by saying how appalled I am this movie made it to the top 250. No way what-so-ever. It's a shame my first post here need be a negative one..The film was funny, but it isn't THAT funny. A good portion of the 'jokes' are simply college kid fodder lines that feel like things your parents would say trying to be cool. The opening 5 minutes, in fact, was filled to the brim with such stomach churning dialog I almost wanted to leave. Thankfully it slowed down after that, though it managed to ruin the portion of the film after wards anyways.Oddly enough, every one of the supporting actors were my favorites! The quirky adoptive couple, the timid track boy, the supportive yet witty parents. No matter how much I tried to like Juno, which the film was 90% based around, the terrible writing she had to put up with from Diablo crashed her potential.Go see this film, it's entertaining and has a heart warming (though naive) message.

The ultimate comfort movie,"Juno holds a very special place in my heart. I think that I've seen it about a dozen times in my life, half of those times this year.To begin with, the aesthetic of this movie is just perfect. The cozy/indie kind of vibe fits the character's youthfulness and quirkiness. It catches you right away in the intro - a segment in which it goes from a ""sketched animation"" into real life again. I think that it is beautifully shot, simple yet pleasing.This movie deals with difficult and awkward subjects such as teen pregnancy, abortion, adoption, teenage relationships, supportive/nonsupportive parents and a lot more. Even though being packed with themes like these, it presents them in a light and humorous way which really suits the main character's, Juno (Elliot Page), mannerisms. The relationship between Juno and her love interest Bleeker (Michael Cera) is a bumpy road but will surely make you root for them in the end. Juno will crawl into your heart and stay there. Through the ups and downs of this movie you will go through stages of crying, laughing and feeling like a supportive parent.I will also say that the casting for this movie is beyond amazing, and every single character feel like they could be real own persons and not just created in someone's mind.Final words of this film: it is witty, cute and according to me, not contributing in glorifying teen pregnancy. It shows the more serious effects of getting pregnant at a young age and doing the ""right"" thing even during the difficult periods.Sidenote: orange tictacs.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Or in other words, is this a film that a an Adoptee, Adoptive Parent or Birth Parent could watch and appreciate without feeling overwhelmed by society's typical inability to portray these delicate issues with tact and fully acquired perspective? I appreciate films for their creativity and edge, but I have not yet found a film that not only creatively depicts the mentioned situations, but also accurately depicts them.I do not hope to open a battlefield forum, I am just hoping to pick the brains of those that might offer some helpful insight.

good but overrated,"Considering the reviews, the 8+ in IMDb ratings and the Oscar from the academy, I expected a lot of good from Juno. After seeing it, well it's not a bad movie but I've gone rather deceived about it.The strongest point in this movie is how the story flies from clich√©s; a teenage girl's pregnancy is carried naturally by everybody, and with no drama at all. The script is nice and funny, but I would not say worthy of an Oscar.The weakest point is how the story goes and ends. It is sweet, predictable, 100% ""a la Hollywood"". Absolutely politically correct. It could have derived in many interesting ways, but it did not. So it give us really very little surprise, controversy or anything that you could expect from an flick that we want to call as ""interesting"". Also a mention to the soundtrack; some people could think that it is ""beautifully minimalistic"", to me it is just a handful of poorly arranged Joan Baez-style songs made of four guitar chords. Actually, very poor stuff that adds little to the movie.Of course that conservative audiences, secondary school students (who liked American Pie and so), young mothers and people-who-lived-a-similar-experience-or-know-someone-who-did, will mostly love this movie. But sure these points of view will not be based on cinematographic arguments.Anyway it's still entertaining, funny, and sweet. So it is not bad at all.

I think I might want a hamburger phone,"I was familiar with Jason Reitman before ""Thank You For Smoking"", from his fantastic short film, ""In God We Trust"", which I caught at a film festival a few years back. I was a fan of Diablo Cody after seeing her on Letterman and buying her book Candy Girl: A Year In the Life of an Unlikely Stripper the very next day. And I knew all too well how great an actor Ellen Page was from seeing ""Hard Candy"", so ""Juno"" was a no-brainer for me ~ I was there the very first day it finally opened in my neighborhood.This is one of those rare films that actually lives up to and mightily surpasses its majestic hype, thanks to Cody's killer script, Reitman's sure-handed direction and a thoroughly captivating performance from Ms. Page, who manages to create a character we hadn't quite seen before but yet feel we know intimately by the end of the movie.Brilliant casting throughout, especially Michael Cera as Juno's true love Paulie Bleeker and J.K. Simmons as her father, but everyone here serves the production beautifully.The best thing about Cody's script is how specific the details about the characters are - she gives just enough to flesh them out, make them 3-dimensional without telling too much and losing the edge. And she makes all the right choices in the course of the story, for these characters, whom she clearly loves - just when we think it's going down a predictable road, we get something different. Brilliant choices for the music too - it's quirky and quietly understated, adding still another magical layer to this near-perfect and heartfelt winner of a film.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Teen Pregnancy Comes With Belly-Aching Laughs,"""It all started with a chair,"" is how Juno begins, like a Tom Robbins novel giving inanimate characters equal time amongst the human actors. It is with this simple line that the anthropologist of strippers turned blogger/journalist Diablo Cody launches the perfect screenplay, full of wit, empathy, heart and comedy.Not often enough, in a film of any genre, are movie-goers given such a treat as we are with Juno. The story unfolds itself with a rare continuity making the story as believable as it is funny. Every loose string is tied up neatly and a simple story takes on heartfelt, humorous complexity. The film's subject manner isn't that of the gut-busting comedy it becomes. Juno is the story and name of a sixteen-year-old girl (Ellen Page) who out of boredom seduces her awkward best friend, Bleeker. (Michael Cera of Arrested Development and Superbad) When pregnancy follows, she decides to carry the child to term, but offer it for adoption to a young couple of baby-craving suburbanites. (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) The performances are as spot-on as the writing, perhaps a nod to what a cast can do with such punchy dialog and a story with so much heart. Page stands out not only as the film's star, but as one who will surely rise in the business. Cera's sweetly dorky portrayal of Bleeker is subtle and effective. Garner for once proves that she has the acting chops of her celebrity status, and actually provides a much needed balance to more than one character. Bateman too seems more three dimensional than in past roles. As Juno's parents, J.K. Simmons and Alison Janney display a needed adult perspective piece to the story, while demonstrating ideal parenting skills. Director Jason Reitman (Thank You For Smoking) has hit a grand slam on his second trip to the plate. The ebb and flow of the film and visual portrayal of this story fit perfectly and without question. It's also nice to see a film where the indie-rock soundtrack actually compliments the story, aiding the development, and offering musical hook along the way. Though none of this properly sums up Juno, a film that will inevitably draw comparisons to Knocked Up and Waitress, yet out performs both on story, dialog and acting. --And for movie-goers who don't thrive on good story-telling, few movies short of The Princess Bride and The Big Lebowski are as quotable as Juno. While Juno doesn't officially arrive in theaters until January, advance screenings are occurring all over the country, with a special website promotion where fans can win a private screening as well as custom Gibson guitar. Not only do they offer a ground-breaking, highly creative film, but the marketing campaign seems to be at par with the product itself. Veering from witty to raunchy to heartfelt and wholesome, Juno accomplishes the impossible and works as all of these things at once. All screenwriters could learn a thing or two from Diablo Cody, and all movie goers will likely enjoy Juno, wanting to see it over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Gem of a movie,"Juno has been hailed as this year's Little Miss Sunshine, but to be perfectly honest Juno is ten times better than Little Miss Sunshine was. Little Miss Sunshine was funny, and off-the-wall and had a superb supporting cast, but underneath Juno's mouthy exterior lies a beautiful, charming, touching little film with quotable lines galore. It tells the story of Juno MacGuff, a sixteen year old who finds herself in a dilly of a pickle (Juno will have you saying those kinda things) when she discovers she's pregnant. Rather than have an abortion, she opts to put the baby up for adoption. I'm not going to discuss the plot in further detail because I don't want to spoil this gem of a movie for anybody. The film features an all-star cast, with the likes of Ellen Page, Michael Cera, JK Simmons, Allison Janney, the aforementioned Jason Bateman and Jennier Garner, Olivia Thirlby and a brief but glorious cameo from Rainn Wilson. Of course it's the film's lead Ellen Page who shines the most in this shiny little movie, giving an incredible performance as the witty, mouthy, lovable Juno. I hate to think what this movie would have been like had any other actress played the title role. Page captures the essence of Juno perfectly, and turns out a performance that has already earned her SAG and Golden Globe nominations, and surely will get her an Oscar nod, if not win. In Juno, teenage girls are given an alternative heroine, a tiny mouthy pregnant girl as opposed to the typical Hollywood teenage stereotype. The script is one of the most original ones I have ever come across, and minus a couple of cringeworthy lines/references ('Honest to blog!') it is set to become a reference point for anybody in the future sitting down to write an indie type movie. This isn't your typical indie movie, and it's not one that can only be enjoyed by freaky-deaky people who set out to find offbeat flicks. It's one that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, and is most definitely one of th best of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I intend to go back and see it again sans ""special effects,"" though I may never be able to keep a giggle down during some serious scenes where I recall seeing the whole boom in the scene.

A teenager gets pregnant and has to deal with the pregnancy. She is a bright and witty young woman and is nobody's fool. She marks out her own path for this pregnancy.Juno MacGuff (played by Oscar worthy Ellen Page),is the 16-year-old who gets pregnant following an experimental sexual encounter (initiated by her) with her best friend and high school track star Paulie Bleeker (played by Michael Cera).After flirting with the idea of an abortion, Juno decides on having the baby and giving it up for adoption to a couple Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) that have advertised in the local Pennysaver free paper. The scene where she breaks the news to her parents Mac MacGuff (J.K. Simmons) and step-mom (Allison Janney) just about brought down the house in the show I attended.Thanks to the brilliance of the script (By Diablo Cody) ""Juno"" is a stream of witticisms from beginning to end and the supporting cast are flawless in executing them.I found the underlying themes all coming to a satisfying fruition at the end. Every thread tied beautifully. There are many true emotional moments in the film and you are never quite sure where it is going. I was so glad it wasn't flawed by a hokey Hollywood ending.But it all belongs to Ellen Page in the end. Her brilliance as an actor is confirmed for once and for all. She is in just about every scene and plays Juno as a sharp, sassy, intelligent and decisive young woman. She is quick, smart and competent and everyone knows it. Great musical score also.Highly recommended. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
great movie!!,"This movie was so funny and original and different than all the trash that's in theaters today. It genuinely made me and all the people around me, young and REALLY old, laugh hysterically. The humor was perfect, but it was completely heartfelt too. Ellen Page and Michael Cera were wonderful! Ellen is so talented and pretty and just wonderful. She has a really great career ahead of her. The ending was sappy, but in a really good way. It wasn't like, well that just ruined the mood of the entire movie. It was perfectly executed. It's so completely and absolutely spot on about what adolescence and high school are like. The characters are so real, too. They touch on tons of important issues just enough not to put a damper on the whole film. I absolutely cannot wait until it comes and on DVD. I just wish there were more movies like Juno!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not to miss...,"To begin with, I want to put things on the table with the comparisons. Because this decade, we've experienced cases like ""Juno""; films that grow with time and suddenly are Best Picture contenders for the Academy Awards. Well, ""Juno"" is better than ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and much better than ""Sideways""; it surpasses the latter one on comedic and dramatic levels and, although it doesn't have 'Sunshine's' dramatic power, it features a more prominent collection of scenes and it has a script that's impossible to beat.I don't want to underestimate director Jason Reitman's delicate and inspiring job, but you can't deny there's something about Diablo Cody's first work that lies beyond explanation. If this writing seems more formal than usual, it's because Cody wrote the main character's lines with a noticeable level of superiority that is at the same time contradictory. Because Juno (Ellen Page) appears to know it all with the level of vocabulary I'm talking about, however when she gets pregnant she doesn't know what to do.And that's not all. Sixteen-year-old girls call their friends 'dude'-or at least Juno is one of them-and she has her fair share of code words that even the wisest teenager in the room may have trouble understanding; not to mention the fact that she listens to really heavy rock music and she dresses almost like guy. Yes, she's a freak, but not with the glasses and the weird dresses she describes in one of the film's many funny scenes (Cody's wonderful script includes a non-traditional form of narration by Juno that works perfectly); she's very pretty.When she discusses the reason of her pregnancy with her best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby), she mentions who the father is and makes obvious that she feels something for him. If you know comedy and romance, you will expect a certain number of exact, by heart phrases that the best friend would use in that moment. She uses none of them, and it's beautiful. So when we 'meet' the father in another great scene, we fully understand that Juno is 'special'.Special as a couple; Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman in two fantastically unexpected portrayals) think she is, when they meet her because she wants to 'give' them her baby. That scene, how Juno constantly refers to the baby as ""the thing""; how she ends up playing the guitar with Mark; the rest of the scenes she shares with him in which, among other things, she tells him he's a big 'sellout'; and my favorite moment of the film are pieces of a well-rounded, multidimensional character we are not used to see in a comedy.And Ellen Page? She hands in a masterclass; a bliss of understanding of character and of sheer honesty, a better performance than Julie Christie's in ""Away From Her"". She has that light; the light of a true talent; the light I saw when I first watched Winona Ryder in ""Reality Bites"" and made me want to watch all of her films (I have almost completed the task). And of course Page also has that look; the look that says ""this is no game"". When it comes to performance, this movie is hers and nobody else's.And I haven't even mentioned the scene where she gives his father and stepmother (J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney), and how they react and the advices they give here in that moment and in so many others; or the multiple film references in Cody's script and the fact that it has clearly remained untouched. I really want to detail many scenes, but instead I'll just tell you which one's my favorite (there's plenty to choose), so you can pay attention: the moment near the end where one character's running and Juno walks to him¬ÖThat moment, that scene.It has been said, but the unchangeable truth is Reitman and Cody do something many movies try unsuccessfully these days: aim directly at the heart¬ÖThey don't miss. I hope I said all I had to say.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Juno"" delivers as a good , unique, and fun movie, but it's disappointingly not worth all it's received hype....","I watched this movie with very high expectations. I believe everybody did. Who wouldn't after Roger Ebert, and every critic, raved about it, it's barely even received a bad review from the general public, and it was nominated for an Oscar? Me on the other.... I was actually disappointed. Do I think it was good? Yes. Do I give them credit for the ""unique-ness"" they put into the movie? Absolutely. But it just wasn't worth it's hype. I'm just gonna say that much. Seriously, don't watch it with high expectations. I know it's extremely hard not to with all the wonderful rave reviews about it, and then you see my little nobody review, but really.... some people will be disappointed. I think the ""unique-ness"" factor, and the fact that it was fun to watch, is why I liked it. Sorry, but not worth the hype. Oh and plus I really didn't think the ""jokes"" were all that funny.

Come on, face it, it doesn't have anything to do with reality, there are MUCH worse movies than this one out there, both technically and from artistic point of view.Evrybody is dying to point out how it's ""not realistic"", how it's ""a serious subject""... Well, this movie deals with a serious subject in a different way. It's kinda simple, you don't know if you'd rather laugh or cry, it's childish, she's a stupid depressive indie teenager yes, it has many flaws, yes... but why always look for flaws and seriousness and reality... The hype is cause this movie GAVE something to people, to us, we FELT something...something SO simple, and innocent, and sad, and full of life... Why care about anything else? It's wrong to think that it's pro-life, I don't think it tries to gives a message of any kind, and certainly it's not trying to preach or tells you what to do with your life.

Great movie...,"""Juno"" is a movie in which we have a teenage girl who get pregnant and we watch her how she deals with this issue. We also watch how her relationships between people change and how different opinions has as the time pass by.I liked this movie because it gives us many messages about a lot of topics which are currently issues of nowadays. Also I have to say that the interpretation of Ellen Page who played as Juno MacGuff was really good and I can compare it with her interpretation in ""Hard Cndy"". Another interpretation that I liked in this movie was Michael Cera's who I have to admit surprise me. For one more time J.K. Simmons who played as the father of Juno (Mac MacGuff) was really good as I expected him to be.Laslty I believe that ""Juno"" is a good movie that everyone have to watch and of course I recommend it. With this movie you can watch and think about many topics that we have nowadays and reconsider your opinions about those.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Baby Blues?  Not in this movie ...,"""Juno"" really is as smart and as sweet as all the hype, its Oscar and a slew of nominations says it is. I suppose you could say it's the teen chick flick that isn't, as Diablo Cody's sassy and grown-up script serves a series of one-liners that might just be beyond most teenagers, both in the audience and on the screen. Cody may be a former 'exotic dancer' and this may be her first script but don't feel inclined to pre-judge her as some sort of novelty act; brainless, she ain't. Most people by now will know it's the story of Juno, pregnant at sixteen from the opening frame, who decides not to have an abortion, (a moral choice but made on the flimsiest of motives), but gives the baby up for adoption instead, (again on the flimsiest of motives).Again, if anything, the movie, however well-written, feels peculiarly like real life. The direction of Jason Reitman is unobtrusive; there are no 'big moments'. If, for the most part, people behave a little too nicely towards each other, their lives are no less messy for all that and the trajectory isn't necessarily conventional. And like the best independent films it doesn't fall into the trap of trying to please its audience and pull them in; it just does.It is, of course, blessed with the performance of Ellen Page in the title role. This is a wonderfully focused performance, easy-going and natural; that it seems effortless may be down to the slack which Reitman has allowed her or simply to the quality of Cody's script but whatever, Page is a star in the ascendant. But then all the performances have a wonderful natural quality to them; even the most unsympathetic characters, the adoptive parents, bear the brunt of Cody's scrutiny. Let's hope her Oscar isn't the kiss of death as I certainly am looking forward to seeing what Diablo does next.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Growing up backwards,"An immature Juno finds herself pregnant and decides to keep it. Funny most of the way but you will find your funny bone not working at the end not because the characters have changed, its because they haven't. Deals with the complexities of growing up and love.

"no heart, no soul","First, the script is third rate. Cody the Stripper thinks that creative writing is non stop teen sarcasm that most of the time isn't funny or biting like sarcasm should be but just....(I screamed did you hear it?) That is what this movie is, white noise with no heart and no soul.Juno is a teenage bitch. She isn't funny. She isn't clever. She isn't a sympathetic character.I could run down the list of copied work this film ""borrows"" from but who is going to care? Once again audiences are throwing money at a movie that doesn't deserve their attention for reasons I don't comprehend.The direction is OK. The acting is OK. But the script is awful. AWFUL! It is amazing that some movies are so clich√©d and so formulaic but critics and fans latch onto them like they are groundbreaking classics, while other movies who have a smattering of both are roundly panned although they are worthier films. No accounting for taste I guess.Just to get this off my chest: Jennifer Garner can't act, period. She is a charmless, soulless, Hollywood creation. Her expressionless visage, Predator sized forehead, and nice behind may have worked well on the trite and equally soulless ALIAS but it doesn't work on the big screen. From her attempt at remaking BIG (dumb going on dumber--or was it 13 going nowhere), to the should have been career killing ELEKTRA, to the god-awful hackathon the KINGDOM, I think we've seen enough of Ben Affleck's Bennifer2. Maybe she should try directing. Affleck is much better behind the camera than in front of it. And Jason Bateman is like Michael Pare or Jean Claude Van Dumb, if they are the best actors you can get then the script wasn't worthy of a real actor even considering the part.My dollar forty-seven.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This movie is numero JUNO,"As far as independent films go, this is one of the best I've seen. One of the greatest things about this movie is how closely it depicts reality. All of the characters are just so real. Juno herself has such a likable personality and the audience falls in love with her almost instantly. Michael Cera's character doesn't have enough screen time as I anticipated but his role suits him perfectly. I wouldn't classify this movie as a comedy, but it is the type of movie that will make you smile at parts, and you will leave with a smile on your face. I saw 5 movies over my Christmas break, and I would say that Juno is the best movie that I saw. I would have to say that JUNO is the surprise of the year!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Guarteed to smile,"Deservingly, this film has been nominated for four Oscars including best picture (maybe) and best leading actress (hopefully) for Ellen Page, and it also has confirmed her status as one of America's best new talents. She is one to watch.First of all it was nice to see a proper title sequence and not just a crappy title in the corner, but that has nothing to do with the greatness of this film. The basic story is about a sarcastic, cynical, tomboyish teen played by Ellen Page called Juno MacGuff, who has sex with her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera of Superbad). This gives her an unwanted gift, in a form of a baby. Woops.Juno decides to give her baby to what seems to be a perfect couple of Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). It seems to be going smoothly at first but there bumps on the way to the birth.Juno has a strange affect on you when you leave the cinema; the first reason is the fact that you couldn't ask for a better written story that makes you smile so much thanks to Diablo Cody, and secondly you feel that you could walk out of the cinema and you could see Juno MacGuff just standing there, as if she were a regular living, breathing teenager. That's how good Page is. In fact every single performance in this film is brilliant. It was good the way that Allison Jenney character of Juno's step mum, Bren isn't like average whiny she-demon like most step mums portrayed in films, she's far friendlier than you would expect. J.K. Simmons finally gets a role where he isn't a total jerk; instead, he's a sensitive father who truly cares for his wacky daughter. Some of the characters of this film may start off a little un-likable but nearly all turn out extremely likable.Another fact of this film that I normally take no notice of is the sound track which is just perfect, as I like songs with good words; I might actually go out and buy it.I don't think I have ever smiled (not laughed) at a film ever, only Little Miss Sunshine comes close. This film is also very funny with loads of witty lines shooting out of Pages mouth all the time. This really is a wonderful film.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I might have given it higher had I seen it some years ago, I think it was very fitting its time and captured the way life would/could be at that time, if you where a pregnant teenager with a strange boyfriend as the father that is :)It was greatly entertaining and funny, both Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody made this something special, and the characters and the actors playing them had something special and fitted their roles perfectly. This is a teenage comedy that should be watched and gives interesting moments and intelligent feedback to the characters in it and the watchers seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Perfect characterizations.,"At the end of the film I noticed that I was not feeling any emotional burden of anger or outrage that is normally associated with movies full of nasty characters giving our heroes a hard time. There was just a feeling of humbleness and tranquility. I wondered why and then realized that there was not one nasty character in the whole movie, (yes, the ultrasound technician came across with a streak of nastiness only because of her ignorance). I mean, ever character had flaws, like all of us who just stumble through life in hope of getting to the other end of it all, where ever it is! The success of this movie came down to the brilliant written characters and their portrayal by a superb cast. The writer respected each and every character and gave them a life of their own. This could not have been achieved by the perfect choice of casting.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The best movie I've seen in a long time,"""Juno"" is about many things: love, need, integrity, commitment, family, parenthood, sex, oh and a tiny 16 year old girl who finds herself pregnant in small town America.If Ken Loach had made this kind of movie, I'd have been slitting my wrists by the 22nd minute, consumed with angst and the inevitable bleakness of the human condition.But this is written by a woman who christened herself Diablo Cody and who manages her image like a Letterman monologue (she worked as stripper in preference to her job at an ad agency and has two wonderful quotes about writing and writers: Stripping toughened my hide, but exposing myself as a writer has been a lot more brutal.I have never been an ambitious person, and my participation in this industry is a fluke, but only male writers can afford to be coy and self-deprecating.) so it is hip without being glib and optimistic without being candy-coated.Just reading the script for this movie would have lightened my heart and stretched my smile but the movie adds indie music, cool animation, perfect timing, and an ensemble cast that take no prisoners.And then there's Ellen Page. I'm more than a little in love with Ellen Page. She knows how to sell an emotion with small changes to her facial expression but she never seems to let technique get in the way of emotional honesty. Page is small, with a large head and a wide mouth and eyes that take in the whole world. She looks 16 (she was 20 when the movie was made) and, although she is brave and independent and almost compulsively witty, she carries across that only-partly-formed-and-still-very-vulnerable state that makes being a teenager so emotion soaked.I first saw her last year in ""Hard Candy"" where she plays a 14 year old who thinks she encountered a internet predator and sets out to deal with him. I switched the movie off, not because it was bad but because it was so raw I couldn't cope with it.I hope the movies does well at the Oscars. I wish Cody Diablo well with her up and coming ""United States of Tara"" series and I am absolutely certain that I will see every film that Elen Page takes part in.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The zipless pregnancy - a modern morality myth,"Let's face it - Juno gives basically the same message as the Oprah movies, ""Where the Heart is"" and the slightly better dressed up ""Waitress"". Despite, the outward Napoleon Dynamite trappings and Grey's Anatomy-chic music, this is really a Lifetime morality tale. The reason for all these films is to promote the idea of the alternative to abortion, and to make it as palatable as possible. They exist to sell the myth of the ""zipless"" pregnancy, one with no consequences.In the Walmart movie, and ""Waitress"", helpful god-fearing people magically appear to provide money and support so that the single mom can go to school or open a pie baking shop. To anyone north of the Mason-Dixie, under the age of 40 who goes to church less than regularly, these films are laughable. To reach these people, Juno simply avoids the mess and basically just ignores any of the real problems involved in pregnancy while dressing up the process to make it look ""cool"".However, the ""edginess"" is forced and phony and very much on the surface. Our hip adoptive parent who likes slasher movies and grunge, is really just another ""Lifetime"" caricature - the-irresponsible-man-boy-possibly-creepo male, to be exact. The father is well-meaning and loving and the best of all Lifetime male archetypes - the unquestioning-supporter (after all a 16 year old female knows more than any 45 year old male could...). And our protagonist is that ultra-cool misfit girl who thinks she knows everything and actually does know everything (including who ""Soupy Sales"" is). She is so savvy that although she is a punk hard rocker - she also loves acoustic alternative folk. She also has a geek boyfriend - another unquestioning-supporter male - who looks like Napoleon Dynamite. The dialog is forcedly sharp - with vocabulary that a 25 year-old poseur might have used in the 80s (""boss???"").The morality play avoids the truly difficult questions: the emotional attachment to the child, the responsibility and feelings of the father and his family, the ostracism of a pregnant teen. These are brushed away as are the alternatives of keeping the baby, adoption by family members and of course ABORTION (legal, ethical and not a dirty word last I checked) which is treated as something gross for uncaring stupid people. And does our heroine learn to use contraceptives afterwards - no - condoms are grotty purple things for people with funny piercings not named Iggy Pop. She's so cool that she'll just abstain until she's ready.Ugh. I prefer, honest manipulative films like ""Reefer Madness"" to subversive manipulative crap like ""Requiem for a Dream"" or ""Juno"". It's not that I don't support the option of having the baby but it definitely is not zipless and has consequences which can not and should not be ignored. Things are not going to be the same - they are not going to work themselves out - no kind stranger is going to raise the kid for you or give you a million dollars and a job. Teens understand this - better than the ""boss"" parents and clueless critics that will make this film a hit.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

But since it was up for best picture, we decided to go see it before the awards tomorrow and I am glad we did. For me, it was the best picture I have seen this year. It is by far the best written movie of the year and all the actors were just brilliant. It just goes to prove that if you give actors a great scrip and good direction; they will do a good job. After all this time, I even liked Jenifer Garner. Unlike other teen movies, the adults were a major part of the story and were portrayed with depth and real human characteristics. I highly recommend this movie for all teens and even for all adults who may think they have already seen too many high school films.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Brilliant!,"This is not one of the best films of the year - personally I think it's one of the best films ever made!

Stupid end,"The movie was great and very good made, the actors are playing terrible good but the end is really stupid.

More friends, Lorenzo and Gratiano also try and fail. Antonio's friend, Bassanio, informs him that he intends to seek the wealthy Portia's hand in marriage, yet needs financial backing. Antonio, though reluctant, offers Bassanio 3,000 ducats (money) to help him. At Belmont, Portia's house, she laments to her servant, Nerissa, that she fears a suitor she dislikes will pursue her hand in marriage. Per her late father's will, the suitor must choose the correct of three chests (gold, silver, and lead), and then, if correct, he may marry Portia. She likes none of her six suitors, but wishes Bassanio would come and choose the correct chest. Back in Venice, after much begging, Bassanio convinces the merchant Shylock the Jew to lend him 3000 ducats, with Antonio putting up his property as the bond. Although Shylock hates Antonio, he lends the money anyway, hoping Antonio will default on the loan.

My new favourite movie,"Juno is, in one word, unexpected.I've read that this is a ""comedy"", but to me it's more like a real-life drama. The funny bits come from the ""real life"" part of this great film and the witty dialogue. Some parts are funny without even trying to be. But because of the subject matter and the way it's dealt with, I wouldn't classify Juno as a comedy (unlike Knocked Up, which dealt with a similar pregnancy plot but was undeniably a comedy).Now for the review. As I said, I was blown away by this film. The characters are so likable. I really like that Paulie Bleeker, for all his ""awkwardness"" and seemingly uncool looks, is the guy Juno chooses to love. It just shows that love is blind, and there really are great guys out there once we look past their shy or unassuming exterior. I also loved Vanessa - she was played perfectly as the wannabe-perfect person, but as the film goes on we realise that all of that is just nervousness and fear of disappointment, and that she really just wants a baby. But the real wowser is Juno herself. Ellen Page is wonderful. She portrays Juno's tough exterior wonderfully, but sometimes in her face we can just see all the emotions behind and that she's really only trying to be brave.There's a wonderful plot twist in this movie, which I had genuinely not anticipated and which proved to be the difference between a good film and an awesome film.Needless to say, I cried loads in the last twenty minutes (also because I could REALLY relate to the story).All in all, Juno is one of my new favourite movies of all time.P.S. The soundtrack is different - but pleasant - too, helping craft the uniqueness of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Knocked Up,"Like all crowd-pleasers rather too soft in the end and a tad too witty and quirky to be thoroughly believable, but still miles ahead of all those abominably crass and vulgar teenage comedies Apatow style that are constantly fabricated by the Hollywood machinery.The main assets are the well-paced screenplay, that finds a nice balance between laughter and more serious moments, and a wonderful ensemble cast led by charming Page.There's real emotional resonance in between all the cleverly staged comedy situations.7 out of 10 mailboxes filled with Tic Tacs",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A good movie, but the dialogue may be a deal-breaker for some.","Juno is just fun, and a pleasure to watch. It's not going to change anyone's life or make a big, important statement, but I haven't seen many movies that are more enjoyable. It's pure charm through and through.Sure, the dialogue is a little over-the-top at times, but this isn't a documentary. Once you get used to it, it starts to feel right to hear these characters talking this way. Like it's a necessary part of this quirky world that Diablo Cody has created.This has to be the most twee story about teen pregnancy ever written, and you won't enjoy the movie if you cannot accept that fundamental fact. Juno requires a healthy amount of off-beat sensibilities from its viewers, and in return, it will charm the pants right off of you. Seems like a fair bargain, to me.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good film,"Good film. I think what only slows the film down is the near forced relationship between Page and Bateman that grows as the film goes on. I understand its importance to the film and understand why it is here, but I just think they play it a little too loosely and way too longish to make it feel as worthwhile as it needs to be. The two work off of each other well, yes (although not nearly as well as Page and Cera, or even Bateman and Garner), but the dialogue and scenes between them just sound like an afterthought, and do not seem in sync with the rest of the film. They have the humour, they have the references (maybe a few too many), but they just do not jive nearly as solidly as they should. Maybe a little less focus on these scenes, and more with the likes of Cera (who is not underused, but probably could have been used a bit more) or Simmons or Thrilby (who are not used nearly enough) could have helped make the movie even better than it already is.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
16 year old girl learns she's emotionally immature and not ready to be a good parent,"I needed a light-hearted movie to see so I picked this one. The music soundtrack was great! Also, I thought the movie did a good job in showing another side of a 16-yr. old girl getting pregnant...that it really is a lot to handle emotionally, even if you're physically ready to have a baby. As a 16 yr. old, you are inexperienced in knowing who you are and what people insinuate from your actions. Ellen Page was fresh and I enjoyed watching her on screen. The script was hilarious! Diablo Cody was great in thinking up of a story that has been told a thousand times (young girl getting pregnant, too young to raise baby), but she twisted the story from a humorous viewpoint that was very enjoyable and different to watch on screen!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good,"This is another level of film, heartfelt and riveting from the first frame to the last. The characters in this film have a lot of depth. Faced with an unplanned pregnancy, an offbeat young woman makes an unusual decision regarding her unborn child.

Over-rated,"The mark of a wonderful film or novel is it's ability to take an ordinary story or situation and transform it into something remarkable and touching. Similarly, ""Juno"" attempts to take the increasingly common event of teenage pregnancy and weave a cutesy little spiel around the whole shemozzle.Unfortunately it doesn't quite get there. Ellen Page displays a mountain of talent, but frankly her character's constant sarcasm, schoolyard-slang, not to mention the attention-seeking ""individualism"" are quite irritating. Of course the kid's heart is in the right place but who does she think she is? Do we care? The script is razor-sharp and riddled with witty one-liners but it's a little hard to justify a feature-length film on dialogue that may have been better suited to a comic strip.Add to this some very misguided messages about sex, love and marriage, and a jumble of 1-dimensional characters (Michael Cera: the sweet dork you do so well is getting old) and you have a movie that is vaguely entertaining but ultimately unsatisfying.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
sassy sweet and smart,"this is my kind a film! its a little nerdy and witty smart... characters are all so well done and very real... i don't think i blinked the whole movie. It is so nice to see a powerful movie where hot sexiness and the power of money NEVER enter the movie. The topics were serious and thought provoking, but Juno takes us by the hand and walks us through her frank perception of life. Every hero has to get through the trial of life, and the heroes do get through the trials with resolve, wit sarcasm, emotion and and and move on in the world. Maybe I liked it because i saw my self in it and wished i could have fared as well as any of the characters in there... in their normal, happy, middle class suburban multi cultural broken and repaired family life. and the sound track was great too. I should give it a 10, not sure why not.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Funny, sweet, touching......excellent movie.","Last year's ""Knocked Up"" was thought of by many as a hilarious look at the unintentionally pregnant woman. Juno beats that movie in every way. It's funnier, it's sweeter and has more emotion. Obviously these two weren't meant to be compared, but it deserves a small comparison, in which Juno wins hands down.Juno (Ellen Page) finds out she's pregnant, and knows right away she wants to give the baby to a nice home. She finds seemingly perfect couple Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) to give the child to. Juno also has trouble with her baby's father, and her father and step-mother. The way this movie is done is very unique. The humor comes from the witty choice of words, and not so much from the jokes themselves. The drama, like the humor, is somewhat subtle at times, but it's obviously there, and is one aspect that made this a great movie. The switches from comedy to drama were smooth. The plot was good, as were the characters. Many of the characters had similar ways of speaking making it sound like they were the same character, but it really wasn't bothersome at all.I highly recommend you check this one out. There's not much to dislike about it, but there is quite a lot to love.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins. PG-13 for sexual humor and language.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Michael Cera and Jason Bateman,"A teenage movie about pregnancy, music, Certs, and oh yeah pregnancy. None of that teenage melodrama you usually expect. Instead boy wins girl, its girl wins boy - after being knocked up by boy and giving up child for adoption. Yeah, not your normal teen movie.Anyway Ellen Page plays the knocked up teen girl that had relations with Michael Cera. Since she doesn't plan to keep it, she plans on giving the child to Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner. Yet, it almost completely falls apart.Its funny since Bateman and Cera were both on ""Arrested Development"" on Fox a few years back, so apparently they have some chemistry. And Ellen Page? Well I don't know.Anyway, Page it pretty funny with her absurd wacky humor. So give it a try while eating Certs. ""B""",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great movie..reminds me of Ghost World,"what do you think? In both movies:-Main Character is an outsider-type girl -Live with dad and his girlfriend/new wife -Were fond of late 70's punk -Were introduced to new music by an older mentor/romantic figure (sort off in Juno..she put on lipstick and checked her self before going in and having a prego slow dance -Had a cheerleader type best friend -Quirky, witty lines (in my opinion) I thought it was a great movie, bittersweet, but still with plenty of laughs and a little plot twist to boot. I understand that some aren't fans or this type of film. I personally wish there were more movies out there like this, but that is I guess what makes them so special",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Juno,"Juno was a really good original romance/drama/comedy. It really captures a nostalgic high school setting with different social circles and high school pregnancy. Stemming from all of that, there was a really good story throughout and it was weirdly engaging and interesting. There was something endearing and sweet about the characters and story overall. It also had some really funny one liners and moments throughout. Definitely a good watch for anyone. IMDb needs to get rid of these damn character limits for movie reviews. It's not practical for a common movie watcher and reviewer! Fix it now!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
a memorable piece of cinema,"I've come to expect good things from Fox Searchlight, but this was remarkable even for them. This film will leave you with a good feeling despite its involvement with sobering subject matter. There is no situational comedy in the film, but the dialogue is witty enough to catch a seasoned moviegoer off-guard. You will find yourself laughing involuntarily as the mundane line you expected turns into something quite eccentric. The writing lightens what would otherwise be a very depressing movie--a difficult task. Ellen Page and J.K. Simmons steal the show with masterful,emotional, timeless performances. Ears perked in the theater when there was interaction between these two powerhouse actors. Page leads you through her struggles in the way only a gifted actor could. Michael Cera delivers his unique style perfectly. Cinematography of fall colors is as dark and beautiful as a painting in motion and suggests, ""this is the good stuff, memories are made here.""",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Social issues are pictured with cheerful daily life.,"I like the opening animation. I was surprised. This movie contains so many themes like teenage pregnancy, anti-abortion movement, adoption, divorce, economic inequality, etc. And LGBTQ+, Asian advocacy. It was predicting trends for 2021. Elliott's natural acting is excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Year's Best,"It is rare when a movie stays with me for longer than a week. However, in the case of Juno, almost two weeks later, it's the only movie I care to see or even discuss.First, Ellen Page may very well be one of the greatest young actresses today. Her award buzz is greatly warranted with her star-making turn as the title character. I'll be surprised if she doesn't win the Golden Globe, and earn an Oscar nomination.Secondly, the screenplay written by Diablo Cody is award worthy. The dialog is real, witty, and fun. I'll also be surprised if she does not win the Globe, and I feel she'll win the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.Finally, the movie itself is feel-good. I think it will win the Globe for Best Picture-Comedy or Musical, and most certainly will be nominated by the Academy for Best Picture, if not win.As I previously stated, it's rare when a movie affects with me this greatly. Not only has it become my number 1 movie of 2007, it has become number 1 on my all-time list.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Juno is neither amusing nor touching,"There's many problems with Juno, no matter where you stand on the teen pregnancy issue, that it shocks me how well this movie is being received. Much of it could do with the tone set by the script and director; is it a comedy? No, despite the supposed ""hip"" cultural references and wisecracks there are very few laughs to be found in this film. Is it a drama? Only if you consider awful made for the Lifetime television network films moving because that's the level of the writing here. The talented young actress Page tries to make the most out of the pseudo John Hughes meets Gilmore Girls lines she's given but it just doesn't work. Instead the Juno character comes off as though she may need serious psychiatric help, but don't worry because she's so cute and funny we'll be able to overlook her warped adolescent world view, or so the people behind this movie want us to believe.I never bought it for a second. Outside of Page and the neat opening credits (for some reason director Reitman has a way with opening credits like in his previous cinematic turkey Thank You for Smoking...and little else) this movie is cringe inducing cutesy poo movie-making at its worst. The parents of Juno are right out of any John Hughes teen dramady from the eighties while the couple looking to adopt Juno's child are strictly paint by the numbers suburban zombies, especially Jennifer Garner's painfully clich√©d wannabe mother. The rest of the cast from Juno's high school friends to the secondary characters that pass in her life are equally uninteresting. For some reason this movie is being compared to last year's sleeper Little Miss Sunshine but if you go and see Juno don't expect anything that good.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A touching film,"Juno is an excellent example of filmmaking that I consider to be one the best films of the decade. Everything is done right with movie. The actors all do a good job, the writing is great, the jokes are funny, and the emotional stuff does work. It really is one of those special little movies that comes out of nowhere and surprises you. I also really liked the soundtrack for the film. The ending with where the two characters are singing along with each other is such a great scene made even better by the great song they are singing. Juno is the pure definition of what a sleeper hit is. Nobody knew what it was when it came out, and in the end people were talking about it. This film hits all the right notes.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Whoamygodz fun.,"I am in love with this movie. My girlfriend dragged me to go see it and, after watching ""Hard Candy"" and ""Superbad"", I wasn't expecting anything too enjoyable. I mean, Hard Candy was too dark and Superbad was just too stupid for my taste you know? It really does take a LOT for me to fall in love with a movie. With a quirky dialog, fantastic music, down-to-earth storyline, and a heart warming feeling at the end, Juno left me smiling long after I left the theater. Take it from a guy who hates Chick-flicks, hates almost all mordern day comedies, and is EXTREMELY picky about movies: this is one movie you CAN take your loved on to and you BOTH will have a good time!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Overrated, still nice","A nice enjoyable movie.The good thing about this film is that the pregnancy of adolescent Juno, around which the film revolves, is not treated in a judgmental moralistic way. It just happened and Juno deals with it her way, which is a little bit odd, as she is. It is truly rare that such a big issue, as teen pregnancy is, is treated in such a fresh and open minded way. That's great.The dialogs, especially Juno's and the ones she has with her parents, are excellent, but the script shows up and downs regarding the story in general and the dialogs of other main characters. The roles of the future adoptive parents are stereotypical and predictable, although respond to human reactions that we find in real life.The performance of the supporting actors here is excellent, and both the actors playing Juno's father and step mother are great, sincere and believable in their roles. The same re the actor who plays Juno's boyfriend, who I found adorable. The roles of the adopting couple are not that good, and the performance of Jennifer Garner and the actor who plays her husband are mediocre, sometimes over the top, which unbalances the overall tone of the film.Ellen Page is a talented young actress, and her quirky character goes well with that quirkiness she has as a person. I think that her nomination for an Oscar was excessive as her performance in Hard Candy was far better and more complex and demanding and she was not nominated. But she definitely has talent.I loved the little songs that percolate the whole film and the golden tones, which welcome the viewer into a warm story, family and characters.However, reviews and critics have overrated a movie that time will show did not deserve a 9!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
