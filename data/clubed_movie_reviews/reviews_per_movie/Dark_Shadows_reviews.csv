Empty Darkness,"Tim Burton is probably one of the best choices to direct a Dark Shadows movie. He's always good at making Dark, Gothic films and everyone's expecting it to be something like Sweeney Todd and Sleepy Hollow. Instead, it has a hybrid of Corpse Bride and Beetlejuice. It begins with decent gloominess but the rest is scattered with groovy soundtrack and colorful images. But that may not be the problem. It's actually pretty good at recapturing the 70's. The main problem is the plot development. It's fun but also disappointing.It looks promising in the beginning. Tim Burton uses his campy directing style which made the intro intriguing. It get silly when Barnabas returns from his grave. Exploring the changes of his town. It's quite funny and delightful. There's a good character development in this that made it entertaining. Johnny Depp gives a delightful performance as Barnabas Collins. Eva Green is quite menacing as Angelique. Jackie Earle Haley and Helena Bonham Carter are the extra comic relief. Chloë Moretz is always good at bad girl roles.There's a lot of fun going on, but in the end, the experience feels like something's missing. It could have been an interesting story but it ends pretty lazy. There are couple of senseless twists that aren't consistent. At least there is something good in the filmmaking. The production design is quite decent and sometimes unlikely colorful. Postmodern music are played often which made Danny Elfman's music score hard to notice. But these merits can't fix the film's storytelling.Dark Shadows is undeniably entertaining and nothing else. There are things that could have been better. I don't think the colorful groovy look is the problem. It just needs a better ending that gives consistency to the story. People can still give it a try for its camp. There's a true vampire here that is nothing like our modern vampires. Dark Shadows is not bad. It's just unsatisfying. It has the color, life, and all but what's missing is a proper plot development.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"looks really good, but just not fun","Barnabas (Johnny Depp) is a successful man in 1770s town of Collinsport, Maine. He makes the mistake of breaking the heart of a powerful witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). She in turn dooms him into a vampire, and then buries him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is accidentally released into the world of 1972. His Collinwood Manor has fallen into disrepair. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better.This has the great Gothic look of Tim Burton. He is able to have both a 70s look and an old Gothic look. However it is very difficult to root for Barnabas who is essentially a killing monster. It is not fun. And it is not funny. Although there is a monster sex scene that produced a few smiles.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Family Is the Only Real Wealth,"In 1760, the Collins family moves from Liverpool to the Maine to expand the family empire and dedicate to fishing business. One year later, they are successful and the city of Collinsport is raised in the place. Then, for fifteen years, Joshua and Naomi Collins build their Collinswood mansion. Their servant Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) has an unrequited love for their son Barnabas (Johnny Depp) that actually loves Josette DuPres (Bella Heathcote). But Angelique is a powerful witch that curses Barnabas and his family, killing his parents, Josette and turning him into a vampire. Then she brings the locals that lock him in a coffin and bury him for the eternity.In 1972, the young Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote) comes to the decadent Collinswood to be the tutor of the young David Collins (Gulliver McGrath), who lost his mother two years ago. She finds a dysfunctional family composed by the devoted matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) ahead of the family business that is near bankruptcy; her rebel daughter Carolyn Stoddard (Chloë Grace Moretz); her brother and David's father Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller); the psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) that takes car of David; and the servants Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley) and Mrs. Johnson (Ray Shirley).When eleven workers release and awake Barnabas, he drinks their blood and returns to Collinswood. He meets Elizabeth and she tells that the family has been cursed, and Barnabas shows a hidden room with a treasure in side and he promises to protect them and assume the business. When he sees Victoria, he rekindles his love for her. But the witch Angie is still alive and is prominent in the town and she has not forgotten Barnabas.""Dark Shadows"" is a film by Tim Burton that has a promising beginning but the development is lost between comedy and horror. As usual, the dark cinematography is awesome and the music score is spectacular, with hits from the 70's. This film is certainly not among the best films by Tim Burton, but is entertaining. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sombras da Noite"" (""Night Shadows"")",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Darkish,"I love Johnny Depp and I love Tim Burton. Together they can be sublime. Look at ""Ed Wood"" and ""Sweeney Todd"" Here, well here they seem kind of lost. Everything is in over the top tones without getting to the root of anything. The performances are shrill and disconnected with the exception of the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter. The script is underwritten and the story is tired and unconvincing but in the present film going landscape it is more enjoyable than most others. I'm tempted to advise Mr. Burton and Mr.Depp to be a bit more daring in their intentions. We're all aware of Burton's visual wizardry and of Depp's remarkable beauty and talent, why not put all that at the service of something meaningful?",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"As wonderful as Tim Burton-Johnny Depp collaborations come, this is a visually sumptuous treat with a delightfully eccentric performance by Depp","Few director-star collaborations have been as fruitful as that of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, or for that matter quite so deliciously eccentric, and their eighth time together proves no different.Never mind if you haven't any inkling of the cult '70s daytime soap opera on which this is based- a swiftly told prologue recalls the setup by telling of the Collins' voyage to America, their instrumental role in the founding of the Maine seaside town called Collinsport by starting up a successful fishery business, and most importantly, of their heir Barnabas' unfortunate run-in with a jealous witch Angelique (Eva Green). Spurned by Barnabas for another named Josette (Bella Heathcote), Angelique hypnotises her to throw herself off a cliff while turning Barnabas into a vampire and imprisoning him in a coffin.It will be nearly two centuries later by the time some construction workers inadvertently free him, awakening Barnabas to an unfamiliar era where he promptly mistakes the golden arches of a McDonald's for Mephistopheles. That's not the end of the fish-out-of-water jokes that passes as humour- other than the anachronistic values about women and childbirth that Barnabas still clings to, he is just as out of step in front of a TV playing a Karen Carpenter show or among a bunch of hippies.Fans of the original series may object to the deliberately campy tone that Burton and his screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith (with an extra story credit to Burton's frequent writing partner John August) adopt for the movie, but those less bound by expectations will lap up Johnny Depp's delightfully quirky rendition of Barnabas. As always, Depp is a master at facial reactions, with every twitch and raised eyebrow perfectly calibrated to elicit maximum hilarity. Depp and Burton are fully aware of the campiness, but both embrace it so wholeheartedly that you can't quite help but be won by their fidelity.There is also much more than just Barnabas' anachronism of course, with Smith giving the film its due weight in Barnabas' mission of restoring the former Collinwood empire to its former glory. Since locking Barnabas away, Angelique has spent her time building up her own booming fishing business. In the meantime, the Collins have been content to let their lives fall into decay like their sprawling mansion- among the dysfunctional members the matriarch Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer), her dissolute brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller), her impudent teenage daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz) and Roger's disturbed young son David (Gully McGrath).However kooky they may be, Barnabas regards them one and all as family- and as Depp's opening voice-over emphasises, blood is indeed thicker than water. Burton-Depp's collaborations have always demonstrated a tremendous amount of heart for peculiar characters, and this latest reaffirms their love for characters of different quirks and idiosyncrasies.Restoring the empire to its former lustre earns the ire of none other than Angelique itself, the ensuing love-hate relationship between the pair giving the film a mildly sexual edge as well as a thrilling climax which culminates in a visually sumptuous showdown. Admittedly the pace does amble on with little narrative tension for most of the movie, but Burton eventually satiates the thirst for bombast in summer audiences with an extended ending made with most of the film's inflated budget unheard of in the days of the TV series' miniscule own.To be fair, some of that has obviously gone into the ornate sets by production designer Rick Heinrichs as well as the elaborate costumes designed by Colleen Atwood. As is Burton's signature, the imagery stands out as much as the characters do, and the finale is a perfect example of the visual richness of Burton's warped imagination brought to life with CGI. But Burton is not foolish enough to rely simply on these modern-day devices, relying too on good-old fashioned casting to ensure that his film is also a rapturous delight.Any actor besides Depp would probably be upstaged by the fine female cast, each of whom shine not simply because of Atwood's colourful costumes. The standout would probably be Green, who plays Angelique with bewitching aplomb, projecting sass and menace with razor-sharp precision and setting off dangerous sparks with Depp as ex-lovers. With Green's showy performance, it's easy to ignore Pfeiffer's more understated but no less loopy own, the actress who once played Catwoman in Burton's 'Batman Returns' clearly relishing one of her best roles in recent years. Bonham Carter unfortunately gets sidelined in this film, her act as a neurotic shrink underwritten and quite out-of-place amidst the other unfolding plot lines.Amidst the new faces, Burton also pays homage to the original actors of the TV series by inviting four of them- Jonathan Frid, Lara Parker, Kathryn Leigh Scott and David Selby- to appear briefly in the film, as well as the era's definitive musician Alice Cooper for an extended cameo. Despite his irreverent take on the material, Burton is clearly in love with the artefacts of the '70s, and the film's awesome soundtrack with the likes of Moody Blues and the Carpenters is testament to that.So yes, fans of the TV series will have to accept that this big-screen adaptation is a reimagining of the original. Yet for those without that historical baggage, it is with any of the Burton-Depp collaborations that have come before it a thoroughly enjoyable visual feast filled with offbeat characters that turn out ghoulishly endearing. This is clearly a passion project for both Depp and Burton, and 'Dark Shadows' as its deliberately idiosyncratic title suggests is an unusual summer season offering that packs its own unique brand of kooky appeal.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
DULL with little bite.  Depp is playing dress up,"Oh the possibilities that were missed here. Except for the character names and a similar architecture in the house this film bares very little resemblance to DARK SHADOWS. The movie starts out beautifully and then goes off in so many awkward directions that it never finds what kind of movie it's trying to be. A few scattered laughs here and there do not compensate for a poorly conceived story that meanders itself to the point of being dull and confusing. What can you say about a movie that only comes to life in it's montages set to a pop songs from the early 1970's? Depp doesn't even attempt to capture any of the guilt ridden angst of Barnabas Collins. His Barnabas is a trick or treat Pirates of the Caribbean, very much like a kid playing dress up on Halloween and with two emotions, upset and more upset. Film has some nice set pieces but Burton doesn't bring any true Gothic feeling or sense of dread to the surroundings. The script has that throw everything up against the wall and see what sticks feel to it. Burtons direction comes off in a conveyor belt ""okay, let's shoot this one"" tone with interest only in visuals, which are striking. He's really more of a visual artist than he is a film director. Indeed, one gets the feeling that this film would never have been made if not for Johnny Depp and his love for the original series which is evident here. It's unfortunate that he relies too heavily on make up to carry his performance. Helean Bonham Carter has no interest in being in the film and it shows, doing it only as a favor to her husband. Eva Green is the type of actress Tim Burton is attracted to and loves to cast in his films, but she possesses little of Angelique's spellbinding jealousy. The only one in the cast that has a hint of what these surroundings should be played like is Michelle Pfeiffer. She is the Grande dame of Dark Shadows capturing both the Gothic feel of the original story and the magnificence of the character.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Is it wrong of me to like this movie?,"I will be honest - off all the Tim Burton projects during the last decade this was the one I had little to no interest. I didn't seen the original soap opera and ""Burton is making a vampire movie"" didn't sounded like left-over idea. All reviews I hear where bad and I only went to see this out of principal ""Ok, I can't talk bad about this movie until I seen it""And to be honest - At first It was a pleasant surprise! The first 40 minutes did a excellent job of introducing the world as well building up the dark atmosphere. There was so humor now and then but overall it was pretty good.But then the movie got a bit flat and what I really hated was the love story! They spent like 20 minutes introducing Victoria character but after that there is little to no of here in the movie, and she has only like two scenes with Barnabas so it's hard to buy the whole romance between the two. The only thing that was making movie good was Eva Green character which was totally Psyco (and Deep as well)But then the movie reach the climax and... It got cool again! The entire final fight was so dark and insane but campy at the same time it was hard not to enjoy it!Overall one of weakest of Burton films but it has it moments. Some of the characters are fun (especially Eva Green) and I LOVE visuals during the final scene, to be honest worth of the ticket price.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Don't bother.,"I am a Johnny Depp and Tim Burton fan girl!!!!! That being said...The intro excited me, but the rest of the movie made me regret buying the tickets. The movie is a downward spiral of awkward acting and bad jokes.Burton's visuals are wonderful as always. His colors and scenes make you believe you are where he wants you to be, but the dialogue is simply horrendous for most of the movie. You get rewarded by a few funny jokes for not walking out of the theater once Collins reaches the house, but otherwise are left feeling underwhelmed.I wont spoil it with details (not that there is much to spoil), but I will say this: Leave your lofty expectations at the theater door so you don't get pushed off cloud nine only to land on 100 degree cement... barefoot.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
somehow not that good,"My overall opinion is not negative but I feel like the idea is wasted a bit. The movie started pretty good. But after twenty minutes, everything became predictable. It was not boring but it was not very entertaining either. I don't even think this movie is comedy. There are very few jokes. Overall acting was kind of OK but Depp is becoming a very one dimensional actor by playing always similar characters. The scenery was pretty good and I must say, visuals were quite good as well. At the end, I wouldn't watch this movie once more but at least I didn't regret paying for it. If you didn't like the other Depp and Burton movies, don't even think watching this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

OK if you haven't seen the older versions,"I am a huge fan of the old Dark Shadows shows. I liked the old series, bloopers and all. I liked the films House of Dark Shadows and to a lesser degree Night of Dark Shadows. I liked the 1991 revival series of Dark Shadows. This new Tim Burton/Johnny Depp version has some good elements in it, like the costumes, soundtrack and special effects, but the problem here lies in the written word. The script relies too much on gags, some funny and some rather lame. The basic characters are mostly here with the exception of the melding of Maggie Evans into Victoria Winters, and the actor playing Willie Loomis does a better job with the character than did the one from the 1991 revival, who chose (or was directed) to play the role as a half-wit.(The one element I disliked about the revival). The 1970s music, cars, costumes and hairdos are spot-on and add to the comfy 1970s feel of the piece. The climax is all special effects and one ""revelation"" of the plot is so absurdly done here that it is (unintentionally) laughable. In all, I would say that this film may appeal more to those who never saw any of the original versions of this than the fans of them. I didn't hate this film, I just didn't love it either.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Surpassed My Expectations,"The film Dark Shadows opened to an eagerly awaiting audience of both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans. Based on the ABC daytime show which aired during the late 1960s which generated a cult following, what was taken seriously in the late 60s / early 70s comes across as comedy today. The majority of the movie is set in 1972 and incorporates music from the Moody Blues (Nights in White Satin) with appearances by Karen Carpenter in a TV scene, a cameo appearance by Alice Cooper and appearances by four of the original Dark Shadows actors including Jonathan Frid who passed away shortly after filming. Rated PG-13 for comic horror violence, sexual content , drug use, language and smoking, one of our 14-year-old critics, Raven Devanney rated it 6 out of 5 stars for ages 13 and up. Here's her take: Dark Shadows Reviewed by Raven Devanney http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2NE6UPSLcM Dark Shadows is a hilarious movie about a man named Barnibus Collins, who is cursed by an evil witch when he refuses to give her his love. Turned into a vampire, Barnibus is locked away in a coffin for two centuries. Now, freed by unsuspecting construction workers, Barnibus finds that his home town of Collins Port has drastically changed. He must learn to fit into the 70s while protecting his family, restoring Collins Port to its former glory and riding himself of the evil witch, Angelique, who cursed him to be a creature forced to hide in dark shadows. I absolutely loved this movie. Johnny Depp, who plays Barnibus Collins, did fantastic! Johnny is one of my all time favorite actors and when he teams up with director Tim Burton, you know it's a film worth seeing. The cinematography was great because of the gloominess that you will often find in Tim Burton's films, but they found a flawless way to thrown in the bright colors of the 70's. The special effects were great too, especially in the end when Angelique's skin started to crack; she really looked as if she was made out of porcelain. Something that did bother me about the visuals was that the blood in the film looked way to fake considering that it is a vampire movie. My favorite character would have to be that daughter of the Collins family played by Chloe Moretz. One; she is my favorite young actress, two; she played a moody, mellow dramatic, angsty teenager perfectly. The acting in this film was priceless because there was a lot of over- acting, but not in a cheesy way, it was done very purposefully and it gave a wonderful comedic feel to dramatic situations. I suggest this film for ages 13 and up because of sexual situations, mild drug use and language. I would give this film 6 out of 5 stars because it far surpassed my expectations!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Tired formula and a disappointing movie,"Let's leave it all at the door here. I loved Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and Batman. Hated Batman Returns, Alice in Wonderland, and Willy Wonka. Could care less about Nightmare before Christmas and Sweeney Todd. Okay, so I'm not a Tim Burton hater. I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan. I think in this situation, I'm as close as you get to the average movie goer. No agenda, no attachments. That being said, this film is terrible. Burton spent so much effort and time worrying about making this film Gothic and off pace, stuffing his favorite actors into the film even though half of their parts were pointless, he forgot he was making a film. It's a simple and fun idea but it feels like ego and ""showiness"" kept them from making the plot even make sense. We get it Tim! You are weird! Don't ruin a good performance by Depp and a fun idea for a film because you have to live up to your own Gothic standards. Grow up. So much talent is wasted on these films having the same look, cast, and feel to them. Take that talent and make something fresh! Stretch yourself just a tad out of that Hot Topic comfort zone will ya? This movie was long, boring, and ruined. All of the funny scenes were in the trailer. By the way.... wasn't this supposed to be the 70's? Other than a shot or two of trees and a hippie van it was just like the set of Sweeney Todd. The whole film felt like London in the 40's.

A quirky story,"Based on all the previews, one would think that this was a remake of Love at First Bite - a fish-out-of-water comedy, with Barnabas coming to terms with 1972. These trailer scenes probably make up 80% of those jokes for the movie. It is not a comedy that the trailers would leave you to believe.Overall it is a quirky retelling of some of the elements from the original series. I did enjoy it for what it was. You do have to go in with the expectation that this is a Burton/Depp film. Johnny seems to play one character for Burton - pauses in his speech, some weird walking movements, and lots of hand waving. A little more of a darker side would have fit this film perfectly.While the rest of the cast does a good job (Michelle is great as a matriarch) the biggest problem I had is that characters appear when needed and then go away for long spells. I had almost forgotten that Victoria was a role she was off screen so much.

Dark Shadows (2012),"I saw every Tim Burton film since Mars Attacks! at the cinema. Until this came along. I had had enough of Burton's subpar efforts over the years and Alice In Wonderland was his last chance as far as I was concerned. Finally saw this and I'm glad I waited. This is simply awful. Based on a soap opera, Burton doesn't seem to know what to do. It changes tone dramatically from obvious humour involving Depp's character waking up after 200 years of being buried and being confused by things such as television. To grisly kills where he takes out innocent victims. There are a whole cast of characters, each one is given their own story, but none of them are given enough time to develop. Miller, Carter, Heathcote are all wasted as are their stories. I didn't even get the point of Miller, which is a shame because he was great with what he had. Entire scenes have no place in the film, or are needlessly long and repetitive. The main plot seems to have Eva Green asking Depp to be hers and him rejecting her, over and over and over again. It really does feel like snippets from a soap opera condensed down. This is really just a clip show. By the end it starts pulling things out of its backside. Couldn't care for anybody in this film and think the original property should have just been left alone.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's version of Dark Shadows is a partly uneven yet still enjoyable movie of a cult classic TV series,"I had first been familiar with the TV series ""Dark Shadows"" when it was mentioned in a book about cult TV programs. But it wasn't until the early '90s TV series remake that I even watched anything to do with one Barnabas Collins who was portrayed by Ben Cross in that one. I remember highly enjoying it and was disappointed when it was cancelled after only 13 eps. So while I admire Tim Burton and Johnny Depp and the work they've done together for so long, I was a little disappointed by their latest opus in making a film of this long-beloved series. I mean, I found many of the '70s references funny but also a bit distracting since they didn't seem to advance any characterizations or plot developments. And one doesn't really get the connection Barnabas and Victoria Winters have to each other despite the flashback scene involving the latter. In fact, I enjoyed the scenes Depp has with Eva Green as Angelique better. And Michelle Pfeiffer doesn't really have much to do as matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard even when she uses her gun so that was another disappointment. But, like I said, there were some pretty funny '70s flavor involving The Carpenters, some Steve Miller lyrics, and an Alice Cooper appearance. And there is some respect concerning the translating of the plot lines and some characterizations of the show to the movie. I guess what I'm trying to say is don't expect a seriously epic drama concerning vampires, just go with the flow of part-camp, part-dramatic entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"Not his Best, but Burton is Still Entertaining","Back in 1966, decades before ""True Blood"", ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"", America had a supernatural TV series called ""Dark Shadows"". This series, which ran up to 1971, was centred on Barnabas Collins, a 200-year-old vampire played by Jonathan Frid (who died after this movie was filmed). Curiously, this campy series had such an influence on director Tim Burton and Johnny Depp that they decided to make a modern version of it.The result is this lavish production that has Depp playing Barnabas Collins as a 200-year-old vampire who wakes up in 1972 and is forced to navigate an era of hippies, pot, disco and free love. With its clock set in the Seventies, I suspect the movie will resonate better with the older viewers than the youngsters.A voice-over prologue relates how the Collins family moved from decadent Liverpool to Maine, in the New World, circa 1795. The family set up a fishing industry in a town named after themselves: Collinwood. Just when the future seemed bright for Barnabas (Depp), a love triangle involving a witch (Eva Green as Angelique), and Barnabas' girlfriend Josette (Bella Heathcote) turned tragic - sending Josette to her watery grave and turning Barnabas into a vampire. Angelique then set the townsfolk on Barnabas who was captured and buried alive.Fast-forward to 1972 and we find young Victoria Winters (Heathcote, again) arriving at Collinwood Mansion to take up a position as governess to David Collins (Gully McGrath), nephew of matriarch Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer). Also staying at the mansion are Elizabeth's brother, Roger (Jonny Lee Miller); her impudent teen daughter, Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz) and child psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter). Meanwhile, construction workers unearth Barnabas' coffin and resurrects him...""Dark Shadows"" is certainly not among the best of Burton's films and neither is it among Depp's greatest efforts. However, the weird and offbeat Burtonesque ambiance and tone are evident and coupled with notable performances by the cast, it is an entertaining effort. The gags that sent our preview audience into laughter and guffaws involve Barnabas' view of the 'modern' world of the Seventies. The vampire is intrigued by lava lamps and the songs of Karen Carpenter, whom he thinks also deals in woodwork. And yes, he also thinks Alice Cooper is the ugliest woman he has ever seen.Burton puts the Seventies hit songs to good use, evoking nostalgia and a sense of campiness among the audience. One of the pleasures of watching a Burton movie is seeing Depp in his deadpan, tongue-in-cheek role, setting a jocular mood to the proceedings. His violent love tryst with Eva Green's sexy Angelique is a highlight of the movie.Another delight is Chloe Moretz who delivers some of the juiciest lines. Among the flaws are Barnabas' inconsistent reactions to sunlight and other vampire clichés which I prefer to overlook. Overall, a nice change from the ""Twilight"" offerings.

Keep these two away from each other,"The film can't decide whether it's a fish-out-of-water comedy or a Gothic thriller/romance. Instead, we get treated to a bipolar movie that is, at times, really funny, but mostly full of unnecessary exposition. I think Burton wanted to honor the TV show by adding in so many details, but frankly, it was boring at times as they moved from one plot point to another. Some of the ""wrap up"" surprises at the end came off as forced. Though I'm glad they didn't rely on as much CGI to create the set pieces, one major scene involving a concert looked like it was stolen from the Austin Powers films.Johnny Depp did some great physical comedy as well as Helena Bonham Carter and Jackie Earle Haley, but Dark Shadows should go back to the grave.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Formula for a great movie? Tim Burton+Johnny Depp+Helena Bonham Carter+Michelle Pfeiffer = Terrific movie.,"Now, I grant you, I was not an avid viewer of the adventures of Barnabas Collins in the 60's, although apparently every girl in my high school was. But I doubt that melodramatic soap had much relation to the film I saw, other than the names of the characters and the ever present scene of the waves crashing upon rocks on the New England shoreline.Small matter. The film I watched was funny, spooky in a predictable sort of way, and the story was fresh. Depp once again creates a strange and unusual persona as Barnabas Collins, at once both the vicious, blood thirsty vampire and the refined gentleman of the 16th century. There are so many elements combined, the jeweled necklace reminiscent of Bela Lugosi's Dracula, the darkened eyes, the long claws of the Nosferatu, and Depp's uncanny ability to pull all these elements together to give us a comedic and enjoyable character we cannot help but like. Michelle Pfeiffer was an excellent choice as the current head of the family, a sturdy, refined and resilient woman determined to hold her head up despite the fallen state of the once powerful Collins family. Eva Green as Angelique is marvelous in her role as the evil yet business savvy woman whose only goal in life is the continuing destruction of the Collins family and reputation. The children, played perfectly by Chloe Grace Moretz and Gulliver McGrath, present the internal conflicts of the Collins, Carolyn who comes off as a very typical teenager, and David, who speaks frequently with his dead mother. Bella Heathcote, who portrays both Victoria in the present and Josette in the past, is also an excellent actress, and gives us just enough weird to balance the prim and proper appearance she first presents.Of particular note is Helena Bonham Carter and her role as the doctor. The blatant comic relief she provides once again demonstrates her ability and depth as an actress, and one can easily see why Burton and Depp apparently enjoy working with this talented lady.Overall, the film grabs your attention and keeps it throughout. The dialog is entertaining to the extreme, and the photography and cinematography is exceptional, as one would expect of anything from Mr. Burton.Rated PG-13 due to the language and violence, as well as several references to sexual situations, I think this film will add nicely to any collector of the trio's work. I have one on order as soon as they are released.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Not incredible, but solid","I'm an avid fan of anything with the Burton-Depp-Carter trio, so when I saw something involving vampires I was stoked. I didn't know it was based on a TV series until a couple hours before I saw it, so I can't judge it based on that, only that I know Burton and Depp are both fans of the show.Overall, I felt the movie was average for Burton, not one of his best, but solid. The effects were good, costumes were quite nice, and the set was very nice and they kept CGI to a minimum. People who have a gripe with the plot of the film seem to have wanted the film to pick a genre. I feel that the movie did a wonderful job using dark comedy, and that soap operas don't often stick with just one genre. As for sub-par acting, once again soap operas are incredibly melodramatic, and I would say acting in this is better than that.My biggest issue was with some developments at the end of the movie that seemed a bit askew but all-in-all, I was entertained and enjoyed myself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Hugely disappointing compared to the classic TV show, and is hugely problematic as a standalone film","While it had a bit of a slow start, with technical limitations being obvious and the characters not being as interesting, from the moment it switched to colour and introduced its most iconic character Barnabas Collins (unforgettably played by Jonathan Frid) the 1966 'Dark Shadows' is a classic.It is easy to see why it was so popular back in its day, and it is equally easy to see why it is remembered so fondly now. Despite its flaws (which were forgivable in a way), this reviewer spent many days and hours watching it with sheer joy, it really helping me get through many stressful and mentally straining times this year at music college (though there were many great times too, and saw a huge progression and several seemingly impossible achievements).Sadly, this 2012 film version of 'Dark Shadows' was hugely disappointing. As an adaptation of the show, it just doesn't compare and understandably can (and has been) be seen as a travesty to die-hard fans. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp apparently claim to be fans of 'Dark Shadows', but to me that wasn't obvious at all. There was more of a sense that Burton hadn't even seen the show, seeing as the tone and spirit feels completely wrong, or he thought he could improve upon it.On its own as a film, it has its good points but several major flaws that to be honest for this reviewer were more obvious. It is a shame as I am a fan of Burton's 80s and 90s stuff, especially 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Ed Wood' which are two of my all-time favourites, but after his career low-point 'Planet of the Apes' he became hit-and-miss. While it is better than 'Planet of the Apes', along with 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' and 'Alice in Wonderland' 'Dark Shadows' is very much a lesser effort from Burton.There are good things. It does look great, with splendidly Gothic and vibrantly colourful sets, wonderful and atmospheric use of colours, effectively ghoulish make-up and appropriately kooky costumes that suited the characters very well, while it's beautifully and stylishly photographed as well. The music score is groovy, rousingly orchestrated, haunting and a long way from forgettable or generic, if not one of Danny Elfman's best or most inspired scores, with some clever song choices. There are some amusing, well-written lines in the script, loved the line about Alice Cooper and it is most successful when Barnabas is struggling to fit in, and a few of the cast acquit themselves well.Johnny Depp is no Jonathan Frid and he has given better performances (though also much worse, it is one of his better performances in any of his later collaborations with Burton), but he is clearly having a lot of fun as Barnabas without overdoing it and is one of the most involved members of the cast, he also is very charismatic. Michelle Pfeiffer is one of the most successful at injecting a genuine and faithful personality, while Eva Green is both sexy and intense. Cameos by Christopher Lee and Alice Cooper are well-utilised.Unfortunately, a number of the cast don't come off well. Jackie Earl Haley, who is very good at being menacing and sometimes low-key if he needs to be, looked bored in a role that is so much in the background that there was almost no need for him. Helena Bonham Carter overdoes it and comes over as out of place, while Chloe Grace Moretz is irritating in a negatively stereotypical role. Much of the acting is either over-compensated and bland, being able to do very little to nothing with their dull and often unrecognisable in personality characters, and while it was interesting to see Frid his appearance is far too short to leave a lasting impression. The chemistry between the characters, one of the show's biggest strengths, is barely there.'Dark Shadows' script has its moments, but these moments are too sporadic. Tonally it is very unfocused and muddled too often, it rarely seems to know whether to be eccentric comedy or full-blown melodrama. It attempts to do both (amongst others) and never completely succeeds at either, the comedy is too sporadic and can be childish and overdone and the melodrama is unmoving and overwrought. Story-wise it's a mess, it never really comes to life, has twists that come out of nowhere and are completely misplaced (especially the werewolf subplot), parts that drag endlessly and contribute very little to the plot and parts that looked alright on paper but executed in a half-baked way.As a result, the Gothic atmosphere is almost completely lost, with it only being obvious in the production values, while the sex scene choreographed to Barry White is too broad and overly-wild and the ending is overblown to ridiculous extremes. Burton's direction does well with the style is but severely lacking in the story and the substance, where there is a complete lack of heart and soul.Overall, not awful but disappoints hugely both as a standalone and especially as an adaptation of a classic show. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Will Suck the Life Out of You,"I guess I will start out by saying that I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and that I even like some of Tim Burton's works (Beetlejuice and The Nightmare Before Christmas). However, that being said, I did not like this film all that much. If you are looking for some comedy in this film, then go and watch the trailer, because most of the funny parts are in it. I understand that this film was supposed to be a spoof of the soap opera that appeared in the 1970's, but it really fell short of my expectations. I remember being in elementary school and rushing home to see what was happening on Dark Shadows. In this film, not only did I not want to see what happens next, I really didn't care. Johnny Depp (Barnabas Collins) once again embraced his character and does a really fine job of making the character believable, but the content just wasn't there. I don't think that this film ever decided what it wanted to be when it grew up. There were elements of comedy, horror, drama and even a little romance. There was some jostling around in this film between Barnabas and Angelique (Eva Green), but you could almost sense the wires that the actors were tied to. And is it just me or does Bella Heathcote (Victoria Winters/Josette DuPres) look a little like Anne Hathaway? Victoria and David Collins (Gulliver McGrath) gave a whole new meaning to the phrase ""I see dead people"". I guess my favorite character in the film was Willie (Jackie Earle Haley) who was Barnabas' sidekick. He was fun to watch even though he did not have many lines (thank goodness). This film may end up sucking the life out of your expectations. By the time you get to the end of the film, things get downright silly and stupid. The last ten minutes of the film I kept thinking to myself .. oh brother. Also at the end of the film there was almost a hint of a sequel; man I sure hope not. Not all of the Depp/Burton collaborations have been successful and this is one of them. If you just want to see Johnny Depp on the big screen, then by old means go. However I think that this film should be locked in a box (redbox). As sure as my blood is red, so is the light for this film.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Awesome Movie,"*This Review Contains Spoilers*I'll start with this, I've read some of the critic and user reviews and most of them don't give the movie Dark Shadows a good name. I am a user and I want to set the record straight! If you like vampires that aren't all that scary then see the movie. If you're a fan of Johnny Depp or Tim Burton then see the movie. If you haven't seen the series then go see the movie. I only say don't see the movie if you have seen the series because, yeah, there is some parts to the movie that aren't all that great and if you like the series a lot then chances are you won't like th movie. I've never seen the series myself but my mother has.Personally, my favorite part of the movie is when Barnabas dodges the green goo that the witch vomits and he says ""Missed me"" only to get hit right in the face with the green goo again.I also like the movie because it's a lot funnier than people think. Some people just don't have that good of an imagination.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A Beautiful and Charming Gothic Film Despite the Derivative Script,"I admit I am a bit wary about Tim Burton and his quirky dark films, some of which I did not really like too much. However with so much advanced hype about this particular collaboration with Johnny Depp, I felt compelled to watch it. I am happy I did. It was certainly one of the most visually-stimulating fantasy-black comedies I have seen, since maybe ""Death Becomes Her.""The story of ""Dark Shadows"" begins in the 18th century when the Collins family crossed the Atlantic to begin their fishing business in Maine. Love-struck maid Angelique (Eva Green) took a fancy to the Collins scion Barnabas (Johnny Depp). Her love remained unrequited though because Barnaby became enamored with sweet Josette (Bella Heathcote). With the traditional fury expected from a woman scorned, Angelique resorted to powerful black magic to kill Josette and turn Barnaby into a vampire. The main story picks up 200 years later in 1972, when Barnabas was released from his grave by a road crew. He not only meets the very dysfunctional current generation of Collins, he also meets Angelique again! It seems that this witch also survived the centuries past, and is now the CEO of the competitor fishing company, Angel Bay. So, will Angelique finally possess Barnabas' love? Or will the pretty doe-eyed governess Victoria (also Heathcote) succeed to win him back, where her look-alike Josette failed 200 years ago?A lot of the charm came from the cast who played their characters in this dark comedy so tongue-in-cheek, it was delightful. Johnny Depp, playing an undead character from 200 years ago waking up again in 1972, so funny as he encounters recent inventions. Eva Green, I have never seen her attack a role with this much ooomph and passion before. I have seen her before drably playing characters before in films like ""The Dreamers,"" ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and ""Casino Royale."" This turn as Angieis a high point in her acting career.I had never seen Bella Heathcote act in anything before, but I understand how Barnabas could be so mesmerized by her beauty. Of course it won't be a Tim Burton without Helena Bonham-Carter, and here she plays a trippy redhead psychiatrist. I do not always like her characters before, but here she is also so funny! The other supporting characters played by Michelle Pfeiffer, Jackie Earl Haley and the kids were not so remarkable. The character twist that involves the daughter Carolyn was so sudden and out-of-the-blue that it does not really contribute much to the improvement of the story.For me, the best feature of this film is its amazing look. The visual effects, costumes and set design were all top-notch. They set the mood and the period of the story very effectively. And the soundtrack of early 70s songs, beginning with ""Nights in White Satin"" over the opening credits, wow! The song choices were unexpected, surprising and nostalgic at the same time.Despite my raves, I know this film will not really appeal to all sectors. I found out during the credits that this was based on a TV show. I had not see this since the series was from the late 60s so I would not know how faithful this film was to its inspiration. I enjoyed it a lot. I found it very well-conceptualized and well-executed, despite the shortcomings of the script. I must admit the derivative script is not really the highlight of this film. It seems it contains various elements which had been bits and pieces of several ghost and vampire films we have seen before. Much to my chagrin, the violent make- out scene and the final conversation on the cliff edge came straight out of the ""Twilight"" films! However, the film as a whole was just very beautiful to watch, in a Gothic and eerie sort of way. Just don't expect too much, sit back and enjoy it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Burtons Dark Shadows....Always Look The Same,"After making a really bad Willy Wonka & and a quite terrible Alice in Wonderland, the Tim Burton ----Johnny Depp pairing presents us with the jackpot. A shockingly puerile Dark Shadows. Having interesting sets and lots of make up is not sufficient to make a good motion picture. The use of ""humour"" is awful....well worn jokes about the ""fish out of water"" theme, and other predictable nonsense & rubbish.....the weak, tired dialogue is simply not good enough. The central story (actually there is no perceptible central story !!) is so badly handled ....this may go down in history in the cult genre of ""one of the worst movies of all time"". This really is Ghastly Gothic Garbage. Tim Burton always gives us lots of heavily made up actors, bad scripts and good looking sets. However, these things become tiresome after a while ....even the Tim Buton ""fans"" must see this as a very impotent movie. Take a holiday Mr. Burton. Come back when you have a new idea.

Anyone else bored of the Depp/Burton collaboration?,"When Burton and Depp get it right it's an Edward Scissorhands, when they get it wrong it's a Dark Shadows. Burtons films are never ""bad"", though Alice in Wonderland and Planet of the Apes weren't good, Dark Shadows just doesn't really deliver when it really could of.Johnny Depp plays the character well, but I think an English actor would have been better cast, as his accent sounds forced a lot of the time. Michelle Pfeiffer is usually fabulous but is just reduced to nothing here, and her chemistry with Depp is far more enticing than Depp's actual love interest, but it isn't explored.The pacing is all over the place, when the film is funny, it does it quite well. But the humour is so rare, it doesn't know how to balance the horror and the comedy, leaving it feeling like two films squished into one. Depps delivery is solid as always, but I just didn't feel this was the right film role for him. I felt this way in Sweeney Todd, although I thought the performance was good I felt Depp was miscast due to his lack of singing talent.Dark Shadows is OK, it is entertaining and has genuinely great moments in it. But these moments are too few and far between.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Great Look and Fun Performances But Shallow,"Dark Shadows (2012)** 1/2 (out of 4)Tim Burton's updating of the TV series features Johnny Depp playing vampire Barnabas Collins who after nearly two-hundred years underground is dug up where he returns to his family estate (via 1972) and plans on returning the Collins name back to the top. The only problem is that his old enemy, the witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), plans to keep his curse unless he agrees to love her. I've heard several people compare this to the earlier works of Burton and I'd have to agree because after years of delivering some fine films I think the director fell back on his old method that is more style that substance. Visually and technically DARK SHADOWS is a masterpiece but there's so little here to connect to that it's easy to see why so many people are leaving the theater disappointed. I'm not overly familiar with the original show, hated the first movie and haven't seen the second one. With that said, I'm not sure how ""fans"" of them will react to this here so I'm not even going to try and compare everything. For the most part Burton has delivered a truly incredible looking film. The sets, costume design and most of the special effects are terrific looking and I'm glad that the director kept the dark tone. The TV ads and trailers have shown the worst of the film and that's the failed comedy. There are a lot of jokes that really don't make one laugh, although some of them are charming in a very childish way. The jokes that do work basically come from Depp's performance as he's able to pull off the fish-out-of-water routine and especially the jokes about Alice Cooper (who performs a couple songs). Depp nails the part pretty well but at the same time you have to wonder why such a talented actor appears in this stuff. Michelle Pfeiffer was back and it was great seeing her. She too delivers a fine performance but the screenplay does very little for her character. The same is true for Helena Bonham Carter and Jackie Earle Haley. It was fun seeing Christopher Lee in his small part as well as Jonathan Frid's cameo. Chloe Grace Moretz steals the film as the young woman with a few secrets of her own. On the whole DARK SHADOWS is a great film to look at and the performances are good but with such a distant screenplay and no characters to really care for, the film in the end just doesn't come together.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Lost interest in movie plot two-thirds way through,"I am a VERY easy grader on movies. As long as my mind is engaged and I don't find myself wondering about something else, a movie gets a pass from me. I literally lost interest in what happened about two-thirds way through the movie and agree with another poster that this movie was just all over the place without doing anything (as far as the plot goes) well. I have no problem with the performances and liked the cast. But I FAR more enjoyed catching SAFE for the third time than I enjoyed even the first two thirds of Dark Shadows. I found The Tourist, The Ninth Gate, and Sleepy Hollow 10 times as entertaining and would watch any of them over again once a year. Also, Pirates 4 which I had a bit of trouble with the first time through but since then have probably watched it a half dozen times with great appreciation. Loved Stardust and even Hocus Pocus.

I am a fan of Johnny Depp. But my two favorite movies of his were Chocolat and Donnie Brasco. Both of these movies had absolutely nothing to do with Tim Burton. He is a very capable actor with the ability to play many genres. But I don't think he has explored his potential enough.

Uneven movie based on the classic TV show.,"Dark Shadows is yet another Burton/Depp collaboration that is based on the classic 60s-70s TV Gothic soap opera. And you'd think that being based on a whole TV series it would give the writers (John August and Seth Grahame-Smith) plenty of story to utilize, yet, this nearly two hour film has what barely could be considered a plot. Heir to the noble and wealthy Collins family, Barnabas (Johnny Depp) makes the mistake of messing with the wrong servant girl, Angelique (Eva Green) and when scorned, the witch causes the death of his true love (Bella Heathcote) and turns Barnabas into a vampire and has him sealed in a coffin for all eternity. But, Barnabas is set free, accidentally 200 years later in 1972 and finds the Collins Estate in a shambles and his old nemesis Angelique is the cause. Barnabas vows to restore his family empire to it's former glory while battling his powerful former lover. Along the way we do get elements from the show weaved in but, the film can never decide on a tone to it's thin story. One minute it is a fish out of water comedy and the next it's a horror film and next it's a drama. Is it spoofing the original show a la the Brady Bunch Movie, or is it a serious retelling like the brief run revival in 1991? The filmmakers don't seem to know. So what did work? The cast. I loved the cast. Depp is very good at portraying Barnabas and handles the character's script driven changes of tone very well. Michelle Pfeiffer is good, although not given much to do, as the family matriarch, Elizabeth. She plays her role straight and it works. Helena Bonham Carter is Julia Hoffman, the drunk family psychiatrist who tries to cure Barnabas of his curse. She plays her part as more comic relief but, smartly, never goes over the top. And as for over the top, Eva Green has a field day as the villainous witch, Angelique and has a great time with it and it translates to the screen as we have a good time watching her chew the scenery and sex it up. She makes this movie a lot more worth watching. The rest of the cast including, Jackie Earle Haley, Jonny Lee Miller and Chloë Grace Moretz all have a good time with their roles and it's all these cast elements that bring Dark Shadows what fun it has. Burton's direction seems to be a bit laid back at times. As with his script, he doesn't seem to know what degree of seriousness in which to take his film and appears to change his mind depending on the scene. Although, it is when he has things played out with a sense of humor that Dark Shadows is it's liveliest as the more dramatic scenes are ho-hum and the climactic encounter between Barnabas and Angelique seems made up as it goes along. No better example as it is never clear whom is more powerful, Barnabas or the witch as it seems to change back and forth. And not to mention last minute reveals on characters that seem to serve the climactic struggle yet, could have been more fun to develop earlier in the narrative. All in all, Shadows didn't bore but, could have been so much more fun had a tone been decided on and the writers had taken better advantage of the 5 years of available story from the original show. Instead we get a mildly amusing passing of time saved mostly by a top notch cast who seem to know the director and scripters needed a little help.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The Best Movie So Far,"I am always open to something new. I really appreciate Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's works, as they are always unexpected and different. This one was not a replica of the show, but showed it respect. How could anyone expect a show that ran for so long to be represented in a two hour movie? This was a fantastic piece that I look forward to seeing again and again. It is not a straight up comedy, but I do not know of a better way they could have sold it. It's nice to see vampires that do not sparkle, and cannot be touched by sunlight. Burton and Depp have made a fantastic movie that has monsters that look like they are supposed to. It does homage to the original show, as well as the monster actors of yesteryear.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
An odyssey of inanity,"Tim Burton must be the world's most unpredictable director. In the last ten years he's made what I consider to be his best movie - the exemplary SWEENEY TODD musical - as well as directing two stinkers which are the nadir of his career, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY and ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Unfortunately, DARK SHADOWS continues the latter trend, as this is his worst ever film, an odyssey of inanity from beginning to end.Burton has always been a style-over-substance director and that's taken to the extreme here. DARK SHADOWS is ostensibly based on a classic '60s-era vampire TV soap opera, but what Burton has done is to take the basic premise and instead make his own version of THE ADDAMS FAMILY. You know, a family of kooks and weirdos, right up his street apparently. I sat watching this film and wondered just what exactly I was supposed to be thinking or feeling. The plot is tedious and long-winded and seems to go on forever. The film is a visual treat but there's no story, just a random connection of set-pieces. Some scenes, like the violent sex scene, are embarrassingly stupid. Was this supposed to be a comedy? There are some quirky moments, yes, but I have to say I didn't laugh once.Johnny Depp delivers YET another of his kooky character performances and surely audiences must be bored of these by now. His vampiric lead is a complete bore, a collection of tics and weird behaviour that leads a vacuous hollow in the centre of the movie. Helena Bonham Carter is shoehorned into a storyline she doesn't belong in, just because she was Burton's wife, and Michelle Pfeiffer looks bored - who can blame her? Her role in STARDUST was a lot more fun. Poor Eva Green is the best actress in this thing, and her undeniable talents are wasted throughout. She deserves a lot better. The most embarrassing performance comes from the awful Chloe Grace Moretz - what were they thinking? - although I admit that the Alice Cooper and Christopher Lee cameos were nicely done. Overall, though, DARK SHADOWS is a hulking mess of a movie and one of the worst yet. Can Burton retire now, please?",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

hard to review not knowing the original series,"A bit of a difficult on to review as I haven't seen the original 1966 series. i knew that it had horror and comedy in it and that's exactly what we do see here. On the other hand I also didn't found it a typical Tim Burton flick.Johnny Depp is really looking great as Barnabas Collins, his stiff and on the other hand funny. There are a few good horror moments but in fact it's more about the comedy and situations. Not that it was bad at all. The original cast of Dark Shadows do appear at the party, sadly Jonathan Frid (the original Barnabas) died shortly after. What was funny was that we do have a gig of Alice Cooper in his clothes from the seventies. I liked that part a lot. I also liked the performance of Eva Green (Angelique Bouchard) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elizabeth Collins Stoddard) wasn't that bad neither.Still it's not my favorite Tim Burton flick but I enjoyed it as a starter of a horror night.

A pirate, a hatter, and a vampire. The latter is shown here and it is interesting and amusing to see him play a vampire from the 1700s. Tim Burton's macabre and creepy humor comes out throughout, with Johnny Depp definitely helping with that. It is also considerably dark and while trying to maintain the comedy over the course of almost two hours, the movie has its ups and down. The sexual content is a bit much as well and would have been perfectly fine without it.

Pop Culture Goth,"Fans of the original TV series are mixed on this modern telling of the story. This is a review of the film on its own with a nod, not a true remake, of the cult show that has a fervent following.There is, as in most Tim Burton films, a mix of wonderful images and creative characterizations along with some incoherent inconsistencies of plot. The look of the film is pop culture Goth and is appealing with appalling sort of violent visuals that releases some bloody bits along with dark humor.Johnny Depp's eloquent performance carries the film from its frustrating narrative and the displaced character's confrontation with modern culture delivers the most fun. Most of the other players seem to be there for support rather than substance and the film does suffer a bit from this shallow scenario.In the end it is a movie that is part premiere Burton and part filler with some inclusions that are flat and less than farcical. The Alice Cooper bits for one, and lack of substantive script support from the family and friends that really don't have much to do in the Collins mansion. Taken as a whole it is less satisfying, but some of the artistic renderings and ghoulish gimmicks are worth the trip back to a time when a midday soap could capture the imagination of a generation with a completely original counter (culture) program.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

The original series was before my time but it took itself more seriously and the humor at times was unintentional but when it was intentional it was clever and dark. This movie is dumb. The humor is dumb, it assumes the audience is dumb. There is nothing of note in it. It has a big budget and superstar cast but it would have been 1000 times better with 1/10th the budget, less spent on trying to make a shiny toilet bowl of an extravaganza. It might have worked if it was more along the line of that weird Jack Nicholson werewolf movie.I think the plan was to turn Dark Shadows into the Addams Family movies and start a big deal franchise out of it. This was doomed to fail on every level and the movie is worth no attention. Better off watching Sly Stallone trying to do a comedy and I never said that about anything else in my entire life.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Blood is thicker than water, a fang of a good time! Excellent take on the Gothic classic.","I for one am one of the biggest Tim Burton fans the man who brought us the classics ""Batman""(1989) and ""Batman Returns""(1992)really blends emotions and the inner feelings to make excellent movies. As his dark and Gothic mood tone will make any viewer enchanted. And with this work an update and more modern version of the TV soap ""Dark Shadows"" Tim clearly did not let anyone down! ""Dark Shadows"" is an excellent take and spin on the Gothic classic and Tim's story is filled with a journey and search for family and love plus the comedy and horror mix make the film very interesting to anyone. And the film is a pop culture piece for the way it blends music and style of it's setting of 1972 it's a rock and roll all night good time. As anyone knows who watches Burton's movies they are full of fun and expressions always revealing inner feelings and emotions his works can really change one's view of the world. And the all star cast makes the film work even more as two Tim favorites Johnny Depp(Barnabas Collins)and Michelle Pfeiffer(Elizabeth Collins Stoddard)shine with star power.The film has a story in a historical and Gothic kind of way starting in 1752 in Liverpool, England a young Barnabas(Depp)suffers some fatal tragedies at the hands of a curse put out by a sexy yet jealous witch Angelique Bouchard(Eva Green). Yet after many many decades of being buried the film flashes to it's present day of 1972 and the culture is captured in the film perfect by the use of 70's music and style as the furniture and the clothing from the 70's is noticeable. And a nice little appearance from 70's legend Alice Cooper is A okay. And Barnabas meets his ancestral descendants that being the wealthy and rich Collins family of Collinsport, Maine a seaside and shoreline fishing community as this business has brought the Collins clan their millions. Yet arriving is a mysterious girl Victoria Winters/Josette(Bella Heathcote) who becomes a guest to the Colins family and this arrival has pleased Barnabas. The bad news is the sexy yet wicked witch but breakable beauty Angelique(Eva Green)has arrived in town with her curse. To help both defeat the wicked witch is the Collins Stoddard family as Michelle Pfeiffer is elegant and sexy in a classic kind of way and in top notch form as family head leader Elizabeth and true this a strange bunch as Elizabeth's daughter Carolyn(Chloe Grace Moretz) is a certain little hand full and family head doctor Julia Hoffman(Helena Bonham Carter) needs medication herself.Overall this horror comedy drama is full of laughs, love, culture, and searching for belonging and acceptance still it closes the historical Gothic story out to a happy ending. The performances from Depp and Pfeiffer were top notch and perfect and again Tim sends a message and he proves with this film that family and belonging is important and too it's okay to be different! ""Dark Shadows"" was one feel good viewing pleasure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Tim Burton at his good but not the best,"Definitely worth watching even though it's not a masterpiece due to several factors. First of all, the absurd gets too absurd to the point it becomes funny. I know some will say that it might have been the director's intention, but sorry, for me it didn't always work. E.g. the vampire brushes his teeth while he can't even hold the toothbrush right because his fingers are awkward and gum-like. On the other hand, all the viewers who say it was total crap are in my opinion totally wrong. They say the film dragged on for ever, and there was no action in it. Well, it's not a Bruce Willis type of movie my dear! If you watch Burton's production you have to savor what you see, the plot itself is of secondary importance here. One great asset of this title is the cast, though it is not always brilliant. I was totally taken aback with Eva Green's portrayal of the demonic witch. She was a perfect choice for this character. Her stunning beauty, her mesmerizing eyes and, of course, the mind-blowing red lipstick was a perfect lure to seduce you into letting her do whatever bad thing she wanted to do to Mr. Collins (J.Depp). Speaking of which, Johnny Depp was great but I kind of got fed up of watching him AGAIN no matter how good an actor he is. Sometimes it is a nice thing to have somebody fresh, and I have the impression he is out of ideas for another character like this. I liked to see Michelle Pfeiffer, because she was beautiful, other than that nothing to write home about. The funny moment was to see Alice Cooper play himself and look exactly the same in 1972. The young actors, especially Bella Heathcote was a pleasure to watch. To sum up, if you know what Tim Burton is like you will enjoy it despite its obvious shortcomings.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Burton and Depp this is getting too repetitive,"¨It is said that blood is thicker than water. It is what joins us, binds us... curses us. My name is Barnabas Collins, and this is my tale.¨Dark Shadows is the latest collaboration between director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp; it happens to be their eighth time working together. The bond between them just might be thicker than blood. Their friendship began when they worked together in Edward Scissorhands more than 20 years ago and it has developed from there on as they've collaborated with each other repeatedly, making some great films together and others not so much. Dark Shadows will be one of those films that fall in the not so great category and may perhaps be a sign that their collaboration together is getting old and repetitive. We all know how great of an actor Johnny Depp is and he's always enjoyed to play these kind of eccentric characters. That is why Tim Burton seemed to be a perfect fit for him as a director because he's such a great art director who is able to paint an eccentric vision of the world. Actually that is the only element that worked in Alice in Wonderland, and is what saves Dark Shadow from being rotten: the fantastic art direction. Burton takes us back to the 70's with some wonderful visuals and recreates a small fishing town to perfection. Johnny Depp also gets to play a very eccentric character once again as he's a vampire who's just awoke from the 18th century, so it plays out as the classic fish out of the water tale. But just like in almost every Burton film, you can't fit his movie into one specific genre as it mixes dark comedy with horror, fantasy and some romance. Dark Shadows at times fits in all of these categories and at others it's just hard to figure out what Burton was trying to do.During the 18th century the Collins family leaves England and arrives in America with the prospect of building a fishing empire. They do so and end up having the town named after them: Collinsport. They build an enormous mansion and have several servants working for them, but they fall under an evil curse when their son Barnabas (Johnny Depp) breaks the heart of a witch named Angelique (Eva Green). He tells her that he doesn't love her and ends up falling in love with the beautiful Josette (Bella Heathcote). Angelique curses the family by killing Barnabas's parents, Josette, and turning Barnabas into a vampire and burying him alive inside a coffin. The story then jumps to the year 1972 where we are introduced to the surviving members of the Collins family residing in the very same mansion which is now in evident decay: Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her teen daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), Elizabeth's widowed brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) and his tormented son David (Gulliver McGrath), and their staff which consists of David's psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley), and Mrs. Johnson (Ray Shirley). Barnabas is released from his coffin by accident when some construction workers find the coffin and open it. He returns to the mansion which is now in ruins and after convincing Elizabeth of his true identity promises that he will restore the family to its former glory. What he doesn't know is that the town is run by Angelique now he is still very much alive and hasn't aged one bit.The first half of the movie worked for me as a very dark comedy. I actually enjoyed the film, until the final act which just went a little too far in its bizarre act and eccentricities (even for Tim Burton standards). The final act was a disappointment, but I did enjoy most parts of the story. Johnny Depp played his usual strange self and Michelle Pfeiffer was great in her role. She claimed to be a fan of the original soap opera that took place during the late 60's and 70's which this film is actually based on. Despite the television show not being a comedy, this film actually plays out as one in the same way most 70'sand 80's TV series are being turned into in recent years. I am a big fan of Chloe Grace Moretz and have followed her since her work in 500 Days of Summer, Kick Ass, and Let Me In. I wish she had been given more screen time because she is always a delight to watch on screen and had an interesting character. Dark Shadows is a very weird movie and definitely not for everyone; it won't be ranked among Burton's best work either (not even close) so I don't know if fans will actually enjoy this film, but I did have enough of a good time during most of the film to give this film a passing grade.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"A fun time, but......","This is an entertaining film. It did however have some problems, for example in some scenes you felt just lost in weirdness, Johnny Depp plays a quirky, weird vampire who is turned into this creature because of an evil curse on him, he does play a quite funny role and i think he is a very good actor as a whole but although you're sometimes laughing and enjoying yourself a lot, sometimes you feel a bit trapped by it in a way.The idea of ghosts being real is a whole stupid part of this film and it wasn't brilliantly done, definitely not one of Burton's best films, but it's entertaining.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Enjoyable enough,"Dark Shadows based on a British show of the same name, which I""m not familiar with so cannot compare, but was enjoyable enough. The movie stars Johnny Depp as a vampire named Barnabus Collins, suffering a witch's (Eva Green) curse, finally set free from his prison after nearly two centuries, introduced to the modern world of 1972. His decedents now live in his home and he share's his secret with the matriarch of the family Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer), along with the secret to the family fortune hidden in the castle by which they plan to reclaim the family glory before the witch, Angelique (Green) cursed the family.

A Must See,This movie was one of my all time favorites! It had quite a few similarities to the 1966 Dark Shadow series. But they brought it up to date and made it from a excellent T.V. Show to a must see amazing movie! Johnny Depp was the perfect choice for Barnubus and portrayed him in every way! Overall I would recommend this to all my friends as a must see! Tim Burton made everything go together so nicely in this movie and the stars that play the part fit their parts perfectly as I am a fan of the Dark Shadows Series and I must say I am VERY impressed with this movie!

An underrated movie from Tim Burton,"Dark Shadows is in my opinion a pretty good movie it's very dark and distirbing at the same time, it also has a great cast of voice actors like Johnny Depp voice of actor of the 2011 movies Rango and Jack Sparrow (Pirates Of The Caribbean On Stranger Tides), here we have the main character named Barnabas Collins a normal person who lived with his parents until we meet the villain named Angelique Bouchard voiced by Eva Green voice actress of Ava Lord (Sin City a Dame to Kill For) and Artemisia (300 Rise Of An Empire) in my opinion she is not a bad villain but not great. The soundtrack is great, the way she dies was shocking and this movie is good but not the best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"This film is a disaster, and not an ""homage"" to the original ""Dark Shadows"" at all.","How sad that Burton/Depp decided to ""sex-up"" this film with breasts, bad actresses, and lousy script offerings. Not one character was worthy of any type of accolade. Some things should be left in the past...and this is one of them.Sure, you had the basic premise of pitiful Barnabus being cursed by Angelique, but there was no back story of any worth. Josette was thrown in as just a ""special-effect"" death...with no relationship with Barnabus, whatsoever.Fast-forward to the future and it's sick/silly. Nothing was funny and they showed every single joke in the trailers. Felt sorry for the ""whoosh"" from the original cast that got thrown in...and Chris Lee was useless.The lines of this film were thrown away...and close-ups of Depp's various makeup jobs were sloppy.There is no excuse for doing a film of this cheapness and calling it after something that was so enjoyed by past generations. Two series are worth more than this mess. Please....save your money and rent the originals...from Net Flix.See what true story-telling should be, not this lack-a-daisical junky stuff. This will end up being on the bottom of every Walmart bin....for $1 for many years.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
An okay enough Tim Burton movie,"This movie is only the second Tim Burton movie that I watched in the theater and I liked it. As an adult, I find this movie to be okay and it's definitely better than Alice in Wonderland (2010). Nosy it's worth noting that I've never watched the Gothic soap opera from the 1960s. There are some big problems, but there's enough good stuff in it to not make me hate this movie.Positives for Dark Shadows (2012):
The production value and the setting design in this movie is amazing. The Collins' Mansion looks absolutely phenomenal and it feels like a setting straight out of a gothic story. Johnny Depp gives a decent performance as the main character of Barnabas Collins as he got some decent laughs from me and he does a great job with the dramatic scenes. I really enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, but then again Michelle Pfeiffer is always good in anything she's been in. I also liked Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Julia Hoffman and she did get a lot of laughs from me. Then, you have Jackie Earle Haley as Willie Loomis and he's great as the caretaker of the Collins' Family, but for me I just love seeing Rorschach in any movie. Chloe Grace Moretz as Carolyn Stoddard was by far the best member of the Collins' Family in the movie and she's has some of the funniest scenes in this movie. Then, you have Eva Green as Angelique ""Angie"" Bouchard as she is very charismatic as this vengeful witch against Barnabas and she was a fantastic villain in this movie. Christopher Lee and Alice Cooper have small cameo in this movie and they were awesome. And finally, the climax of the movie was great.Negatives for Dark Shadows (2012):
Bella Heathcote as Victoria Winters was an unbelievably bland love interest for Barnabas and there are so many moments to where she's supposed to express some emotion and yet she just has this blank and emotionless expression on her face throughout the runtime. Jonny Lee Miller as Roger Collins was also very bland in this movie and there are so many times to where I literally forgot that he was even a character because he does nothing in this movie. Hell, he literally leaves the movie before climax and that begs the question, why was this character in the movie in the first place to begin with. There's also a number of moments where the humor didn't land for me. And finally, this movie is the most bland of any Tim Burton movie and that's saying a lot.Overall, Dark Shadows (2012) is definitely one of the lesser Tim Burton movies in this filmography, but I wouldn't hate rewatching this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Dark Shadows, bad dialogues","Dark Shadows is visually a great Tim Burton movie, but the script is totally insufficient. It's based on the eponymous late-1960ies soap opera, which is still one of the longest TV series (in terms of episodes) in history. I didn't know about the series, and it's hard to gauge how many out of the 2012 audience have it on their radar -- very few will have actually seen it. Director Tim Burton is apparently a huge fan of the series, which may have lead to him getting carried away. Or maybe condensing 1125 episodes into a 90 minutes feature film is an impossible feat to begin with. What Burton came up with is the story of a 200 year old vampire resurfacing in the colourful early 1970ies (roughly the era when the run of the original series ended), which is mainly characterised by macramé, troll dolls and Alice Cooper. And a few stoner hippies. Unlike the original series, the 2012 feature film is a comedy, and the culture clash between the ancient vampire and his modern-age family and surroundings could have been a functional plot motor, but unfortunately it falls completely flat because the script -- and especially the dialogues -- sucks. Hard to fathom in a movie that cost US$ 150 million. The result is a movie that is so disappointing that I can't even recommend it for home viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Misses The Mark,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Dark Shadows.Following on from Alice In Wonderland being a blockbuster hit for Burton and Depp, expectations were high for this one, and I had high hopes too. I had not loved a Depp movie since Sweeney Todd (5 years and 8 movies ago) but the trailer looked promising and when Depp teamed up with Burton, I always enjoyed it. However, whilst this starts off promising, this is a bit of a mess. I think Burton tried to start a franchise and set about trying to incorporate too many subplots into the first movie (A common flaw these days) and a potentially fun movie gets lost. It's not all bad, it does make good use of the 70's music for example. A lot of the humorous moments come from Depp's reactions to 1970s pop culture and I enjoyed the love scene set to Barry White.If they had set out to make a straight comedy like 21 Jump Street, it may have worked. But it's uneven tone makes it impossible to enjoy. Apparently, Depp was a big fan of the original series, and he was really excited to be playing Barnabus. This is the eighth collaboration between Burton and Depp and Burton is the director behind some of his greatest movies. Sadly ever since he graced our cinemas as Captain Jack Sparrow the fine actor of the '90s and early '00s has been replaced by a man with a penchant for over-the-top antics. His Barnabas is a drag, but not because he resembles a drag queen. It's because he seems to belong in another movie. He is far too camp for this movie's darker moments.Michelle Pfieffer is ok, Eva Green is quite good, Helena Bonham Carter is surprisingly bland as is Johnny Lee Miller, whilst Chloe Grace Moretz is fine too, Christopher Lee and Alice Cooper pop up in cameos. This is the last film Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter worked on before their relationship ended. This was also Producer Richard D. Zanuck's (Jaws) last film.Dark Shadows grossed $79 million at the domestic box office to end 2012 as the 39th highest grossing movie of the year!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Going into the movie, everyone should expect some weirdness, that is Tim's style, which is why this dark vampire movie is perfect for him.Johnny Depp is in his zone as creepy, out-of-place Barnabas Collins.

Missing a bit of the Shadow,"Johnny Depp and Tim Burton over the years have obviously stamped their mark pretty deep in the world of Hollywood. They have developed titles such as Edward Scissor Hands, Sweeney Todd, Alice in Wonderland and Charlie and the Chocolate Facotry. All of these films impressed me and I thought i would expect nothing less from the 2012 film Dark Shadows.Firstly, this movie did have its highs and i immensely enjoyed them like its impressive cast. But this movie also had its lows which unfortunately overshadowed the highs (no pun intended). The plot lacked detail and everything seemed to be happening very quickly. It involves a centuries old vampire being set free from his coffin like prison. After this he decides to continue his legacy and help his present descendants prosper in their fishing business. This plot is certainly different and could have been a real success. The characters in this film, mainly the family are developed effectively but no character wowed me. Even though Johhny Depp did deliver his usual brilliance their was a lack of reaction with other character to build interesting relationships.Their was the same dark and slightly wondrous feel to the movie which is no doubt created by the hand of Tim Burton even that couldn't patch the hole in plot development. The ending was somewhat boring and again had no wow factor unlike the epic conclusion in Alice in Wodnerland. It is also a comedy and their is parts where i chuckled a little but the balance that Burton provides between horror and comedy was tipped here with no sense of direction.All in all this movie disappointed me. I was expecting a dark and comedic joy ride with a fantastic climax. But because the movie lacked this i give it a unsatisfying 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Disappointing, not entertaining at all","Vampire Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) awakens from his 200-year sleep and discovers his family is not right and resolves to make the family prosperous again. Not all know he is a vampire.I had no prior knowledge of the Dark Shadows TV show. I didn't know what to expect. All I knew was that Johnny Depp is a good actor and I took a chance hoping that it wasn't scary because, as you know, I need to sleep at night.What it wasn't: Not scary, not funny, and not entertaining. And after all that I had to ask myself: why was this made in the first place? Nothing made sense. A story should have a beginning, a middle and an ending. This had a middle and stayed there as we had nothing to look forward to because the middle never moved anywhere. And, there was no caring for any of the characters because we didn't really get a chance to get to know them. See?I stayed with it for one reason. I did like Johnny Depp's performance with that cadence. If the script was any better this might have had a chance at being entertaining. Didn't happen.One bright spot was a Karen Carpenter song that they let play almost all the way through. Very good, but that was the only bright spot.

Dark Shadows,"Dark Shadows is based on the television series of the same name by Dan Curtis. For those who have never seen, or heard of the Dark Shadows television series, it was a Gothic soap opera that ran from 1966 to 1971. It was followed by the films House of Dark Shadows as well as Night of Dark Shadows and was remade into a television series again in 1991 and a television movie in 2005. Now we have this new theatrical movie version based on the television series which is directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp among it's quite impressive cast. Before seeing this 2012 movie version of Dark Shadows, I had never previously seen the different television shows, or movies that it was based on. I remember seeing the original series from the late 60's on in reruns on some specialty station on television, but I never saw more than a few minutes of it, so I walked into this new movie version not knowing too much about the plot, or back story from the previous films or television series. Also because I have never seen the originals I can not compare this new version to them either. From what I gather the original was done in more of a slow paced style and played out more melodramatically like soap operas usually do. This film version does do a bit of that, but I think unlike the series and movies, this version also incorporates humour into the story as well. This new version of Dark Shadows did not really get good reviews at all. I remember reading numerous bad reviews from critics and even average movie goers who were posting their blogs, or reviews of it online, and did not seem to like it. I fall into another category then because I absolutely loved the film. The fact that it was a Gothic horror costume drama that takes place in the early 1970's mixing the music, dress and culture of that era plus the more macabre events going on as well as some pretty humorous scenes as well, I found myself really enjoying it. For one thing, I really liked the atmosphere and look of the film. With it's great cinematography and visuals the film looked very good and quite appropriate to showing a castle from hundreds of years ago, plus the way they put in elements of the 1970's I felt worked very well and added more fascination and humour to the film as well. The performances from the entire cast were very good. After, I had thought about the film some more, I think I appreciated the performances even more because the actors had to be over the top and melodramatic when delivering their lines, but also do it in such a way as to be believable and realistic. It wasn't the type of melodramatic performances from say Hollywood movies of the 1940's, or 50's that I usually have a problem with. Often, I find that those performances from the older films do not hold up that well compared to today's movies and acting because they often feel dated and the performances lack emotion, or any shred of believability, or realism. It often felt very forced and over done whereas the acting in Dark Shadows does not and I would have to say that the performers do quite a good job and it is a very talented cast. The story to the film I found very compelling and fascinating. It required elements of the macabre and Gothic horror which I found to be fascinating and intriguing and I found that most of the humour that went along with it worked really well also. There were quite a few times when there was a certain line, or moment in the film that put a smile on my face mostly because of the good delivery and performances of the actors. The film managed to be dark and creepy, but never actually scaring, or disturbing us, or going over the top with violence, or gore. The film is fairly over the top in it's storytelling style, but it never took the easy way out by using expensive special effects and lots of gore. Instead it focuses on a well put together story that drew me in and captured my interest to the end. I was enjoying this film so much and found it so entertaining that afterwards I thought to myself about what critics did not like about it. Perhaps they just did not get it. I found everything worked together so well and was put on by a marvelously talented cast and crew that I never did find much faults, or criticisms about the film. Instead, I found it entertaining from start to finish and it really fascinated me with it's original and fascinating storytelling and it's unique delivering of how it went about telling us this story. I loved the acting, music, scenery and pretty much everything about the film. I know I am going to receive a lot of flack about this, but I would have to say that I loved Dark Shadows. Every minute of it and I am not ashamed to admit that. This film as it seems is certainly not for everyone, but I for one adored it because of it's sheer entertainment and fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Especially when he was taking his first breakfast on the dinner table. Of course, listing Depp in a film would never make it less interesting. The other characters would certainly play so good role too. It's kinda a very funny humorous film implemented in a complete plot of the Collins-Witch revenges. It was a very nice story, and happened to be a very good use of CGI too. You would definitely find it very entertaining.

An original DS fan who loved the Dark Shadows movie!,"Yes, I was one of those running home from school to watch Dark Shadows each day! I bought the DVD collection and have my husband hooked on it now. I was almost afraid to see this movie after reading all of the early comments after seeing the trailers, but there was no way I would have missed it. What great fun! Except for a few character changes that I was not happy with, such as Julia Hoffman and Roger Collins, it was a wonderful and entertaining two hours! No one will ever replace the original but this was an excellent twist. I actually hated the House of Dark Shadows movie because it turned my favorite characters and the great story lines of the series into a mindless bloodbath. The Ben Cross revival mini series was lame compared to the original. This time, Burton and Depp took a different approach and added some comedy to balance the drama.

We skipped the light fang-Dango,"A movie about a whiter shade of paleI must admit that I never watched the original ""Dark Shadows"" (1966-1971), as I spent decades ignoring soap operas and most weekly serial entertainment programs except for a few classics.

He is boxed for a couple of hundred years and on his return, he now must cope with a new world and his reencounter with his gorgeous lustful nemesis.This looks like it is probably a pilot for a new series of films like his previous ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series.Now I want the soundtrack. I have most of the songs now, but it is a nice mixture and will remind me of the movie.""The Secret Room""

Utterly disappointing,"From the trailer, I was expecting Tim Burton to re-conjure up his clever supernatural formula of his 1988's BEETLEJUICE. I knew that he was going to take a comedic direction as compared to the serious Gothic thriller versions of the 60s and 90s TV series . However, Burton failed to make this one work, much less a big screen version to the successful series. In fact, I would be so generous as to say that the trailer makes better sales pitch than the movie itself.But apparently I was sheep enough to be deceived by its sly marketing.Ghosts, witches, vampires and werewolves would certainly make good concoctions for an interesting supernatural movie premise after the recent splash of the superhero ensemble that was THE AVENGERS. But it seems that that was pure wishful thinking. I was bored to my bones and uninterested throughout the entire movie. I found myself practically praying when the movie is going to end as my focus was beginning to drain out.On another level, it's quite plain to see that the Burton-Depp collaboration has been definitely been exhausted. I mean I should have seen the tell-tale signs that their so-called ""professional marriage made in cinema heaven"" had faded when they did the trying-too-hard screen version of the musical SWEENEY TODD. It seems like their last best project together would have to be SLEEPY HOLLOW and whatever they do afterwards seems to be forced. It's as if Hollywood itself is the mastermind that makes them keep up with the charades.Strangely enough, it was Depp himself who jokingly hinted on E! that his collaboration with Burton seems to be failing like many Hollywood marital affairs. And it was proved a true revelation in this latest box-office bomb (to me, at least).Like many others who flocked early to get the tickets, I was really anticipating a fun journey. Instead, all we got was an arid unimpressive trip into oblivion. I suppose those who among the lucky ones to have snapped up tickets to sold-out shows really deserved the junk that we saw on screen.As colourful as the poster might have looked the only vibrance about DARK SHADOWS were the 70s costumes and Helena Bonham Carter's rich makeup. Even those did not feel authentic to the era other than tunes by The Carpenters.I must say that it was a terrible waste of talents to be in this excuse of a ""dark comedy"". From Michelle Pfeiffer to the gorgeous Eva Green and cameos by Christopher Lee and the original ""Barnabas Collins"", Jonathan Frid (who passed on following the wrap-up). At the risk of sounding cruel I suppose his demise was probably due his disappointment Burton's treatment to his original series. And even Alice Cooper's presence did not particularly grace the film with his homage to the age of rock-and-rock of the 70s.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
It's such an excellent movie with Johnny's amazing acting!,"When I saw the trailer of this movie, I immediately fell in love with this movie as I thought the storyline of the movie was extraordinary and seemed to be interesting! I was really looking forward to Dark Shadows at that time! Fortunately, this movie doesn't disappoint me.Firstly, for the storyline of the movie, it is interesting that there is a great contrast between the lifestyles of the vampire Barnabas and the Collins. The whole cinema is fulfilled with laughters!Although there are many scenes that make us, the audience laugh, there are still something I think can be better. For the plot of the movie, I believe that the director or the script-writer may want to focus on how Barnabas helps his family to restore their glory and ""defeat"" their enemy, Angelique. However, the plot of the movie is not that smooth since the movie has been talked about many points which are not that necessary like how the Collins holds a party. Therefore, I think the movie does not have a clear message which is to be brought out.Apart from some unnecessary in the movie, I do think that the love between Barnabas and Victoria(Josette) is touching! 200 years ago, they were together and loved each other very much. Just because of Anglique, they were separated. 200 years later, Barnabas and Victoria which look similar as Josette fall in love again but Angelique comes across and makes Victoria jumps from the cliff! Luckily,Victoria doesn't die and be with her lover Barnabas this time! It 's just so touching that they can still be together if they love each other no matter how many 200 years are separating them!Last but not least, I do appreciate how Johnny Depp acts out the character Barnabas Collins. He acts out the character naturally and can match with the tone of the movies. His acting skills is just so amazing. I am looking forward to seeing him to get an Oscar in the future and I believe that he will definitely win one very soon!I think Eva Green can also act out the witch Angelique. She makes me hate the character at the beginning but soon I think that her character is not that bad and she just wants the one she loves can love her. To conclude, Dark Shadows is a wonderful movie about vampire which makes people like me who don't really enjoy watching movie related to vampire to buy a ticket to support it. It's really a movie of a big family and a romantic story! I do love it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
another Burton-Depp collaboration,"I agree with some of the reviews, that ""Dark Shadows"" director Tim Burton didn't know if he was doing a camp comedy, a horror film, a romance, or a drama.He would have been best to go with the camp comedy in this 2012 film, since that comes off the best. Loved Barnabas experiencing McDonald's and television and thinking the Carpenters worked with wood. I loved the 1972 settings and references. And I loved the soundtrack.There are lots of special effects here, some are fun, some just aren't. I saw this as a rental and I think it probably comes off much better as a rental.Johnny Depp is sheer perfection, so serious, so intense, you can't help but laugh at some of his line deliveries.The rest of the performances are fine, but Depp is fabulous.Depp obviously loves working with Burton and vice versa, but let's face it, not all of their work together is inspired. This film is based on a flimsy script that could have been so much better, if only Burton had decided on which way he wanted to go. The comedy stuff was great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"""Women don't care about money, man... or sheep...""","1770's. The aristocratic Barnabas, whose family founded the small harbor town of Collinsport, has a tawdry affair with one of his maids(who feels scorned by the higher-ups, thus going into the class struggle), and when he breaks it off, he finds that she was a witch(Eva Green, whose wicked smile sends chills down your spine), and... she doesn't take it well. She places a curse on his entire line, kills his parents and fiancée, Josette(another beautiful young woman... Tim has taste...! And Chloë Grace Moretz is... still jailbait, oops) and turns him into a creature of the night. She has him trapped in a chained-shut coffin, where he remains for two centuries. Waking up, he finds it to be the 1970's(something that this draws surprisingly few jokes from... heck, half of them are in the trailer; it's mostly the backdrop(the production design of this is great, costumes, sets... they built this city! No, I don't know if they used rock 'n roll!), and this whole thing is a love-letter to the decade... the soundtrack is fantastic, and from that period as well), and he must familiarize himself with this new time(Johnny Depp is impeccable at portraying eccentrics, so why this is the first time he was cast as a 200-year-old fish-out-of-water vampire(and this doesn't shy away from the blood-sucking and tragic nature thereof, he is conflicted and we can't view him quite as a role model) is anyone's guess), and when he finds his beloved estate, Collinwood, in disrepair and the family(a big theme in this is the strength of such) connected by little other than blood relation, he vows to improve both to their destined high stature. And there he also meets a woman who looks just like his lost love, and he falls for her. This is based on the show of the same name, I'm told, though I know little about it and can draw no comparisons. There are a few interesting characters, such as Elizabeth(Michelle Pfeiffer), the strong, independent woman who was the head of the Collins' until the return of the patriarch. I like Jackie Earle Haley who plays Willie Loomis, the drunken caretaker... in other roles. Several jokes and gags genuinely fall flat. Is this a black, campy comedy(and Burton brings his sometimes dirty sense of humor, along with his visual flair and signature style)? Yes. But it's also fantasy(there are mysteries and most of the main players have a secret each... and the majority are cool), a dark love story and a soap opera-ish drama. The climax is very nicely done, and this has some truly memorable, inspired sights(such as the sex scene between our two supernatural leads you see in the previews, with them throwing each other into walls, rolling on the ceiling, etc.). There is some bloody violence, disturbing content and mild to moderate language in this. I recommend this to fans of the director and/or the star. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Just Awful,"I was probably more excited than anyone when I heard a new Dark Shadows movie was going to be made. I was even more excited to learn Johnny Depp was behind it. WIth his clout in Hollywood, and his fan base, I knew the movie would get the needed financial backing and draw a crowd at the theaters. This was going to be great.Then I heard Tim Burton was signed on. It never occurred to me, and I suppose it should have, that he would bring Tim Burton into the fold. Tim has done some great work - Sleepy Hollow is a favorite of mine, except the scene with the old witch who was a talking skull whose eyes and tongue popped out (stupid) this was a great film. Once I heard Tim was on board I knew the stupidity would commence and the film would be ruined. I really hoped Depp wouldn't allow ""Stupid Burton Tricks"" in this film. They were both supposed to be fans of the show. Clearly, they weren't. They just made the claim to win over TRUE Dark Shadows fans. It is unfortunate that Depp allowed Burton to ruin what could have been a great film. It's unfortunate Burton was ever signed on to the project.The other reviews here give enough examples of the stupidity I refer to. I had hopes for new blood for Dark Shadows. A new future, with new stories. Now I can only hope we won't have to endure a sequel as well.Thanks Tim for driving a stake through the heart of my childhood memories.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

A Winner!,"Based on the Gothic soap opera of the same name that was produced for television between 1966 and 1971, Tim Burton's 'Dark Shadows' is A Winner! An Entertaining, Dark & Moody Horror-Comedy, that is spell-binding in its own world.'Dark Shadows' Synopsis: An imprisoned vampire, Barnabas Collins, is set free and returns to his ancestral home, where his dysfunctional descendants are in need of his protection.'Dark Shadows' has its own mood. Its for the Tim Burton Fanatics, who vow to appreciate the filmmaker for his own vision, which in my opinion, is bombastic & no-holds-barred. 'Dark Shadows' is Dark, Moody, Violent & Extremely Entertaining. The pure imagination of the Legendary filmmaker is visible in each & every frame. Fantastic Work!Seth Grahame-Smith's Screenplay is entertaining & spooky. Bruno Delbonnel's Cinematography is atmospheric. Chris Lebenzon's Editing is sharp. Art & Costume Design, are Oscar-Worthy.Performance-Wise: Burton gives Johnny Depp the best opportunities & Depp is simply mesmerizing as the imprisoned vampire, Barnabas Collins. Depp, An Acting God, lives the an unlikely protagonist in the most attractive manner. Depp is masterful all through. Eva Green has never been this evil before & she is absolutely delicious in here. She's twisted, wicked & ruthless, delivering a career-best turn. Bella Heathcote is fabulous. Michelle Pfeiffer lends grace to her character. Helena Bonham Carter is always flawless. Jackie Earle Haley is decent. Chloë Grace Moretz has emerged into a terrific performer & she does exceedingly well. Gulliver McGrath is perfect. The Magnificent Christopher Lee appears in a cameo.Call it flawed & dark, I enjoyed Burton's interpretation of a complicated tale lasting centuries & Depp's masterful take on a cursed vampire.

Terrible! Terrible! Terrible!,"As a person who watched Dark Shadows in the beginning when it first was on TV it was a great disappointment to watch this movie.

A great movie in itself...,"I remember watching the 1991 series and was quite fond of it, especially because of the acting by Ben Cross and Lysette Anthony, and it had a really interesting plot. So I was really curious to see how the concept would fare under Tim Burtons dark, twisted, surreal touch. Don't get me wrong, I am big fan of Burton and enjoy most of his previous work.I will say that you should not hold the 1991 series up against this 2012 movie version, that is sort of a mistake. I haven't seen the 1966 running series, so I can't compare anything to that. Where as the 1991 series was more Gothic dark romance, this 2012 movie does have that, but adds some of Burtons dark humor as well, which most of the times does work out well enough. Just don't do what I did, and draw similarities between the two.If you just watch the 2012 movie as a stand-alone movie, it is actually good entertainment. It has a great story that doesn't really require a lot of thinking on the viewer's part. It is just sit back and enjoy the movie. But what amazed me in it, as with most of Burton's work, is the level of details in everything. The Collin's mansion for example, wow, it was just off the charts. It had such a great wonderful touch to it, dark and mysterious, yet grand and ancestral at the same time.As with the classic Burton movie, you have Johnny Depp (playing Barnabas Collins) and Helena Bonham Carter (playing Dr. Julia Hoffman) in it, and as always they deliver a great performance, both individually and together on the screen. But ""Dark Shadows"" also boasts other impressive names, Michelle Pfeiffer (playing Elizabeth Collins Stoddard), Jackie Earle Haley (playing Willie Loomis), Chloë Grace Moretz (playing Carolyn Stoddard), and also two great appearances by Christopher Lee (playing Clarney) and Alice Cooper (as himself, just in a 1972 version!).Personally I found the comedy in the movie a little bit misplaced, because I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to laugh or take it seriously. (I didn't laugh, though!) I will say that without the comedy, the movie would have fared a bit better than it did. Perhaps I just didn't appreciate the comedy in a movie of this genre and caliber, but who knows, you might just enjoy it and find it funny.""Dark Shadows"" is definitely a great movie to watch, it is entertaining and interesting, and it doesn't really put vampires up as teenage idols with sparkly skin and big hair - so it is a great step back to the original charismatic and devilish creatures that vampires should be. And it is a movie well worth a place in any movie collection both for fans of Burton, Depp, Bonham Carter, or not. I will definitely watch this movie again, just to pay extra attention to the details in the shots.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
What a disappointment,"Having been raised on the original Dark Shadows TV series and having seen the original dark shadows movie (btw, it was done MUCH better than this farce) I was disappointed... in the roles Jonny Depp and Tim Burton played in bringing this mockery to the theater. It bears VERY little resemblance to ANY of the original series or movie, and that resemblance is only in the names of the characters.How a Gothic romance horror can be turned into this joke of a movie is beyond my ability to comprehend. there was no horror and very little ""goth"" or romance. I understand the need to ""modernize"" a movie to make it appealing to a different generation, but this is not modernization, it is butchery. Would you approve of the works of Shakespeare being butchered in such a way? The tell tale heart turned into a comedy with NO resemblance to the original work? No..My advice to all those who loved the original series OR the original movie? No not watch this, you will /wrists before the movie is even 1/2 way through.And Tim Burton? Jonny Depp?

Thoroughly enjoyable.,"Despite the scathing criticism that the movie received, I went ahead and watched it. I'm a lifelong Depp fan, and there's nothing like Burton's amazing style... what's the worst that could happen?I actually thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was a little queer, a little weird, a little spooky... and it was funny. It made me laugh, and it made me laugh again - which is common for Burton-Depp movies - they have a tang and feel to them that just works for me. So, I was expecting great things, and they delivered, magnificently. I haven't seen the Soap Opera, nor do I intend to - the movie said it all for me, and more. It was witty and quirky, and made me think about things I had thought about before, but in a different way, from another direction. I didn't find it over-the-top, or corny, though as another reviewer said, in parts, you could almost feel the mechanics behind the movements of some of the actors.Overall, I found it well-written and directed for a movie based on a television show. It gave enough to explain what was happening and why, without leaving the watcher with the urge to watch the program for more information and explanation. I think it was well-casted - the children were cute and believable, and the 70's culture-shock that you got from some characters was exactly what I expected it'd be like. I wasn't disappointed, and though I wouldn't call it Depp or Burton's best work - I can say that I'd watch it again with enthusiasm.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"The Vampire, The Witch and The Dysfunctional Family","Horror-comedy involving various supernatural creatures, this is Tim Burton at his best. Burton does not set to direct perfect films he directs how he sees them, he and Johnny Depp really treated this film like their baby. Having not seen the original yet, so not knowing how faithful it is, this review is judging this as a stand-alone.The cast and characters are all excellent; they all have their moment to shine. Johnny Depp is excellent as always, not his best performance however he clearly cares about the Barnabas Collins character. Eva Green is like an exaggerated version of Glenn Close from Fatal Attraction, perfect choice as the evil witch. Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful as the family matriarch Elizabeth, this woman does not seem to age. Chloe Moretz is great as a moody teenager, clearly hiding a secret. Bella Heathcote is lovely as Victoria/Josette, so sweet and likable it is no question why Barnabas falls in love with her. Helena Bonham Carter is hilarious as an alcoholic doctor, Johnny Lee Miller is great as a selfish low-life, Jackie Earl Haley is well cast in a small but effective role as a scruffy caretaker.Tim Burton's visual work amazingly as usual, every shot in the film is beautiful and artistic. The film is not as over colourful the advertising makes it out to be, just in certain parts, a lot of the colours are actually washed out, in a good way so you won't get a headache. The songs used in the trailers are present in the film, not in the same context, mainly during short montages and they are not overlong as many people are making them out to be. The Collins mansion is very well design, it almost a character itself in the film. The opening credits are very simple compared to Burton's usual opening credits, which is simply following Heathcote through her journey to the Collins with Nights in White Satin playing.Any criticisms I can think are nit-picks; looking at it from a critical point-of-view the mixed reception is understandable. As a big fan of shows like Buffy and True Blood, and just like them you can nit-pick this film till you bleed but that is missing the point. It's not meant to be taken seriously, it's over-the-top, it's fun, it's got clichés and some decent metaphors involving family problems.The climax was awesome and over-the-top action and CGI. It kind of reminded me of Jan De Bont's remake of The Haunting, I know it's a bad comparison because that film is horrible, however it works here because Jan De Bont expected his audience to take it seriously; Burton does not he knew his film was silly and took advantage of it. There are complaints of the climax involving a twist of Chloe Moretz's character, yeah it's very sudden but has a great metaphor behind it, especially when Pfeiffer finds out. The CGI effects are quite obvious, however it fits the tone so you won't care; it's still 10x better than The Haunting.If I had to nit-pick I would say that because there is so many characters their moments felt kind of forced and rushed but I expected that, the story is very slight but this isn't meant to be Memento, and it does feel like it ends too suddenly but it's kind of bittersweet. And leaves it open for a sequel or let you decide what happens next.This film is an escape not meant to be picked apart, just to be enjoyed with an extra large popcorn. After all films are made for entertainment, it doe not have to teach lessons, make sense or be analysed. Just play to your certain interests, that's where the film succeeds.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Worth the watch if you appreciate Tim Burton,"Any time Tim Burton and Johnny Depp work together on a movie it's usually a recipe for entertainment. Dark Shadows is their latest collaboration in a long list of titles. Starting with Edward Scissorhands, and including titles such as Sleepy Hollow, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Alice in Wonderland. Dark Shadows does not disappoint. It's a great dark comedy with several unexpected laughs and twists.In Dark Shadows, Johnny Depp's character, Barnabas Collins, is a man from the mid-1700s. Barnabas comes from a wealthy fishing family that built their town named Collinsport. He is unfortunate enough to scorn a woman named Angelique; who just so happens to be a witch. Angelique kills his parents and true love after he refuses her. She then curses Barnabas; turning him into a vampire. Rallying the townspeople against him she has him chained in a coffin and buried alive. In 1972, nearly two hundred years later, he is accidentally unearthed by some unlucky construction workers. A series of mishaps and conflicts ensue as Barnabas tries to regain the Collins' family business, and restore their home. The entire family is still being plagued by Angelique after all these years; leaving the audience speculating as to what could happen next. Anything can happen when you take a trip in the twisted mind of Tim Burton.The characters were well casted. Johnny Depp, as always, is very believable as Barnabas Collins. His quirky personality shows a wide range of emotions that truly brought Barnabas to life or death. There is a wide range of experienced supporting actors; including Michelle Pfeiffer. Her character, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, is the current head of the Collins' family. She is a strong woman with a dry; sarcastic wit. The cast was further enriched by Helena Bonham Carter as the hilarious drunken psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman, and Jackie Earle Haley, the Collins' confused, always intoxicated servant, Willie Loomis. As far as villains go, Eva Green was an excellent choice to portray Angelique Bouchard. Her facial expressions and mannerisms alone were worthy of any evil witch. The chemistry between the cast is undeniable, and adds to the charm and believability of the characters.However, Dark Shadows is a comedy, and although there were several laugh out loud moments; it still left a little lacking in that department. The plot came across a little rushed in parts. More time was spent than necessary explaining things that were not key to the outcome, and not enough clarification on things that were. The ending was definitely more abrupt than expected. Mr. Burton could have gone into more detail with the final scene.Overall, if you enjoyed Tim Burton's work on his previous films, Dark Shadows is a worthy addition to his collection, and deserves at least one viewing. It's entertaining and comedic with a great cast. The concept is different and not overplayed; as many films seem to be these days. Dark Shadows would make a great choice to watch when you are having a bad day. It's definitely better to watch with a friend, so you have someone to share in the madness and laughter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Dismal stuff.,"I usually like the Burton/Depp combination, sometimes a lot, sometimes not so much, but this, I'm afraid, is very poor stuff indeed. I have no idea what Burton was aiming for, but the general ambiance is of a low-grade afternoon TV film aimed at the early-teen market. The female characters were straight out of ""Bewitched"", and many of the special effects were a mishmash of ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Death Becomes Her"" coated in the usual Burton eye-shadow (not intrinsically a bad thing, but now starting to look like last year's ""colourway""). There is no character or plot development, the film is neither scary nor humorous. Would uncritical twelve year olds like it? I don't know, but it's not for critical adults, that's for sure.

For fans of Burton it can't be labeled anything but a disappointment!,"'DARK SHADOWS': Three Stars (Out of Five)Tim Burton and Johnny Depp team together once again to bring the popular 1960's horror soap opera (of the same name) to the big screen in campy spoof form. Fans of the original series will most likely not be pleased by Burton's rendition of the melodramatic soap as it lacks strong character development as well as story structure and never takes the material seriously in the slightest. The film was written by Seth Grahame-Smith and John August (both future and past Burton collaborators on other films as well) and co-stars the likes of Eva Green, Michelle Pfeiffer, Chloe Grace Moretz, Jackie Earl Haley, Johnny Lee Miller, Bella Heathcote and of course Helena Bonham Carter (Burton's mainstay and partner). The film will most likely let down Burton and Depp fans as well, although Depp is good in the film like always.The story focuses on Barnabas Collins (Depp), a rich playboy in 1752 who breaks the heart of a servant named Angelique Bouchard (Green), who also happens to be a witch. Out of anger and jealousy Angelique curses Barnabas to be a vampire and causes his one true love to commit suicide. She then convinces the townspeople to turn against him and bury him alive. Barnabas is trapped, chained in a coffin, for centuries until he is freed by some construction workers in 1972. He then returns to his estate to find it in ruins and under the hands of his depressed distant relatives, lead by Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Pfeiffer). Barnabas must then do battle with Angelique once again in order to save his new family.The film is darker than I was expecting! Depp's Barnabas is not a good vampire like the trailers lead you to believe; he murders and feeds on innocent victims and yet he is the film's hero. Depp is hilarious in the role and the 'fish out of water' humor does work for the most part but the rest of the story does not. It has no direction and seems to just consist of a bunch of random scenes thrown together. Burton's directing is not efficient and I actually found the film quite boring at times. Still Green looks gorgeous, it's nice to see Pfeiffer working again and the rest of the cast is adequate. The film just had potential to be a lot more and for fans of Burton it can't be labeled anything but a disappointment.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01kYho5uKO8",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Fans of the TV show beware. Burton fans beware. Depp fans, he's not bad!","Dark Shadows (2012) A part spoof, part earnest (oddly) vampire movie with only a few of the twists and visual effects you'd expect from director Tim Burton. The year? 1971. The source? American television.Mostly there's Johnny Depp, who again lifts his movie into something watchable. Depp's deadpan humor, with an old school British accent, is killer. He's a vampire, for sure (you can't see him in reflections, and he's not so good with sunlight) but he's got justice on his side, and a sense of family loyalty that goes beyond the Corleone flavor. He broods. He means well.When Depp's character, Barnabas Collins, gets a second chance to win back his honor and his love, it's in coastal Maine, where his nemesis, a centuries old witch, runs the competing fishing cannery. Yes, there's some silliness here, but in movie form it's too grandiose. This is totally t.v. material and here it doesn't get funny or campy or weird enough to work.There are some short scenes that are hilarious, like the lines about ""Love Story"" (which young viewers won't get) or when Collins tries to learn about contemporary life from some pretty convincing second-rate hippies. Sometimes it's a bit of special effects overkill with creatures coming to life from the woodwork of the old house, or with Helena Bonham Carter at something less than her best as a cookey psychoanalyst. (To be sure, when Carter is not her best, she's still pretty good.) Michelle Pfeiffer is a wonderful matriarch, and the evil witch is played with good bad energy by Eva Green.The big problem? This is a Tim Burton movie that lacks the originality of something like ""Edward Scissorhands."" I mean, what was he thinking? Still, for pure mindless fun, especially if you don't know the t.v. show, it might be worth a drive-in kind of night out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A beautiful but boring production of vampires and witches and love and other nonsense,"I'm assuming it's the recent obsession with vampires, including teenage vampire love and nonsensical vampire lore, that has made it okay to make movies based on bad 1960s horror-drama soap operas. I had also assumed that Tim Burton's remake of ""Dark Shadows"" would be a comedy. In that case, at least, I was wrong. Unfortunately, the film stayed faithful to the original and was more soap opera-like than comedic.Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is from the 1770s but had a curse placed on him (because of unrequited love) and is pulled from his coffin as a vampire in 1972. There are a few quick jokes making fun of the 1970s and the changing of the times, and then sprinkled throughout there are a handful of funny one-liners as Barnabas comes to terms with the new-age world. I would have actually preferred the movie if that was the entire thing. But instead it was mostly about rich families trying to maintain their wealth and control their fortune and status in a small community. It's also about vampires and witches falling in love and determining their destiny.These characters really don't do anything interesting so I certainly don't care about their future, whether it's a lack of a future or an eternal future. Again, as a comedy, it could have at least been entertaining. Being a Tim Burton film though, he obviously cares more about the visuals than the characters or the story. It was a fairly detailed atmosphere, combining mystery-like illustrated art work with 1970s lavish musical sets.The costuming was pretty exquisite. Over-the-top in some cases, but I'm assuming that was the point. The best part was the stylistic flair to Eva Green's witch named Angelique. The clothes and make-up alone defined that character. And that was counteracted with this ethereal beauty of Bella Heathcote and her innocent and unadorned love. I have singled those two actresses out because they were the only two that tried to make this movie interesting on some level.Since costumes don't comprise an entire movie, the rest was the soundtrack. Littered with catchy pop tunes, we were supposed to be singing along to songs that defined a generation. Obviously that last bit is an exaggeration, but the influence on the movie is not. There was even an entire Alice Cooper concert thrown in just for the fun of it. ""Dark Shadows"" was made just for the fun of it all, but why wasn't it more funny?",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Mildly Entertaining - especially for Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fans.,"I have never seen the TV series of Dark Shadows but have seen all of the movies that Tim Burton had directed (all except Ed Wood, one of TB's finest, yet don't ask me why.) Compared with his more recent movies, I would put Dark Shadows somewhere between Sweeney Todd and Charlie & The Chocolate Factory/Alice in Wonderland in terms of entertainment value and classic Tim Burton.However, I must admit that due to the poor reviews by critics, the movie's poor trailer and the memory of disappointment generated from seeing his last few movies, I went to see this one with much lowered expectations.During the first half of the movie, I was mildly entertained and was thinking:""This isn't so bad, I'm quite liking it."" Perhaps the best part was its middle, when we were treated with a montage displaying the high point of the film - when Barnabas has just been inducted into the Collins family and was seen taking charge in reviving the family to its former wealth and glory. The segment was appropriately accompanied by The Carpenters song ""Top of the World.""Unfortunately, as the name of that song suggests for us - there is only one way to go when you are at the top of the world - and hence the movie just went downhill from there on. It became neither funny nor serious, character-driven nor plot driven. It just doesn't know where to go and became quite a mess that stopped building interest for the audience. It became a personal performance reel for Johnny Depp's Barnabas.With all said, I still think the movie isn't bad, there are some endearing aspects that is hard for me to put into words. Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe it's Tim Burton's resistance of growing up as an artist/director. The odd thing is, I don't wish for anything better despite its flaws.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
What a waste of time,"The decision to watch Dark Shadows was not based on the fact that it starred Johnny Depp, although this is a reason for some to go to the cinemas. Now the presence of Michelle Pfeiffer (Who played Catwoman and to me is the best portrayal till date) was as incentive but the main reason I actually opted to see this was because it was done by Tim Burton.Tim Burton is known for his Gothic movies and this is no exception, one of my favourite Tim Burton movie is still The Nightmare Before Christmas. Other greats by Tim Burton are Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992) and my all time favourite Beetlejuice (I have a lot of Tim Burton favourites).Well enough of Tim let's get talking about Dark Shadows, the movie is based on a soap opera of the same name that premiered on ABC between 1966 and 1971. Funny although Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is the main character in this movie in the soap he was introduced in the second season and grew to become one of the main character.I haven't seen any of the episodes in the series but if the movie is anything like the series then I wonder...This is the Eight (if am not mistaken) movie that Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have made together and it is one of the worst I have seen from both.The main issue about the movie isn't the theme, the theme is actually well crafted and I give kudos to the customer designer and the set manager, but the movie is so unevenly paced one time you are excited then next you are dragged into a long conversation.The Vampire has some tricks up its sleeves other than the fact that he could make you his zombie (which he did enough times in the movie), he could also bore you to death (which he did throughout the movie).The story goes thus: In the 18th century the Collins built a huge fortune in the fishing industry in Maine. A witch (Eva Green) falls in love with Barnabas (Johnny Depp) the son of Mr. Collins, but he turned her down after some..She out of anger and jealousy kills everything Barnabas loves, including his parents his wife and she did the one thing that witches have not been able to do for a while now, she transforms him into a vampire and had him buried alive. (Witches turning men into vampires, where have I heard that before? Oh! yeah no where) We are now in the 70s and Barnabas is dug out. He reunites with his weird descendants and begins plotting his return to power. Also in these 196 years in the ground the witch still was alive.Will I still watch another Tim Burton movie? Hell yeah! Alice in Wonderland (which he did with Johnny Depp) is still the eleventh highest grossing, movie in the world, so Tim has got it in him to make a masterpiece just that this movie is 3 stars from being one.If we point our focus on Depp and rest of the crew, it was a share waste of talent. Having Pfeiffer and Eva Green and making no good use of them is amazing. Depp's movie before this was The Rum Diary a movie I still don't get.All in all I won't waste a dime on this movie this I tell you.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Great Gothic Romp,"Despite the very disappointing and unpromising trailers that tried to make this movie look like a spoof or satire, Tim Burton has actually created a very worthy tribute to the late 60s TV cult classic. The characters names remain the same and some even resemble the originals (ex. Roger Collins). Even names of minor locations (Windcliff Santorium, Blue Whale pub, Widow's Hill) remain the same. Of course, some composite characters and unique plot lines are used trying to cram 1500 plus episodes into 2 hours. As a fan of the TV series and Tim Burton, I am pleased with the outcome. The soundtrack is amazing with great songs from the era. Alice Cooper is a very good choice for the Collin's ""happening"" as he is the Godfather of Goth. So, if you are a fan of ""Dark Shadows"", don't be dissuaded by the trailers and go and see this dark gem.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Surprisingly Very Very Good,"I really liked this movie. It's about a weird family becoming introduced to a vampire and his community.I thought it was very well made. I like the weird family aspect to it. It's happy but weird at the same time. Johnny Depp is great in it, and so is Michelle Pffifer.It's surprisingly good. I would recommend you watch it today. I don't say that often.7 stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Despite an excellent performance by Depp, like his character, the film is just a little lifeless.","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have a long, quirky history spanning over twenty years now, from the brilliant (""Edward Scissorhands"") to the disappointing (""Alice in Wonderland""). And although both have a resume with more positives than negatives, Burton still directed ""Planet of the Apes"" while Depp should desperately want to take ""The Tourist"" off his list (and while he's at it, every single Caribbean movie).So, when ""Dark Shadows"" was announced some time ago, I was sceptically excited, as I assumed it would probably be great, but hey, both names have stumbled. Then Michelle Pfeiffer got added to the mix, and anticipation grew (because, c'mon, MICHELLE PFEIFFER!) and then Chloe Grace Moretz! Suddenly, May 11th, 2012 was steaming with excitement for me! So, now that the day has come and gone, how do I feel? Well, to be honest, slight disappointment.""Dark Shadows,"" based on the uber-cheesy series which aired from 1966 to 1971, has all the right ingredients, but instead of cooking it on high, it was brought to a boil on medium, and thus watching it sadly became tedious at times. A few bubbles would pop up, but then you go back to watching a film that slowly heats up as you look at the clock.Barnabas Collins, as played by Depp, returns to Collinsport in 1972 after having spent two centuries underground, having been put there by a witch, Angelique. After being dug up by an excavation crew (who suffer the consequences dearly), Collins returns to the house he built to find his descendant s still live there, although not nearly as lavishly as when he was ""alive."" Head of the household Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, played beautifully in a more-than-welcome return of the magnificent Michelle Pfeiffer, is struggling to keep the family above water. When Collins arrives and persuades her that he is who he says he is, she opens the doors to the family home to him on his promise that he will revive the family fortune.A fortune taken away by the very witch that entombed him.I have felt over the last few years that Depp had pretty much exhausted every quirky character he could. The biggest disappointment of ""Alice in Wonderland"" was that, for the first time, he brought nothing original to a role. It was merely an amalgamation of characters we had already seen him do. Such is not the case with Barnabas Collins. As a vampire waking up in 1972, I cannot think of a more perfect actor to play the fish-out-of-water scenario than Depp, and his execution was exquisite.To see Pfeiffer back on the big screen (her last starring role in a major film was 2007's brilliant ""Stardust"") is nothing short of a dream, and her role as the family matriarch is nothing short of perfect. And the woman still looks phenomenal.Chloe Grace Moretz (""Kick-Ass,"" ""Hugo"") never ceases to amaze me, and I cannot help but think this young lady could fill the gap left by Lindsay Lohan....that of a young actress with so much incredible acting talent, you cannot help but see Oscars in her future. As rebellious daughter Carolyn, Moretz absolutely controls every single scene she appears in.Of course, for comic relief, the always pitch-perfect Jackie Earle Haley as Willi Loomis, not to mention Eva Green's just-fine performance as witch Angelique and an impressive major-motion picture debut by ""Neighbour""'s alum, Bella Heathcote.So, with all this star power and direction by Tim Burton, why is my reaction not complete exasperation? As I said, the film just moves far too slowly. Despite excellent performances all around, a great story, a script that is clever and crisp and refreshingly funny while staying absolutely true to the concept of the original series in every way, it may have tried a little too hard to be as quirky and cheesy as the TV series, thus lending to a film that seems like an episode that was stretched just a wee bit too long. The whole knock at 1972 never becomes tiresome or less amusing, even though the film itself does as time drags on.So, that is the one critique I have. A film filled with excellence in acting, writing and, with incredible special effects and outstanding cinematography, an absolute visual pleasure! But, despite all this, it just sadly took too slow a pace to get to the point. So, the film is good. Not great, but good, simply because Burton focused on the ingredients, and while doing a superb job, simply forgot to turn up the heat.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Quite delightful throughout,"Liked the story. It's 90% dark comedy and it works especially with the 18th Century vampire adapting to the 1970s. The humor is quite sophisticated. As expected the Tim Burton style and effects don't disappoint.Johnny Depp carries the movie. Eva Green is quite good as the witch. She is better in these kinds of monstrous roles. What they did to her reminds me of ""Death Becomes Her"". Michelle Pfeiffer is still lovely in a natural way. Chloe Moretz is still cute.Some reviews say it lost steam but I think it was alright. Could have had a bit more good lines from the supporting cast though. Worth a watch for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
disappointment,"I'm a big time Burton fan, even have a tattoo of TNBC but this film is lame and I'm getting really really bored of the j depp and h b carter characters in EVERY single one of his films, both good actors but jeez cast some fresh faces Tim tired old relationships Alice, Charlie and the chocolate factory, corpse bride, dark shadow, Sweeney Todd feels a bit like watching an extended version of the same film except it gets more tedious and boring, will definitely not sit through this rubbish again!!!!!only small saving grace is a fairly good performance by Chloe grace Moretz and a OK performance by Michelle Pfeifer, otherwise boring. the only thing this film offers that differs from the usual Tim Burton styling is less light and more shad, in most of his films there is an equal balance of bright colours (in corpse bride the underworld was colourful in image and in soul compared to the surface world where everything was grey!) Johhny Depp as Barnabus is dull as a vampire, overacted and far too much make up with far too much obvious confusion when he comes to the more modern world, no surprises and none of his his usual unexpected wit, the jokes are not funny and i think 4 year olds would be able to guess the plot as it unfolds!",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Tribute to original Dark Shadows,"I saw Dark Shadows yesterday, and I wasn't sure if it was going to be a good or bad movie based on the crappy preview, BUT I have to say the preview gives the actual movie little justice. It showed many of the jokes in the movie but none of the really good parts. The movie is amazing, everyone should go see it, Johnny Depp really payed tribute to the original series, Depp was even able to get down some of the mannerisms of the original Barnabas. Sure some of the things are slightly different, but it doesn't matter because the movies is so well made. Plus to top it all off, Alice Cooper was in the movie and Cooper is just amazing. So Tim Burton does it again and gives us another amazing movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Awful!,"I have never seen Dark Shadows the TV show so my despising of this movie isn't bias. I came into the cinema very open minded and with Johnny Depp being an actor I quite admire I was obviously fairly excited. However already 10 minutes in to the film I was painfully bored. Throughout the film I just felt like walking out as I sat there thinking of far better things I could be doing with my time; but i did stay just to say that I had experienced all of this dreadful film. First of all, the overall acting was poor, even from Johnny Depp. The script was equally as poor and very predictable. Why this movie is labelled as a comedy I do not know! I didn't laugh once! There was no character building and the love between Barnabas and Victoria was certainly not felt by the audience. You didn't feel for any character as everything was just so dry. As for the visuals it was all so predictable and yawn.I think the Depp and Burton partnership is extremely over rated and Johnny should consider playing parts in far better films, as he obviously has the potential. As for Tim Burton, please retire.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Unique and Addictive,"First of all I must say that I am a big fan of Dark Shadows the original television series, and I am a big fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp (separately and collaboratively. But I had my apprehensions when I saw the trailer for this movie. I was unsure of the direction of the movie, because of the serious tone of the television series.Boy was I wrong. The movie starts fast and keeps you engaged throughout. Instead of necessarily focusing on one aspect of film-making it covers many. Suspense, Comedy, Horror, and Mystery are all a part of this film. Burton and the writers combine all of these elements while staying true to Burton's style and the television series.The talented ensemble cast have great chemistry throughout the movie. Everyone has a purpose.But I have to admit the standout is Johnny Depp. Talented might not be the word for him. He can absorb any type of role with ease. His character Barnabas gloats with honesty. His shyness of the new world he is facing, while being a vampire and having needs is a dilemma. Because of this Johnny's (seldom scene)comedic skills shine throughout. Barnabas is very blunt with his actions, but with his exquisite vocabulary and proper manners the comedy is non stop. I was literally laughing the entire movie. Some of my friends who knew nothing about the movie were laughing harder than I was.I enjoyed this movie. The writing, directing, costume design,and acting are all top notch. One of the movies that make me still have hope in Hollywood. It's a must see. Don't hesitate. Another Burton classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Even Burton can't make the most of this movie.,"Grim and wacky auteur Tim Burton, a director who you may remember best for terrific movies like Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, and Ed Wood, gives us the first of his two 2012 directed features. Dark Shadows, based on the long running TV series created by Dan Curtis, features Burton's undeniably quirky stamp, but it also turns out to be his least entertaining movie since Planet of the Apes.Johnny Depp stars as Barnabas Collins, a man from the 18th century who is cursed to be a vampire after toying with the heart of a woman who turns out to be a witch. For this, the Collins family is historically cursed, and Barnabas, locked in a coffin for nearly 200 years, awakens in 1972. The Collins family business, led by matriarch Elizabeth, is flailing. Overpowered by the business led by a rival company, the brains of which belong to Angelique, the woman who cursed Barnabas. Barnabas seeks to restore the Collins business it to its original grandeur, win the heart of a young woman, and figure out what sorcery powers a television.The biggest problem with the movie lies with writer Seth Grahame-Smith. The screenplay is seriously awful. The back stories of the characters are interesting, but somewhere in the writing, something just rings untrue. These characters have so much potential, but the emotional involvement is unsatisfying, the development falls flat and inconsistent, and the structure just feels off. The movie itself also lacks rhythm. It struggles to find a consistent tone, thrown off course by irritating pacing shifts, and the kind of quirky humor that normally works for Burton's films, but feels wildly uneven here.As for the cast, there's plenty of talent, but not enough chemistry. Oddly enough, the cast do succeed in bringing something out of nothing roles, except perhaps Chloe Moretz and Johnny Miller. Eva Green, delightfully wicked and menacingly funny as Angelique, is one worth mentioning. Johnny Depp, as well, remains just as deliriously enjoyable as ever. Even if the fish out of water humor feels a bit much, he still manages to leave one in fits of laughter, especially in the hysterical floor-wall-ceiling love scene in Angelique's office.And since it's a Burton movie, it looks just as good. Definitely his most beautifully designed movie since Sleepy Hollow, and arguably his most beautifully designed movie ever. Rick Heinrichs' production design, Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography, Joel Harlow and Paul Gooch's makeup, and especially Colleen Atwood's extraordinary costumes are properly elegant. Burton's composer of choice, Danny Elfman, brings on yet another great musical score as well. However, it takes more to make a good movie than pretty imagery. A good movie requires true heart, which Dark Shadows unfortunately lacks.***/ *****",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
I don't get all the hate,"On coastal Maine, a Vampire named Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is released in 1972 after almost 200 years in captivity and reacquaints himself with his family's chateau & the nearby fishing village. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the Collins matriarch, Helena Bonham Carter the in-house shrink, Eva Green a conniving witch, Bella Heathcote the reincarnation of Barnabas' long-lost love and Chloë Grace Moretz a 15 year-old punk.Directed by Tim Burton, ""Dark Shadows"" (2012) isn't far removed in tone from his ""Sleepy Hollow"" (1999), which also featured Depp as the protagonist, although I suppose ""Shadows"" throws in a little more humor. I've never seen the TV soap opera Dark Shadows or the subsequent two movies, so I can't compare this movie to them. All I know is that I liked this rendition quite a bit, just as I liked the inexplicably reviled ""The Lone Ranger"" (2013).The October/November ambiance (i.e. Halloween-season) is to die for and Depp as Barnabas Collins maintains your interest throughout. He's obviously a fish-out-of-water in 1972, but acclimates pretty quickly. Eva Green is perfect as the ee-vil witch and Carter is enjoyable as usual. I don't get the hubbub over Moretz, but she's a'right (and holds a surprise for the last act). Alice Cooper is featured in a glorified cameo. I should add that the opening credits sequence with ""Nights in White Satin"" is cinema at its finest.The movie runs 1 hour, 53 minutes and was shot in England (Devon, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Cornwall & Farnham) and Scotland (Mull, Argyll and Bute) with exteriors of the chateau shot at Trafalgar Castle School, Whitby, Ontario, Canada.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Am I the only one who liked this?,"I have to say, after reading all of the user reviews, it seems like this movie started some sort of angry mob to chase Tim Burton out of film making for good. Seems to me everyone hated this film which apparently lacked depth, storytelling, interest and many other things. However, I feel Dark Shadows was at least an improvement over the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland remakes Burton has force-fed us in the past.That may not sound like a great recommendation, and it's certainly not to suggest this film ranks anywhere near the Burton genius of Big Fish, but I felt the movie was genuinely entertaining to say the least. Unlike my fellow user reviewers, I felt the awkward combination of darkness and comedy was quite refreshing. Just as this movie seems to settle into gentle family comedy, somebody gets randomly murdered and you're left with that great, awkward feeling where you want to laugh but somehow know it's morally wrong somehow. Truly such a laugh is guaranteed in a viewing of Dark Shadows as many of the serious moments come completely out of left field and often left me confused, but amused as well. The genre-bending nature of the film often kept me interested, as the narrative was a far cry from the goofy comedy promised by the trailer.That being said, it is hard to deny there are significant flaws here. The story has some random, gaping plot holes and several 'deus ex machina' style resolutions to many of the central conflicts, but that almost makes it more endearing and satirical of the soap opera style the story is derived from. Truth be told, I've never seen the soap opera, but my mother assures me it was not funny; rather, it was often creepy. Be that as it may, Dark Shadows is enjoyable enough for a night at the movies, and certainly worth the time contrary to how boring some apparently find it. Quite frankly, this is an entertaining movie you can have fun with and not think too hard about if you don't want to. At the same time, if you enjoy running comparisons to old soap operas and enjoying campy, self-reflexive film making, there's room for that too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"""Dark Shadows"" is Burton being Burton at his least inspired","When you let a child play with the same toys over and over again, you're going to end up with some stale make-believe. Tim Burton has pulled his Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter dolls out of his play chest again and decided this time they're engaged in a supernatural love story taking place in the 1970s.Like most of Burton's films, ""Dark Shadows"" hits on moments of gleeful peculiarity that remind us why we've been following his exploits for decades, but by and large it feels over- trodden and uninspired, and that latter adjective is not one to wield lightly against Burton to be sure.That's not to say Burton has lost a step by any means; he still does what he does better than anyone can, but his past successes have set the bar higher than he dares to even jump with ""Dark Shadows.""Depp plays Burton dress-up again as Barnabas Collins of the wealthy Collinses who immigrated from Liverpool and established a fishing empire in Maine. After spurning the love of the witch Angelique (Eva Green), he and his family were cursed. She turned him into a vampire, locking him in a coffin buried underground for nearly 200 years. Now, in the 1970s, he's unearthed and learns that Collins family has fallen quite a bit, so he endeavors to restore them to glory.The voice-over prologue hits us over the head with language that love is the strongest curse, begging us to care about Collins and his lost love (also cursed by Angelique). We're also then asked to take interest in the dysfunctional Collins family led by the distrustful Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her thick-headed brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) in addition to some other misfits: the rebellious daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz), troubled son (Gulliver McGrath) and his psychiatrist (Bonham Carter). Turns out that Barnabas' exploits as a vampire out of time are far more interesting than whether or not they get their act together as a family.The archaic expression of crude dialogue written for Barnabas and perfectly suited for Depp provides the chief source of entertainment in what's otherwise a campy affair that hopes you will just embrace its outlandish choices and unjustified quirkiness. It will surely remind those who've seen most of Burton's work that he is a man in love with classic B movies, not to mention Gothic appearances and odd turns of events.Although Depp brings the humor, Eva Green is the standout as Angelique, who 200 years later still desires Barnabas and has destroyed his family in the process with her own fishing empire. Green is nearly unrecognizable in the role, and despite playing the villain in a campy affair, manages to avoid chewing the scenery to pieces, which can't be over-appreciated in a script of this nature.Seth Grahame-Smith and John August take liberties with the ""Dark Shadows"" TV show — so I'm told. The film uses the show's concept as inspiration, but inspiration for what? It would seem that the point of adapting something with a fan base would be to honor it with some degree of loyalty. If you're just using the name, characters and basic concept, why not create something entirely original? Perhaps the film's one true crime is providing no good reason for being a ""Dark Shadows"" adaptation, and consequently seeming somewhat purposeless.No doubt Burton had fun making this movie. It's an excellent excuse to defy the rules of reality and borrow numerous characteristics from the films he has drawn his inspiration from over the years. It's expertly set-decorated and Colleen Atwood's costumes assure there's plenty to look at. Much of the film's big set pieces have a grandiose quality to the them, a certain fanfare, if you will, with due credit to Danny Elfman, whose scores are always so quintessential to Burton's tone. Everywhere else, however, it's hard to find intrigue or anything compelling in these characters and their dilemmas.Burton appears to channel all his energy into the aesthetic of ""Dark Shadows,"" something that could be argued as the downfall of a lot of his other lesser works. It's as though everything rides on the script in his films, an arena he has generally avoided in terms of the creative process. If he's picked strong source material that's adapted well, the aesthetic that he brings makes his film a winner. If that core is weak, then he goes down with it. ""Dark Shadows"" is one of those more hollow stories and it shows.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
This is the one Tim Burton will be remembered for...,"This movie was great! It's not perfect. It has the worst ad campaign and trailer I have seen for a modern film. The film is a lot of fun. It's not a comedy. There are some scenes in the middle that seem out of place, like him brushing his teeth. But most of the film is cool and hip. The TV show was lurid and melodramatic. I saw the film House of Dark Shadows in the theater on opening day in 1970 and the theater was empty. That film was awful, but the follow up Night of Dark Shadows was even worse. Burton's film has received poor reviews. They can't accept that the old show is lousy. I just watched the MPI collection. This is Tim Burton's best film. Unfortunately, it is being overshadowed by a giant wrestling match called The Avengers. It's much harder to develop real characters, and that's what Tim Burton has done. It's about time someone acknowledges what a genus he is. PS> He's made several stinkers especially Planet of the Apes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Hard to describe, but it barely saves itself.","First of all, we might say this is a typical Tim Burton movie, and that might be just what saves it from mere mediocrity, because that seems to be about it.This movie features a love story gone wrong because of betrayals and seems to be a bunch of 'clichés' all put together: a person betrays another, which just happens to be a witch and, for that reason, the female sorceress puts a curse on him... imortality. Now, the idea of ""eternal suffering"" (as a matter of fact, the main character tried to kill himself in the beginning along with his... AHEM... ""lover"") makes total sense, but it's been a little overused over the years - even by Twilight movies themselves -. Then Johnny Depp goes to a coffin, and that's about it for the background story.As you would expect, some years later he returns and it's all about a bunch of fantasy creatures like vampires and stuff adapting themselves to the real world, which is also so unoriginal that I can't even remember which movies features such a plot line. One of the issues, in fact, is that they try to focus a lot on LOTS of characters, so some of them are left out and then come back all of a sudden (like ""Vicky""), in desperate need of 'spotlighting'. Also, it's hard to say whether the movie's funny, what are the morale traits of characters or messages the movie seems to transmit - in which sometimes the main characters just kill people for some unexplained reason - and Depp's performance isn't all that amazing.However, what saves this is the fact that... the movie is somehow hilarious some of the time... the McDonald's symbol was well thought, Depp's dialogues are, a few of them, surprisingly memorable, and his ""formal and gentlemanly-said"" insults are typical Burton-Depp humor. So it's not that forgettable, it's just not that good of the movie... and don't expect to learn anything from it or feel touched.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Entertaining. Funny. Enjoyable.,"In my opinion Dark Shadows is probably the best recent Tim Burton/ Johnny Depp collaboration, well I think it's certainly a lot better than Alice In Wonderland anyway, but if course there are the haters out there, and I must say that the hate from die hard Dark Shadows the series fans is probably warranted as it steers heavily away from the original subject material but the hate from the general movie going public I simply don't understand.There is not one other filmmaker out there that can make movies that are stylistically goth and moody the way Mr Burton does. I think his films create the perfect kind of goth / comic combination. The storyline is exciting, led by a hilarious performance by Depp, the movie speeds on a pretty fast pace I thought, there weren't any times that I was bored. The rest of the cast are pretty superb also, Eva Green is terrific playing something totally different as the villain you just love to hate, Angelique Bouchard, and up and coming Aussie actress Bella Heathcote adds a sweet touch also, I did however think that Michelle Pfeiffer and Helena Bonham Carter are a little underused but oh well.Obviously like most movies there are things that are wrong, and Dark Shadows does have it's flaws, the ending is almost not an ending, it kind of seemed like only one part of the story was finalized and the rest was left open ended which was a tad disappointing, but generally the film is great, it's got lots of humor and heart and a nice message about family. I enjoyed it plenty but I guess each to their own.P.S the soundtrack is excellent, the opening with the moody blues, perfect. :)",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Mindless Fun,"I love Johnny Depp, his quirkiness makes me laugh. I like Tim Burton's take on things and can enjoy his perspective. This film does not seem to have the charm of either.Yes it is fun, yes JD has a few quips (all seen in the trailer however), Yes Eva Green is gorgeous. However, I am sorry to say it is quite a boring film that really goes nowhere and has little point to it.The 70's concept is well captured, the characters are believable. This has been done well, the cinematography is visually appealing. It is by no means a CGI spectacular, nor is it in any way scary or sexy.If you are a die hard fan, go and see it. If not, wait for the DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The beginning of the fall of Depp,"Dark Shadows is one of those movies that you expect to be excellent with Johnny Depp vamping it up all comedic, with a cool 70's vibe, but somehow this still falls short. The story itself is good -interesting which sees Barnabas Collins (Depp) turned into a vampire by a witch, then buried alive. Two centuries later, he is freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. Returning to his ancestral home, he then aids his dysfunctional descendants.There were lots of things I liked here; the special effects were kinda dazzling including Johnny playing dress up (again) and damn did I ever laugh at that violent love scene (up and down the walls). The fact that it took place in the 70's was fun, groovy baby, and Michelle Pfeiffer did a good job as the family matriarch.Watching Barnabas struggle in this modern world was also initially amusing but truthfully most of the really good bits were shown with the trailers on TV. Ultimately I felt kinda meh about the whole movie, I can't put my finger on why this wasn't better though. 08.13",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Not Tim Burton's best but fun and enjoyable.,"Dark shadows is a very unique movie it's classic Burton, this movie was so close to being a classic, all it needed was a few extra scenes here and there. I constantly here on other reviews people saying it can't decide whether it's a comedy or horror, well it's both in a way I mean it's not a scary film in any way but it's still creepy, and the humor is always put in the right spots of the movie and it's actually funny and it still doesn't feel like just a comedy.The acting in this movie is great all the actors carry their rolls perfectly and they do not feel wasted at all, I can see how some saw this as the Johnny depp show as he gets most of the screen time, but the other characters do not feel under valued in anyway.In conclusion this movie was a great installment to the Burton collection all though there is room for improvement it was a fun and extremely enjoyable movie. I recommend this to all people who are a fan of Burton's work.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Feels like a walk under dark rainy weather, gloomy but beautiful","This film has one of the best atmosphere creation of all time. The dark atmosphere of the 70's Maine couldn't be made more aesthetically magical and pleasing. It also has one of my favorite intros in cinema history. It makes me feel nostalgic even though I haven't lived through those times.There are scenes which scared me and sequences which made me laugh.
Barnabas is portrayed really wickedly and out of that time, and Carolyn's character is so intriguing yet beautiful.While some people say they didn't like it because of the script, I see this film as a Tim Burton piece, as if it is a painting. He creates a world with life in it, and the film lives and speaks for itself.This is the first film I watch whenever I need my mind to be somewhere else and live in a different time.
And when I hear the Moody Blues say ""Nights In White Satin, never reaching the end"", I know I'm about to start a journey which feels like a walk under dark rainy weather, gloomy and dark yet cinematically and aesthetically beautiful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A great night out,"Despite all of the negative reviews, I took my twelve year old daughter and fourteen year old son to DS. We all enjoyed the movie thoroughly and I am slightly irritated that we almost didn't go because I read multiple reviews that said the movie was inappropriate for children. I disagree, it might not be great for a six year old but this is a mild pg13 film. Tim Burton is most definitely on a comeback with this flick. Great story, good character development great cast incredible effects ...even an awesome fight scene, disappointing that many will opt for the Avengers when this is a far more original and time lasting movie.......stop reading and go and see now definitely worth the cover charge",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"""Dark Shadows"" is visually beautiful, but the script fails to explore all its vast potential in a feature without rhythm and with jokes that do not work","The problem of ""Dark Shadows"" is the same that Tim Burton faced in his ""Alice in Wonderland"": the script. Plastically impeccable, the director gets it right again in the visual and setting of the story - with a beautiful instrumental track (which even includes a participation by Alice Cooper) to help in this regard and a beautiful dark photography by Bruno Delbonnel. But Seth Grahame-Smith's writing simply doesn't excite, it's not very entertaining (the comic timing is rarely right, having one of his best jokes involving McDonalds) and fails to explore all its vast potential in a feature without rhythm. For example, it's not really exciting to see a vampire just freed from a coffin going about his fishing company's business.What makes the film bearable by far is Johnny Depp, who adds yet another memorable character to his enviable career and does so without repeating himself, nailing Barnabas' accent and expressions; whose contrast between good and evil (he is a killing machine but feels remorse for his actions) is startling. It is also satisfying to see the actor embodying the ""classic"" characterization of the vampire: pale skin, fangs and long fingers that directly refer to the iconic Nosferatu. Vampires aside, witches, ghosts and werewolves don't impress as much as the protagonist. Mischievous and attractive as her cleavage, Eva Green stands out among the supporting actors, who have the erased Michelle Pffeifer and Helena Bonham Carter; two uninteresting characters whose intentions are never well developed. Chloë Grace Moretz is saved, but her good work is undermined by the stupid turnaround-although it presents ""clues"" before it happens-that her character suffers near the end.More used to books and TV series, this being his first text for cinema, media where the works have greater freedom to explore their narratives without getting lost, screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith turns out to be an inadequate choice for the job, giving an absolute lack of focus on production. Even so, the screenwriter has good ideas and creates gags and dark and fun situations, such as the sequence with the hippies and the joke with the logo of the McDonald's snack bar chain. Almost all the women in the plot are a more than positive highlight, especially the matriarch Elizabeth, played with impressive strength and tenacity by Michelle Pfeiffer, and the angry Carolyn, played by the increasingly talented Chloe Grace Moretz.The same cannot be said of the Australian Bella Heathcote who, despite living two characters - the virginal Josette in the 17th century and the tutor Victoria in the 1970s - does not have enough charisma, showing herself to be incredibly beautiful, but empty. We still have the alcoholic Dr. Julia Hoffman, who gains the face of a restrained Helena Bonham Carter who, having only one scene of greater prominence on the tape, appears totally wasted. Eva Green's Angelique, on the other hand, appears sociopathic ally seductive and fun, a good part of which is due to the charm of the French actress, although her obsession with possessing Barnabas ends up diminishing her, especially in the third act. The deconstruction of the villain has a very interesting reflection on her look, which gradually cracks like a porcelain doll.Seeming to believe that it will provoke laughter just by focusing on the stylistic absurdities of the 1970s, with its extravagant clothes and typical slang, the screenwriter and Burton at least benefit from the excellent score. Wasting dozens of opportunities to provoke laughter by creating situations that never offer a suitable outcome, ""Dark Shadows"" is a continuous exercise in frustration: at one moment, we see Barnabas, master of hypnotism, being hypnotized by Doctor Julia (Carter), but we never witness what happens; in another, the subject appears in the middle of a group of hippies who philosophize on marijuana, but it doesn't seem to occur to anyone that seeing him doped up could yield curious results, since he never tries the joint - and if at a certain moment we witness the sexual encounter of two fantastic creatures, the filmmaker limits himself to showing them spinning in the air and repeatedly scratching furniture, demonstrating, to say the least, a terrible lack of imagination. To make matters worse, the production has a very irregular rhythm, stopping at several moments just so that we can accompany Barnabas commenting aloud on his impressions of what surrounds him.After Barnanabas' awakening in the 1970s, the script shoots in all directions and, from Barnabas' perspective, several stories develop... or almost... we have the old-fashioned vampire trying to adapt to an era that is strange even for those who lived in it (hippies, Vietnam, Lava Lamps), the love triangle between the vampire, the witch and the governess, Angelique's revenge and the breaking of Barnabas's curse, just to name a few. And that's where Dark Shadows's main problem lies: two hours don't seem enough to tell the whole plot and there's the feeling that even if the film dragged on for a few more hours, Barnabas's Victorian verbiage wouldn't allow the story to unfold. Was developed satisfactorily and with the necessary depth.Very interesting issues and features of the dysfunctional family not mentioned due to spoilers that could emerge to add more value to the final result are pruned in favor of focusing exclusively on the dramas of the protagonist (which are already numerous) and it ends up smelling like an incomplete work. Of course, good ideas, especially the jokes and situations with Barnabas in the 1970s, make the viewer smile, but everything ends up halfway between ""The Legend of the Headless Horseman"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"". If the beginning promised a drama with elements of fantastic cinema driven by revenge, it soon becomes a situation comedy, which leads to a family drama, then becomes a romance, flirts with the horror of the 1950s by Hammer and returns to comedy.At least in the minds of film artists who seem to be working on automatic, a more involved montage with music in the background, ""Top of the World"", by the Carpenters, would supposedly give some credibility to this friendly identification between the characters that make up the family. , as well as this reconstruction of the prestige of the group among the community. The script continues with its inconsistencies. The disappearance of the character played by Heathcote, without even getting involved in the climax of the feature film, is understood to be reversed with small scenes that make up an extremely depressing past, contrasting with his almost apathy in the present scenario. Feelings are not understandable. Whatever Burton was aiming for in this novel die like his own fall off a cliff. How to show that love can survive lifetimes gone by? The script believes that by having the vampire get involved with all but one of the adult women in the film, the audience will buy a certain romance - misplaced laughs.Comedy's relationship to horror is completely inconsistent. The character of the morbid-turned-ordinary, like the murder of the group of young people who were camping, does not carry with it a character study in crisis. The identities, when in unison, when part of the development of Barnabas Collins, are not deepened. The connection with the public fails to create a truly painful creature, who we understand is facing a serious dilemma. The protagonist does not seem to feel a presumed unhappiness given the situations in which he needs to feed on blood to merely quench his thirst, moments that, on the other hand, are loaded with comedy, even if the identity conflict is mentioned in the film as disturbing to the vampire. . The first scene - with the workers who find the coffin - does not bother this proposed mixture of genres, as it achieves a justification. The issue of young people camping, however, is completely gratuitous. The impulse to massacre, too casual, is not just insinuated, premeditated.The created universe has vampires, ghosts, witches and werewolves. The characters are numerous, however, the resourcefulness of each of them beyond their superficialities are not reconciled. The boy, for example, begins as a narrative premise and becomes, in the end, almost an extra. The cohesion between the monstrous dynamics does not work, while the beginning with a frightening intention ends up being discarded afterwards, without provoking reactions to the housekeeper's character. The scene of the ghost covered by the white fabric creates a pretext for horror, but it is an exception.Dark Shadows is not only visually pale, with the white characters and makeup accentuating the lack of any more vivid aspect inside it, however, it is also a film that presents the essence of director Tim Burton withered, as if the blood and the filmmaker's imagery power was being drained by a vampire. Dark Shadows, being one of the great stumbles of Tim Burton's career, never manages to leave the coffin that remains for almost two hours, forever forgotten.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Flat, Boring, Pointless -- A Total Waste","A campy performance by J.Depp, a strong supporting cast, some cool and fun special effects here and there, and jokes about the early 70s popular trends cannot save this movie from being one of 2012's worst releases.There are no thrills, there is very little action, there are very few funny moments, the pace is slow, there is no character development, the plot is thin and not clever. Even a performance by Alice Cooper is boring and goes nowhere.The original soap opera -- despite the unintended campiness of the supernatural mumbo-jumbo story lines -- at least had some character development and a relentless tension making it ABC's most watched show during its heyday in the late 1960s. Of significance is the fact that the series had dream sequences, morphing, etc., all done with the limitations of being a daytime soap with one-shot takes that went straight from live to tape. Sadly, Tom Burton spent millions of dollars on 21st century digital technology for special effects and came up with a boring, pointless film which is neither a campy comedy nor a supernatural thriller.There was a 1991 short-lived miniseries which had a compelling cast (Ben Cross, a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt), solid plot lines (for a supernatural story), and a taut, tense pace filled with action, sex, and horror.

"Good, unexpected.","Always a fan of Tim Burton, I easily enjoyed this film. However, one should not expect more of a comedy, as this film is based off of a soap opera. The humor is lacking a bit, but still prominent. The time period was developed perfectly, makeup fantastic, cinematography nothing spectacular. Acting, well just take a look at the cast! Although Ms. Moretz as Carolyn Stoddard does not properly portray both sides of her character blended well enough together. Eva Green does a voice... good for her character, but unbelievable as an actress. SPOILER: The final scene, with the Doctor's eyes opening, signaling her as a vampire, too cliché as it reminds me of breaking dawn part one, Avatar, and several other film endings, it's overdone.

Meh.,"*could contain spoilers*Quite double..Started off quite good, I am a great fan of Tim Burton and Depp, especially in combination of Helena, Danny Elfman, and the occasional references to other Burton films. (Big Fish was named, Victoria is a much used name by Burton, and I do recall someone saying something about Christmas.)Anyway, although the acting was fairly great, really, with most actors (well except for Willy, who starts off quite strong and then kind of sags off, as well as Helena, shame.) it was a HUGE disappointment to see how utterly bad the special effects were. It really itched me to see how horrible, horrible these effects were. To see every fling, every motion, delayed and so sickening computer animated, yuck. just yuck. Aw-ful.The story was nice, although not so strong. It turned into an love story like every other, and contained a witch, vampire, and of course ghosts. Oh, did I mention the werewolf yet?

Mixing Depp's anachronistic English accent and attitude with 70's Americana is Catweezle himself (maybe only good for UK residents, that connection, perhaps). Very appropriate music of the time, and attitudes of the young then. The Alice Cooper vignette, and Depp's character's misunderstanding makes a good rolling gag.

"Good, but messy","I was disappointed in the reviews for Dark Shadows, since I hoped for a home run for Burton. Still, I went to see this, and am glad I did. It's fun and entertaining for the most part, but incredibly messy. The main problem here is the editing and pace. Whereas Alice in Wonderland's problem was that it was just weak all around in the storyline, it at least did move more coherently. Dark Shadows never really has a central storyline or purpose going, and instead feels disjointed and random. But although it does feel messy, it still has a lot of great scenes mixed throughout, and I think as for the horror and comedic aspect, it was handled appropriately. I enjoyed the cast a lot, especially Depp. So I recommend it, but it sure has a lot of flaws. It could have been put together a lot better, and it also felt like it never went ""all the way"". But, I actually did find it funny many times, and although I have not seen the TV show, I didn't find that the ambition was lacking here. It doesn't exactly feel ""lazy"" as Alice did, just a sort of mishandled film.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
It's a vampire story...so come on...,"First of all I think that most vampire/werewolf stories and films are cheesy at best, so I was hesitant.

If you watch the movie thinking that it's going to be anything serious like the former Dark Shadow's shows, think again. It's a spoof, like unto Beetlejuice (as one reviewer wrote). Did it have entertainment value? Yes. Was it worth spending a matinée price? Probably not. I would have rather seen it at the dollar show or waited for it to come out on DVD. Did the actors do a good job? Yes, most certainly.Is this a family show? Most definitely not. I'd watch it alongside an older teen, but it's not a movie that's suitable for kids under 15 due to the adult humor, sex scenes and violence. But, everyone is different in their judgments. At least watch it before you let your kids see it.All in all, it's worth watching and my husband and I had a few good laughs.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Watch the orginal soap opera instead.,"This just showed up on Netflix so we watched it (we have been re-watching the original series and are up around episode 250).Right off the bat the movie suffers from some horrible miscasting/character development. Carolyn and Roger being the most horrific mistakes. Carolyn doesn't work as a whiny early teen, she's a whiny early 20s. Stripping out Quentin and giving his traits to Carolyn with a toss away line pretty much sucked as well. Roger should be fabulously camp with the best snarky lines, delivered while snuggling up with the liquor cabinet, not a bland wallpaper villain rifling pocketbooks at a party. His whole character was just wrong.Johnny Depp as Barnabas works up to a point. Though his sorta-sex scenes were pretty cringe and detracted rather than added to the story.The early part of the movie starts out well but it really falls apart rather quickly. The conflict between Angelique and the Collins family (a la Burk Devlin) looked like it might have some teeth, but it stalls out with some lame set pieces. I'm a fan of Alice Cooper, but his inclusion just ate up time that could have been used for story telling.By the end the whole thing is just creaking along feeling like it was looking for a place to stop. The big budget Hollywood treatment really strips away the shoestring budget charm the soap opera had.I did like how Maggie and Vicky were merged. To me they were the most boring characters in the soap and mashing them together was a nice was of including them both.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Is it time to bury Burton/Depp?,"Camp piled on camp would be over the top for the best cinema satirists except maybe David Lynch and the durable Tim Burton. The latter has taken on the campy '70's TV program, Dark Shadows, enlisted his usual suspects, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter, and made a comedy that holds up for laughs and wit, the latter being the province of the gifted Depp.Depp's Barnabas Collins returning to Maine after sleeping for over 200 years, finds his dysfunctional family, well, still dysfunctional. His saving their fortune and indulging his enduring playboy inclinations, puts him fang to fang again with witch Angelique, played deliciously over the top by blonde barracuda, Eva Green.Lurking in these shadows is Depp, who plays Collins with such uncharacteristic restraint that he captures his seductiveness and his menace in every turn of his smacking lips.Burton and Depp have been together eight times starting in 1990 with Edward Scissorhands. Given the lack of financial success in Dark Shadows, it may be time to bury the relationship and resurrect it at a time when, like Collins, they can feed a nostalgic craze for them rather than noticeable box office yawns.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Season of the Witch,"Greetings again from the darkness. If anyone ever asks ""What was the name of that late 60's goth, supernatural soap opera with the cult following?"", it's safe to assume they mean the TV series ""Dark Shadows"". It ran from 1966-1971 for a remarkable 1225 episodes. For those who remember it, the image they recall tends to be actor Jonathan Frid as Barnabus Collins ... the first vampire any of us ever saw outside of a Friday night horror film. The series made quite an impact on two young boys in particular: Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.There are many reasons that movies get made. Pet projects or labors of love are not as common these days because of high production costs. But that's exactly what this movie is - a pet project for Burton and Depp. They clearly have fun with the characters, and the film dallies ever closely to the parody line. The initial set-up is brilliant and dark and ominous, leading us to believe this film will be in line with Burton's Sleepy Hollow or Corpse Bride. Instead, the rest of the movie is more in line with Beetlejuice. Definitely not a bad thing - just different than what we were prepped for.Johnny Depp gives a wonderful performance as Barnabus Collins, the rich young man cursed by Angelique, the witch he spurns in love. His curse is to be turned into a vampire and buried alive. When his casket is discovered 196 years later, the world of 1972 is quite different than the one he left. He comically struggles to fit in and make sense of it all ... not the least of which is his remaining family. At his beloved Collinswood Manor lives Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer), Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller), Carolyn Stoddard (Chloe Grace Moretz), David Collins (Gulliver McGrath), the live-in child psychiatrist Dr Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), and their recently hired nanny Victoria (Bella Heathcote). While he was buried, the wicked witch Angelique (Eva Green) becomes the most powerful figure in town.Burton does a nice job poking fun at the 1970's with comedy that won't mean much to today's youngsters, but will hit home with those from the era. The art direction and sets are terrific, especially Collinwood Manor. The music of the 70's is used to comic effect, including a live performance by Alice Cooper. Michelle Pfeiffer does the best job at capturing the look and feel of the original series, but her daughter's character (Moretz) takes an unnecessary turn as Burton tries to cram as much in as possible. In fact, the film is actually quite fun to watch, but is lacking real substance in the story department ... not dissimilar to the original series.This is the 8th film collaboration between Burton and Depp. They make a wonderful team, and Depp has added another entertaining character to his Captain Jack Sparrow, Edward Scissorhands, Mad Hatter legacy. His movements and speech pattern are especially entertaining as we are mesmerized by his milky white complexion. His dialogue (written by Seth Grahame-Smith) demands attention and is both comical and majestic simultaneously. Burton's tribute to the TV series includes cameos by four of the original actors: Jonathan Frid, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker and David Selby as guests at the ball. It's a classy touch. Danny Elfman's score is a bit overwhelmed by the use of numerous 70's classics, and it was disappointing to hear The Killers version of ""Go All the Way"" rather than The Raspberries as the closing credits rolled.Burton is one of the more visual directors and even though the story is a bit lacking, each scene gives us plenty to absorb. The ghosts are especially well done, as is the fishing town of Collinsport which was built just for the movie. It has many similarities to Bodega Bay, which film lovers will recognize as the setting for Hitchcock's The Birds. Lastly, Burton gives us another scene with the great Christopher Lee - this time as a boat captain caught between Angelique and Barnabus. Good stuff.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"Gothic, Epic, Classic, Mystic, Magic, Comic, Slapstick, Frantic, Scenic, Antique, Not Yet Tragic, But With No Garlic!","Who else could be the better choice to direct thiz movie other than Tim Burton. The description is Gothic, epic, classic, mystic, magic, comic, slapstick, frantic, scenic, antique, not yet tragic, but with no garlic! Just like his previous masterpieces such as ""Beetle Juice"" (1988), ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), ""Big Fish"" (2003) and ""Alice in Wonderland"" (2010). Thiz time, Tim Burton tries to bring back classic vampire tale based on the original TV series in 1970s-era. The story takes place in the year 1972, when 196-year-old vampire Barnabas Collins has just awakened in his coffin after being cursed by a cold hearted witch Angelique Bouchard who previously fell for him. Now, he arrives back in his grandiose mansion to restore his family to its former glory, what he doesn't know later, the world has changed a lot since his last departure. The original version looked more like a soap opera, but in Tim Burton's hand it turns out to be a fresh family drama with some mysterious elements and sometimes cynical good humor. It's certainly acceptable, considering Tim Burton has done his homework for compiling 1.225 TV episodes into two-hour movie. On thiz occasion, the Director Tim Burton has also successfully gathered together all his favorite performers. Thiz is his eighth collaboration with Johnny Depp, his seventh with his real-life partner Helena Bonham Carter, his fifth with Christopher Lee and his second with Michelle Pfeiffer after her role as Catwoman in ""Batman Returns"" (1992). Have you ever seen the original Barnabas Collins which played by Jonathan Frid? If you are old enough to have a chance to see his performance previously, you probably would have realized that Johnny Depp has done a lot of efforts to portray that character through his tone of voice, his facial expression and even his gestures. Beside that, there are some other performances which have got my attention. For the umpteenth time, Chloë Grace Moretz has shown her maturity in acting, thiz time to become a rebel teen daughter. Bella Heathcote also makes a special impression as a mysterious new nanny. And Eva Green is obviously very attractive and sensual even as a ruthless witch. The rest of the Cast members are Johnny Lee Miller, Jackie Earle Haley and Gulliver McGrath, plus a special guest appearance by the legendary rock star Alice Cooper. In fact, the gang of 1970s version also make cameo appearances as the guests in the ballroom party scene, including the late Jonatahan Frid, Lara Parker, David Selby and Kathryn Leigh Scott. Thiz movie really brings us back in time to 1970s. Everything is so authentic, including the clothes, the hairstyles, the cars and even the songs. My favorite moment is when they play the song ""Top of the World"" by The Carpenters. Somehow, the song sounds so fresh and uplifting. It sounds pretty much like thiz, ""Such a feeling's coming over me. There is wonder in most everything I see"". It can also be precise words to describe thiz movie.

thought it would be good but it really wasn't,"It took a while to watch this and I wanted to watch it ever since the trailer came on TV also I've never watched the original series so can't compare them.

There were random plot twists that had no bearing on the main plot and not much of a back story to go on. There were a few funny one liners but the ones used in the trailer so a film your fooled into thinking is good until you watch it. I also didn't like the ending which basically repeated the beginning so really all you have to do is watch the beginning think of the obvious ending and you have pretty much watched the film.The idea of it i really liked what would happen if a vampire randomly woke up in modern day how would it act. However this is a tired theme running from queen of the damned and of course the original series (which i will stress again i haven't seen). However, in my opinion with the Gothic mansion that for some reason hadn't been touched in the last 200 years and the almost Victorian looking clothes i sometimes forgot that it was in fact modern day.I am a Burton fan and a Depp fan, I think they create magic on set with Burton's ideas and Depp's improvisation so I'm disappointed with what they accomplished when they could have gone a lot further with this however for some reason chose not to.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Brilliant, low rating makes no sense","I can't believe this film got such mediocre reviews. I absolutely loved it. Maybe it was just badly marketed, ie if you're looking for a lightweight comedy then you'll be disappointed. I think maybe the reason is, it's a little too subtle for an American audience. Although (ironically) it was made by Americans, I think it has more UK/Australian audience appeal. I know that's generalizing (i.e. satire doesn't bypass all yanks), but generally speaking..I thought it was really brilliant, very very clever & entertaining. Johnny Depp was (as usual) absolutely mesmerizing & the rest of the cast really hold their own. I really think this is Tim Burton in top form.I think they could have done more with the soundtrack. It's not bad, but... it's set in the 70s, it should have had a killer soundtrack. Apart from that, I'm completely stumped by the low rating. It did get the thumbs up from the ABC's Aussie critics (Margaret & David) and currently has a high (4.5/5) score on the Oz iTunes store. So I think it's ""knowing satiric edge"" (per Margaret Pomeranz) was just, perhaps, a little too subtle for many.I loved this film. I really hope they make a sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"A great looking, and often funny movie, in search of a plot and a point.","A Gothic romance about a vampire...this sounds like primo Tim Burton material here. On a visual level, this world here is fully realized, but unfortunately, that's the only place it's realized. The plot is kind of a set piece to set piece episodic one, and the romance here is severely underplayed, making the ending kind of pointless. But what the trailer emphasized was the comedy, and a good chunk of this film features some well played fish out of water comedy. On some levels this film is a surprising success, and on others an complete failure. It's entertaining, but that's about it really.It's the late 1700s, and Barnabas Collins' (Johnny Depp) family started a small fishing town called Collinsport, and together they live in Collinwood, a luxurious mansion. Barnabas breaks the heart of a spiteful witch Angelique (Eva Green), and she kills his parents, forces his lover Josette (Bella Heathcote) to commit suicide, turns Barnabas into a vampire, and imprisons him in a coffin underground. Two centuries later, a mysterious woman ""Victoria Winters"" is going to become the governess for David, a surviving member of the Collins family who is deeply disturbed. Barnabas is then freed from his coffin, and returns to find his living relatives in need of help, so he tries to bring life back into his town of Collinsport. Meanwhile, Angelique (who still appears to be the same age) has taken control of the fishing industry in Collinsport, and he must help his family bring their dying fishing industry back.For those of you who didn't like the visual style of Tim Burton's last picture, ""Alice in Wonderland"", this one should be a refreshing return to form (visually that is). The sets are really neat, and Collinsport is quite a beautiful little fantasy town. The special effects are also really good when they are featured. On a visual level, this might be Burton's best looking film since ""Sleepy Hollow"" over a decade ago, and the score by Danny Elfman is also quite good. And what do people think of when they think of Tim Burton movies? Awesome visual style (check), bouncy score usually by Danny Elfman (check) and Johnny Depp (check). But what this movie is lacking is a plot. Something to drive the story other than jokes and neat sets is needed.The layout of the story and overall tone is quite odd. The film starts off as a Gothic romantic fantasy telling the history of Barnabas Collins. By no means is this portion of the film meant to be humorous. Then we begin to follow a mysterious girl ""Victoria Winters"" (who becomes lovers with Depp), who has taken on the job of being little David's governess. This portion of the film isn't particularly funny either, but it adds an element of mystery so the movie becomes a bit more interesting. After about 15 minutes of this girl as our main character, the film becomes an unfocused fish out of water comedy for the remainder of the film (sans the last 25 or so minutes). This part of the film is actually quite funny. Then the climax and last portion of the film becomes like a horror action film of sorts.There is a romance subplot, but it has no importance in the story until the very end. There is no chemistry between Depp and Heathcote, because they are only given like 4 scenes together, and none of them feel very organic. Also sadly underwritten are Victoria Winters, and David's relationship. Ar the beginning of the film seem like they could have an interesting dynamic, but instead they are given very little screen time. Every sub-plot is dropped in favor of Depp's fish-out-of-water routine, which is quite funny, but also makes this movie's plot slight and overall point even slighter.Visually, this movie is a real treat bringing back memories of older Burton films like Beetlejuice. The performances are also very good, especially Johnny Depp who does some great deadpan comedy here, but what's missing is a point. While it may entertain, in the end, nothing really matters here.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 124 mins. PG-13 for sexual humor throughout, some language and violence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Lousy,"If you are a fan of the TV show Dark Shadows, you probably won't like this movie. In the tv show, Barnabus hated being a vampire. He was trying to find a way to become human again. In this show, Barnabus is a blood sucker. Totally opposite of the show. In the movie, Vickie Winters and Maggie Evans are the same person. In the show, they are two different people with two completely separate roles. The only thing this movie had in common with the TV show is the characters had the same names. Other than that, they had nothing in common. I recommend you skp this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
I liked it but did not love it.,"I grew up watching the original show and it was dark, spooky and mysterious, very Gothic and it sucked you in, so to speak. The movie did great with the logical idea of a victorian vampire waking up in the present, and the seventies was not bad, but the amount of killing done at a time was a bit underthought. The means of dealing with Amngelique was very lame, and the sex scene was something that never should have happened, along with the ""client confidentiality"" scene that did not belong in this movie at all.I loved the house, but essentially the movie did disappoint in many ways. Barnabas appeared debonair, but foolish (organ scene) and if I had to guess, I'd say no one took the time to really study the original to get the atmosphere into it. Additionally Barnabas's issues over lacking a casket were very corny.They could have used the original atmosphere and left out the silliness and had a better movie, and Barnabas could have been much more dark. At least they did not deviate from the original plot as the Friday the 13th movies did, one movie barely related to another. If there is a sequel, I hope it gets better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Surprisingly Good; Worth the Admission,"Dark Shadows is unlike the many strange and different Tim Burton films that have come across in past years from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland. This film had a great story with very good acting from Johnny Depp, Chloe Grace Mortez, Michelle Pfiffer, and Jackie Earl Haley. Haley and Depp were hilarious, while Pfiffer and Eva Green provided the film a backbone. Even though this film may seem strange from the posters and trailers, it truly isn't when seeing the movie due to the story explaining the odd elements of the film. In fact, the only strange part of the film was the always strange Helena Bonham Carter, who actually was decent in this film. This film has some decent scares and some good laughs along the way which makes this a more mature version of A Nightmare Before Christmas and a funnier and very more kid friendly version of Sweeney Todd. This is an easy 7.5 out of 10 and should be watched regardless of how strange it may appear.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Vampires and witches can also have sentiments,"This is a good fantastic movie directed by the firm hand of Tim Burton who is a specialist in this kind of movies. It benefits also of a luxury cast with great performers such as Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer and Helena Bonham Carter. It's a story of a love-hate relationship between a witch (the beautiful Eva Green) and a man she transforms into a vampire (Johnny Depp) and has him buried for two centuries to punish him for rejecting her love after having induced by witchcraft the woman he loved to kill herself. When he is disinterred by chance he regains his place in his family's estate and the war begins again between them also because meanwhile his family had lost their local power to the witch although they ignore she is one. This struggle assumes physical aspects sometimes extremely violent and very well filmed and acted. But the final scenes are particularly moving. This good movie could be very good indeed were not for some loose ends in certain scenes not well explained by images or words. And of course in this kind of vampire movies we always must accept and take for granted the several gratuitous murders the vampire performs to feed on his victims' blood. And it proves also how vampires and witches can also have sentiments. One of the best movies of this kind after all and this kind doesn't allow much better by its own nature.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Problematic and Boring,"Multiple instances of sexual assault towards Depp's character throughout the movie. Each time this happened as well, it was just seen as normal or a good thing because Depp's character was supposedly so attractive. On top of this, they continued to sexualize Chloe's CANONICALLY UNDERAGE character throughout her screentime.I truly don't have enough words to describe how terrible this movie is. None of the characters (expect Depp's I guess) are likeable. None of them are good people. The only person who is ""good"", the little boy David, is just not even likeable either. The movie is about Depp's relationship with the character ""Vicky"", short for Victoria (WHICH BURTON HAS ALREADY USED THAT NAME IN CORPSE BRIDE), yet you hardly see them interacting and forming a relationship. The movie introduces Vicky as the main character, yet barely focuses on her character after Depp's is introduced.The only reason why I continued to watch it was for the really well-put together aesthetic, which does not make up for the movie enough. You will not miss anything if you don't watch this movie; in fact, I recommend just watching another vampire movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Enjoyable!,"If you're a fan of Dark Shadows, you can't go into it with the expectation that it will be like the original/s because it's not. It's the same story line and the same characters, but it takes it all and throws some comedy into it. You just need to take it for what it is, a supernatural dramady... While I never watched the original Dark Shadows, I did watch the mini series they came out with in 1991 and it took me over completely. I was in love with the story, the characters, and the darkness that it brought once a week on Friday Nights! It was an impact on me to say the least. I watched it all over again thanks to NetFlix and was in love just as much as I was back in 5th grade when I saw it the first time! But comparing that to this movie is like Apples to... Pears.... They are very similar but not the same... But I didn't find that to necessarily be a bad thing. And really, I'm a fan of Tim Burton. I love the style he brings to movies and his touches were everywhere. Something I really enjoyed was how it was dark and dreary, and yet there were such bright and colorful scenes or objects thrown into it. I found that contrast to be wonderful! It just added that much more to the atmosphere.I really liked Michelle Pfieffer in it. I thought that she played her character well. She kinda had that powerful beautiful b&^%h thing going on much like she did when she was Cat Woman. I enjoyed that very much. (And she looked awesome!) The rest of the cast was fun. The children were played well. Helena Bonham Carter was fun as always. (Loved the bright orange hair!) Eva Green who played Angelique did a fantastic job. She could go from beautiful to crazy rather quickly and the looks she could give with those big eyes of hers were nothing short of freaky! And of course Johnny Depp rocked his part as always. He was a fun Barnabas and I enjoyed his take on the character.Over all I liked it. It was what it was and I was entertained! My only issue was at the very end where they just throw something in out of the blue... I will never understand how anyone can think that such a thing works in a movie... But other than that, it was fun, it was entertaining, it made me laugh, and it did manage to bring me back to Collinwood, a beautiful, powerful, place full of Ghost Stories and the supernatural.

Tim Burton is over,"This movie is an insult to the watcher. With Tim Burton's overly used plots and characteristics, after watching 2 or 3 Burton films, you will get offended and ask yourself; ""How many times a Director can play me for a fool?""Tim Burton executes this well. With weak plot, taking so much from the earlier Tim Burton movies, fails to achieve anything noteworthy let alone entertain the audience.I think we are sick of the ""Burtonesque"" cast choices and visuals and after a while, seeing hundred Johnny Depp characters, Barnabas Collins shows us, Depp is not a good actor, as a matter of fact, Depp is really unable to do anything besides playing himself.Dark Shadows is a bad idea, Tim Burton should be ashamed.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Absolutely absurd and wonderfully unpredictable,"There are not many movies like this one. One doesn't see whats coming. The lead characters aren't heroes or morally strong.

When you watch this you ought to remember the whole drama part of it is intentionally over the top. Keeping that in mind the unpredictability is to be appreciated. My opinion is that critics are too tough on Johnny Depp. They are so to speak used to his brilliance. Depp' s Barnabbas is another great character. It seems he has already given so many memorable performances so that people cannot fully take them all in. If this would be the first Depp film a person sees, that person would surely think it was a one of a kind role performance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Funny and such, but...","So here comes another dish made with the Burton-Depp recipe, and this time it is a new adaptation of a TV-series with the same name from 1966. I have not seen the original series, so I have no idea of how true this movie is to its source, and therefore I saw it only for the movie it was. It's a Gothic vampire-story that revolves around Barnabas Collins, a rich, young man who's the son of a wealthy merchant and lives in Collingwood Manor in the year of 1752. He has an affair with a servant girl (played by Eva Green) but it is all physical for him and he soon leaves her for a girl he truly loves. Bad move, since the servant girl is also a witch. She proceeds to kill his parents, kill his love, and then she curses him to an eternal life as a vampire and then locks him in a coffin! Damn! After 300 years he finally gets out and decides to return to Collinwood manor and resume his life together with the left-overs of the Barnabas family. He quickly discovers however, that in 1972 things are very, very different, and he struggles to fit in in modern society. And as that was not enough, the servant girl has also hung around due to her magic, and under different aliases she has become the local community's biggest fish and has on her own driven the Collins family to the edge of bankruptcy. Barnabas really chose the right girl to fool around with, didn't he? I should begin to say that I did enjoy the film, however I still feel that it raises a cloud of doubt whether Tim Burton's film-making abilities are still up to par. After the, in my opinion, minor disaster of Alice in Wonderland Burton needed to follow up with at strong piece to convince us that he still has what it takes to deliver the special kind of magic he is known for. I do not feel that Dark Shadows accomplishes that. It feels in many ways confused, unfocused and sometimes downright sloppy.However, let's start with the good stuff. This movie is funny, like really funny. Most jokes centers around the cultural clashes between Barnabas 18th century's manner and the wilderness of the 1970:s. We get the scenes were he interacts with modern technology, starts to appreciate modern music and tries to comprehend the strange ideals people have. This kind of humor could easily have become cheap and tiresome, but somehow this movie makes it work all the way. The acting is overall great. Johnny Depp is as solid as always, and Eva Green is great as the villain (she has a thing for playing evil sorceresses). One of my favorite performances though has to be Michelle Pfeiffers portrayal as the current matriarch of the Collins family. She desperately tries to keep the Collins family together and going, and she has harsh and effective way that makes her easy to like. It's also fun too see some quick cameos from Christopher Lee and Tom Savini (very short, keep your eyes open). The 70's music is also great and fits very well to the visual. Hell, they even manage to integrate a creepy Alice Cooper-ballad to a romantic scene.One of the major downsides with this movie is how it seems to be confused on what kind of film it wants to be. It goes from being a half-serious comedy to a whacked out mindflip and back. It changes between lighthearted to really dark in a way that just doesn't mesh to me. Also, the script can be really sloppy at times, and the focus is not always were it should be at times. This is best shown in the romance between Barnabas and Victoria Winters (played by Bella Heathcote). It is supposed to be very central to the story, but it is showed to the sidelines and is not expanded very much. Instead we get a lot of thrown in stuff that steals focus from the film. There is a lot of scenes that does nothing for the story and just comes off as pointless, and you can't but wonder why they did not replace these scenes with... you know, point.All in all a mixed bag. Compared to movies like Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands and even later stuff like Sweeney Todd it doesn't pack a similar punch. But dammit Burton, I know you CAN make movies. Maybe you need do refresh yourself, give someone else than Depp a go, bring more focus to your stories. I'm still a fan an excitingly awaits your next work.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Alright Tim Burton Vampire Film,I am not a fan of vampire films but this film was alright to watch. The crew did a fine enough job in creating this film. The storyline of this film was fine and strong enough. There were some parts throughout the film that were not very pleasant. The cast selection was great and strong enough. They deeply committed and connected to the storyline and to their respective characters. The chemistry between the cast members was full on.

A Nutshell Review: Dark Shadows,"Director Tim Burton, actor Johnny Depp and composer Danny Elfman reunite for their umpteenth collaboration on film, and like all their previous works together, there's always a touch of the strange, the quirky and a whole lot of dark themes all rolled into one. Based upon the 1960s television soap opera series, it's not exactly The Addams Family here, but one will see some shades of similarities in this big screen adaptation, with a more serious romantic love triangle here taking centerstage.It's the story of how Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp), the scion of the Collins family who had crossed from Liverpool to the New World in the 18th Century, and through their fishing business amassed fame, fortune and being responsible to create a new city revolving around it. But Barnabas' romantic indiscretion with their supposed maid Angelique (Eva Green), a witch in hiding in his household, ran his promising future to the ground, cursed to live out the rest of his life as a vampire, see his one true love Josette (Bella Heathcote) commit suicide in front of his eyes, and having to witness the demise of his parents as well. And to make matters worse, Angelique turned the townfolks against him, locking him up in a box and buried six feet under.Fast forward some 200 years later, and the Collins family's fortunes had seen better days, with the family now made up of matriarch and distant relative of Barnabas, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer), daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), womanizing Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller) and his son David (Gulliver McGrath), David's psychiatrist Dr Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) who craves youth and drink, and housekeeper Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley). And we join Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote again) as the new governess to the children, who shares an uncanny resemblance with Josette, which means Barnabas, broken out of his confines by construction workers, get to pursue true love all over again. But not before Angelique gets wind of her infatuation's break out, and returns to cause trouble for Barnabas and the Collins all over again, until she gets what she wants.There's some good natured humour ranging from the usual slapstick, to that of a fish being caught out of water since Barnabas speaks in a style already extinct, and has plenty to catch up with in the modern 70s world of free love and technology. There's no glitter in this vampire, and it's old school throughout with his fear of sunlight, which means his wheelings and dealings to get the Collins back on track in the fishing business have to be conducted in shadow, as well as to curtail his need for human blood to keep alive. But that's about all that's great about the film, which is unfortunate.Could it be that Tim Burton is running out of steam with the rehashing of the usual dark themes in his films, that enough is enough? It's not to say Dark Shadows is a bad film, but this collaboration with the usual suspects looked a bit tired. Elfman's score is uninspiring and somewhat subdued behind the soundtrack (featuring Alice Cooper too, no less), and the direction very much looking alike with a host of other Burton films. Too many characters in this film, some with last minute surprises, resulted in a lack of focus on many supporting cast, where even Michelle Pfeiffer got little else to do here except to agree on a pact with Barnabas, and having mother-daughter issues. Jackie Earle Haley was also wasted, as was Jonny Lee Miller and Helena Bonham Carter, all having little to contribute to the plot.So we're left with Johnny Depp and Eva Green to carry the film, and their scenes together were wickedly interesting, but also repetitive in their rivalry. Bella Heathcote plays the go-between character, but while the point of view shifted to her when we enter the shift in timeline, that very much shifted out of focus once Barnabas entered the picture, and their supposed true romance wasn't a tad believable. Which is a pity since that would have formed an emotional crux to anchor the film upon, rather than to be wowed with the CG visuals but turning everything else empty without much heart.Dark Shadows didn't have a clear direction on where it wanted its narrative to head toward. It could have been a dark comedy, or a heavy tragic romance, or both even, but what turned out felt lacklustre and in some ways going through the motion. With the Burton-Depp-Elfman axis in the past, one would have come to expect more, and unfortunately this collaboration was steps backward.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Don't hate the performers; hate the script,"Tim Burton and Johnny Depp used to be the most reliable of partners, with their work dating back to 1990 with the release of the beloved Edward Scissorhand. In present time, the public has grown weary of the two men, as they both seem to be putting on a crazy costume party with every film they make. Regardless, I'll always view Burton and Depp as a likable pair, and even with the lukewarm Dark Shadows, I hold optimism that in the near future I'll hold one of their upcoming films as a great picture.Dark Shadows, as stated, is not that film. It's a film with an incredible, Gothic look and tone, but a meandering story that tries to dab into way too many genres. Perhaps because I never watched the soap opera, which is now adored by cultists everywhere, I am entitled to have a more favorable opinion than the average fan. However, even a moviegoer ignorant to the original show may have a hard time enjoying this picture to the fullest extent. It's not the easy time I've had sitting still for one-hundred and thirteen minutes.The plot: Johnny Depp is Barnabas Collins, a 200-year-old vampire who has been kept in a coffin for many years by his evil ex-lover Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). When he is unearthed, he ventures back home to the gigantic Collinsport Mansion, which resides in 1972 Maine. After reconnecting with the family, including the shy matriarch, Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) and the new, very attractive helper Victoria (Bella Heathcore), he must find a way to stop Bouchard, who has now completely taken over the Maine town.Depp fully exercises his right to be quirky and outright strange and I wouldn't expect anything less. He makes Barnabas into a likable, but rather forgettable soul, and the other members of the Collins family remain pretty faceless for the entire time, appearing as members of the Addams family only far less interesting. As a non-fan of the series like myself, I'm at least wise enough to know that there has to be something more to this series and these characters than what is presented here. If Barnabas remained the entire focus of the show, like here in the film, and the other characters were sidelined to dry supporting roles, how did it go on to merit a level of cult support and fanatical charm amongst the public? The same went for the dreadful film adaptation of The Dukes of Hazzard, which focused almost entirely on stupidity and car chases. Even those unaware of the true ideas behind the episodes know well enough that the show didn't last several seasons and earn love and fame because of simply that; there had to be more that was simply neglected for the film adaptation.The more prominent problem with Dark Shadows, however, is its lack of self-awareness and thematic certainty. One moment, we see Barnabas fiercely biting the neck of a woman, when the next, we see him making some sort of corny joke that throws the surrounding mood out the window. Is this a comedy? A black one? A costume drama, a quirky thriller? A horror film? An argument can be made for all of those, which is great, but Dark Shadows unevenly cycles through all of those genres that it becomes messy and boring.Saying a Tim Burton movie has great cinematography and beautiful visuals is like saying Ken Burns' documentaries are full of interesting points and always provide knowledge to viewers. The compliment is a commonplace, and in many ways, I appreciate the look of this film over that of Burton's Alice in Wonderland. The Gothic-style replicated here, heavily emphasizing the black, purple, and white color scheme, is richly detailed and eye-poppingly crafted, and the dark cinematography is terrifically presented through an eerily ominous lens. Even its score accentuates a more haunting, unnerving atmosphere than I originally thought.Dark Shadows is a fine picture in the respect that it's made by someone who knows how to decorate a set, utilize special effects effectively, and erect quirkiness on demand. It's just a shame that Burton has such a hard time getting a story across that is interesting and focused. Perhaps it's time for him and Depp to take a break from each other, or seek out a project that will allow them to take a more specific direction, while still breeding their indelible eccentricities into the project. It's a shame to see a few missteps leave two once highly-regarded talents doubted and bashed.Starring: Johnny Depp, Eva Green, Michelle Pfieffer, Bella Heathcore, and Jackie Earle Haley.

Very entertaining,"First of all, I did not know that this was originally a TV-show, so I went in with a complete open mind, and was very entertained. As to expect when watching a Burton movie, it looks fantastic. I am not sure if this was also shot in 3d (seen it in 2d), but it is stunning. The music is also well chosen and the score by Elfman is very good (somewhere along the way it reminded me of Williams score for TinTin). As for the story, there is actually a story in the movie (seems rare these days). And although it might be a bit slow, it is captivating. There are some nice twists and turns to keep things interesting, very well done. Depps character is not as over the top as for instance Jack Sparrow, but that fits the story well. And he is a vampire, so although you gain sympathy for him, he needs to do vampire stuff. Loved the Granny! The ending (without spoiling it), well, I felt like it could have been better and the twist/surprise in the end, I saw that coming (does not mean it is bad!! not at all).All in all, a very enjoyable movie experience, go see it in the cinema.Looking forward to the sequel!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"""Does my odor offend thee?""","If you are going into this movie thinking you are going to see the drama filled Dark Shadows TV show brought to life by the infamous Tim Burton, think again. If you are going into this movie thinking you are going to be watching another great Burton/Depp/Carter movie, then you are right, as a stand alone movie this is a great movie about the life of a vampire who has been entombed for centuries, only to have to help save his decedents from evil spirits after being resurrected; however, this movie has very little shared plot line with the actual TV program. With the TV show being somewhat of a drama, Burton went for more of a comedic feel to life as a turn of the century vampire. It all depends on which end of the spectrum you're looking from. Me being the Burton/Depp/Carter fan that I am, thoroughly enjoyed watching Depp submerge himself in the quirky, somewhat naive Barnubus Jones. If you are watching the movie expecting it to be a movie version of the TV show, then you'll surely be disappointed.

"Surprised, oh yes.","It's has the vibe, in Tim Burton's view. I think sometimes combining the two, can be refreshing. We need more films that require original and creative imaginations of any genre. Even mixing two or three genres could be good justice. Tim Burton outdone himself on all his films and this one, did not disappoint me at all. Johnny Depp's character really was different than any films he has ever done, but very good sense of humor and has a Gothic view on how vampires should be.

Cool movie but if you think deeper it'll turn...,"After seeing Tim Burton's Ed Wood (which I consider his masterpiece) i became a huge fan of his. Hes really unique with has his own touch of Gothic and dark imagery. I was really hyped for Dark Shadows but when saw it and i was disappointed. What kills it: I loved the movie, the humor is cool but what kills it is the lack of focus. The movie didn't focus on all the characters except for Barnabus of course but i didn't care for any of the other characters. for example Victoria is one of the main characters in the story and we see her only for 15 mins! i almost forgot she was in the damn movie. Another thing is the acting, they were all great except for that little boy, he was boring!. What made it good: One of the coolest references was a poster for Christopher Lee's Hammer Dracula A.D 1972,which then followed by a conservation between Barnabus and the Count himself Christopher Lee (C.Lee who played Dracula in every Hammer Dracula).

"Mediocre, but with excellent production","To begin with, this film has good technical details and is visually acceptable. The production design is good, the soundtrack composed by Danny Elfman is also acceptable, the effects are not bad and I really liked Johnny Depp's vampire appearance. Another thing that I cannot miss is the character of Eva Green, since to be honest she is very succulent and it was difficult to take your eyes off her. The look of the movie is fine, but the movie itself is something else. It is supposedly a black comedy and although I laughed a little when I saw it in the cinema, now I have to say that when I saw it again it didn't seem very good as a comedy. The jokes are not well balanced with the tone of the film and instead of being a laughable comedy, the truth is that it is somewhat boring. I think that without the jokes it might have been better, since it has serious moments that stand out. There's not much to add, because those who have seen it understand my point and the only excuse I have for watching this movie is because of the technical details and the cast and Eva Green. The only thing I can say about this movie is that I found it mediocre. Visually and technically it's not bad, but as a comedy movie it's not good. My rating for this movie is 7/10 and I would only watch it again to take in the visual quality and drool over Eva Green's sexy moments.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"I enjoyed it, but it could have been better.","I really did enjoy this film, but not in a way that I had anticipated. What I wanted from this film was a more seriously Gothic-style film that was reminiscent of Sweeney Todd, Edward Scissorhands or Sleepy Hollow, but it's a tad too light to be compared to those films. It was funny in some places, more serious in others, and at times it was almost like a parody. I was honestly a little disappointed by it. Chloe Grace Moretz completely ruined the film for me, as her character was incredibly over acted and just a little bit cringe-worthy. Johnny Depp was brilliant as always, no complaints about his performance at all. Gulliver McGrath was also awesome, and I loved his character, they should definitely have focused on him a lot more than what they did.Although I have a great love and respect for Tim Burton, I have to say that it was almost like he was trying to put too much into the film, and there was so much going on that he'd lost focus on what could have been a really great story line. All in all the film was alright. It'll never be a classic like Edward Scissorhands or The Nightmare Before Christmas, and I think maybe Tim Burton should stop trying to create one so desperately and just calm it down a bit. Something more subtle and beautiful would be much more welcomed, I think, than another over-done production such as this.Having said all that, it is worth a watch just for Johnny Depp, and the great visuals throughout the film. If you liked Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland, you'll probably like this too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
from the eyes of a novice,"First, I should say that I have never seen the original ""Dark Shadows"". I had read about it when I was young, and it didn't really come to my attention until Jonathan Frid died. Maybe that's why I enjoyed Tim Burton's ""Dark Shadows"" more than most people apparently did. It came across as a tongue-in-cheek adaptation. The main focus is Barnabas Collins's goal of reestablishing his family's former glory, but it partly looks at the era when it takes place. There are the fish-out-of-water situations (Barnabas tries to figure out what sort of witchcraft gets used to operate a TV), and one that affirms the generation gap (the stodgy matriarch asks the governess's opinion of Richard Nixon and the Vietnam War). But there's also the ""if only"" scene: Barnabas hangs out with some hippies, one of whom predicts that the Vietnam War will be the last war ever. I wish!Anyway, it's a pretty funny movie, although I did prefer Tim Burton's other movie from last year (his stop-motion adaptation of his earlier ""Frankenweenie""). I'll have to see the original series to see just how this movie compares.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Um Alice, this isn't your movie.","I do not doubt the skills of Tim Burton nor his cast of characters, nevertheless I found this film to be very underwhelming. In his normal fashion, Johnny Depp pulled off another semi-creepy but lovable performance that somehow made this film a bit more bearable. The plot was very simplistic in design and a bit too underdeveloped to carry much weight. The other actors were good enough, but they were not important to the basic story. Only Johnny Depp was. As he always is. The jokes were stupid and felt as though they were lacking in the kind of taste normally associated with such films. The worst of it though was that the main character played by Depp, Barnabas Collins, was excused for his behavior as a vampire. It was OK that he was killing people left and right out of thirst. It wasn't frowned upon by the other characters, nor discouraged by the narrative. Perhaps I'm old fashioned, but I think it's a bit rude to go around sucking people's blood when you are thirsty. But that's just me apparently. There were also several appearances that didn't make sense in the film. Like Alice Cooper. Why was he there? Overall, this film was a bit confusing and disappointing in it's presentation. It could have been a comedic view of vampires if it didn't try so hard to be funny and dark at the same time. Sorry Tim, better luck next time. As a disclaimer, I've never really been a fan of his anyway.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Blood is thicker than water.,"I've always heard of the original 1966 TV series Dark Shadows, but I never saw it, so I have no idea how it compares with this film. At the very least, I always thought it was weird that they'd make a movie out of this after more than forty years of the TV show's premier.On its own merits, the film has its moments. Tim Burton's typical Gothic aesthetic is applied pretty generously, so the film does have its fair share of darkly fantastic imagery, wicked monsters, and imaginative special effects. There are also occasional moments of amusing comedy. In fact, it comes pretty close to achieving the same effect as the film adaptations of The Addams Family or The Brady Bunch, since all these films took the characters of the original shows and plopped them into modern times to create some really funny scenes. The Dark Shadows film sets out to do the same, and it is successful at times. The problem is, it's never constant, so the film tends to drag in between the funny scenes and the more eventful scenes.The story for this is not too bad. I've heard that the film crams in entire seasons of the show into its short runtime; fortunately, the film is never rushed, but it feels as though a number of scenes, subplots, and characters are presented without any direct bearing on the main story. Regardless, the film does a fine job of keeping all the plots and characters straight and presentable for the audience. Characters are pretty interesting all around, even if some of them are one-sided or undercooked. A running theme of family helps tie it all together.The film looks good and slick, with good photography and editing. Acting is not bad; I enjoyed Johnny Depp's eccentricities, and I loved Eva Green's performance. Writing is alright. A good amount of quality sets, props, costumes, and special effects were dispensed effectively. Music is pretty groovy.I recommend it as a rental.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
total waste,"Seeing this made me wonder why Tim Burton and/or Johnny Depp ever thought this would work as campy comedy.It totally doesn't. Not that my liking the TV show kept me from being open to other approaches to the material. I guess it takes a special kind of person to laugh at a ""comedy"" that features lots of bright red blood on the screen. And I guess I'm not one of them.Michelle Pfeiffer is wasted too. And she seems like someone who should have known better. The total of enjoyable moments clocked in at under 10 for me. An opening scene set on a cliffside, and a nice song by Alice Cooper that sounded great on the theater speakers. I barely even like or listen to Alice Cooper anymore. The fact that his appearance was the most enjoyable part lets you know how little I liked this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Well...it was amazing!,"I am a massive fan of Tim Burton, but had never actually heard of Dark Shadows as a soap opera till the film was released (this is because it isn't really big in the UK); I was a little apprehensive at first, because he hasn't done a soap opera before and I didn't really know how he was going to play it, but I must say I was HUGELY impressed. Firstly, lets go with the golden trio, Depp, Bonham Carter, and Burton- now when a film comes out and these three are involved, I automatically get excited. Once again I was largely impressed by Depp's performance, as a vampire in a completely different era to his previous, the vocabulary used and comedic timing was spot on. However, though Helena Bonham Carter did do the film justice, I felt something somewhat lacking in her performance in comparison to her others, (Sweeney Todd, Alice in Wonderland, Planet of the Apes.) She just didn't seem entirely focused, but it is not a criticism merely an observation. Moretz and Pfeiffer were absolutely fantastic as Mother and daughter, and with the final plot twist in the end you can really see the bond created between the cast members which was brilliant. BUT- the biggest congrats and praise goes out to the wonderful Eva Green, playing Barnabas' brief love interest, the jealous, psycho witch/bunny boiler, Eva's Angelique Bouchard was excellent, she stole every scene she was in with what seemed like effortless attempt, (even from Johnny Depp) and although psychotic and insane, played a deviant sexy strong character, or 'ballsy Barbie' . Her comedic timing was absolutely perfect and she was quite literally the star of the film. One cast member disappointed me though, and that was Bella Heathcote, I felt her portrayal as Maggie Evans/ Victoria Winters, was completely monotone, she was very plain and did not stand out for me at all, and I had to think that in the final scene, her likeness to one of Tim's animated characters was the only reason she got the role, as her acting was absolutely dismal. Overall, the film was extremely enjoyable, funny and in one particular scene, absolutely moving (I admit I did cry!)- The music was brilliant (who doesn't like the 70's) and it is full of laughs, and also a little scary at times. I went to see this at the cinema 11 times and I was NEVER disappointed, can't wait for the DVD!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Ends Up Needing More Than Just a Blood Transfusion.,"Schizophrenic underachiever that markets itself as a unique and appealing comedy on the level of perhaps ""Being There"" as long-deceased and cursed vampire Johnny Depp awakens in 1972 Maine with typically well-calculated and hilarious results. However, Tim Burton's unfocused, mean-spirited, and oft-times confusing direction derails what should have been the film's premise with surprisingly dark and disturbing sequences, a distracting love triangle between Depp, his true love Bella Heatchcote (in a yawner of a role), and the super-sexy Eva Green (arguably hitting a new note for even her on the heat meter) who doubles as a witch and a cutthroat businesswoman of canned foods (no kidding), and waning attempts of possible character redemptions. Also along for the ride is the always under-rated Helena Bonham Carter as a frazzled psychiatrist, 1972 family matriarch Michelle Pfeiffer (woefully lost and miscast here), and cameos by horror veterans like Jackie Earle Haley, Christoper Lee, and even Alice Cooper. Definitely would have worked better as a long skit ala something from ""Saturday Night Live"" or even perhaps a sitcom, uneven elements turn a possible winner into another in the long line of ho-hum releases from the sometimes brilliant, but sometimes negatively outlandish Burton. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
How much did this cost?,"Ed Wood was the last time Burton really kept me in aww~mode... I have been a long time fan of his work & his overall feel, but this time out, everything falls flat and not even the blue cheekbones of Sir Depp can bring this back to life. Shame.It should be noted as well that while shot with a big budget, the Collinswood set feels about as big as a shoebox. I guess all the money went into that house, but I could not help notice how small the world the movie took place in. Its basically narrow streets and two canneries at the end of a pier~The biggest fault I had with the movie (which I was consistently trying to enjoy as it went on) besides the script was the casting. Everyone was bland, lifeless and dull. Depp was the obvious standout, getting the laughs and embodying Barnabas,but everyone else left me with a kind of smattering of appeal towards their characters.

Definitely not as bad as people are making out to be,"I honestly don't understand why people are so upset at this movie. It's a parody, and you can tell that from the trailer. Does it have its flaws?

It seems to me, that the people angry don't understand the joke behind this film. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp wanted to recreate in this film the sensation of watching Dark Shadows, a soap opera that's known for its cheesiness and low budget. The film is supposed to be goofy and over the top; it's supposed to be dramatic in some places; it's supposed to be all over the place; it's supposed to have random, shocking moments, because that's what soap operas are like. I'll admit, I haven't seen the original Dark Shadows, but I plan to. I have also done research and saw some clips.

"Perfect, then it's all thrown away..","Dark Shadows 7 out of 10This movie really had great potential.. The sad thing is, that they: Burton, Depp and Carter.. had it so close.. like, 70% perfect!!! But alas, after a great soundtrack (it's opening song a favourite of mine, and one I have planned for a film I've written of my own) and one of Depp's best performances in a long time.. Burton's art ""should"" have succeeded, but instead, fell suddenly flat..Amongst the cast: Michelle Pfeiffer (another ex cast member of Burton's) looked amazing for her age (perhaps just good makeup of course) Helena Bonham Carter (that I've never been a fan of) played her part as well as expected knowing the inner workings of her hubby's mind.. Even Christopher Lee makes a brief appearance along with Alice who well, I'm not sure has changed in the past 50 years..Tim Burton is a master of the Gothic scene. His architecture in time, place, setting and sculpture is without equal. From the early success of Edward Scissorhands to his latter great Sleepy Hollow. He once again brings this uncanny, quirky and foreboding ability to entice audiences into his escapism with Dark Shadows, and he so nearly pulls it off masterly once more, but unfortunately where the film goes, where it entices us to be, instead stops in it's tracks and starts to drag.. then with quick explanation or none at all comes to a close and leaves you behind with quite a dull feeling of.. what was that all about? is that it? So I guess now, it's over.I soooo wanted it to be more, but with such strong character development and premise from the get go, you expected more of the same from start to finish, but instead it rushes what it should have developed, and throws what could have been to the winds..The film may leave you with questions, but perhaps they are not even worth knowing the answer to, other than perhaps, why?",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Burton spirals into shadows,"A featurised reimagining of a TV soap opera, Tim Burton returns with a gruesome dark comedy about a XIXth Century vampire Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp), the entrepreneurial creator of a fishing empire in the town of Collinwood, who is unwittingly released from his eternal coffin prison. His bloody urges must be quenched, hence blood splatters, but still Barnabas is an eternal with honour and a strong attachment to family ties. Hence he decides to live with his descendants in his family mansion, populated by Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer), her daughter Carolyn (Chloë Grace Moretz), her brother-in-law Roger (Jonny Lee Miller), nephew David (Gulliver McGrath) as well as an assorted crowd of alcoholic psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), caretaker Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley) and babysitter Victoria Wnters (Bella Heathcote). The latter bearing a remarkable resemblance to Barnabas's long departed beloved and ultimate cause of his accursed state. To his surprise the Collins fortune has largely fallen into disregard, whilst the town's fishing business is currently overrun by Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), the witch responsible for turning him into a vampire.Admittedly an immense Tim Burton fan ""Dark Shadows"" is sadly his worst picture apart from ""Planet of the Apes"". Possibly revisiting the same actors has strained his ingenuity a bit, as well as caused the actors in force to go through familiar motions. As such Johnny Depp seems like a mold of other Depp-Burton characters, which is further not helped by the Depp and co's dry delivery of dry humour, which makes this dark tale thoroughly humourless. Knowing everyone in the cast is brimming with talent makes the overall dourness of proceedings even more striking. Depp seems emotionless beyond interest, Carter struggles to imbue any presence, Green is an empty if pretty shell, Haley barely registers, while Moretz comes off whiny and pretentious. The story wiggles around trying to bring together a coherent plot, but instead seems like a poorly glued together sequence of scenes of varying quality, which fail to either construct a story or instill any sense of affinity towards any on-screen character.Conversely Burton's sense of glorious Gothic atmosphere is at its best with set designs and rummaging shots quintessential stuff and possibly some of the best in his career. However thrown into such a detached and pointless story it just seems like an immense waste of possibilities.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The movie was beautifully approved for the eyes of many audiences,"In all honesty, the first thing I noticed from this film was the Mcdonald's ads in the movie. This was fine I suppose, although some people may have found it tedious. My view on this movie was that, yes, maybe some of the actors were just put in here because they are friends of Tim, but furthermore they still acted to their best abilities and showed many profound qualities. Johnny Depp was probably the one having the most fun with his accent and seemed to enjoy himself. This movie had many qualities that we have not seen in other movies that Tim Burton directed. I noticed many comments which referenced to many sexual themes which was unusual to me in a film from Tim Burton (except for the one scene in Edward Scissorhands). I suppose it was to make the humor of today and make the movie more lovable. Then again it was humorous to me overall and made a tremendously great show for me. I loved to see the works that were shot in Los Angeles. (the wonderful quality of the cinematography, camera angles, etc) Special kudos to Bruno Delbonnel for his brilliant works with the cameras. I could Tell Timothy had many things on his mind flying back in forth from UK to help with Frankenweenie, then to California for the shoots and directing of Dark Shadows. He did a wonderful job on his film and had a great time in the works. The next coming films are sure to drive even more of an audience now that the table is set. I hope to one day be apart of something as great as this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
An enjoyable vampire feast,"'Too many dull and hideous vampire movies are being produced these days'. Said one of the moviegoers sitting behind me. 'Tim Burton better deliver'.I could really understand why he was so irritated. The waves of movies (and TV shows) about vampire-ish creatures of any kind attack us from everywhere all year long. I wouldn't mind if they were even half as good as old Nosferatu (1922) or Dracula (1931) with Bela Lugosi. The thing is, though, that vampires nowadays tend to be, how should I say, too pretty and shiny. They do not resemble the archetypal monster that was able to scare people away with a single look.However, taking into consideration that Dark Shadows is based on a fantastic TV series (which aired from 1966 to 1971), and that it's built on collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, I thought that this might finally be a vampire picture worth watching.Even though it doesn't actually share any similarities with the classic horror show, it still is an enjoyable movie in its own Burton-y style. The art direction, costumes, make-ups and sets are spectacular, as always. In its visual sense it's definitely a thing of beauty.Unfortunately, it lacks a bit in its storyline. The beginning is very promising, but it becomes less and less engaging as it runs towards those important, but not very promising, final minutes.It starts off with a fine introduction of Barnabas Collins' (Depp) teenage years in a wealthy estate of Collinwood, and shows us why he had been turned into a vampire in the first place. We find out about the love that he lost, because of an overly jealous woman called Angelique (Eva Green). She was also responsible for putting him into a coffin buried deep in the ground.Fast-forward 200 years. The Collinwood Manor is now a ruin occupied by Barnabas' distant relatives, including the family's fortune-keeper Elizabeth (Pfeifer), useless brother Roger (Miller), his grieving son David (McGrath), and a chilled-out 15-year-old Carolyn (Moretz). There is also the live-in psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Carter) and a drunken servant Willie (Haley). And how can I forget about the old lady that actually doesn't say a word, but steals every scene that she's in (the whole audience was laughing so hard every time she appeared).After an accidental turn of events Barnabas is finally freed from his horrible trap and returns to the old house with a bang. I must say that with the minute Johnny Depp arrived on the screen again with his pale-as-a-wall face the movie become much more entertaining. The enjoyment he shows when he examines the marvelous architecture and décor of the Manor is so expressive and funny, that it provides for some of the best scenes of the film. That, and also his utter fascination with everything 1970's- style, like a Big McDonald's sign or a lava lamp (it sure looks like blood in a urine).The burning scenes of fiery flirtations between Angelique and Barnabas show that even the undead are able to give out some of the hottest 'cadaverous cold' love-making sequences of the past few years.All in all, I have to say that Tim Burton was once again able to make a movie that can yield a huge amount of laughs from the viewer. Even though Dark Shadows doesn't measure up to pictures, such as Edward Scissorhands or Sleepy Hollow, it still shows a fair amount of potential in its ability to grasp one's attention. And Johnny Depp's acting, as the dignified and totally classy vampire (more Dracula, less Edward Cullen), is as neat and pleasurable as always.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"starts okay, devolves into screeching camp","Tim Burton's reimagining of ""Dark Shadows"" is a mishmash. The original ""Dark Shadows"" TV series unfolded - sometimes leisurely, sometimes recklessly - from plot to plot, highlighting along the way a variety of characters including a warlock, a ""phoenix,"" various ghosts, werewolves, psychics and spiritual mediums, witches, Frankensteins and mad doctors, professors of the occult, religious fanatics, and endless vampire victims. Time travel warped the chronological flow for months at a time. It was the pull of the overlapping narratives, improbable as they were, combined with the persuasiveness of the characters and the ever-present unifying element of creepy musical underscoring by Robert Cobert that kept audiences watching despite the tacky special effects, botched line readings and wobbly set pieces which, ridiculous as they were, transmitted an otherworldliness which was alien to anything else on the small screen at that time and which even today retains a singular character.First, let it be said that Burton and his writing team, faced with winnowing out two hours of content from an ocean of possibilities, had to make hard choices. Unfortunately they chose silly camp as their overriding style.The introductory scenes, set in the mid-1700's and narrated by Johnny Depp, straightforwardly and melodramatically explain how Barnabas Collins, the young heir to coastal Maine seafood canning fortune, is turned into a vampire by the spiteful witch Angelique as punishment for favoring another female. Being supernatural creatures, Barnabas and Angelique never die, so we meet them again 200 years later.But when we are whisked to the year 1972 as a construction crew inadvertently digs up Barnabas's chain-wrapped coffin, the movie suddenly descends into broad CGI-assisted slapstick and ironic camp, with the most consistent theme being Barnabas as odd man out from another era mistaking electronic or mechanical devices such as automobiles, TVs or neon signs as satanic apparitions.When we are introduced to the 20th century occupants of Collinwood, the family estate, the movie turns to the style of sometimes clever, sometimes over-obvious drawing room banter. Once the characters have been established the story galumphs along through a combination of montages (some with visual wit) accompanied by 70s pop music and outbursts of violence (fights, explosions, a wild seduction) until the dreary mess finally ends.The trajectory of the plot - the struggle of Barnabas to save his family from Angelique's curse and reunite with the modern incarnation of his 18th century lover - brings us too often into the outside world of the nearby town with its noises, bright lights and bustle and corporate board meetings and high-lit factory assembly lines, which violates the stark and morbid Gothic atmosphere that made the original series unique. Simple face-to-face dialogues with perhaps a bit of fisticuffs or strangulation, a dash of poison or a bullet or two, are replaced by endless orgies of environment-shattering mayhem, drowning out the melancholia that was one of the hallmarks of the series. We are benumbed. Perhaps the lowest point is reached at a ball thrown by the Collins family to ingratiate themselves with the community which they have alienated over the decades. A remarkably well-preserved Alice Cooper plays himself as the ""entertainment,"" complete with rock ensemble, while four cast members from the original series make a fleeting and utterly pointless cameo appearance as guests among the crowd. They seem insulted, degraded.Johnny Depp emerges with dignity as the conflicted vampire Barnabas Collins. He makes the character his own while also channeling key aspects of the role's originator Jonathan Frid not only in his almost-British line readings, but also in the way he extends his consonants, particularly his s's, at the ends of words. He maintains a haunted dignity, aided by some beautifully written lines in the 18th century style. The other cast members range from excellent (Chloe Grace Moretz as bratty Collins daughter Caroline) to good (Johnny Lee Miller, as the decadent Roger Collins, who could have been even better if he had been given more of a chance) to sloppy (Helena Bonham Carter, as Dr. Julia Hoffman, who tries to cure Barnabas of vampirism; she too is undermined by the script which makes her sober, thoughtful character into a pill-popping, carrot-haired lush for no apparent reason).It would be interesting if other directors took a crack at ""Dark Shadows."" There is much in this iconic artifact of popular culture to draw from and it's a shame to let it go to waste. How about it, Mr. Lynch?",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A Lot of Fun,"The Burton-Depp sense of exotic humor is back once again, making a return after 'Alice in Wonderland' to hypnotize us with a vampire tale.Imagine a man from the 17th century landing in 1972. Now imagine that man is Johnny Depp in a Tim Burton film need I say more? Based on the 1966-1971 soap opera of the same name, Depp finally realizes his dream of incarnating the role of Barnabas Collins, a 200-year old vampire. He returns to the age of rock and roll and hippie nonchalance to re-establish the once very successful family business. But an old affair- with a now powerful witch- isn't about to let some 'noble' blood-thirsty ruin her fish kingdom. If you think our intro is absurd, wait till you watch the film.The film goes back to 1760, when the Collins' established Collinsport, a flourishing fishing port. They worked very hard on their family trade but gave their son Barnabas a very precious piece of advice; the greatest fortune of all is family. The wealthy young man grows up to become a Don Juan, breaking some hearts on the way including that of the aforementioned witch, the Collins's servant Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). When he finds his own true love, Josette DuPres, Angelique in an act of jealousy puts a spell on her rival, forcing her to jump from 'Widow's Peak'. Baranbas meanwhile is doomed to suffer for eternity as a vampire. Angelique then turns the town against him, and he is buried alive in a chained coffin.Two centuries later he is accidentally released, only to find a troubled and financially ruined extended family. However Angelique was living happily covered in wealth and beauty.History repeats itself in a different era, and the conflict is back on fire between the two former lovers. Baranbas's priority is to bring back the glory of his family history, while Angelique is obsessed with power at any cost. It gets even better now that she has a new rival who stole Baranbas heart away; Victoria (Bella Heathcote) who recently moved to the castle as a governess of the orphaned David Collins (Gulliver McGrath).Besides the absolutely gorgeous 70's 'free look' apparel, versus the stark black Gothic persona, the outcome is ""Shakespeare in the Park"" (borrowed from 'The Avengers'), with the 1967 Moody Blue's hit 'Nights in White Satin' in the intro. The dialogue is Shakespeare meeting Alice Cooper, literally.Recent reviews have been a bit harsh on the film, but guess what?

Burton Seemed to Out-Deadpan the Original Deadpan,"My Wife and I were both HUGE fans of the original TV series. We actually own most of the original paperback copies of DS as well as the VHS(s) of the original show.Depp was a perfect Barnabas, and I thought Phieffer was a pretty good Elizabeth. To my wife and I, Eva Green stole the movie as Angelique. Her overall vibe in the movie was great. But the reason why I only gave it a 5/10 is twofold;1) - What little comedy there was was shown in the TV previews, and, 2) - I thought the overall pace of the movie was extremely boring.While DS always had a dark, deadpan vibe to it, I thought Burton went so far in trying to capture that vibe that he ruined any chance at capturing the overall suspense of the old show. The casting was great, but the editing and pace was terrible. Burton missed on quite a few genuine opportunities to add a bit more humor and there was absolutely no real suspense to speak of. It was pretty obvious what would happen next; including the ending.Unlike other reviewers, though, I will surely be on line to watch the (hopefully) next installment.

All the other actors are well cast, including Alice Cooper who's an inspired touch. My only complaint is common to today's movies: CGI.

Another playful works by Tim Burton... And so?,"It is true that Dark Shadows is less profound, less marvelous, with less glitter, and more both clichés and repetitions, but evenly strong cast - no matter if leading or supporting roles - makes it still pleasant and catchy to follow. Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Jackie Earle Haily - those names are all known to those fond of ""different"" movies; moreover, they are also recurring actors in Burton's movies. Well yes, the plot is uneven, but there are several funny moments (particularly when Depp reacts to 1970ies lifestyle, a kind of cultural shock), and depiction of a vampire is also different from trivial approaches on this matter.Despite some shortcomings, still recommended - unless you dislike Burton's out-of-this-world creations.

lighthearted and enjoyable for all,"I loved this film. So funny and interesting... WELL DONE to director actors film crew and writer. We got it and loved it, thanks for a great afternoon.Our son was put off by the reviews and missed a fantastic movie, but we will be buying it and have a huge TV so a possible cult movie will be enjoyed by all over and over..I disagree with previous viewers that characters were inserted without need, you can't have a family without family members and I thought the twists were funny and in line with current trends... very amusing. All the actors got their parts and the idea of the movie and acted very well accordingly.A movie with a difference, but great cinematography and theme. Really enjoyable for all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Not great, but worth a watch","Tim Burton's career has been kind of all over the place. Recently his last film, Alice in Wonderland, wasn't anything to get excited about, but this was a welcome return to form, if he ever had one officially, for Burton. The best part of the film is Johnny Depp having a great time in the role of the vampire Barnabas Collins. Eva Green also does well as the witch who cursed him. The film has flaws however with its uneven tone, not quite balanced between comedy and horror. Just a closing note: I thank the film for the Carpenters references and the montage featuring Top of the World. Thanks for resurrecting the Carpenters when they had seemingly disappeared from the modern culture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Very disappointing,"The film ""Dark Shadows"" is a date with destiny that its director Tim Burton does not show up for. This could have been a very good scary movie - easily one of the best of its era. Unfortunately Burton ruins this by constantly throwing in dumb jokes that are never funny. It seems like such a waste. The budget was obviously huge, the kind most fright-film makers could only dream of. A talented cast is assembled. The lighting, cinematography, special effects, sets and costumes are good as any chiller I've ever seen, and far beyond most. Even with all the lame jokes the basic plot line manages to chill - probably the main reason none of the dumb humor works. Bela Lugosi would have traded most of his career for one movie with a budget as big as what 60 seconds of this cost. Yet it doesn't work. The fault lies with Burton, who, it seems, lacks the courage to make the genuine attempt to scare you that this tale deserved. It's like he was afraid of being ridiculed in case a true attempt at a fright flick failed, so he hedges his bets by ladling on camp before the horse even comes out of the gate. Like he has to let you know he's so far above the material he's winking at it - or so he believes. The story's a lot better than what he does with it. The supporting actors are good, especially Michelle Pfeiffer. But Johnny Depp's portrayal of Barnabas Collins is not one of his best. Like Burton, he ladles on the camp, and it fails. Also the accent he attempts often seems unwieldy, and how white is his skin? Well, that arctic white shade you painted your kitchen wall to match the refrigerator? It's whiter. The scenes of Barnabas having sex do not work on any level. Some things are better left to the imagination. Truly a disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
We could do less with the Avengers and more with Dark Shadows,"Usually i don't really care to write down a review i just give it stars but this, this i had to do. i need to be explained (probably by rabid sheep) why this movie has a 6.5 rating and the droll which is the The Avengers got a 8.5 or so ?Dark Shadows is beautifully realized in any way. The acting is top notch: Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer need i say more ? the scenes were amazingly crafted: no flamboyant CGI which makes films feel like a game on my PS3 the story and plot were nice and kept your mind running as to what's to come. in the end what you get is a well made movie in all its facets.i really don't get why crap like the Avengers which had nothing to it even the battle scenes were poor, boring and felt straight out of a video game at best, rates higher than Dark ShadowsPeople if you value your thinking more than you value your reality shows go see this, if not go see The Avengers",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Bad script saved by fleeting moments,"I feel even a six rating might be too high for what is essentially an uninspired, not that clever comedy. However, I was never bored and some of the jokes did make me laugh (often in spite of myself), so I cannot claim it's flaming trash.The big problem is the script. It lacks focus. The opening is heavy on exposition and low on establishing characters-- and by establishing characters, I mean presenting Barnabas Collins as anything other than a poor sap subject to the cruelties of the plot. The love subplot is so underdeveloped that the filmmakers could have cut it with no problem. The family bonds are given lip service rather than exhibited through character action, dialogue, or ANYTHING.Can't really recommend it, yet it's not as rank as its reputation would suggest. Some of the jokes are funny and you can tell Depp is trying to do something with the material here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
I really wanted this to be great!,"Unfortunately, it was a total bust. My favorite childhood TV show made into a movie by two of my favorite folks, Director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp. What could possible go wrong? - everything... Mr. Burton never decides if he is making a comedy or a horror or a drama or a satire and ends up with a jumbled mess. What an utter disappointment. Eva Green tries her best with the script she is given and Jackie Earle Haley as Willie Loomis gives a competent performance. Johnny Depp seems bored with his role and obviously does not have his heart in it. Gulliver McGrath does bring the innocence of David Collins into the film and was the only character that brought to mind the feeling of the 60's hit show. I knew with it being a Burton film that I was not going to walk into a remake of the Dark Shadows of the 1960's, but I did not expect to walk into a piece of junk.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
a muddled mess that just doesn't work.,"As it should. It sucks! Thirty seconds are good, title and last few seconds of end titles have sampled some appropriate music from the original series, and that little bit is all that that worked for me, (and that will work only for those who recognize it), and is in sharp contrast to everything else that is a muddled mess of a bastard adaptation of some of the original story line. Was surprised that they did keep it very serious for the most part. All the funny bits are in the adds and trailers. But the Nosferatu Barnabas look prevented any of this cinematic waste to work at all. In short the original fan will like the fact that it is a muddled mess and the newbie will just be bored to tears. So ironically original fans may get more enjoyment out of this, bit not in any way that the makers of this intended. If you blink you will miss the classic cast enter a doorway and then two of them in a background of another shot. Not a word spoken or mouthed. That may be something for all to follow as a good example of how to handle this. Don't speak about it, and I for one won't waste any more time thinking about it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Missing some details,"OK, I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan, so I'm gonna say he was awesome himself as usual, so that's why I gave it 6 out of 10. I know Tim Burtons style, so I didn't go to see the movie with high expectation. I think that all characters were underdeveloped. I expected little bit more detailed story about each one of them and there were way to many scenes showing only two people. I liked special effects, mainly towards the end of the movie and attention to some details (it could have been done even better). I have to say it was OK movie for rainy afternoon, but definitely not as good as Edward Scissorhands or Alice in Wonderland. Black humour was not strong/funny enough me. I guess TB tried to please bigger audience and he ended up disappointing his and JD fans. 10 people in the IMAX theatre I went to on the opening weekend speaks volume on how people feel about the movie without even seeing it.

"Great cast, effects, story, and entertaining","I wasn't expecting much since I used to watch the TV show back in the day. There wasn't much to it then, so I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be more of a drama and possibly bland. Not the case. First, I liked the way the story enfolded and how we got to know the characters one by one and how they worked in a group setting. Quite humorous and funny. I didn't expect that. Johnny Depp is great. He can play anyone or anything. He is so versatile and believable. He also has a comical side which added life to the movie. Eva Green, who played his nemesis was great. So believable. Very good actress and quite witty herself, too. If you grew up anywhere from the 60's to 90's, you will like the soundtrack. Great music. Appropriately placed in scenes. It's worth a night out and to be entertained. I liked it that much I may see it again on the big screen. I think it will have a better effect than watching it at home on a much, much, smaller screen and nowhere near the sound equipment the Cinemark theater has. Go see it with an open mind. If you're a Tim Burton fan then you will appreciate the film's direction, special effects and his dark humor. I can't wait till Frankenweenie comes out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Cute Trifle,"I was a kid when Dark Shadows started, and it was never on my radar. When I heard about it later I was very curious, and when it finally was syndicated on TV I watched a couple of episodes and found it painfully tedious. A 70s daytime soap with vampires is still a 70s daytime soap.The movie version is decidedly faster paced, aiming for campy, silly comedy and cute special effects. While it's not as fun as Burton's Ed Wood nor as deep as his Big Fish, it is a generally amusing burlesque of 70s television.I felt the last part of the movie was the weakest. Dark Shadows owes its success to not taking itself seriously, but towards the end, as the various dramatic threads come awkwardly together, the movie tries to both give viewers some flashy special effects and pull some emotion out of them, and it just doesn't work, both because it's not in keeping with the rest of the film and because the movie doesn't try hard enough to create that emotion.But overall I thought this was quite fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Tim Burton and Johnny Depp! How Can You Go Wrong?,"Dark Shadows is based on a 70s TV series, I believe. It's about this vampire that gets trapped in a coffin for centuries, but gets dug back up in the mid-1970s.Now, Dark Shadows is Tim Burton's big live action 2012 film. Now is it good? Yes, it is. It is nothing spectacular, but it is very enjoyable.The characters are very wacky and weird in this film, which I like. I generally did enjoy Dark Shadows. There's just very little to say about it. While it is good, it is forgettable.Johnny Depp is really good as the vampire protagonist. He is funny but also kind of creepy.My only true problem with Dark Shadows is the protagonist's habit of changing personalities all the time. I know he's a vampire, but does he have to suck out the blood and guts out of every young person he speaks with?Overall, there's not much I can say about Dark Shadows.

"(review outside of ""I love it"" or ""I hate it"") Well done film.","Lets cut to the chase.You want to know...Heres things to know: The pace is steady and calm. The story is after all a recreation and it stays mostly dedicated.The roles are well done.The only actor that doesn't fit in is Eva Green, she does good, but she is just not for it, its almost like watching Ray Liotta play a nanny - has the depth to pull it of, but that wont help you feel its a seamless blend.If you have come to demand spectacular party favors out of films. This is not it. Its a balanced film, and the people who made have obviously taken their time to do it well, instead of go fishing for audiences' AWE or coppers.The end effect for me is ""A fine film, I am pleased to have seen it"". True its not a ""WOW, it blew me out of my mind, wow wow wow"" - but not like regular stuff comes anywhere near it.If you have to pick between this film and some other film which is badly trying to impress you - pick this film.

Welocme to Collinswood. My Name is Barnabas Collins,"Dark Shadows was a classic TV show that ran until 1971. However Dark Shadows the show had years to wrap up it's run this movie only has a couple of hours. Barnabas Collins is the rich son of the owner of Collinsport he lives in the mansion Collinswood. the year is roughly 1752. When Barnabas Rejects the love of angelique,She is driven to the dark side and finds a way to curse him with becoming a vampire. She also kills his true love Josette. Angelique leads a mob to Collinswood and they drag Barnabas to a open coffin and chain him in the coffin and chain the coffin. and then bury it. when 1972 rolls around a construction crew uncovers the coffin and free Barnabas who promptly feeds on them. He returns home to Collinswood. And it is there he meets his family and the nanny. Victoria Winters is a young lady with a secret. But then again they all have secrets. The film quickly moves into Barnabas fighting to restore his family to greatness once more. and to destroy angelique for what she has done . He also struggles with his curse and fights to find a cure.The Film is dark in some places light in others and it resembles a 70's vampire film. Still while it bears the names and the basic storyline it is not the TV Series. Dark Shadows the film is a honest effort to retell one of the classic Vampire stories of the Television era. Johnny Depp portrays Barnabas Collins in such a Fried like manner that you know he is doing this as a tribute to Jonathon Fried and a love for the Barnabs Collins character.Worth seeing. I enjoyed it a lot because it was different then any of the films released in 2012. And that's a good thing.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Destined to be Overshadowed,"Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is a vampire, buried for 196 years and awaken in 1972. The witch who cursed him to this fate, Angelica (Eva Green), has control of the town that his family built from the ground up. Can Barnabas rally his existing family to defeat Angelica and save the fishing industry?Director Tim Burton has assembled his troops. Dark Shadows features Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and composer Danny Elfman. All of whom are vets of his films. To retain talent at this rate, Burton must be doing something right. Unfortunately Dark Shadows isn't one of their brightest moments.The 1972 setting is mostly disclosed through song. Dark Shadows is no musical, but the classic rock and pop soundtrack carries the movie more than any other single element. Don't jump too fast at dolling out credit; it's not that difficult to select songs most patrons are going to enjoy when they've had 40 years to grow on us.Depp is good as the fish out of water. He's not fantastic and frankly, like most of Dark Shadows, his performance will go forgotten soon after viewing. It's not for a lack of production value, but more for an effort to mimic TV format. Now I'm not familiar with the television show Dark Shadows which this film is based, but it's too obvious that TV plot lines dominate the film. It boils down to Barnabas sleeping around and murdering to the point that a happy ending isn't just. If you're expecting a dark comedy, the trailer will suffice.I honestly struggled to recall if I had fallen asleep, missing several touching scenes of between Barnabas and Victoria (Bella Heathcote), the young governess who has arrived in town just as Barnabas has returned. Perhaps the context is lost when it's glossed over via montage, one that focuses more on Barnabas struggling to find suitable sleeping quarters than their blossoming romance. It's something that a love story skips out on the heart.There's a bevy of characters I'm not even going to bring up because they simply have no impact on the story as individuals. The writing seems to know this, making one a werewolf just to have something interesting occur. Again, I'm sure the TV series had time to hint at this surprise while this movie throws in an unwanted twist.Tim Burton was at one time an auteur of unique vision, but for over a decade he's done nothing but remakes, reboots, and adaptations of established works. Dark Shadows certainly looks like his movie, combining a morbid scenario with white makeup and giant eyes. I can't help but think how magnificent it could be for Burton to apply his trademarks to new concepts.Check out my video review as well as my other reviews at my site VaughnOnMovies.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"dark, mysterious vampire","The perfect film for Johnny Depp... a dark, mysterious vampire film, where he can be as quirky and dark as he wants to be. Directed by Tim Burton, so fasten those seat belts! Co-stars Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Carter. Depp is Collins, a vampire, who has been imprisoned for years. And has finally been set free. Based on the highly rated Dan Curtis television series in the 1960s. That series had Jon Frid, Grayson Hall (Night of the Iguana), Kate jackson (Charlie's Angels). Coming back may not be as easy as Collins had thought, as his descendants are now living in his house! And the house has many secret passages and norners, providing mystery and adventure. Collins intends to bring the family fortune back to what it once was. Some fun comparisons to the ""old times"" and the modern times, as Collins gets used to technology and present day customs. French Eva Green is ""Angie"", Collins' able enemy. And.. about halfway through, Karen Carpenter sings ""Top of the World"". Just Perfect! And then lots of time spent on Alice Cooper, performing at a party. Carter is Doctor Hoffman, who wants to study Collins. What will come of a competition between Angie and Collins? Will there be anything left of the town? Starts out like a very serious novel, but the last third gets a little more light, fluffy, and silly. Still good stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Spectacular fun,"I came to Dark Shadows for the first time with this movie. It seems that some reviewers remembering a TV series fondly, appear to be the most critical of this movie version. As I never saw the original I can only judge this movie on it's own merits and I found it highly entertaining. Tim Burton once again showcases his Gothic flair for spectacle, harnessing an A list cast and making a delightful show that entertains throughout I thought. Johnny Depp, vampire, returns to the 1970's after 200 years to find life as he knew it, somewhat changed. This allows a number of gags to flow referencing the two different time lines. He plays Barnabus Collins whose family ran a successful business, thus building up a huge fortune and the descendants now all live in a magnificent mansion they inherited. Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Chloe Grace Moretz are just some of the top cast enjoying the fun and scares and with a standout part by French actress Eva Green as Depps former stalker and witch. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and recommend it to fans of comedy horror and top class acting and directing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Burton makes up for his horrible Alice in Wonderland movie.,"Dark Shadows is an 7 to me. Tim Burton finally made something worth watching again. After what I felt was horribly over hyped Alice in Wonderland movie that left me almost upset I wasted my time watching it. I kind of went into this movie expecting not to like it. Tim Burton always has pretty stunning visuals in his movies but I usually get bored with his creepy, but almost G rated style. I usually just watch his stuff for the dark goth type sets and effects that he is known for, But easily tire of him recycling actors over and over again. His wife used to be a pretty good actress, but do we really have to see Her in a starring role in EVERY ONE of his movies?Michelle Pfeiffer was forgettable, and a few times I think I had to remind myself what her part was. The real star here is Eva Green. She is the center of attention in any scene she is involved with, even when its with Johnny Depp. Let's face it Johnny Depp is a decent actor but he only does dramatic over the top characters, so its not a stretch for him. He was good, but Green sizzles in a role that is a departure from her other films.The comedy gags are alright but not to many.

The best Part of the entire movie was Jonny Depps flawless acting without doubt.However I can't quite put my finger on what it was but I couldn't help but feel there was something missing in this film.

Very shallow,"Could you imagine if Tim Burton cast Johnny Depp as Beetlejuice instead of Michael Keaton? The movie would not have even been close to being good. However thankfully Tim Burton cast perfectly and is still one of my favorite movies to date. Now why oh why doesn't Tim Burton look at his previous works and actually analyze what made them great so he can repeat? I can't believe that he actually ""wants"" to make bad movies. In contrast Johnny Depp was perfect for Edward scissor hands. Of course he was... Johnny Depp is a great actor, but even the greatest actors can't do every single character in every single movie. I mean, what if Tom Hanks or Robin Williams or Johnny Depp was cast as Beetlejuice? See my point? It would have sucked. Never having seen the original series, I had nothing to compare this movie too. It didn't have to ""live up"" to anything in my mind and yet it was still shallow and unimpressive. It wasn't really all that funny, some parts were but I didn't utter anything more than a forced chuckle. It really wasn't that dark because of the constant air of trying to be funny and charming but failing at that, which took away from the darkness. I was pretty disappointed.

"Dull Shadows (or, The Rise of Count Chocula)","If the tone set in the first ten minutes of Dull Shadows had been carried over into the last 110 minutes of the film, this would have been a very good entry in the Burton/Depp oeuvre. Instead, the tone changes drastically from Sleepy Hollow to a poor man's Beetlejuice. It's as if the opening sequence was directed by a skilled craftsman and the remainder by a skilled but inexperienced dilletante. The sets are excellent, as is the cinematography but the characters are underdeveloped and the actors underused. Depp puts in a carefully crafted performance as Count Chocula, but not Barnabas Collins. This is a disaster and the threat of a sequel is unbearable. Certainly, the original series was a bit campy but charmingly so. This film is just over the top in a very underwhelming way.

Light Shadows,"In 1760 Liverpool (which we later learn reeked with the stench of un-dumped commodes), we meet the ""cursed"" Collins family. They move to Maine, successfully start a fishing business, and ""found"" the town of Collinsport. Grown up handsome son Johnny Depp (as Barnabas Collins) becomes a real lady killer. This irks sexy servant girl Eva Green (as Angelique ""Angie"" Bouchard), who yearned for Mr. Depp from their days in Liverpool. He soon finds ""true love"" with pretty blonde Bella Heathcote (as Josette DuPres). Jilted, Ms. Green turns out to be a witch. She turns Depp into a vampire and has him sealed in a chained coffin...This set-up - all occurring before the opening credits - is fine, but offers some timing problems, especially when you consider later revelations. It seems like Depp had to be a vampire before he turns into one, and we aren't sure how it all went down. Possibly there is plot skimmed away, and this feeling continues throughout the film. After the prologue, credits roll and we are in the year 1972. The story shifts to Ms. Heathcote (as Maggie Evans) on a train. She's the mirror image of Depp's ""Josette"" from the past. Harboring a more modern mystery, Heathcote takes the name ""Victoria (Vicki) Winters"" from a train poster advertisement...The story begins with the arrival of Heathcote to seek employment as governess, coupled with the unearthing and arrival of Depp. The film becomes mostly a situation comedy until the climax. Some of the jokes are funny - some are not. Two of the better characterizations are beautiful family matriarch Michelle Pfeiffer (as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard) and troubled young nephew Gulliver McGrath (as David Collins). Depp falls somewhere in the middle. Dead-panning with amusing sincerity, he nevertheless is victimized by a lack of romantic development; increasingly hidden behind elaborate make-up, Depp hits the comic notes well, but he fails to make ""Barnabas"" a passionate lead. Director Tim Burton's quirk looks something like a slip. But the art and set direction are good.***** Dark Shadows (5/7/12) Tim Burton ~ Johnny Depp, Eva Green, Michelle Pfeiffer, Bella Heathcote",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Unique to say the least,"My last review on IMDb was of The Lucky One and I said it was one of the corniest, clichéd by the numbers movies I ever saw. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp may not be to everyone's taste as actor and director but at least they are always unique and original in everything that they do. They have made so many movies together that I bet they can read each other's minds. I never saw the original Dark Shadows series (although I think I remember seeing a Barnabas Collins board game in my fifth grade classroom). I can't compare Depp's performance to Jonathan Frid the original Barnabas, but Depp really delivers I think. He makes Barnabas scary (the scene where he kills those construction workers, those hippies and that doctor) however he also makes him strangely sympathetic as well. You feel sorry for him in a way because of the terrible curse he bears. Burton brings his trademark quirky brilliance to directing this film. He does a fine job mixing laughs and screams. However, there was just one slight at the end. I always watch the credits of the movies I go to see and I noticed that they didn't dedicate it to Jonathan Frid who just passed away. He'd a cameo in the film as well as three other original cast members.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Edward scissor-hands re-visit with no direction,"I generally like Tim Burton because his quirky attention to detail to sets and costumes but sometimes he leaves the movie behind. This is the case here. I was unaware that Dark Shadows was a previous TV series so this is a review just of the movie. The movie lacked any direction or focus and just seemed to meander around trying to get to the next joke in which every punch line was already broadcast in the previews. Literally there was nothing new to the plot that wasn't spoiled in the previews.Johnny Depp was given no direction by Tim Burton and as a result he just revisited his Edward Scissorhands persona by holding his hands up in every scene and flicking his fingers around like they had uncomfortable poles attached to each finger. His role was aggressive and out-going character but retarded. A tiny Songstress in a box??? and why attack the box??? OK, I get zany but his role kept flipping from dark evil powerful to retarded 3 stooges zany. This did not work.Go to watch Tim Burton's 70's sets and the fantastic bright yellow Chevy station wagon in the movie. Literally the only cringe for me during the entire movie is when they unloaded a coffin from the back of the station wagon and it looked like they may scratch the tail gate, no!!!! Don't expect much other then giggling school girls in the audience from Depps performance.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Not so dark...,"Haven't seen any of the older versions so this was completely new for me. Tim Burton's movies always excite me and the cast had some big names including Johnny Depp so had to watch it despite the negative reviews.The story was predictable and the characters lacked depth especially the children. If this was entirely a comedy it would have been a much better film. Johnny Depp's was impressive as usual, Eva Green was stunning in her appearance and performance, they could have done more with the character. Everything else was sort of okay, the locations, scenery, costumes, make-up, etc that you'd expect from a Tim Burton movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Moribund,"Definition of Moribund: ""In terminal decline; lacking vitality or vigor."" That's this movie. Don't believe the trailers -- they made it look very witty and fast-paced. Instead it is slow and dull.Why don't they get the people who make the trailers to make the movie? Trailers are always fast-paced and funny and make the movies look terrific. I think there are jokes in the trailers that are not IN this movie! Why would you remove jokes from a movie that has too few?Johnny Depp tries his hardest, as he always does. But the script is just flat. Sad to see that Tim Burton has demoted his girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, to ""older character lady"" role. Women in their 20s get the romantic leads.

"Awesome, it is highly entertaining","Dark Shadows is a movie based on a TV show, that I specifically don't know. I walked into this movie VERY hyped up, I knew that it was a Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie, and it was going to be great, and it was.It had lots of cool CGI, lots of cool action scenes to keep EVERYBODY entertained. It has laugh out loud comedy, which was good every know and then. Johnny Depp was TRULY amazing, he was more in character than he is with Captain Jack Sparrow, truly!The plot was very interesting and entertaining. It has an all star cast including: Michelle Pfieffer, Eva Green, Chloe Grace Moretz, Tommy Lee Miller and with the comical genius Helena Bonham Carter, and to top it off a cameo by Alice Cooper. The music was composed by Danny Elfman (Edward Sciccorhands), whom has had worked with Tim Burton before.The movie was amazing and truly spectacular, 10/10. Great Job!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Entertains, but nothing memorable here","Dark Shadows follows the tale of Barnabas Collins, a wealthy and a rich man who whose family migrates from Liverpool in the 1760's and start a fishing business in America , which turns out to be more than successful and is called Colllinsport. Collins seduces one of the housemaids, who loves him very dearly, but finds out that the Barnabas does not love him back. Barnabas falls in love and marries to which the house maid feels heartbroken and jealous to and places a cruse on Collins family who die under mysterious circumstances and ends up wiping out most of Barnabas ancestors, but most of all places a curse on Barnabas himself, who himself jumps off the cliff in order to be with his dead wife who not a few moments ago jumped off the cliff under the spell of the house maid, the witch Angelique Bouchard, Barnabas finds himself surviving the fall only to find out that he's been turned into a Vampire by the witch. Towns people are turned against Barnabas as he kills people for blood, they arrest him, chain him and then bury him inside the coffin....Alive.200 years later or should I say 196 (As said by the antagonist of the movie) the coffin is opened and the things are about to change for the better ...or the worse.The story is rather very simple and not that complicated to understand. It gives you a sense on what to expect at the very start of the movie. Dark Shadows falls under the category of Dark Horror Comedy, Tim Burton (the director of the movie who needs no introduction) directs that movie quite well. He's no stranger to dark tone of the movies, his shining example would be ""Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street"" that was released in 2007. Johnny Depp once again returns along Tim Burtons side, to me personally this actor can portray many roles with ease, he can be a Demon Barber, Captain Jack Sparrow, Mad Hatter ........a Vampire and countless other roles he was played over the years. In short he was perfect for that role.This movie is well directed, the sets are amazing, the performances are top notch. The visuals look amazing, despite of having everything perfect, I think the script needed a bit more work on it to make it more memorable and developing other characters more. Despite that minor shortcoming aside, I certainly enjoyed watching the movie ""Dark Shadows"". I won't be seeing it again & again,. But it's a pretty pleasant ride that should be experienced at least ""once"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"I was a fan of the television show, but from what I'd heard, this was going to be played for camp, and I was alright with that. However: almost all of the campy parts were seen in the trailer. This movie was a complete waste of my time and money. I can't imagine that Johnny Depp or Michelle Pfeiffer are proud of their work in this movie. It bounced from horror to comedy (or rather, attempted comedy) to martial arts to sheer stupidity. The story line was strained; I didn't care about any of the characters; and the love scene was ridiculous. After about 15 minutes, I was already looking at my watch, as was the person I was with. If I had been watching this on Netflix, I would have stopped after no more that 15 minutes. Other movies on my worst list: The English Patient;Ready to Wear; Dumb and Dumber. Blech. SAVE YOURSELF!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS AWFUL, AWFUL MOVIE.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The jury's out,"I like Tim Burton, I like Johnny Depp and I like vampires. Hence Dark Shadows was always going to be something I watched. The film is based on a little-known TV show where Depp plays a vampire who's been buried alive for two hundred years and awoken in the seventies, where he tries to rebuild his family's fortunes while fending off the witch who originally buried him.Having watched the film, I'm still kind of in two minds whether I liked it or now. There were some bits that were really good. If you've seen anything by Tim Burton, you'll either love or hate his Gothic fairytale style (which is, once again, evident here). Depp, as usual, puts in a good performance. However, it seems he's trying a little hard to be different with some not particularly good dialogue. A lot of his 'acting' in this involves him waving his fingers in a semi-threatening manner.I couldn't work out whether the film is trying to be a comedy or a drama, but with horror elements thrown in there as well (and a kind of 'action' end standoff/battle). The film seems to lurch from one genre to another. There are some funny moments utilising the fact that Depp doesn't understand the world he's now living in, but they're few and far between.I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure how. Just like I'm not sure I'd be in much of a hurry to see it again. It's even left slightly open for a sequel, however with the mixed reviews (which now, having seen the film, I can fully understand) it's probably in some doubt whether there's any more Dark Shadows to come.Although, it was great to see Alice Cooper rocking out in a film again!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Brilliant script, really fun performances, plot was a bit clunky","I was not expecting to like this movie nearly as much as I did! I typically don't love-love Tim Burton and largely feel indifferent about Johnny Depp, but this film felt like a really fun sandbox for the two of them to play. Michelle Pfeiffer and Helena Bonham Carter we're also quite good in their respective roles. Seth Grahame-Smith's script was consistently hilarious and the special effects were fun and The production design was gorgeous-it was a really fun blending of 70s aesthetic with 18th-century vampire aesthetic. Loved every frame of it visually.The story, however, was kind of a mess. I recognize this work was the feature film adaptation of a tv show and I have to say, I think this would've worked better either if they kept all the plot threads they wanted to explore and adapted the script into a TV series or if they had scaled down the script to follow just a few members of the family. I didn't care enough about any of the characters outside of Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer to really get invested in the final battle (which I will say, was nonetheless entertaining to watch). Some plot threads and characters seemed to pop up out of nowhere and I think really could've shined if they had a bit more time to get invested in them, so perhaps a series would've been a better homage to the original show-and I have to say, I would immediately be hooked in for a series version of this film and creative direction!Dark Shadows was a fun watch, if a little overpacked. Loved the darkly comedic humor, actor performances, and visual style.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Depp Does Vampire,"Who would have thought up this plot: Vampire attempts to save family fish canning business from evil witch in control of rival fish canning business? Somehow, I never heard of this Tim Burton movie; had to check it off. The story is about a man named Barnabas (Depp) has been cursed as a vampire and buried alive gets unearthed 196 years later in 1972. This being a light comedy, there are jokes about the vampire being surprised by the things of the times. Before he got turned into a vampire, Barnabas was living the high life and had a very wealthy estate. He was buried alive after breaking the heart of a woman, who turns out to be a witch. Fast forward to 1972, and Barnabas is witness to his descendants allowing his estate to lose its luster as they are a high dysfunctional family. Will Barnabas be able to restore his estate and family name to its former glory while fending off the competitive fish canning business run by the witch who buried him? This has some amusing moments as it was not a serious horror movie, had a few splashes of Tim Burton's creativity and overall was fairly enjoyable. It did leave some room for improvement yet fun nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
serious or comedy?,"First off, it's just plain bad. No coherent direction, at times it feels like it's trying to be a comedy, others it tries to be serious, since it never chooses it just falls flat. The staging, costumes, etc were gorgeous. Depp was great as Barnabus, but, the story played out flat.As for the comedy aspect, what you saw in the trailers was 90% of what was funny in the movie.Classic failure of Hollywood today, wow you with the trailer, get a big name to lead the film, have gorgeous sets and costumes, set in a beautiful location, in the end it's a stinker.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Not Burton's best, but an attractive effort...","Well perhaps Tim Burton has run out of ideas. Finally.Dark Shadows is the latest of a long line of Gothic and occasionally burlesque fantasies fried and seasoned by Burton and electrified into quasi-solid completion by Johnny Depp. I have always been fond of that two-headed monster, from Edward Scissorhands to Alice in Wonderland, though Burton-and-Depp have accumulated quite a bit of heat for the latter. Of course Burton deviates from original material in whatever he does. Washington Irving would never have known Sleepy Hollow for his, Roald Dahl might have blinked twice at Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Lewis Carroll very possibly wouldn't callooh or callay at his revised (or should I say revisioned?) Wonderland. In this, Dark Shadows is no exception. There is a great divide between the 70's soap we know and love and Burton's over-the-top spectacle. However, what the film lacks in constancy and plot it more than makes up for in setting and character.The film opens in eighteenth-century England. We watch the Collins family rise to wealth through a series of flashbacks before settling at last in aptly named Collinsport, New England. All would be fairytale perfect, were it not for young Barnabas's idle tryst with Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), an ambitious servant girl whose extracurricular activities consist mainly of reading spell tomes and summoning devils. Spurned by Barnabas, she wreaks havoc on the Collins family, concluding her revenge by cursing her former lover to all the soulless disadvantages of vampirism as well as the confines of a standard six-by-two.There is no denying Burton is a master of set design. The first twenty minutes of Dark Shadows are sheer brilliance. A few moments that linger particularly in my memory are those featuring Barnabas before he becomes a vampire, mad with grief in the midst of Angelique's torments. The Collins estate is a beautiful work of Gothic architecture, ""the perfect marriage of European elegance and American enterprise,"" and Burton is at his best when the mansion itself is a character in mood and meaning. A claustrophobic library, closed and stifled to the light of day, where Barnabas fevers over occultism, contrasts desperation and entrapment with the melancholy sweetness we discover through Barnabas's one remaining happiness, Josette DuPres (Bella Heathcote), on an open, grey little balcony, unadorned but simple and free. Poignant and effective, these scenes of shrouded mist and creeping, cloying evil set the mood for a film that might have been taut with suspense if not for two centuries lost and Barnabas' jarring introduction to the novelties of modern living.Conflict in the film consists mainly of Barnabas's efforts to reestablish the Collins family business, all but flattened by Angel Bay Fishery. Yes, Angelique has indeed survived all these years to lord financial success and social influence over the ruined Collinses. While this storyline is somewhat lacking, the characters themselves provide an entertainment not dissimilar to the Addams Family's appeal. Of all the original characters, Elizabeth Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) maintains her mien of no-nonsense, but Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller) lacks the gravitas and charm of his original and is rather an ill-tempered skirt-chaser. The character of Carolyn suffers the most, the bubble-headed but innocent bombshell now transformed into a teenage rebel obsessed with, let's just say, not the Carpenters. As for Barnabas: well. Jonathan Frid defined the character with his shy yet aloof manner, a romantic ghost out of time and place. Depp handles the role with a similar romanticism and gentility, but there is a hint of villainy to his character that was not so defined in Frid, excepting House of Dark Shadows (1970). This Barnabas, while obsessed with thwarting the advances both physical and monetary of his nemesis Angelique, is also an active vampire, killing with a strange mix of remorse and glee. He executes mayhem with an apologetic relish that would mortify many a delicate modern vampire. Depp's excessive, perhaps rich, makeup and dress—exaggerated as in so many previous films— has never really upset me. I am rather fond of playacting, and the more extreme he waxes the easier it is for me to find a costuming parallel at Forever 21.An outstanding performance worth mentioning is that of Bella Heathcote, who plays both Josette and Victoria Winters. Her performance is both sympathetic and emotionally charged, a blend of innocence and ethereal goodness that contrasts perfectly with Eva Green's portrayal of the devilish Angelique. Her intensity draws the viewer in and compels you to mostly forgive the occasionally awkward moments that take place at the Collins dinner table.What you must not forget while watching Dark Shadows is that you are watching a Tim Burton film. Quirky, off-beat humor, eccentric characters, and moments of improbability are par for the course. There is too that theme of artistic misunderstanding caused by an unacceptable fascination for the otherworldly that pervades all of Burton's films. But if you are willing to suspend your disbelief and simply enjoy a bit of madness, mayhem, and Heaven for misfits, you will enjoy Dark Shadows despite its flaws, and perhaps more than it deserves for that careless bit of black adventure that carries through even the worst of Burton.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Dark Shadows...1.5 out of 4 Skittles,"LOGLINE: In the 1770's the wealthy Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is cursed to spend eternity as a vampire by his lovesick servant and secret witch, Angelique (Eva Green). Upon discovery of his new affliction Collins is buried alive by the townspeople, and spends nearly two centuries underground until he is accidentally dug up by the construction crew building a new restaurant called McDonald's. Collins discovers times have changed as his family heirs are struggling to get by and the witch is now the most powerful and popular woman in town.Yesthis is the actual premise that some Hollywood jerkoff thought would be a great movie to throw millions of dollars at to get made. Dark Shadows, based on the marginal late 60's/early 70's Gothic soap opera, is basically the story of what happens to a 18th century vampire who wakes up in the 1970's after a 200-year sleep. Jokes about all things the 70's decade had to offer are constantly thrown at the audience and the gag runs thinvery quickly.The all-star cast struggles to find their footing, and the story plot is underdeveloped and pushed to the side to make way for the generic jokes that don't stick. Tim Burton seems to phone this one in. Burton's directorial detail and effort of his past classics such as Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands are nowhere to be found in this one, but I guess that should be expected from a guy who made boring movies out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland.Dark Shadows is a misfire and a perfect example of how confused Hollywood currently is. When the mass audience already has a bloated belly full of vampire stories why trot out another movie that strips the genre of its essence and excitement? Maybe this will be the holy water or silver dagger that will be shanked through the heart of the current vampire trend and put us out of our misery.

"I wasn't disappointed, but I didn't see the trailer.","Really enjoyed this film. I am not name savvy enough to have known Tim Burton's film history (though I of course recognised the name) nor the series it was supposed to be a spoof of, so perhaps I benefited from not having expectations for this movie.I love Chloe Moretz though she isn't central to the story, and Bella Heathcotte who plays 2 characters. Helena Carter is cool, though she'll always be the girlfriend from fight club for me. Johnny Depp had some straight comedy but most of the comedy elements were in the type-cast characters and situations which could easily be missed, more of a black comedy rather than for laughs. Yet it was mostly not all that dark for a black comedy, though some elements occasionally reminded me this was a 12A as some was some nightmare fuel.I didn't come out thinking ""that was amazing I must tell everyone about the best film I've seen all year..."" admittedly, but I did slowly release the news of what I had seen and gathered people's opinions. By a day later I realised after choosing through film briefs and posters for which should be on my wall, that this was the only one that stood out.That could be partly down to a lack of particularly inspiring films out at the moment, but this film's mix of iconic characters, cliché twists, satirical comedy and unobvious direction has made me quite fond of it suddenly.If you have huge expectations it seems (by the ratings here) that you'll likely be disappointed. I went in knowing a few people who were in it and having the idea that it was a vampire comedy, but a weird one... And found it neither to be purely comedy nor purely weird, and wasn't disappointed. I feel sorry for people who saw a trailer that made it look like a pure comedy. That happened to me for Attack The Block and although the film was still OK, it does make you despise the people who market these things falsely.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Entertaining enough, but a little too uneven","Even though I kind of like Dark Shadows, it is a shame it does not follow up on a rather awesome scene quite early in the movie. What I'm referring to is a rather violent scene, I won't go into detail because spoilers, but let's just say it's pretty cool. It really looks like Tim Burtons way of portraying some vampire-related violence.Unfortunately though, the scene I'm talking about does not represent much of the rest of the movie.I do think this movie is the kind of movie that sort of grows on you. The first time I saw it I had some expectations, they were not really met. But then I caught parts of it on television later, and I found it more entertaining.Dark Shadows is a little bit more of the old Tim Burton we know and love, not so much the new one. Yes, it has Johnny Depp, but still I find it to be more Batman/Scissorhands and less Alice in Wonderland.It is a little on the long side, I would have liked if it were a little darker, some more vampire violence, but hey, what are ya gonna do!? It is uneven, and that is much of the reason why I didn't like it better. I hope Mr. Burton continues in this track, rather than the track he has been on the last 10-ish years.Johnny Depp is alright in this, but Tim Burton, you have got to stop having him in everything you make.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Shadow spoilt by being so light,"I know that Dark Shadows was a rather campy TV series rather well known in the USA but almost unheard of outside of North America.This was a concept Gothic film right up Tim Burton's and Johnny Depp's street.It is a rather forgettable film which is disappointing for a Tim Burton movie.It seems Burton had difficulty in getting the tone right and the script was half baked before the project was even green lit.The film is set in 1972 with a revitalised Barnabas on the prowl again. As he acquaints himself with his descendants he tries to save the family business but old ghosts refuse to die.I can see why this was a box office disappointment, it's visually very good, what else would you expect from Tim Burton.

Very Good Movie,"I cannot believe all the negative reviews...this movie was funny, exciting plus a little dark - what more can you ask for? Depp was brilliant as always and Eva is the ultimate jilted witch.

In-fact, I imagine someone from 200 years ago would not stop talking as everything they see is new and different. The set was beautifully executed and made the movie much more immersive. The weird teen (portrayed by Chloë Grace Moretz) was very believable - you would understand if you had a teen of your own. I liked the fact that this movie had some twists and wasn't stuck on a single plot (BORING)! I liked it so well I may go see it again before it comes to Redbox.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
What did I just watch?,"A movie that lacked so much direction that the original plot doesn't enter into until the last 2 minutes of the film. Tim Burton apparently had ideas for about seven other movies that wouldn't work on their own. He crams all of those ideas into this one movie, where they don't work anyway. In this film, once there is a plot point of any kind, it is either not discussed for 1/3rd of the movie, or it is immediately resolved that very scene, then we move on to yet another one. This movie has absolutely no focus what-so-ever. It doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy, horror, drama, or romance, so it decides to be one of those every other scene and it is just exhausting.The Bella Heathcote is in the film for a total of five scenes of the movie, and she is in the first few scenes of the movie as the main focal point. Johnny Depp is the focal point for the majority of the film, and decides that he loves her for no other reason than meeting her once, and walking with her on the beach once. This movie has no build up on any front, and decides to hit it out of the park without even battering up.Dark Shadows has no audience. It's one thing to reach a demographic, but be good enough for others, but it's another thing to reach absolutely no audience at all because of how vague the plot is, and how childish/adult oriented the movie turns out to be.There are some genuinely funny moments, and the movie has shown promise more than once through out, but these moments of glee are interrupted by large portions of sporadic jumps across the screen. There are times when we truly feel for Johnny Depp's character, and his overacting is actually humanizing to a degree of someone who was a fish out of water or a man out of his own time. Yet he still murders innocent people and handles his problems so blatantly bad that the sympathy for him is limited down to nearly nothing.It's a mystery of how Tim Burton wanted to play this film out in the first place. He obviously had some good ideas, but every single idea that is brought to the screen is soon wiped off in order for another to take its place. Then there comes the third act, where we are treated to the most uncalled-for horror-fest money can buy. Remember when I said there was no build up to this movie? The third act was the prime example. All of the sudden we are shown things that had absolutely no build up to it anywhere throughout the film. They are just brought to the screen and we are supposed to accept them, and after being beaten with so many random plot points, you feel like you've ran a marathon, and the movie ends with very little to recollect.This film is not worth the time nor the effort to attempt to watch. It paints an obvious picture of how hard times have fell on a formerly great director, and why it may be time for him to hang up his director's chair for good. Do not give this film the time of day unless you are just such a die-hard Johnny Depp fan that you want to see everything of his in the first place. Either way, you have been warned.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Must see for Dark Shadows fans!,"I absolutely have to have this movie on DVD! Greatly daring I went to the first showing today, which was mid-morning, terrified it would be as campy as the trailers. Not to mention I read the review in my local paper that labeled the film a 'comedy'.Was I ever pleasantly surprised! The new movie is a lovely blend of drama, dark humor, favorite elements from the original series, some unexpected twists, and horror. Yes, there are a couple of 'over the top' scenes but I didn't find them distracting from the over all plot.Four actors from the original series made cameos - J. Frid, D. Selby, K.L. Scott and L. Parker. Look for them in the happening scene.My only argument is that in the very beginning - Barnabas is shown as an only child. How could the Collins family have survived? Most important to remember about the movie is the theme: Family is everything. It is carried through out the entire film.Otherwise, a must see for fans of either the 1960's or 1990's series. Johnny Depp is a fan of the series and the way he plays the character shows that.The ending was interesting and sort of upbeat. I will not ruin it for those who have not seen the movie yet.There are many other elements typical for the time period between the hippies in the minivan, the habits of Dr. Hoffman, the lava lamp, and music. While modern audiences who did not live through the early 1970's may find them comedic, they are a clear reminder of where our country once was before cell phones, computers, and the Internet.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Amusing Movie but Ultimately Unimpressive,"I'm finding more and more difficult to have a coherent opinion on the collaborative movies of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. It's tough to complain about one of their movies because, really, after eight movies togetheryou know what you're getting and you get what you paid for. When I see a trailer for a new Burton/Depp movie, I'm never concerned with whether it's a great movie, what the premise is, who's starring, etc. You know what it's going to be before you ever settle in to watch it: Gothic, eccentric, visually stimulating, and a good chance for weak substance. I've come to a point where I don't bother going to Burton movies in the theater (though I made an exception for ALICE IN WONDERLAND because it was one of the few movies I was interested in seeing in 3D). Now I wait for home video and watch them when the Burton mood strikes. DARK SHADOWS falls easily into that categorya mediocre movie that is just interesting enough that I know I'll go back to it once a year or so. The movie is based on a cheap Gothic soap opera from the '60s that, I'll admit, I've never watched. I was aware of it, and I know it's got a decent cult following. That's the extent of it. It centers on the character of Barnabas Collins (Depp), a man born into a wealthy family of the 1700s who made a mistake of scorning a witch. In return for his refusing her love, she destroys his life and turns him into a vampire and buries him to suffer for eternity. He's unearthed in 1972 and returns to his family estate to find it in ruins. He makes it his mission to revive his family's fishing business and renew their good name, but his past has returned to haunt him.I wasn't sure what I was walking in to with this movie. The original series was played straight but the trailers for the movie set it up as a comedy. DARK SHADOWS is somewhere in between. It tries to retain a serious note to the whole ordeal but stoops to easy laughs as Barnabas adjusts to life in the '70s. There were moments in the movie where I couldn't tell if it was trying to be funny. The movie has its share of laughs but it's nearly outweighed by a disappointingly boring plot. The bulk of the movie is about Barnabas and his jaded former lover/witch Angie Bouchard (Eva Green) and there's a good deal of time spent with Barnabas spurring his family into action to save their good name. Nothing too exciting but the movie is a decent distraction and your average Burton fan will probably be satisfied. There is nothing to brag about here with one exception: the soundtrack. Being that the movie is set in the '70s, we're treated to some great music: Donovan, Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper (who makes an appearance in the film), the Moody Blues, etc. The music is the best part of the whole movie.DARK SHADOWS has a few of the usual Burton players with a few new additions. There is, of course, Depp as Barnabas Collins. Depp has done so many eccentric characters that I forget what ""normal"" Johnny Depp acts like. Barnabas merely fades into the ongoing assault of bizarre characters Depp continues to add to his resume. He's good, as you would expect with Depp, but there is nothing about this character that will stand out over his previous. Helena Bonham Carter is here as the family's live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Hoffman. She's about what you expect from her in another Burton film. Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty strong (and beautiful as ever) as Elizabeth Stoddard, the head of the remaining Collins family, and Jackie Earle Haley is a great little bit of comic relief as the bumbling handyman Willie Loomis. Chloë Grace Moretz is equal parts creepy and disturbingly adult as the moody teen-aged daughter, Carolyn. She goes a little overboard in the ""moody/crazy"" bit but she's great up until the final half hour when her secret is revealed and her dialogue gets lazy. And then there's Eva Green as Angie Bouchard. Green blew me away as Vesper Lynd in the fantastic CASINO ROYALE but, wow, is she cheesy here. I mean, really cheesy. If her character weren't so hot, she'd be outright aggravating with her hamming. It's all right though because it all balances out. As with a lot of recent Burton movies, DARK SHADOWS is wonderful visually and has a crazy fun premise with other-worldly characters but fails to rise above the rank of average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Weird and strange,"First things first: I have not seen any episodes of the original TV series this is based on. So no comparisons to that from me. This might have been a good thing from what I hear. But let's get back to this movie, that would've faired worse if Captain Jack ... I mean Johnny Depp wasn't in it. My niece who watched it with me, said she could spot Capt. Jack mannerisms. I hope that does not spoil the movie experience for you, but I guess this is the curse or the bad side of having created a great character.Still that is not the weak point of the movie. Not even the weirdness, which I thought was nice mostly. But the movie itself is just not funny enough. It is pretty silly, but unfortunately not in a good sense. There is a scene where my niece went ""That letter looks like ..."" and while she was kidding I assume, I was still thinking ""Kids"" these days. But apparently Tim Burton thought the same thing ... He played right into that and it just doesn't work. Best scenes are in the trailer, the rest can be forgotten (including one very dark moment at a camp fire). Not as bad as his Planet of the Apes re-imagining, but still far away from his best efforts",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"This ain't Dark Shadows, and it doesn't even pretend to be","This rendition of Dark Shadows plays out like a joke to the audience of the original soap. What this movie does is retain the characters and the relationships, but almost entirely discards everything else that made the soap what it was.The 2012 film is a what-if scenario. What if the Gothic horror/drama was turned into a Tim Burton comedy? And what if they set it in the 70s instead of the 60s for some reason? What if ALL the story lines we know and loved were completed neglected on all accounts?What if Roger didn't have his proper accent? What if Willie was a balding drunk? What if Dr. Hoffman was a drunk too? What if Maggie Evans was merged into Victoria Winters and had a convoluted backstory? What if one of the characters was a werewolf for absolutely no reason? What if Alice Cooper partied at Collinwood? What if Burke Devlin never existed?! Nor Jason McGuire, Reverend Trask, Ben Stokes, Jeremiah Collins, and countless others... What if nothing followed a pattern, and we just get vague cutouts of our beloved characters?With its innumerous differences to the show accounted for, how *is* this movie actually? It's surprisingly watchable, in an over-bloated Tim Burton kind of way, but this movie really shines its subtle moments, which was a highlight aspect of the show. In a film where almost everything is just wrong about the mythology, Johnny Depp plays Barnabas Collins (vampire), channeling the original actor Jonathan Frid in a commendable performance where he retains the propriety of the real Barnabas. At least it kept that right, but all-in-all, this is a terrible representation of what Dark Shadows is all about. This movie is more amusing in how extravagant it is with the liberties it takes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Depp is ideally cast as vampire Barnabas Collins...but overblown horror-comic is bereft of real blood,"Director Tim Burton and actor/co-producer Johnny Depp might have been the perfect twisted-twosome to expand Dan Curtis' Gothic television series ""Dark Shadows"" (1966-1971) into a theatrical feature. Unfortunately, what we get here is barely recognizable from the cult TV show, what with a bloated budget, a wandering narrative, and a misjudged pop/rock soundtrack. In 1972, the family-based corporation for an East Coast seafood company find themselves struggling financially; unbeknownst to them, their chief competitor is a witch who has held a grudge against the Collins's for nearly two centuries. The son of the company's founders, who spurned the romantic-minded lass in the 1870s, was turned into a vampire and buried, is ultimately released and unites with his relatives in turning the family's misfortunes around. Although Depp is the perfect choice for Barnabas Collins, the other characters and most of the action surrounding him fall flat. As the latest Collins matriarch, Michelle Pfeiffer makes some funny faces, but otherwise has nothing to do except address visitors from the staircase; Helena Bonham Carter, as a scheming psychiatrist, does what she can with a one-note role, while Jackie Earle Haley looks lost as the estate's simpleton groundskeeper (he's supposed to be under a spell, but I sensed the actor was floundering with poor material). All the dreary talk and plot-exposition leads to the proverbial special effects-induced showdown, complete with bodies flying upwards and backwards. It's too bad Burton chose to make this a slambang 'crowd-pleaser'; it doesn't have enough juice in it to please horror buffs, nor are the intermittent jokes enough to snare Depp's ""Pirates"" fans. ** from ****",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

One vampire I wouldn't mind driving a stake through,"I'm a fan of Tim Burton, at least his older work, and Dark Shadows, as a dark comedy, may seem right up his alley. Much of the look of the film is technically sound, and the actors, particularly Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer and Chloe Moretz, do what they can with the material. Alas, that material is weak, and Dark Shadows becomes a drag to sit through.The story follows Barnabas, a man cursed by a witch to become a vampire, and is then locked in a coffin and buried by the village people for 200 years. He is released in 1972 (Deliverance is playing at the theatre), bent on reuniting with his living family, restoring the family business and triumphing over the witch, who has gone on to found a rival company.Except for one crack about equality of the sexes and the bit about stoning the vampire, all of the jokes fall flat. There's many of the same old tired jokes we've seen before in stories about someone from another era or world falling into our own- looking for a sorceress songstress in a TV, Depp saying inexplicable things and Pfeiffer's character covering it up as best as she can. Stale jokes about immortal breasts not ageing fail to impress. As well, none of these characters are endearing at all. Reciting The Joker doesn't make Depp's character lovable enough to pardon him for mass murdering innocent workmen and hippies. Let the Right One In (2008) had a killer vampire you couldn't help but hope would survive and get away. I wouldn't mind driving a stake through Barnabas myself; at least the movie would end quicker. It's under two hours, but feels longer. This certainly isn't Burton's best work; at least it's better than Mars Attacks!",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Umm.....,"Dark shadows is just absolutely terrible, it is muddled, BORING, poorly acted to be honest, and a complete waste of talent. Tim Burton is obviously a very talented actor, so I don't know what kinda whacked up stuff he was on when he did this movie, but even if he was that's still no excuse for delivering this trash to us. I'm not a humongous Depp fan, but he has been good in previous films, he was NOT in this one, he is annoying and way too over the top here. This film is not funny, when it tries to get out a laugh, it falls flat every time. Helena carter is lazy and lackluster here too. And I usually like Michelle Pfeiffer, but come on Michelle, you deserve better material than this! The events are boring and the plot i.e. uninteresting and the script is very lazy and phoned in. 1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
I liked it.,"OK, so I was reading various reviews and I don't think they're the best. Not just because I liked the movie, but most of those reviews were ripe with grammar and spelling errors. It was not ""the worst movie of all time"" as one dubbed it. I think it probably should'E been billed as more of an action-fantasy, rather than comedy. It had silly, fun parts, as expected from Johnny Depp, and more serious parts, as expected from Tim Burton. It wasn't the greatest movie ever, I do wish they had gone in depth a little more to some characters, but it was still a good movie. Overall, it was a movie worth seeing, so don't listen to harsh worded reviews that aren't that great. At least see the movie, even if you hate it, Johnny Depp's antics are still fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Silly fun,"Well worth the watch. A basic popcorn movie,great for a lazy afternoon.

"""A Curse or a Gift""","Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.Don't get me wrong, this is probably a stranger than good watch, but from concept to story to characters, it has a lot of good to it. Some of the choices are a bit odd, but they do create their own problem-solution story arcs that make it feel like this was a comic book that was consolidated into a movie.While Depp's typical weirdness is abundant, each character has their own weirdness about them, and the otherworldly atmosphere of the movie is what makes it.Eva Green does steals the show whenever she makes an appearance, and her character is a force of power, and it shows.There is something very intriguing about immortal characters locked in battle, and that's what really draws me back to this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Kinda liked it.,I like the world he created and the gothic feel of the movie and majority of the characters except for Johnny Depp. He looks a bit odd in this. Some of his dialogue was cringeworthy.

nice effects. a bit boring. maybe it could have been good with a different story.,"i watched the movie because of the actors. at the theater i was filled with hope of what i'll be viewing. the start was good but as the movie progresses it's like nothing was happening and i kept waiting and waiting, but there's nothing interested me about the movie. there are few scenes that'll give you few laughs. Johnny Depp's acting reminds me of Sheldon. while seeing the movie i kept thinking, ""is this really tim burton's work?"". i hate to say this but the movie seems mediocre and like it's trying hard to be funny. but the effects were so incredible it makes me stare at them wondering how could they do that. Eva Green's glass skin was nicely done and Chloe's wolf form was also good. i really believe that if the story was only different this could be a good movie. maybe make it more interesting and add more actions because most of the movie they were only talking.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Totally loved it!!!,"Recently, I had been binging on the original daytime series and of course have seen this movie version about 10 times already. I am a HUGE fan of Burton, Depp, Bonham-Carter, Pfeifer and Green! The cast is outstanding, the cinematography is exquisite and while the plot may say in places, it is INFINITELY better to consider the whole rather than disect it.

The new disappointment by Burton.,"When I heard that Tim Burton had met again with Johnny Depp to create the film Dark Shadows I could not help thinking that I would give them my confidence to that couple for one last time since in their latest films together (Alice in wonderland, Swenney Todd, Charlie and the chocolate factory) they have not done more than leave us dissatisfied.When the film begins, it seems that Burton has created a story of love and terror that seems to be real promising. The film begins when by a series of situations of jealousy and impossible loves the witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) curse Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) in order to turn him into a vampire and locks him in a coffin where he is forced to spend a long time locked. All goes well until the vampire Barnabas Collins is released from the coffin and appears in a total different world to where he lived and must adapt to the new customs from the 70s and also has to fight to rescue from the misery the family business while living with all members who now inhabit what was once his home, like Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), who enters as an important figure in the development of the plot, with a good performance by Carter, but Burton could have done a better job developing this character by the fact that sometimes appears like a less important character. One problem with the film is that the way in which Burton reveals the development of the movie, becomes really boring, full of clichés and old and predictable jokes, that let the spectator notes that a story of vampires trying to do a combination with terror, comedy and drama is something that in the Burton's universe is not very profitable.Depp presents a performance where is notable that the exaggeration of mimicry and the peculiar form of walking are the characteristic features in every single one of his latest movies and he creates a character of Barnabas Collins that is not credible. Not everything in this movie is below expected, the role of Michelle Pfeiffer as the Collins house matriarch, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, is so good that is only surpassed by the performance of Eva Green as the antagonist of the story that is the best thing of the movie, Eva Green creates a fantastic Villain that has a bizarre way to show her love, full of sensuality, malice and hate to every person who stands in their way. One more time, in a film that is predictable, and there is a lack of intriguing moments. Where the best thing is the fabulous performance by Eva Green and Michelle Pfeiffer. Burton leaves us waiting to much of this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Tim Burton has lost his touch,"I adore Tim Burton's movies in general. Corpse Bride, Big Fish and Beetlejuice are among my favourite movies.However, I can't help but feel that over the past few years Tim Burton has either lost the plot or his magical touch. Watching ""Batman Returns"" in television yesterday cemented this thought for me. Michelle Pfeiffer must sincerely regret asking to star in Dark Shadows, probably a decision she made because her collaboration with him as Catwoman was so amazing.Alice in Wonderland was a convoluted mess which gave me a headache, although it did get better after I watched it a second time. At least Johnny Depp wasn't terrible in it. However, he completely over-acted his leading role in Dark Shadows, and the movie lacked any form of wit or humour at all. As some other people noted, Chloe Grace Moretz was also incredibly irritating in this movie.The only saving grace of this movie, if any, is the eye candy of Tim Burton's more or less always beautiful sets. To be fair, Eva Green wasn't that bad either, and is sexy is always. Depp's love interest in the movie also looks simply transcendent with her blonde hair when playing her part as a ghost.The movie had so much potential, and it was such a letdown. (And I never even watched the original TV series so it's not like I dislike this movie based on comparison) I hope that Tim Burton gets his talent back somehow and produces touching films like the Nightmare Before Christmas or funny films like Mars Attacks once again. I would love to see him do justice to the Addams Family, if that were possible.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"A Perfect Sexy, Horror, Comedy Blend","I absolutely adore this film! Tim Burton is my all time favorite director and has not disappointed me yet! Not to mention I LOVE Johnny Depp! So I went into the film completely blindfolded: I did not check out reviews, I didn't read about the plot, I didn't watch the TV show its based on, I wanted to be surprised, and surprised I was! Vampire films have really gained a reputation as being boring teen romance drams ever sense the Twilight movies, which is kinda sad. But with Johnny Depp bringing his creative and sexy charisma to film it definitely sucked me in. I always have a BLAST watching this movie, the writing is superb (I mean do you really expect less from Tim Burton). You get enough horror it to be horror but not an over whelming amount for it to be to gory. The acting is AMAZING I've already mentioned Johnny Depp but I will again, he brings to much to Barnabas that makes Barnabas such an interesting and complex character! Helena Bonham Carter is awesome as usual and the chemistry between her and Depp is perfect. Eva Green is amazing as the villain Angie. She portrayed her character as being cunning and very intelligent (I especially liked that she killed Barnabas's parents first and not just killing her parents and Josette at the same time, in hopes that in his grief he would come back to her). The music was very well done and I love all the songs! And yes I do enjoy the sex scenes between Depp and Green and Depp and Carter (I only wish I was the one replacing Green and Carter in those scenes ;). Honestly I was surprised it only got a PG-13 rating. If you love Johnny Depp and Tim Burton you should check it out tonight!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Limpid energy sustained only by Depp and three beautiful costars,"DARK SHADOWS was created for TV by Dan Curtis, which aired from 1966- 1971. The new film is reverentially written by John August and Seth Grahame-Smith. Johnny Depp topbills, with Michelle Pfeiffer, Eva Green, Helena Bonham Carter and Chloë Grace Moretz. ""An imprisoned vampire, Barnabas Collins (Depp), is set free and returns to his ancestral home, where his dysfunctional descendants are in need of his protection."" (imdb.com). Depp adds another rich character to his cornucopia of inimitable delineations, with much pizzaz and gloss, as a man-about-town in 1752 Collinsport, Maine, who is turned into a vampire and buried alive. Eva Green is (initially) exquisite as the witch, Angeline, who curses him after he spurns her affections, and Pfeiffer and Bonham Carter are topnotch as Depp's circa-1972 descendants, living in Collinwood Manor. Tim Burton's stories and movies have always bordered on the macabre, but DARK SHADOWS, despite the invigorating performances from the cast, is never as horribly menacing as his SWEENEY TODD (2007) or CORPSE BRIDE (2005), although beautifully layered like BIG FISH (2003), CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (2005) and ALICE IN WONDERLAND (2010). Even replicating the poignancy of EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990) or the frenetic pace of MARS ATTACKS! (1996) would have been welcome pluses. Thankfully, Depp is an actor with a Michael Caine/Christopher Lee penchant for an eclectic filmography, and his Barnabas Collins rises from the limpid energy sustained feebly by the film. Christopher Lee, famous for horror films from 1950s-1980s, is wasted in a brief role; a pity, he could have energized what scenes he had. Even Eva Green, my new favorite actress from CASINO ROYALE, appears to channel Elvira, Mistress of the Dark (actress Cassandra Peterson). This film has all the components of a successful horror picture but modern-day audiences may find it hard to relate to the 1970s-set dialogue, much as the flamboyant costumes, wigs and sets (by Rick Heinrichs) add sparkle to Burton's otherwise aimless remake of the popular 1960s TV show. Kudos also to Danny Elfman, who always provides thrilling music for Burton's ouvres. However, DARK SHADOWS is a must for Depp completists and fans of Green, Pfeiffer of Bonham Carter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Mediocre at best, the only real highlight was the Alice Cooper cameo.","I remember when Tim Burton used to be a respected filmmaker. Specially women seem to always be Crazy for his work. And I do agree that he has a unique style and he has made many good movies like: Beatlejuice, Batman, Nightmare before Christmas etc...But when he made Alice in Wonderland things had changed. Everything was a mess and I just ended up not caring about any of the characters. This movie is exactly the same, first half was alright. At first when I met all the characters I thought that it could be really interesting. Sadly i was wrong.Even with Johnny Depp in the main role and a lot of other good supporting actors things just fall flat. Pointless side stories, a boring love story and some really cheesy dialog. Like when Carolyn jumps down as a Werewolf and say something like ""yeah I'm a Werewolf, big deal"". At that moment I cringed in my seat and felt embarrassed that i was watching this. I also don't really understand who this movie is made for. Tim Burton is normally really popular among the women. But in many ways he made it more to please the men. I mean a large part of the movie seems to be about Women being eye candy for the camera. Even the 15 year old Carolyn poses as if she has somehow mixed up acting with modeling.But lets name a few positive things: Well it's a Tim Burton movie so it has a kinda cool gothic/70s feel to it. Depp is alright and pull off some funny jokes. It has some good 70s music. The main reason I'm giving this movie a 5 is because of one person. Alice Cooper...The moment he started preforming i was having a blast. Sadly thats not enough to salvage rest of the movie.Lets just hope Tim Burton has learned something from his latest mistakes.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
That's an enjoyable dark comedy!,"First of all, when I first watched the trailer of the movie I really enjoyed it and I had high expectations about that movie, because it was kinda innovative. The plot of the movie was very interesting and kinda prototype. The storyline was very well written and everything was well-explained. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and most of them were likeable (especially, the family). The filming location of the movie was mainly a big old creepy mansion in the middle of nowhere. The casting was incredible and their acting was AMAZING, everyone did a great job of portraying their characters. In my opinion, it wasn't a horror movie, because there weren't any jumpscares nor creepy scenes. The opening scene was very promising and the execution was very well done. The 3rd act was unexpectedly intense, full of shocking scenes and action-filled moments. The ending scene was definitely unpredictable and I really liked it. Also, the cinematography of the movie was brilliant and very unique. Moreover, the 1970's were portrayed really well (especially, the outfits, the music, the lifestyle, etc). Overall, it was an enjoyable movie, very intense and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. Last but not least, that movie DEFINITELY deserves a sequel!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Gothic Fun,"Dark Shadows is a tale spun from the 1966-1971 TV series with the same name. The filmmakers chose a comedic twist to deliver in 113 minutes what was once a 1,225 episode, daytime, Gothic horror soap opera.Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) loses the love of his life, is cursed with eternal vampirism by the jealous witch, Angelique (Eva Green), and buried alive in 1752 Collinsport Maine. 200 years later in 1972, he is dug up during the construction of a McDonald's restaurant. He returns to Collinsport and finds his beloved Collinwood Mansion has fallen into ruin along with Collins Cannery, the source of his family's wealth. The present-day and still cursed Collins family is under the protective watch of descendant, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer). Her orphaned nephew sees dead people and her daughter deals with hairy teenage-hood. Barnabas amusingly blends in and takes them under his vampiric wing. His mission: to restore the respectable Collins name. Yes, he's a vampire! His ambitions are quickly buried again by Angelique when he falls in love, again, with the destined Josette, a.k.a. Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote).Johnny Depp fans, this is a must-see. The film is gorgeously shot and uses all of Depp's talents to build to a climax that brings all the sub- plots home. Unfortunately, only three characters are necessary in the telling and the ending falls flat on its face in a classic case of deus ex machina. Maybe the filmmakers will give us an eternal, happily-ever- after ending to make up for it?",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Typically Burton,"Not too bad really, very much Tim Burton, and nice filming. The story is good, however, the end seems a bit like the story ran out of ideas.

Pretension Only Goes So Far,"Dark Shadows tries with all its might to be as quirky, spooky and ironic as possible. But I couldn't agree more with what most of the critics have said, and I quote, ""All dressed up, and nowhere to go"". To be honest, I thought that this was going to be one of Burton's most original outings since the mid-nineties. I was looking forward to the juxtaposition of groovy nostalgia and Universal classic horror movie monsters that this film promised. But once I pressed play, those hopes were quickly dashed. Its another pretentious Burton schlock-fest with over the top weirdness, over bearing set pieces, uninteresting dialog and of course, Johnny Depp stinking up the joint. I should have known that Dark Shadows was such an appealing franchise for Burton to get his greasy hands on. Nothing in this film is genuinely compelling or funny. However, the homages to the 70's (as little in quantity as they were), were at least semi- amusing. Tim needs to learn at some point or another that his 20 year Depp collabo is wearing extremely thin. Perhaps the film's box-office returns gave some sort of a clue.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Extra Sauce Wanted,"Dark Shadows is no masterpiece but a mostly fun and entertaining affair, offering stunning visuals and a lot of humor. The cast is just too delicious for such kind of a grotesque story: Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Eva Green, Chloë Grace Moretz, and last but not least Alice Cooper and Christopher Lee. Tim Burton made more fantastic, grotesque, darker and more sophisticated movies, but Dark Shadows is good enough, even if it can't reach the heights of Polanski's The Fearless Vampire Killers. What Dark Shadows mostly misses is a really good and interesting story, even the fine performances and stunning visuals can't hide the fact that the plot misses that extra sauce. But well, for all lovers of comedy and the vampire business, this one is solid enough for a ride. One bonus point to the rate for the visuals.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Interesting but something is missing,"The movie is legendary for me, I mean really, Johnny Depp, he's a legend himself, and let's not forget the queen Michelle Pfeiffer. For me it's kind of great and amazing. Yes, there's something missing as mentioned in the title of my review but I don't quiet know what is that ingredient. The romance between Josette and Barnabas that couldn't come to an end even after centuries and that true love never dies is just an amazing factor in this movie and as much as Angelique's obsession over Barnabas and the psycho she became is kind of interesting and for me is a push to know how her story would end.At first, my love to vampires and fantasies was the reason I picked this movie to watch and of course my love for Johnny Depp too but it's a little bit unique as it's not classic like Twilight or The Vampire Diaries and those vampire drama. This is about family standing together, never giving up, undying romance, and following revenge.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Dark Shadows would be better without a globe in the projector!,Unfortunately for fans of Johnny Depp and Chloe Moretz this would have to be one of the worst pieces that they have made. Hopefully fans will forget quickly. The film had me wishing that I had bought a bigger popcorn. That way after about the first ten minutes I would have something to do. The scenery was excellent and gave the film a great Gothic feel that it needed. The ruins of the mansion looked spectacular. Unfortunately the wooden acting and the manner in which each sub plot was written and resolved like a weekly TV drama made it difficult to have any real reaction when something happened. The comedy aspects that this film is supposed to have must have been playing in the cinema next door. I didn't find any comedy in this film except for the abysmal performance of Eva Green. Yet again another movie where the ending is so obvious and embarrassing when it is finally revealed you sit cringing in your chair hoping that they really don't make the second movie. If you want to see this film wait for it to be on TV so you don't have to pay for it.,1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

I enjoyed it,"I've read so many negative reviews of ""Dark Shadows"" that I just wanted to add my 2 cents. I enjoyed this film, especially the look of it. The set design, I think, was brilliant and the interior shots of Collinwood simply beautiful. And I also enjoyed the cast. This film is based on a TV soap opera that I was addicted to back in the day. That said anyone who watched Dark Shadows on television knows the program was riddled with problems. It was very low budget and props gave way, actors forgot their lines, booms and lights often appeared on screen and the story wound its way to hell and back. But those were not the things that mattered to me. It was the atmosphere of the show I loved and its Gothic theme. Yes, the ""Dark Shadows"" film is flawed but I found it entertaining. It captured some of the ridiculousness of the television show while elevating the production value off the chart. If you like darkly brooding yet luscious sets combined with well acted quirky characters and a generous dose campy humor you might enjoy this film too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Tim+Johnny, for better or for worse.","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp feed off each other immensely as working partners and have developed what I can only assume to be a legitimate close friendship over the years. Due to their friendship Hollywood has seen some of the most incredible and original motion pictures over the 90's and 2000's. Im not saying they cant work apart thats not the case at all. Im actually saying they work together so much they might want to be caviler in choosing projects to work on.Dark Shadows is a disappointment for many reasons, and after collaborations between Burton and Depp such as Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and Sleepy Hollow, one has to wonder why this was ever even made. The script doesn't only not work on any real level, its pace is horrible and the film cant decide what it wants to be at all. Dark Shadows cant even decide if it wants the main character in the film Branabus (Played by Depp) to be liked or not, he goes from goofy to high class to murderer in a eye blink and it all comes off flat.Another big problem Dark Shadows has is it never fleshes out any side plot. Like the side plot is glanced at for like a scene then it just pops back in 25 minutes later and you are like ""Oh thats what that random scene 25 minutes ago was about.Other times things just seem forgotten completely. I swear I forgot Bella Heathcote was in the film at on point and she is the love interest, and I didn't forget because I was ""Caught up in the thrill ride that is Dark Shadows."" I forgot because she disappeared for a good 35 minutes and she isn't doing anything during that time, not in danger or kidnapped just kinda goes off screen and comes back later, as to say ""Did I miss anything?. No, Bella. You missed nothing.Much like The Avengers people fight for shoehorned screen time unlike The Avengers the screenplay isn't fan friendly at all so aside from some beautiful filming techniques the film has nothing to offer.If you a Depp fan, Phiffer fan, or A die hard fan of Burton ascetics as a director I guess its worth a watch, but as a film that stands alone its not funny, its not scary, and its not engaging. Its nothing really, you would expect more from Depp and Burton at least a little more.3.5/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

But it pales in comparison to the TV show which was a drama and not comical.Yes I wish this film took itself seriously and it was a pure drama (that's why I didn't rate it higher) but the Burton and Depp dark comedies are to much for me to resist so therefore, I'm giving it a rating I think is fair enough.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

These two have a chemistry and their own visual and theatrical vocabulary that they have cultivated over the many projects they have worked on together. The other actors were also well cast and believable. But on the first viewing I was sort of let down by the ending and by the general tone of the film. It seemed to be too light as compared to the bits and pieces I remember glimpsing on daytime TV when it was in reruns in the early 80s. My mother loved the show when it originally aired so Dark Shadows was a reference that has seemed to be floating around my whole life. So although I enjoyed it the first time, I tended to agree with the reviewers that said something was missing.However, I went to see it again as a matinée midweek recently and my experience was much different. (It is a great matinée film...with these great dramatic monster and maiden hero shots at the beginning and end.) In the interim, I had watched almost every episode of the old show that has been uploaded on Netflix and so this time I could appreciate all the analogs from the show to the movie...and this made all the difference! Because the fact is that it's all there from the original, just reflected or refracted through the mind of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. And on seeing it the second time, I think it really works! Rather than being a remake or a homage, it is its own entity but with all the characters and places referenced in some ways and changed in others to fit the story. Now, some purists who only want the Dan Curtis version will never like this movie. But I say give it a second chance if you felt so-so after the first viewing. We have the original, melodramatic version which is brilliant and now we have this movie, which is another take that in time will be viewed as brilliant in its own right. In watching the old show, there is a mounting frustration in myself as a person of the 21st century that screams out to Barnabas to just reveal himself for what he is and let others deal with it. Most of his problems come from trying to hide who he is from everyone. Burton must have felt this too, especially given his filmic crusade to liberate and celebrate the ""others"" of our society, because the Barnabas in this movie is a vampire, accepts it and gets on with life. This joie de vie for being undead gives Depp's Barnabas a great energy and makes this movie a fun ride that I will no doubt watch many more times once I have the DVD. I even found the ending more acceptable the second time. I guess just as with all Burton films, this one too will fit better with wear.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
vampire games,"When Tim Burton and Johnny Depp come together one already knows what to expect. Dark Shadows is the 8th film directed by Burton with Depp in the cast, the first one being Edward Scissorhands from 1990, maybe the most famous of all. We already know that a fantastic and strange world of weird beauty and ugliness will be created on screen. We know that it will be scary but that we need not take it more serious than necessary because we are now adults and fairy tales do not scare us any longer (do they?). We also know that Depp will again be hard to recognize, but will be himself as well, another entry in a series of fantastic characters that we - who love the actor - wish will last for as long as possible.'Dark Shadows' is inspired by a TV show which gained cult status in the late 60s and early 70s which I have never seen or heard about before. It starts as a Gothic witches and vampires story in the 18th century to continue as a back-from-grave witches and vampire comical action in the contemporaneity of the TV show. Tim Burton and his script writers chose the path of creating from the perspective of 2012 a retro-actual comedy combined with situation gags about the culture, revolts and music of the 70s including a cameo appearance of Alice Cooper. These are actually some of the funniest moments in the film, as the rest of the story is pretty conventional and does not exceed the level of a mediocre comics-inspired intrigue.Acting-wise we have of course Depp, as pale and as weird as ever. Besides Depp the film is blessed with exquisite cast including Michelle Pfeiffer which unfortunately seems lately to fade away from important roles, Eva Green which has a love scene like you never saw on screens before with Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter which I wish had spent more time on screen. And yet, despite moments of fun and splendid visuals that only the imagination of Burton can create, something is missing in the script. I did not see the TV show, and yet I had a very strong feeling of deja vu which could not be completely balanced by acting and spectacular visuals. A movie relying only or mostly on visual effects, as perfect as they may be, risks to feel like unfinished.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Could had been amusing but it remains too underdeveloped for that.,"There really once was a time that Tim Burton just could do no wrong by me. I loved his unique style and visions but his more recent movies have been nothing but disappointing. His style feels more like a gimmick now days and he doesn't seem to be interested in telling a good story, with intriguing enough characters in it.And this movie ultimately is also a very shallow one. It does a poor job at handling its characters. Most never get developed properly enough, so you don't feel any involvement with any of them and it makes the movie vague and confusing about the motivations of the different characters.Seemed like the movie had plenty of ideas in it. Too many perhaps. It occasionally picks up a plot line but then completely drops it for another one. It makes this movie feel like a underdeveloped one, that never sets up anything properly. Instead it makes the movie feel like it's being all over the place with its story. When you think that the movie will be heading into a certain direction with its story, it suddenly takes a completely different approach and abandons all of its initial ideas. Seemed at first that the movie would be about Barnabas Collins trying to reclaim his family position. It then seemed like it was going to be a love-story and finally the movie suddenly started to involve a villainous plot, that worked out as something far too forced. No, it really isn't a very natural feeling or flowing movie, which also truly prevents it from ever becoming anything fun because it's also so terribly uninvolved and shallow to watch all. This especially goes for the movie its final 30 minutes or so, which just was one big mess, in my opinion. I literally had no idea what was going on anymore, simply because I had also lost all interest at that point and stopped trying to like and understand the movie.The movie does has its stronger points though. It remains a great looking movie, with all of its sets, costumes and makeup and I also liked the collaboration between director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman, which was something that seemed to be lacking the last couple of years but it seems like they have really found each other again with this movie, which is also one that feels a bit more into tone with Burton's earliest work, such as for instance ""Beetlejuice"".I also really liked Johnny Depp, even though his character remained terribly shallow and not very interesting throughout the entire movie. He still manages to put a lot into his role and still give some life and fun to this movie. I also really liked Eva Green as the evil villain but everything else in this movie was interchangeable really. Most characters don't even seem to have a real purpose for the movie at all and actors such as Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Jackie Earle Haley, Jonny Lee Miller and Chloë Grace Moretz all remain terribly underused.The first half of the movie remains pretty amusing, I give the movie that but I just can't forgive it for its second half and other weaknesses. It makes this far from a great or recommendable movie.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
shocked :-((,"i saw this movie three days ago and i had high expectations for the names of (Johnny Depp & Tim Burton ) have a ringing name in my ears , and i was disappointed .. the movie was too naive , the story was hollow and the acting was poor , Johnny Depp was the only one who knew how to play their rule , all other were missed up and was wondering out through the movie without a clue :-( , i really expected much of this movie ... Tim Burton Returns in a very very bad movie , i thought it would be better with Johnny Depp on board . am still mad at them both for doing such a bad movie , the only good thing in this movie ( which could be boring to others ) is the music and songs for the early 70th , i really enjoyed it and this with the acting of Johnny Depp Is the only reason i rate this movie 6 out of 10 , without them (music & Depp) I could of rated this movies with a solid 4 or 3 maximum ... wait till it is on DVD or go to theater if you feel bored and want to do anything but sitting home .",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Cool premise, but ""reality"" seeps in","I am old enough to remember watching the original ""Dark Shadows"" soap opera, but I was a kid, and so do not remember much about it. Best I recall, they played it straight. But it was, of course, a campy concept, putting Gothic horror elements into a daytime soap. Which brings us to this movie. A lot of movies seem to fall into this trap: they come up with a really good and/or novel premise for the film. And so the beginning of the movie, where they are establishing that reality is really good. But, it is a movie, which means it requires a story arc, climax, etc. superimposed upon the premise. And that is where it all goes, if not bad, it at least goes not as good. That seems to me to be what happened to Dark Shadows. It was still an amusing film, with some interesting actors doing interesting roles. Worth a look, but don't buy it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A fun parody of the original...nothing more.....,"This movie serves as a lesson in setting or having expectations. Fans like me were expecting something in the way of ""House of Dark Shadows"" or ""Night of Dark Shadows"", or the original classic TV show. We were somewhat disappointed.To be sure, Johnny Depp does a good job with the material he was given here. His character however doesn't inspire fear or dread, like Jonathan Frid's, or even Ben Cross's Barnabas Collins did. His character, especially in the second half of the movie, was more of a comic portrayal of Barnabas (a la Dracula in one of Tim Kelly's Dracula plays). Also Eva Green just isn't as delightfully creepy as Lara Parker. Although I love Michelle Pfeiffer, I feel she was totally miscast as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard.To be fair, there were moments of humor in the original Dark Shadows. Most of those however were unintentional (for example, in one scene you can see a stage hand waving a stick around making a vampire bat fly). The series overall however was suspenseful and sometimes frightening: the first two movies had that too. Tim Burton's Dark Shadows has overdone humor, comical special effects, and almost none of the suspense. I enjoyed watching it once, but I'll pass on watching it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

With the exception of his first Batman outing, his remakes/re-imaginings fall very short with me. To state the obvious, they're style over substance, forgettable budget bin titles 3 months after they hit the stores.

True, I agree the the ending is a tee let down from the Super High Start. and I have given a star less for that.

If you have seen one Burton/Depp movie you have seen them all. Nothing different here at all. Edward Scisorhands 10. I say B-,"""Welcome back to the shadows Barnabas Collins, I've missed you."" After refusing the advances of Angelique Bouchard (Green), Barnabas Collins (Depp) is cursed with eternal life by being turned a vampire and being buried alive. 200 years later he is accidentally awoken and returns to the manor his family built where he meets his descendants. He soon discovers that his relatives do not have perfect lives either and begins to try and change the fortunes of the Collins family. I have to put a disclaimer on this review by saying that I am not a Johnny Depp fan and am really getting sick of him playing the same role over and over. Having said that this movie is deceiving. The preview made it seem like it was a comedy, while there are funny parts this is not really a straight comedy. I never saw the TV show so I wasn't sure what to expect but to me the movie had the feel of less funny ""Death Becomes Her"" as far as comedy goes. To me the best parts were the old maid who doesn't speak at all and the soundtrack (as well as Alice Cooper). There were some pretty funny lines and Depp did do a good job but this is his typical character lately so I can't really be impressed by his acting. I will admit though that if you are a Johnny Depp fan then you will probably really enjoy this movie and totally disagree with my review. As far as my feelings I thought it was a little slow moving and seemed confused as to whether it wanted to be funny or not. Overall, fans of Depp will probably love this, I thought it was a little less then OK and a carbon copy of every other Depp/Burton movie. I give it a B-.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Barnabus Collins scorns a witch who loves him and she turns him into a vampire and destroys his family's fortune. He returns 200 years later to revitalize it all.,"I really do not understand why this movie is getting such a bad reputation.My theory is that people were expecting something that this film was not: they wanted it to be true film adaptation to the original soap opera source material, they wanted to see Nightmare Before Christmas 2, they wanted a dark horror movie, they wanted a hilarious fantasy comedy, or maybe they expected Batman Returns Again.If you watch this film with ANY expectations like the above, then you will be sorely disappointed. That is not to say that this film is bad because I actually love this film and think it's very, very good.Tim Burton is really at the top of his directing game here because this movie is actually a blend of silly comedy, dark fantasy, 70's period piece, and revenge. These are drastically different genres but Burton sews them together very smoothly. One scene will have Barnabus trying to ""fit in"" to the 70's with silly results, and the next will be a blood- sucking murder of one of the characters. This movie has ghosts, vampires, werewolves, witches, and somehow they all cohesively fit together without trying to kill each other for attention for the audience.You can also tell that the script has been polished and fine-tuned to a brilliant level. I never once got tired of action or tired of the drama because Burton and his writers spaced things out and paced the movie very well. You never feel rushed to the end of the movie or dragged slowly through the mud; this film changes the pace accordingly to the ultimate climax at the end.Of course none of this would work out if you didn't believe in the film's main character Barnabus Collins. Johnny Depp anchors this film with his truly amazing acting. If you reread his lines in this movie, you will know that a lesser actor will have audiences laughing at the ridiculousness of his words. I always thought Depp was good in general, but I am not a huge obsessive Depp fan. But he deserves high praise here because you can tell he takes his craft very seriously and it pays off. Depp plays Barnabus very straight-faced with no theatrical ""wink"" to the audience; he reads his lines as if he really were an 18th century merchant who turned into a vampire and has resurrected in 1972.Equally important in this acting category is Eva Green, who plays Barnabus' former lover and the witch who turned him. Her character is more ""out there"" in terms of villains and she needed to act with the appropriate grandiose bad guy and obsessive-ex-girlfriend levels at the same time. She is fantastic here because she shows vulnerability as an ex who wants Barnabus back but also a cut-throat businesswoman out to destroy him. Oh yeah, I forgot she also has to play a villainous witch on top of those two qualities. She shines and plays a great counterpart to Depp.In this movie, I found myself laughing, curious, and creeped out at the various times. I also came into this movie expecting nothing more than to be entertained, and it delivered more than that. I know Burton has a history of doing certain types of movies, but please don't go in expecting this and that. You have very polished and solid writing, very good acting, and silly comedic reliefs throughout the film. Just open your minds and go on a fun ride because this movie will surely keep you entertained if you don't label it beforehand.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"A nice comedy fantasy involving vampires, witches and magic.","It feels different from other Tim Burton movies, but it's not necessarily bad.

There are a few random scenes and dynamics that are specifically designed to shock the viewer - if you know you know - but they don't add anything to the plot and they feel flat pretty early on in the film.

Poor Effort from Burton,"I don't know what to make of this movie. I really don't. It tries to do so many things and ends up doing nothing. The plot is all over the place. There's a lot going on so it's hard to find the important details.I've been a fan of Tim Burton as long as I can remember. I grew up watching his two Batman films, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands. I've followed his work from Pee-wee's Big Adventure through Big Fish. His recent efforts (Planet of the Apes, Alice in Wonderland) have noticeably lacked his earlier charm. I've only been disappointed with two of his movies: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (which was more due to how good the original is) and now Dark Shadows.The movie is based on a Gothic soap opera from the 60s and 70s. Johnny Depp plays a vampire who awakes to find his dysfunctional descendants plagued by the witch who made him. I have very vague memories of the show, mostly when I caught the last five minutes while waiting for The Incredible Hulk on Sci-Fi Channel. I know little about the series, and it seems the movie is made for fans of the show with little effort to create new ones. Besides Barnabas and Angelique, there's little development in the other characters. They all have the occasional scene but nothing memorable. These seem mostly to reference some event in the show and not really help the movie in any significant way. Worse yet, Angelique makes a horrible villain. She has no reason to act other than she loves a man who doesn't love her. The whole time I kept waiting for some dynamic motivation that never appeared.The movie is trying to be a comedy, Gothic horror, and romantic drama but never really succeeding at any. The problem is, anytime the movie starts getting into one particular genre it changes gears. The separate elements never really blend together. I understand that the show has a certain camp factor to it, but I've read that this was mostly unintentional. Perhaps if they had simply made it a comedic Hammer films style film, or romantic comedy, or Gothic romance. But the three together never work as a cohesive whole.The finale (not really spoiling anything here) is representative of all the problems of the movie. By the time the third act came out I had somewhat zoned out. I knew what was going on, but simply didn't care. It felt like the movie was just going through a series of checkpoints but without any feeling. There are revelations that mostly come out of nowhere, but apparently are based on the show. The whole thing screams of committee filmmaking, like the studio put too many demands on the film without letting Burton be Burton. Either that, or since Depp and Burton were such fans of the show they tried to hit too many major story points and forgetting to make it into a single film. It's okay to cut stuff out for a sequel. The first Terminator and Indiana Jones films cut out material that they ended up putting into the second. It's okay to not include every single idea.Had the movie stuck with the fish out of water story, this would have been great. The best scenes are Barnabas encountering ""modern"" life like roads, television, and pot-smoking hippies. Depp makes these moments quite hilarious. I found the line confusing McDonalds with Satan to be very effective.The only really good thing about the movie is that Burton certainly has his unique look. He is definitely one of the most visually distinct directors out there, if not the most. Every frame of the movie has his visual stamp on it.Honestly, I can't really recommend this to anyone. It's not even an okay-at-best effort from Burton like Alice in Wonderland was. The movie won't win over any new fans for the show. And fans of the show will probably find this to be little more than a overly-silly CliffNotes version. It's too dark to be a comedy and too silly to be a drama. The series is fondly remembered. The movie won't be.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"I went into this really not expecting much, but... Surprisingly, it was actually quite good.  Blu-ray: Excellent A:10 V:10","I was REALLY surprised by how much I liked this film! I almost didn't watch it because I read so many reviews where they said that Burton took the old Gothic show and made it REAL campy. But, that simply is not true. So, I had pretty much resigned myself to the fact that the movie, although possibly entertaining, was probably not going to have much of a truly Gothic atmosphere and that it was likely going to be pretty corny.Well... I am FRIGG'N glad that I did see it! I do not really care for a lot of Tim Burton's films, but I very much DO like a few of them. So, I was VERY pleasantly surprised that right from the start the film had a STRONG Gothic intensity that Burton retained through most of the movie. And... the comedy when it did come, was timed very well and it really was used fairly sparingly. Most of it shows up around the time when Barnabas comes back and the expected humorous things that happen to him when he tries to interact with 200 years in his future. This time, I did NOT get the impression that it was a run-of-the-mill Tim Burton film, where he was just kinda going through the motions. I could truly feel his heart solidly in this one, really bringing out the depth of feeling inside of Barnabas, and thus, our feelings for him.Amazingly, Burton kept the tension and main focus on the underlying enmity between the two primary characters most of the time. And Depp's performance was absolutely perfect! He hit JUST the right amount of dryness when reacting to 'modern day' things; and he kept up a consistent, beautiful, dark, Gothic pathos which carried most of the film. I mean, you could REALLY relate to and feel for him, despite the eccentricity of the character; you have to be EXTREMELY good in order to be able to pull that off.So, whether you are a Tim Burton Hater or not, please by all means give this movie a chance (assuming you like at least SOME fantasy elements in your films) You may be VERY surprised (as I was) that it is actually quite good and likely one of Burton's better movies...",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good moments of dark humor in a regular comedy.,"Barnabas Collins has a huge fortune and a great future but he turns out to be cursed by a witch, whose love he despised, becoming a vampire. Now, centuries after his disappearance, he will try to return to his ancestral home in order to protect his descendants. Directed by Tim Burton, it has screenplay by Seth Grahame-Smith. The cast is headed by Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer and Eva Green.This is the film adaptation of an old soap opera. First, I must say I never saw the original series, so I can not make comparisons. But one thing I noticed: as this film is a dark comedy, many people did not like it because they expected to watch a horror movie or a thriller. This happens especially when we know the story from a book or previous film. But that does not make it a bad movie. As I had no expectation, I watched it as a comedy and really liked it. The dark mood is rare because it is controversial, but this movie is full of good comic moments without breaking with political correctness.The script works on a regular basis, it should have been more reviewed and worked. There are a handful of dubious elements, poorly explained situations and plot holes throughout the film. The provision of the actors was positive, but Johnny Depp's performance in the lead role, overshadows almost all colleagues. Actor experienced and proved in terms of versatility, he is able to do almost any role. Eva Green was also perfectly at the height of her role, giving an icy sensuality to the villain. The scenarios are excellent, particularly Collinwood, whose Gothic and sinister environment has lots of charm. I'm not a big fan of the seventies, but the epochal recreation seems to me dubious and untidy. Most of the scenes seem so much like the present that the audience quickly forgets the story takes place in the past. The cinematography is good, alternating darker and gray tones with more colorful scenes in order to emphasize sensations. The visual and sound effects are good. In turn, the soundtrack has coordination problems between the original track, made for the movie, and music pieces from the seventies that arise in the film and obfuscate soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

I still feel that enough works here to warrant itself a rental at least,"""Dark Shadows"" is not a great film, but it's entertaining enough to warrant a watch, even if it's a bit all over the place in terms of quality. The movie starts off a little slow, but it's got a strong and very entertaining middle that I feel elevates it enough that I can give it a mild recommendation. It looks great and you'll get a lot of laughs out of it, enough to forgive the end which sort of comes out of nowhere and unfortunately does not follow up with some of the charm it had earlier on. I had heard multiple times from people that a lot of Tim Burton's movies feel like the director lost his interest in the story towards the end, and it really feels like that's the case here.

"It's no ""Sleepy Hollow"".","I was hoping for another magical mix of atmospheric horror and Burton /Depp shenanigans like the perfect blend served up in their take on Ichabod Crane. I thought the prospect of a Vampire being brought back after 2 centuries would provide lots of opportunity for laughs and scares.Alas this is another broad and oddly muted pairing off the jolly bad boys much more in line quality wise with their off-kilter (if enjoyable at times riff on ""Alice In Wonderland"". It has neither the scares or guffaws that might have given it some genuine life.The first mistake was probably in settling for a PG13 level of depth and mayhem (though Burton and Depp obviously had a great time sneaking in bizarre sexual innuendo including witchy Green dropping down to give Barnabas a bit of undead oral attention). ""Sleepy Hollow"" worked for me because it's ""R"" rating gave the premise room to breath...and be as far out as B and D wanted it to be. This films seems oddly truncated and half hearted.Another problem is the ""Gotta please the fans"" decision to devote gobs of time to back story...without bothering to give the updated characters any life or depth...(and playing fast and loose with the mythology at times is NOT going to win anybody's eternal devotion).All in all entertaining and watchable...but not what it could and should have been.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Nothing like the original,"I watched this movie with an open mind. I want my time back. In my opinion, anyone that is a fan of the tv show can't like this movie. We all know that Barnabus did not like being a vampire and tried anything he could to be come human again. In this movie, they made Barnabus a bloodsucker. Also, in the movie, they made Victoria and Maggie the same person. Why would they do that? We all know that they are two different people and have their own stories in the show. This might be the first Tim Burton movie I didn't like.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
This Movie Kinda Sucks,"I really like the original Dark Shadows TV series; it's got a nice eerie feeling and it was satisfyingly complicated. I didn't, however, catch the early '90s version or the 2005 TV movie, so when I heard that Tim Burton was going to be remaking it for the big screen, I was quite excited. The material seemed right up his street. There was no way, I thought, that this could be anything other than excellent. Oh, how wrong I was!While a lot of the blame for how bad the movie turned out to be must be laid at the feet of Seth Grahame-Smith - and I'll go into why in a minute - there are some creative decisions that were surely other people's, or that people didn't question at the script level that just don't make sense.In fact, this movie's main problem, I think, is that logic packed its bags and went on holiday during production.You can make the world you create as a movie-making team with whatever logic you like, but, if your world doesn't operate according to the real world or by logic set out by similar worlds and characters in past works, you must explain that, or the audience must, and will, use their frames of reference. I might be looking into all of this too deeply, and the leaps in logic, inaccuracies and nonsensical stuff here might just be oversights, but there are too many of them for that to be the case.But, then again, they must just be oversights and examples of shoddy writing, or else they would be explained. If I could have just turned my brain off, not thought and not listened to dialogue or not paid attention to the many, many illogical and nonsensical things in this movie, I might have enjoyed it more than I did. I doubt it, though; it's got Johnny Depp in it, who has definitely lost that certain something that made him a great actor.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Its good but.......,"I went on to see Dark Shadows with much expectation but it did not deliver 100%.Firstly the acting by Johnny Depp was very good as always,Eva Green also acted well as the cunning witch,rest of the cast performed accordingly.Story was also good but it lacked depth,the movie did not know whether it is a comedy or a horror movie.Dark Shadows is undeniably entertaining and nothing else. There are things that could have been better.Dir. by Tim Burton was not up to the mark,he needed to make the movie more compact.The horror aside - there's nothing to make you bite your nails - Dark Shadows clearly works on three fronts. First, is the picturesque setting then the acting and visual effect.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Shallow but funny fairy tale and Depp ego trip,"I am generally not a Tim Burton fan. His grotesque and over the top style is mostly just too ludicrous for me to enjoy. ""Big Fish"" is a notable exception - that was a wonderful, heartfelt movie.In Dark Shadows the dark comedy is fun and it all starts out good as Johnny Depp is amazed by all the progress in the 196 years he has been buried. The 70s vibe and character development of all main and side characters is satisfactory at the start. The absurd humor is generally funny. But somewhere towards 2/3rds of the movie it starts to derail. Heavily. No more character development, everything developing according to standard Hollywood structures and most of all, a dull, uninspired and laughable closing scene that leaves you with a bad aftertaste in your mouth.The acting is OK, although Depp is quite boring in his ego-trip interpretation and constant hard stares. His acting prevents from viewer bonding with the protagonist in my opinion.All in all it is not a bad movie and it can be quite entertaining, but don't expect the same emotional deepness as in ""Big Fish"". Good start, horrible ending.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A Tim Burton Joint,"While very campy throughout the film, if you're a fan of Tim Burton's dark, gothic style with some corny segments here and there you'll likely find enjoyment here as I did. Johnny Depp hams it up once again as an over the top flamboyant vampire this time who returns after a 200 year hiatus to pull his descendants out of a jam. He is accompanied by a slew of well known actors as his kin and side characters. Across from him was Eva Green who was simply born to play the seductive villain in most of her roles that suits her very nicely like pairing a fine white wine with a char broiled salmon. There was also a solid appearance by the great Alice Cooper who put on one of his mini wild stage shows in its horror-esque nature. The soundtrack too is scored by none other than Danny Elfman, who I don't think is allowed to score a movie without Tim Burton's approval or involvement I don't think as he's always attached to his films it seems and that's just fine by me. Overall it is a mildly entertaining dark horror comedy and if you know what you sign up for with Tim Burton you'll derive some enjoyment here like I did. If his style is not your thing though, then I would consider this one a hard pass.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Not true to the original.,"I remember listening to the radio show of the same name and watching the tv show and this movie is not true to those. I would label this more as making fun of the original or perhaps comedy horror. Either way, if you are expecting the creepy and scary of the original audio or tv show then skip this. Depp, while a fine actor did not do this character justice. I would say it is the fault of the script because he is stuck with what he has to work with.If this was a standalone with no ties to the original Dark Shadows this would be OK as long as it was labeled as a comedy horror. It's nothing great and definitely not the Pirates of the Caribbean. Would I watch it again, no, that is part of the reason why I am writing this review. This came up as a suggestion to watch and I remembered that it is not good enough to view a second time.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"My first exposure to anything ""Dark Shadows""","This is a movie where people are either creeped out by Johnny Depp or want to have sex with him, while he acts like a total cartoon but is somehow portrayed as the coolest guy in the room. He fights to undo a monstrous curse put upon him by an abusive witch who is trying to force him to love her, but his hands aren't exactly clean, either.And, man, I dunno. It's kind of on the nose, y'know?This is probably a movie that the deeply die hard Johnny Depp fans like, because it's Depp doing the thing that he does, and he's with Helena Bonham Carter and she's doing the thing that she does.But the entire time I was completely distracted thinking about how the perspective of this movie feels so strange considering the last few years of Johnny Depp's career. It left me feeling uncomfortable.It's also just kind of a weird, messy movie. Barnabus is meant to be the movie's protagonist, but he murders quite a lot of people and though it's funny that he apologizes for some of the killing, sometimes he's merciless in a way that doesn't seem great. It also spreads characterization way too thinly -- take Victoria, who seems to be important to the story but only shows up in, like, five scenes in the whole movie? There are huge stretches where you'd forget who she even was, because the focus is more about this fish-out-of-water story where the fish somehow just adapts perfectly to his surroundings.And it keeps getting messier, and messier, and messier. Despite nearly two hours of runtime, it can feel like half the movie is missing, because things just randomly happen in the way that they sometimes do in bad movies. There are several 11th-hour revelations like this towards the end that fall in to this category; things that are never mentioned before, never set up in any capacity, but somehow happen for convenience sake. It's bad.Look, I'll level with you: I watched this because I honestly got it mixed up with the ""What We Do in the Shadows"" movie. I figured I'd still give it a shot anyway. Don't make the same mistake I did; this isn't worth your time.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"A bit too much Eva, and not enough Helena and Chloe, but well done","I give this movie an 8, but if I could rate more discreetly I'd give it a 7.8...just under that. When I viewed the trailers, and I must have viewed nearly all of them and saw the TV adverts I was afraid that Burton and Depp had jumped the shark with too much comedy. They didn't, although there are a few scenes that go over the top. In general the tone is respectful to the original soap while managing to poke a bit of fun at itself.They've taken some license with the original plot, but not in a way that detracts I think. Certainly, the movie successfully explores and exploits the sudden jump from 18th century to the 20th in a way that the original never thought to.It moves a bit slowly at times, and there are some actors that are underused. Chloe Moritz and Helena Bohnam Carter could have been used more effectively even without expanding their parts, but by simply making them more integral to the plot.I don't think I'm spoiling anything by mentioning the well advertised cameos of the original stars, but I will say that their appearance was much too brief...fleeting even.On balance, if the movie performs well and they decide to make a sequel, I'm on board.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Should Have Been Brilliant, BUT...","This is not a good adaptation. At all. Nor is it a good movie in its own right.This is just a really messy, mushed together thing that doesn't work on any level. Not comedy, nor gothic horror, nor drama.There are a ton of bizarre decisions in tone and casting, not to mention Depp just doing the same cooky thing he always does.And - I can't stress this enough - NOTHING works. Watching this movie is like watching a bad fan edit of several different movies, all of them more interesting than this one.I saw an interview where Burton said it was because it was adapted from a long-running soap that the movie turned out like it did. That he didn't really intend it to end on a sort of sequel hook.Then, perhaps, don't make the film? Or come up with a solid script first?I don't know. Everything feels wrong here, like nobody knew what anybody was doing. And it sucks, cause the soap is wonderfully melodramatic and moody and gothic.If you're a fan of the soap, go watch that instead. If you like Burton or Depp, you may get some enjoyment out of this, but I'd only recommend if you need to complete your collection.And if you've never seen the TV show Dark Shadows, go watch that before you see this... thing.

Burton being Burton,"Dark Shadows was the last major film to date that Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter worked together on. It was a partnership that general audiences were getting tired off which partly explains why the film flopped at the box-office. Despite this Dark Shadows was more in Burton's wheelhouse then offer films made in the 2010s: it was an off-beat gothic comedy. It was the film that was the closest to Burton's early hit Beetlejuice.Dark Shadows had an incredible cast. Eva Green was a delight as the villainous Angelique who was bitter that Barnabus Collins rejected her and Michelle Pfeiffer dominated as the Collins matriarch. Depp was playing his quirky characters that became known for at this point but he did use it for an out-of-time comedy and I would be lying if I didn't laugh at times. The montage that showed Vicky's backstory was dark, twisted, and pure-Burton and I loved it.The big issue with the film is its story. Dark Shadows was based on a soap opera and it showed because it tried to tell quite a few stories in one go. There was the rivalry between Barnabus and Angie, Barnabus rebuilding the Collins business, and Barnabus' love story with Vicky. The film did waste some of its cast members like Chloe Grace Moretz were wasted in fairly small roles.Worth a watch on Netflix or Amazon Prime.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Moody and charming! - then tattered and flat.,"This movie started out so moody, atmospheric, and groovy! I was totally enamored. I loved the first hour of character building and scene-setting. Unfortunately once the plot started to thicken, things started falling flat. Gaps between scenes, weird reasoning, plot jumping around, bad makeup/effects, glacial pacing during the climax, using bad shots of the actors for some reason. I think the overall plot, and all the actors, were so good! The difficulty was in the editing toward the end. Johnny Depp is so adorable, I just wanted him to have more screen-time in character! As was Helena Bonham Carter. Same for all the characters, honestly. Too brief on each. But, that editing at the end really did it in. Hate for this rating to reflect on the cast, but the latter half was that disappointing. It's the beginning that holds my rating up at a 7; it's worth watching on its own.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
This movie is a travesty and an insult to the original show!,"I have never been so disappointed and angered by a movie in my life! Dark Shadows was one of the greatest TV shows/soap operas ever made, and this movie did nothing to honor its legacy at all. It was a giant piece of smelly crap! I used to run home from school every day to watch the original Dark Shadows on television at 4 p.m., and it was a thrill for me and every other fan who adored the series and the cast. All of the fans were heartbroken when the series ended. In later years, we were able to buy the series on DVD (the only soap opera ever made available to purchase). We were able to buy the Dark Shadows movies, and an attempt to revive the series in 1991 with actor Ben Cross failed, but at least it was a genuine attempt to stay as true as possible to the original series.The problem is that you simply can't remake something as classic, unique and ground-breaking as the original Dark Shadows. In fact, most movies that try to retell classic TV shows fail, with just a couple of exceptions.This movie was so boring and so bad that it probably made Dan Curtis roll over in his grave. For those who don't know, Dan was the creator of the original Dark Shadows. Johnny Depp is a fine actor, but he's no Jonathan Frid. I respect his attempt, but it fell way short.The original series was not a comedy and the lame attempts at comedy were an insult to a classic series that was anything but comedic. The fact that four of the original cast members made a brief cameo in this movie simply proves that they had respect for Tim Burton by accepting his invitation to appear, but most likely they were paid handsomely to appear as well. Who can blame them? Also, I want to say that I have enjoyed many of Burton's other movies. He just should have passed on this one.I only know that I did not like this film at all. I'm sorry I watched it because it took me 6 years to break down and do so, and I got exactly what I thought I'd get. A horrible experience. Just leave the original Dark Shadows alone! It will live on and on and on without any help.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Super Freak- awesome,"Johnny Depp does not disappoint in Dark Shadows, a quirky funny dark tale. The story embarks from the old country as the Collins clans sets out for their fortunes in the new world. This lands them in America and they become the city elders of Collinswood. Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is the devoted son and through a series of mishaps a curse is placed on him and his family which results in him becoming a vampire. This leads to an inadvertently sentence to a life far below, fortunately some road construction 200 years later frees Barnabas and he returns to find his family fortune and name in shambles. So begins the odyssey as this unlikely Savior seeks to save the day, win the girl, and adapt to the norms of the 1970s. The modern matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeifer) holds the fishing business together while fighting off the rival Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). This is a charming movie that gives some of the best dialogue to the reverent superstar Johnny Depp. Bedsides the funky psychedelic 70s is out of sight. This is a must see hit that contains all the elements of a good big screen hit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"A good movie, but not what I was expecting.","DARK SHADOWSI remember seeing this film was coming out in the cinema and I was really excited. I love waiting for a Tim Burton movie. Tim is my favourite director and I just love the feel of his movies.The movie is about a wealthy man who scorns a woman that works for him unknowing that she is a witch that curses him and turns him into a vampire. She buries him and leaves him there. 200 hundred years later he gets dug up and realises that times have changed and the witch is still around running the town. The battle for the town begins.I went to see this in IMAX when it was released, I remember liking it but being slightly disappointed. The trailer makes it look like a full on comedy, but it's not really. There are some very funny comedy moments in it, but most of them were in the trailer.The story was really good. I like the rivalry between the vampire and the witch. There is a sexual tension between them, but even though there is that tension there, he really doesn't like her. It is a weird relationship.The casting was very typical for a Tim Burton film. Johnny Depp stars as Barnabas. Johnny has starred in a lot of Tims films. I have read some negative comments about that, but I disagree. I see them working together and it is a winning combination. If a partnership works, then why break it up? If you look at the films they have made together I can honestly say that I like all of the films they have made... even the remakes that Tim has done. I am not a fan of remaking a film and I was very dubious about it when Tim started making remakes, but I do like the ones he has done. Helena Bonham Carter also stars in this with Johnny. I know... no big surprise. But again, it works. Michelle Pfeiffer, Jonny Lee Miller, Eva Green, Jackie Earle Haley, Bella Heathcote, Chloe Grace Moretz and Gulliver McGrath star. The acting was quite good throughout, but again, the annoying one was Chloe Grace Moretz. She has yet again proved she can't act. It is a shame, but I really don't see what people see in her. Her lines seem so forced and it feels like she is reading every word she says. It was good to see Michelle Pfeiffer in a Tim Burton film again. The last film the made together was Batman Returns. There is also a great cameo by Alice Cooper and Christopher Lee.It was also really good to see the original cast of the TV series made a small appearance. Jonathan Frid filmed his scene and unfortunately died before the film was released.The effects were really well done. The end of the movie is where the effects are really shown to it's full capacity. Eva Green's character starts cracking and it is really well done.The soundtrack to this film is great. The movie is set in the 1970s so all the way through the film you have some classic 70s songs. They really do go well with the film.This is a good film that is a lot of fun to watch... but don't see it thinking it is a laugh out loud comedy, it is more of a fantasy film.I will give this 7 out of 10.""You may strategically place your wonderful lips upon my posterior and kiss it repeatedly!""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Biggest disappointment of the year,"I had such high hopes for this movie.The clashing of black-clad Victorian prudishness with garish swinging 70s has amazing comic potential, especially with the irony that the prude kills people. Imagine a bicycle outing along the beach, with Barnabas on a velocipede. Imagine the family surprising him by fixing up his coffin with a water-bed and fiber optic lamp. It could have been so good.So what the hell happened? Lots of people have pointed out that the movie was a mishmash-- didn't know whether it was satire, slapstick, drama or what. True, but the bigger problem is the dull, dull pacing -- the actors just trudge from one plot point to the next, passing up every opportunity for originality along the way.None of the characters have any back story, they look like Burton picked them out of a catalog. That's especially noticeable in the villain, whose motivations are completely one- track and ridiculous. You can't have a character on screen for 20 minutes without developing her somehow. Snidely Whiplash is a more believable villain. In fact, not one of the characters was remotely likable.I like Tim Burton and even defended Planet of the Apes (garbled ending and all), but he should have turned this concept over to Wes Anderson.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

This ends up being a poor man's Adams Family that is a slightly above average addition to the genre,"Dark Shadows (2012) is a movie I recently rewatched on Amazon Prime.

""" Blood is Thicker than water, but that was Hundreds  of  years ago   ""","Dan Collins created this black Macabe thriller back in the 1960s and despite it being a bit of a shock to audiences, it nevertheless became a lasting entertainment staple for years.

Okay,"Dark Shadows is adapted from the same 1970s TV series, which has 1,200+ episodes. The movie focuses on Barnabas Collins, a human-turned-vampire who was buried in the 1760s, only to be freed in the 1970s.While the series is really dark, the movie takes it a little bit more lightly and has very cheesy moments and some jokes that aren't really funny. It was interesting at first, then on the middle parts it just became dull.

"Despite a Recklessly Overstuffed Plot, Burton's Latest is a Thin, Watery Affair","Although I was sucked in by the sheer, merry lunacy of this world, its characters and their wardrobe, there's really no excusing some of the faultlines that run through the heart of this confused little horror saga. It suffers from a severe case of subplot-itis, and tries in vain to cram four chapters' worth of back story into nearly every face. Even the less interesting minor players are obsessively over-inspected, which leads the more important characters to pull constant disappearing acts. Pseudo-protagonist Belle Heathcote is the most glaring example, vanishing without explanation for a full forty minutes during the second act, and then materializing right in the middle of a cramped romance. Johnny Depp's Barnabus is the one constant, happily sailing far over the top in yet another colorful, inexplicably successful leading turn. I caught myself laughing at the punchlines more often than I'd expected, but Dark Shadows often tests the boundaries of good taste, and in one case (an out-of-left-field comic love scene) ventures too close to the uncomfortably absurd. Kooky and silly, it's unforgivably (and thoroughly) lacking in the kind of panache Tim Burton was always known for.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Quite entertaining,"I plan to buy this movie when it's released for DVD/Blu-Ray. It is certainly not a landmark of modern film making but it's entertaining. My better half and I enjoyed it in the theater and look forward to watching it again in the comfort of home. The small group of movie goers in the theater with us all had positive comments as we were leaving.This iteration of Dark Shadows does not strictly stick to the story lines and characters of the original soap opera. I feel it does pay homage respectfully.It is basically a comedy but is not a blatant 'leave your brain at home' comedy. Though it contains some overt humor and physical comedy, it also has more subtle humor that may not hit you right away.It is not a 'jump out of your seat' or 'gross out' horror flick either. It has the pacing and physical appearance of a classic Hammer atmospheric horror movie.While I don't believe it's destined for making a gazillion dollars in it's theater run, I feel like it has a promising long-term future with a loyal cult of fans. This movie isn't for everyone. You've got to discard any preconception of what you think it will or should be like. Then immerse yourself in the fantasy, suspending disbelief like you would with any film dealing with the supernatural. Finally, listen and watch carefully so you don't miss the subtleties.Depp was the perfect choice for playing Barnabas. At times, it seemed like he was playing it like a stage role - just a bit over-the-top dramatically. He never breaks character by acknowledging the humor in his misunderstanding contemporary references in the dialog. His reactions range from oblivious to mildly perplexed, lending credibility to the performance.Gone with the Wind it isn't, but it is a low key entertaining romp.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Fun. Funny. Very retro feel of Dracula and Austin Powers.,"Fun. Funny. Very retro. Depp doing Depp at his best! And surprisingly a genuinely sound storyline.If you were born too late to enjoy the spoofy, silly but a little bit creepy late 60's daytime soap opera on which this film is based, you are probably too busy seeing The Avengers for the third time this month. This movie is not for you. But it could be. TMG thinks this film can play to all generations if they give it a chance. Most will not. Too bad.To a sharp eye, this movie has many elements of Edward Scissorhands (1990). Scissorhands was the movie that has defined Depp's career, perfected his quirky mannerisms and solidified his creative acting style. It is in the TMG Movie Hall of Fame. Dark Shadows won't make the Hall of Fame, but it is a solid reprise nonetheless.What is appealing is that the screenwriters mixed a dumb soap opera with genuine comedy largely built around a vampire (always popular) with the modern day surprises after being buried for 200 years (196 to be exact). It has that Austin Powers fun about it. Pfeifer and Green added the sultry and hot spice while Jackie Earle Haley (remember Little Children from 1990?) added a touch of creepy authenticity (a bit Marty Feldman like from Young Frankenstein (1974) for a very mild, spooky feel.My real disappointment, perhaps more of a concern, is for little Chloe Moretz.

Left feeling sleepy and hollow,"So, Dark Shadows. I was waiting for this film for a long time as I am a big Tim Burton fan, and a huge Johnny Depp fan. But this venture was confused and really missed the mark for me.With Tim Burton you know what you are getting, usually. Yet Dark Shadows seemed to be suffering from an identity crisis. What am I? A Gothic romance? A spoof? Have you ever looked at a magazine stall and wondered why each genre of magazine, be it womens, mens, gardening or whatever look exactly the same? It's because people en masse need that. And with Dark Shadows it lost it's direction from the very outset. I spent the first hour wondering if I should laugh or not. I was confused. But I think not as much as the guys who actually funded this movie.I want to reiterate, I love Burton, Depp and Bonham-Carter. It was great to see Michelle Pfeiffer again (and she was great as it happens). But I felt let down by this movie. Something didn't quite work for any of them, like they had been miscast, or the script was lacking, or perhaps the idea was just not right. The chemistry was a little off and the intended jokes missed by a mile. I sincerely hope that this is just the one that Burton 'experimented' with and now we can all go back to the comfort of his genius. It would be awful to think that he has allowed his ego to take over.I don't do spoilers. I think people should watch a film for themselves rather than read reviews, but I also know that people do read reviews and I don't want anyone to think this is rubbish. It's not. It bounces along with the usual Burton quirkiness, but somehow it just didn't gel. I paint, and I know that sometimes despite experience and best efforts not every painting is good. Some just annoy for no tangible reason.Overall, it's nothing different, nothing of note. Bit boring, and sadly even Depp fails to impress (first time ever). I kinda feel sorry for Tim. He won't be happy with this one, but at least he got paid.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Too cheeky for its own good, script lacks","Pretty average. OK for a random evening, but quite unmemorable too. Several plot lines are thrown out in the early stages of the movie, but then altogether left alone. There is an attempt at humor, it does work at points, but it also feels a little forced and the whole thing becomes too cheeky because of it.I had low expectations about Johnny Depp after liking him less and less in recent movies, including Burton's movies. But Depp is OK here. Still, Depp, as well as Eva Green, Johnny Lee Miller, Michelle Pfeiffer, Chloe Grace Moretz, Helena Bonham Carter, while turning in good performances, also are too caricatural. A little too much one-liners. Cheeky is the word. I do not blame the actors, it is the script.Also, there is some unnecessary CGI/post-processing. For example, the docks and ships at the beginning of the movie look very unnatural.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Light or dark? It's a misfire either way.,"Dark Shadows is directed by Tim Burton and written by John August and Seth Grahame-Smith. It stars Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Chloe Moretz, Eva Green, Bella Heathcote, Jonny Lee Miller, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jackie Earle Haley and Gulliver McGrath. Music is by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel. Based on the TV series of the same name, plot finds Depp as Barnabas Collins, a 200 year old vampire returning to the family mansion in 1972 to find his dysfunctional descendants in residence. With his old nemesis still to deal with and the changing of the times complicating matters still further, it's clear Barnabas has much on his hands.The Burton and Depp combination, coupled with an American fan base of the original TV series, ensured that Dark Shadows made a decent profit at the box office. However, this does in no way prove to be a guide to the quality of Dark Shadows. It is in truth a muddled mess of a picture, in fact it comes off as a selfish exercise, it's a film that Burton and Depp appear to have made purely for themselves. Self confessed fans of the original TV show, of which only a cult fan base existed any way, there's no denying that Burton pleases the eyes with his visuals and Depp engages in that kooky way from the corner of the market he has cornered, but even their hardiest of fans must be growing a little concerned about the lack of feeling for their audience.The film actually starts off quite promising, prologue and lead characters in place, a whiff of comedic horror in the air, but once Barnabas is unearthed from his 200 year old grave, it all goes quickly down hill. Not sure if it wants to be funny or creepy, or what pace of scene or tone should follow each set-up, it's weird for all the wrong reasons. The fish out of water premise quickly grows tired and the support characters to Depp's Barnabas are merely making up the numbers. Only Eva Green, who is so delectable she is made for Blu-ray, is able to compete on equal terms with Depp's latest kook, but even she is hindered by the weak screenplay. It's a shame and a waste rolled into one, because as gorgeous as it is to look at, and as sure as there is loving intent, Burton has crafted a disappointing over long mess of a movie that is neither homage or reinvention. 5/10 for Miss Green, the visuals and a snazzy sound track.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
campy vampire tale....,"was Barnabas good or bad? That is what I was trying to figure out after watching this. On one hand, he is supposed to be the protagonist who is going up against evil and on the other hand he is killing construction workers and spaced out campers.Barnabas is a vampire that is released after being underground for 200 years. So there is a lot of campy jokes about how things have changed, from roads to cars to parties. He finds that some relatives are now living in his house and he conveniently has a room filled with hidden treasure, so that takes care of money issues. The witch that buried him is still running the town and she is still obsessed about him. Also, Barnabas's love has been resurrected in Victoria, a girl living with the family. So the film is about Barnabas trying to get rid of the with, Angie. And as it turns out half the family have some sort of supernatural powers.FINAL VERDICT: Seemed like this was thrown together to take advantage of the popularity of vampires. It's not a comedy, but it's not to be taken serious. Don't go out of your way to see it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"Coming from Depp and Burton's previous records , you will be definitely disappointed","When you hear about marvelous actor like Johnny Depp and master- director like Tim Burton doing a film together , your joy will be doubled but then you watch them doing a movie like ""Dark Shadows"", you joy will be cemented.A vampire , imprisoned for 2 centuries , returns back to his own home to find his family and business being ruined by a witch. He must act and protect before it becomes too late to get tangled by ferocious witch.Tim Burton (Sleepy Hollow , Big Fish, Alice in Wonderland) is always a director to look forward to as his films are fantasy , adventurous , dark and humorous. Dark Shadows promises to fall into the category but is bogged down a weak screenplay and even weaker direction. The movie starts off very very well when Johnny Depp is buried by the villages after being betrayed by his ex-lover and then he returns back after 200 years only to rejuvenate his family business and protect his family but things gets out of hand in the middle and looses further steam down the film. In fact , it becomes so irritating that you might want to skip the movie in between and go and grab some free air. Tim Burton is not in form this time. He choose the right story but fails to make an impact. Screenplay is lousy along with poor dialogues. Art direction is wonderful with eye-catching cinematography and visual effects.The only thing , I liked about the movie was Johnny Depp's candy floss performance. The actor is always dependable and is fun to watch.Overall , weak movie in all merits.

Loved it! See it!,"First, I didn't really expect so much from this movie. I had some expectations, some preconceived ideas, maybe it was a spoof of the old Dark Shadows TV show? Which I only vaguely remember as I was just a kid at the time. My impression was it was kind of a soap opera with Vampires.I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It was way entertaining beyond all my expectations.I really do love movies, although not necessarily all of Tim Burton's. And not even so sure he ""made"" it. He directed it, but JD produced it so I don't know. I liked ""Corpse Bride"" but didn't care much for his Batman, and some of his others. But here, this movie was spot on in the genre!I haven't liked a dark creepy movie like this since Peter Jackson's ""The Frighteners"" (a classic in it's own right), and it minded me a bit of those fun ""Adams Family"" movies.Johnny Dep Vampire was so compelling, interesting, and just humorously perfect creepy.Now if it has much to do with the original Dark Shadows series, if I missed some spoofs, or inside jokes, I honestly could care less. I doubt it even matters unless you are a 55+ plus that really remembers the old show (and nothing wrong with that either). For pure entertainment value it kicked some serious A'!See it, enjoy, you might love it as I do.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Promising start, Disappointing end","Dark Shadows is a fantasy horror comedy movie directed by Tim Burton and stars Johnny Depp, Eva Green, Bella Heathcote, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jonny Lee Miller, Helena Bonham Carter, Jackie Earle Haley, Chloe Grace Moretz and Gully McGrath.The start of the movie is promising and it seems that we are ready for an entertaining joyride but the hope diminishes and vanishes.It seems that the plot is written in a hurry and the characters aren't explained properly although the cast chosen for the movie is talented and they had performed well in their department and special praise should be given to Johnny Depp for his impeccable comic timing.Screenplay is not that impressive and couldn't hold the half cooked plot. The direction also disappoints. Acting as I mentioned earlier is impressive and visual effects attracts appreciation. The movie could've been better provided they had developed the plot and character in a much better way.Overall an average movie with a great comic timing but disappoints when it comes to the plot and it's execution.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Terrible Script Destroys Great Idea,"When a movie is staffed with some of the best actors of the day, that usually indicates that they liked the script.right? Well, not exactly. Dark Shadows is a great introduction to the dark shadows of Hollywood. Sometimes it doesn't matter what script you think is good and what script you think is bad. Instead, it's about who you owe a favor or what studio you work for. How else could such a plain script attract the likes of Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Carter, and Chloe Moretz?I have never seen the original television show that sparked this movie. However, to my understanding, it was a dark drama. How did such a television show get turned into a comedy? What's worse is that is got turned into a comedy that didn't make me laugh in the slightest. The movie is filled with awkward lines and out of character moments. The writer—Seth Smith—shows just how much of a amateur he is in the world of film scripts.The only enjoyable part of the movie was when the actors found a way to work outside of the script. Although Chloe Moretz character was horribly constructed, she still made some of her scenes work. Johnny Depp was able to pull of the strangeness that comes with losing two centuries. Above all others, Helena Carter actually pulled off a believable character. Just a fair warning to all screenwriters out there. If you only successful character is the drunk, you have a big problem.Tim Burton is the master of ""hit or miss."" He had directed some incredible movies in Edward Scissorhands and Big Fish. However, he has plenty of terrible movies: Alice in Wonderland, Mars Attacks, Beetlejuice, etc. There is little room for in-between with Tim Burton. I don't consider this a bad thing. He goes all-in when he makes a movie. When it succeeds, you get fantastic results. The only problem is he creates a lot of bad movies in the process. Please, Tim Burton, stop taking mediocre scripts!The only people who will see this movie are fans of vampire movies and fans of Johnny Depp. The thing is, this movie disgraces both. Johnny Depp had put out come fantastic movies. With such a great acting ability, there is no need for him to be in such a mediocre film. As for the ever-expanding genre of vampiresthere are plenty of good alternatives.

"No laughs, no scares, really poor.","Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is the son of a wealthy English family who move to Maine, USA in the late 18th Century. After spurning the affections of servant/secret with, Angelique (Eva Green) he falls in love with local girl Josette (Bella Heathcote). Angelique, unable to bear seeing someone else with Barnabas, kills his parents and Josette and turns Barnabas into a vampire. 200 years later it's 1972 and Barnabas is unearthed from a coffin which the townsfolk placed him in and attempts to reconnect with his living family and rebuild the great Collins name.Tim Burton appears to be on a bad run at the moment. His last two films 9 and Alice in Wonderland were critical failures though Alice proved to be extremely popular at the box office. It is my feeling that Burton is currently favouring style over substance and that is evident in his latest offering. Tim Burton has no trouble creating beautifully odd looking sets, characters and films but it is one thing to make a film that 'looks Tim Burton' and another to make a film that is any good. The film has all the Gothic grace of Tim Burton's finest and he manages to meld this with a 70s look which works quite well. Details of both periods look great and work well together. The set dressing, clothes and music are all spot on. Where the film falls down is in the plot.Firstly it makes no sense and there are more plot holes than a machine gunned Swiss cheese. Barnabas, an only child, is killed in the late 1700s, long after the death of his parents yet 200 years later his family is alive and well. Where they came from is never explained. Another problem is that Eva Green's witch character has tried for 200 years to get rid of/keep the family out of the way. She is a witch and shows her power in numerous scenes but has still been unable to remove them. This doesn't make sense and in one scene late on it is shown that she is responsible even for improving the survival chances of one family member. A further problem is that the character of Josette and the 1970s nanny Victoria are played by the same actress and one is followed by the other's ghost. The reasons for this were never explained and made absolutely no sense. Another problem which bothered me though probably doesn't matter in America is that Barnabas is meant to be from Liverpool but speaks with the same non-descript English accent that most American actors use.Other than major plot holes the plot itself is thinner than tracing paper. It was really boring and I didn't care about any of the characters. It wasn't funny enough either. I sniggered a couple of times but didn't laugh once and I wasn't alone. Even during the funniest parts, the audience I saw it with barely tittered. Along with being unfunny it also wasn't scary. For a comedy-horror really it should have been at least one or the other. The Woman in Black showed what can be done with a 12A/PG13 rating and this film came nowhere near to making me scared.The actors were all generally quite good. Johnny Depp was fairly amusing with his from a different time bit, but it soon wore off. Overall though he was very good and carried the film. Chloe Moretz was also excellent, for once playing a normal teenager. She conveyed teen angst very well and made for a good sparring partner with Depp's Georgian vampire. Michelle Pfeiffer was also fine as the family matriarch though she didn't have much to do. Helena Bonham Carter was great but felt under used and Bella Heathcote felt a bit swamped by the exuberant characters and personalities around her. Eva Green was excellent as the witch. It was also nice to see Christopher Lee on screen, if only for a minute. The addition of Alice Cooper felt like when a TV show has run out of ideas so brings a star on to boost ratings. It felt very unrealistic to have him appear but it was only a matter of time before he did make an appearance in a Burton film.Overall this is a film of style over substance and that puts Tim Burton in a bracket with Zach Snyder, somewhere he really doesn't want to be. It looks and sounds great, has some great acting and characters but suffers from a poor script, lack of laughs and scares.www.attheback.blogspot.com",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Decent but below any expectations,"This movie had all it takes for a good movie. A top-notch cast, a decent director and a successful TV show to build on. Sadly, all this potential was wasted due to a lousy script. The story is weak, the characters are superficial and unconvincing. No blame on the actors though, they did best they could with what they were given to work with.The first few minutes of the movie play in the 18th century. Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp), son of wealthy and successful parents has an affair with Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), a housemaid from humble home. He refuses to acknowledge her, unknowingly that she is a witch. In return, she kills his parents and his newly-married true love Josette (Bella Heathcote), turns him into a vampire and has him buried alive by a mob. All of this is rushed through in about five minutes and that is what it feels like. Rushed. Josette has literally one line to say before she is killed off, all of this appears unreal and laughable. It's like ""Oh Barnabas, promise to always stay with me /big eyes/"" (first line and last one, just saying) - ""Yes my true love, I swear, we are so in love, huh?"". I mean, come on. COME ON. That's all so unreal and unconvincing.Anyway, plot continues 196 years later, in 1972. A bunch of construction workers stumbles over Barnabas coffin and releases him and he sets out to see whether the Collins family endured. They did. Elizabeth Stoddard (Pfeiffer) and her daughter Carolyn (Chloe Moretz), Elizabeth's brother Roger Collins (Lee Miller) and his son David (McGrath) still live in the Collins mansion. They are in company of psychiatrist Dr. Hoffmann (Bonham Carter), caretaker Willie (Jackie Earle Haley) and the new housemaid Vicky (Bella Heathcote, again). The family business however is going bad, let's say not going at all and the family fortune is gone. All of them has their own problems, in one way or another. Barnabas decides to get the old family business going again, only to find out soon enough that Angelique who cursed him two hundred years ago is still around and alive, being the family's biggest opponent in the industry. Barnabas has to struggle with that as much as with family internal problems and of course himself adapting to a new age. This brings along quite a few good laughs.Johnny Depp sadly fails to reinvent himself as Barnabas Collins and displays the annoying habit to adapt gesture and humorous dialogues which made me think of Captain Jack Sparrow with make-up rather than an entirely new character. He's entertaining nevertheless, don't get me wrong. The rest of the cast is doing decently, from my point of view the only outstanding performance is delivered by Jackie Earle Haley, though. That guy is totally underrated. Sadly, sadly, sadly, the characters and their relations to each other are weak, superficial, the plot seems forced at times and character development is not to be found. The romance is as much of a joke as in the 18th century part of the movie. Again, I blame the script for this. Too many characters, too little screen time for each of them, too little time to evolve and make them appear alive.All in all, a waste of potential, this one could have been big, instead it's mediocre. The only thing this movie shines at is the soundtrack. It's terrific. Wish I could say that about the rest of it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

I found myself checking facebook during the movie and only looking up when I heard Depp's voice which was very entertaining. Helena Bonham Carter was good for what she had to work with and the two children in the movie were great actors.

Why series aren't movies...,"This movie just does not work - although the actors all perform well. especially Johnny Depp. Tim Burton tried to cram a whole series into a movie - a task predestined to fail. I admit, I haven't seen the series, but as I saw the movie, my first thought was: This should have been a series.A lot of very strange characters, all having a dark secret, all having a dark history, a great setting for some ""war"" between the witch and the vampire - and it is because of the length of the movie impossible to exploit them. Thus, the movie touches all of them slightly - way to slightly. The result is the constant feeling of passed chances to create something great, and putting it all to the waste - you're giving it all away in the end, all those about 10 plots are revealed ""using the sledge hammer"".All in all, because of good acting and some funny scenes worth a watch, but I think I'll give the series a chance now - where all those great ideas mingled into a movie way seemingly feel more complete.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Depp is Dark but not Deep,"I just re-watched this and was quite surprised how much I enjoyed this (hence the high rating). This film is flawed but also inspired in its own way. Johnny Depp is great as the infamous vampire, but Depp plays up his unfamiliarity with modern items such as electric lights, TVs, and even asphalt (""Curious terrain""). All the casting is good; there are many A-listers. Even the cameo appearance by Christopher Lee is nicely done; his reverberant voice is really something.The movie starts off with a lovely ""high camp"" tone and artfully descends into absurd comedy. It's not badly campy until the final act. The ending is appropriate but somehow a bit unsatisfying (too pat?).The bevy of fine actresses competing to steal the show is impressive. I'll rate them in order of descending success. Eva Green (psychotic witch), Helena Bonham Carter (a hoot as a cynical redheaded doctor), Chloë Grace Moretz (hilarious teen angst), and Michelle Pfeiffer (bitter matriarch). Having this group of talented (and attractive) women exercising their formidable comedic talent together is a real treat.I give this 7.5 stars, plus a half-star bonus for the ""doctor-patient confidentiality"" scene near the middle.

No synopsis here,"Just a simple to the point review. I was never a fan of Dark Shadows so perhaps if you were.. you should take this with a grain of salt.This movie looks like a dark comedy.

I thought i would dislike some of the rest of the cast as they seemed to be set up to play stereotypes.. none of them did and the entire cast was Excellent. The scenery was great and somehow they managed so make a dark foreboding mansion set in a bright sunny town... totally believable. In fact everything about the movie was believable.. and there are some pretty insane things in this movie.But it just didn't click. Probably the script. Maybe the directing. Maybe the movie just couldn't decide what it wanted to be.. horror, comedy, romance, tragedy... Its like they were trying to make a superepic but just didn't have what it took.

dark shadow is worth of watching and thinking.,"It seems it's a different movie from Burton. Like Charlie and chocolate factory his aim is to show importance of family and love. He always mixes truth and fantasy with people's beliefs. I think here, the witch is a symbol of jealous people which want to destroy other's lives. Barnabas is symbol of innocent human which his life is destroyed by this jealousy. Mother is symbol of all mothers, strong and tending to keep family together for any price. The weird wolf girl is symbol of indifferent and careless young people today which in the hard time even though it is not expected, but they show belonging to the family. Gorget who guides Victoria to her destiny is the real fate which some people believe fate will guide them in life and there is sign if you look around carefully. At the end this is just love which can destroy the curse (even love between Barnabas and Victoria, and love between family members).

The end of the movie got a little bit dark and rushed, like they were trying to finish and tie up loose ends. The story in general was a good one, but the details was where it got really weird. Although this movie has my favorite actor, Johnny Depp, it wasn't good. I would compare this movie to a dark romance mixed with an inappropriate comedy mixed with a fairy tale or legend. I don't think that the story was developed enough and there were too many different characters and bits of their lives all trying to be in the same 2 hours. Had the director taken out a couple of the smaller parts and developed further the more important parts, it could have been a decent movie.

Don't bother,"Dark Shadows, the new collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, a remake of the late 60's television show of the same name, is a disappointing train wreck of flat characters, weak storytelling, and is guilty of a mundane premise. This is just another movie (a la Alice in Wonderland) where the names Tim Burton and Johnny Depp don't go synonymous with greatness.Barnabas Collins (Depp) is a vampire, imprisoned for 200 years in a coffin by his arch nemesis and lover-to-the-end-of-time Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), and wakes up in 1972, only to find that he is in a different place, different time, and that his family fortune is all but none. He heads back to his home in Collinsport and seizes the opportunity to help his living heirs and hopefully destroy Angelique once and for all.One of the problems this movie has, albeit a lot, is that nothing ever seems too big of a deal. The 1972 Collins family is struggling to survive; yet no one works. They all blame the lack of their once successfulfishing company on Angelique's slow turning monopoly ""Angel Bay Seafood"". I know there's a point where you have to suspend disbelief but come on, battling seafood companies? The Collins' are a collection of great actors but horrible characters. Michelle Pfeiffer, the so-called matriarch, is nothing more than a brooding house mom with too much time on her hands. I personally kept getting distracted by her ridiculous eyelashes. Jonny Lee Miller, as the dim-witted selfish brother offers nothing exciting during his screen time and when he leaves us it is with relief rather than regret because it wasn't like he was doing much when he was on screen anyway. Chloe Moretz, one of the few child actors nowadays that I am actually excited to see grow up into a fine actress, is wasted as a brooding teenager, having no new insightful moments or any act relative to the story at hand. Her turn in the third act is unjustified and is over as soon as it starts. Helena Bonham Carter. Well. This movie really made me miss the Bonham Carter that was in Fight Club because since she got hitched to Burton, she seems to be playing loud obnoxious characters that aren't funny and waste time on screen (think the Red Queen and now this atrocity).The only redeeming quality Dark Shadows has is that its soundtrack is pretty awesome, giving us some 70s tunes that we haven't heard in a while and making good use of the time period with production design. It also reminds people like me that when something is being marketed as the new Tim Burton-Johnny Depp movie, I know now not to get as excited as I used to.Chad FilmPulse.net",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Great Fun! One of Burton's Good Ones,"I've never seen the show, or the previous films, but Tim Burton's Dark Shadows was great fun. The comedy is not in your face, it's subtle and sarcastic and witty. The film is a slowburner, it's not action packed, but I don't think it was meant to be either. This after all is paying homage to all those spooky Dan Curtis movies and television shows, he was always about the old fashioned horror clichés, the fog, the moon, the ghosts, the giant mansion.I thought Depp was great as Barnabas and is really what kept me glued to the film, Barnabas is a great character, the fish out of water elements were great, but so was the theme about trying to bring the Collins family back to it's former glory.I salute Burton for not using so much CGI, this time, its only used when necessary. This time we get real sets, and not everything is computer generated. The art direction is top notch as is expected of a Burton film.Some people might not like it when compared to the TV show, because this is a comedy and the shows were not comedic, but I think on its own merits, the film works and I consider it to be one of Burton's ""good ones""",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Tim Burtons Entertaining Horror Comedy,"It seems like Johnny Depp can't say no to Tim Burton, they had some good collaboration, except for Charlie and The Chocolate Factory(2005). Now the re imaging of the 60's show named Dark Shadows.Johnny Depp is pretty memorable as Collins, the vampire who was buried for 220 years. And makes it clear that he is a character you don't always want to route for, and his pretty funny with his dialog. Eva Green(Casino Royale) is also a scene stealer has the witch who cursed Collins, she really plays evil to the max, and has such awesome chemistry with Depp. Michelle Pfeiffer is memorable, also Chole Gace Moritz. It's not all comedy, and not all horror. It balances the both. But if you are not into this, you should skip it. But it's awesome direction by Tim Burton.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Started out good, all downhill from there...","I was really excited to see this movie after seeing the trailer on TV all the time. I love Johnny Depp and Tim Burton's done some good stuff, so I figured it would be a pretty decent movie. However, the trailers completely give you the wrong image, making it out to be a funny ""fish out of water"" comedy, when the movie itself it pretty dark and intense. I figured from the trailer it was PG-13 most likely because of language, but it was pretty violent and a bit sexual, not something you want your 6 year old seeing. Another thing, (I hate it when they do this!) ALL THE FUNNY LINES ARE IN THE TRAILER! So if you've seen the trailer, I kid you not, you've seen the entire comedic aspect of the movie.They could have totally gone in another direction by making this strictly a comedy with not nearly as dramatic and intense a plot. I would have enjoyed it much better if it focused on the funny things Barnabas does while trying to assimilate into society, like the Disney movie ""Enchanted"" or ""Back to the Future."" There is one scene where Barnabas sees a McDonald's sign and thinks it's the Devil and another where he rips open the family TV thinking there is a ""tiny songstress"" inside! Why wasn't there more of that in the movie and why wasn't that the main focus? Instead, the story focuses on a corporate battle and the rivalry between Barnabas and the witch Angelique. Honestly, the rest of the characters are just pointless and do nothing. I get that Tim Burton was trying to stay true to the old TV show, but by doing that, he ends up cramming in a bunch of little subplots that are really pointless and lead no where. He could have appealed to a much larger audience and most likely been more successful if he had stuck with the comedy and even possibly made the film PG. To sum it all up, MORE COMEDY, LESS WEIRD DRAMA.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Not a good movie,"I am a huge Johnny Deep and Tim Burton fan, so I'm sure you can understand my disappointment of this film. if you're looking for a comedy i don't suggest this movie,dark shadows is not a fine work for Deep or Burton. the plot line was a tad bit pointless and some parts didn't even make much sense, the beginning was pretty cool but after that things just got weirder and weirder. i'm sorry to say that i do not recommend this movie, and i'm pretty sure they sort of ripped of a Goldie Hawthorn movie. so my apologies to anyone who enjoyed this film or to those looking to view it, but in my honest opinion i am highly disappointed and i have lost two hours of my life i can never get back",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Jeepers creepers, what a loser...","This live action cartoon starts off really fast and furious with what seems like a great story, but then out of no where, it starts to lose steam and ends up spinning its wheels, much to my frustration, as this was the only movie running on the Red Eye from Los Angeles to Boston. There are lots of predictable scenes and lines that attempt to be cute or funny (much like Burton's goofy Planet of the Apes remake) but this just emphasis the inability of the writer and director to connect with fans of the series. Even Depp seems like he's just coasting along for a paycheck. Elfman's score is creepy enough, but as the film morphs into a Scooby Doo episode, so does the music. Hence, the mansion is the real star. Eva Green is gorgeous as ever and if it weren't for her, I'd have just snoozed on the plane ride home instead of waiting and waiting for the story to improve. Neither the story nor my patience did. The most obnoxious gig with this film is Depp's makeup. Even vampire's don't look this clownish or silly. If you're 12 or 13 and a real die-hard Depp - or Burton fan (if there is such a thing) you might get through this film, but I recommend passing on this one and go back to the original TV series on DVD.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
No Redeeming Feature Here,"Tim Burton used to be gooood. He did. Johnny Deep used to be a genius, too. He did. Here they both failed. Miserably. Utterly. Wholly. Completely. Totally. Pity.

We saw in awful Sweeney Todd. We saw Helena Bonham Carter and we know already how bad she is. Any clear spot? Pfeiffer? Nay, she is very much like in Stardust. Old hat. So, any clear spot? Yeah. Alice Cooper. Music. This is all. All that dark, sepia, gloomy scheme is so funny and laughable. We never even smile. We saw all those mannerisms before.

A bad movie with a big budget to cover up its flaws.,"If it wasn't for the obviously enormous budget that went into hiring stars and starlets as well as the CGI efforts and special effects (which by the way look idiotic at some points), this movie would be categorized as a B-Movie at best.The story is flat and uninspiring (bad witch curses everyone, yaaaawn!) and flat out predictable. The end doesn't make any sense at all and seems completely rushed.Seeing Johnny Depp as yet again another make-up-overloaded ""weirdo character"" gets boring by now as well and all of the other actors except for Eva Green seem to not give it their best at all. The acting is laughably corny in a lot of the scenes.This movie tries sooooooo hard to be funny it is painful at times and rarely successful. The obvious product placements throughout the story are annoying as well.3/10, unwatchable disappointment and a waste of time.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Almost Never Saw This,"I saw the trailers for this film, and sadly did not see it in the theater. I couldn't imagine WHAT Tim Burton was doing, but this was most certainly NOT ""my"" Dark Shadows. The trailer made the film seem trivial and preposterous; a complete farce. Whomever was in charge of that trailer needs to be disposed of in a most visceral way.The actual FILM is quite fetching. Depp is a star in this role as in most. His recreation of Frid's original character is startling, while maintaining a continuity between the two renditions.The problem with the original soap opera is that it took itself WAY too seriously. It tried to scare us green, and it really DID entertain...while accidentally making us laugh from time to time. This film is fun and really took me back...in a good way. The comedy is campy and intended, where the original series had no intention ever of making one laugh, though it often did. The character development is sufficient without boring the audience into a long nap, and plot execution goes off seemingly without a hitch.Continuity has a few holes, but this was done for fun and in fun...so who cares about continuity? I didn't. I was entertained. That's what film-making is all about. And, if it makes money, that's a bonus. LOLOn a more personal note, I genuinely hope they make another. I know the plates of all the principals are full, but would still very much like to see a run of these.

Sort of lame,"What would you call this movie -- a spoof?The problem was with the plot and the writing I suppose. I just didn't see the point of most of it. It seemed to be another kick at the Beetlejuice can (family deals with crazy character).Tim Burton has produced some great movies, but something went wrong with this one. Maybe I'm in the wrong demographic.I enjoyed the many 1970s references.This movie had a few laughs. However, mostly the fun seemed forced. The hippie scene, for example.The strange thing is that the performances delivered by Depp, Bonham Carter, Pfeiffer, Green and the others were actually quite good. Depp was amusing and seemed to be enjoying the hand thing. Bonham Carter is always good. I love her.When I attended this movie, there were only three people in the theatre. And I have to admit I dozed off during the first half hour.I want to give it a 5.5, but I've rounded it down.I'm surely not the only one who is a little tired of the vampire, zombie and werewolf theme. I refuse to go to a Twilight movie. Don't get me wrong. When they're well done, I enjoy them as much as everyone else. But they just seem to be everywhere lately.

Maybe it's because I never saw the original soap opera and went into the movie with no background information. Or maybe the soap opera was just as weird.

"A visually beautiful, surprisingly funny, retro romp.","I fully expected to sleep through this movie. I was not a fan of the original Dark Shadows TV series, nor am I a big fan of Burton, but this movie was a very pleasant surprise. Perhaps too much of the amusing aspects of the plot were given away in the trailer, but speaking for myself, I felt there was still plenty to keep me amused. Was it on par with Citizen Kane? Please. But thank goodness, it doesn't have to be to be an enjoyable movie.Is Johnny Depp's performance over-the-top? Yes, that's what makes this so funny. Did this story not deviate from the original plot in a significant way? Sure, that's what makes this so funny. Did this film not wallow in the cheesier aspects of 1970's culture? Yep, that's what makes this so funny.The only issue I took was with the usual cheesy visual effects that Burton loves (think claymation), which to his credit, he kept to a real minimum in this film.Visually, the Burton 'chiaroscuro' worked brilliantly, and the music by Danny Elfman, was perfect, but surprisingly different from his previous compositions which all bear a trademark style missing in this score. Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer & Helena Bonham-Carter gave excellent performances & the supporting cast worked really well. The performance by Alice Cooper was a delight, too. Eva Green's performance was the weakest part of this film for me. For a character that was supposed to be driven by love & revenge, she seemed a bit flat, one- dimensional & uncommitted. Perhaps the character was written poorly, but the performance didn't save the character. Jonny Lee Miller didn't sparkle in his role, but as he is a truly brilliant actor, I suspect the lack of sparkle stemmed from the script & possibly the editing.The movie is light, tongue-in-cheek, witty & fast-paced. The violence & language were not objectionable for younger viewers, and the retro appeal was really well done. It's a fun, enjoyable family movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Quirky and good,"If you ignore the weaknesses of the story, for example the almost non-existent portrayal of the love affair between Barnabas and Victoria, an entertaining film remains.

A little bit of everything and a whole lot of NOTHING,"Meh... that was our reaction when the credits rolled after seeing Dark Shadows. I wasn't even planning to go see him in the cinema, but my friends wanted to see him and just went along. Afterwards, they liked it even less than me, which was funny. Everyone is talking about the collaborations of Burton and Depp. I dunno, IMO they make only movies for themselves and if the public likes them, they got lucky. Separately they are brilliant and both have great movies. Together, something happens... every movie is ""different"" to say the least. I think Sleepy Hollow is still their best one yet, and I don't think they can top it. This one however... I'm never going to see again. Because what is it about, do we even have to think about this one? Why did they even take time and money to make it?? Is this what people are waiting for I wonder. OK, short overview: Visuals were great as we've come to expect of Burton. Depp is a great actor, but stuck in a terrible roll. Eva Green is as hot as they come!! The red dress!! The young girl, who I recognized from Kick-Ass is growing up nicely... I know she's fifteen, but you can already tell she's gonna be a beauty in years to come. I actually liked her performance best of all, until she became a *spoiler* at the end when the whole movie was ready to be put out with the trash. What sucked? Everything else... story? no Plot? even less Idiotic chars? Too much!

soulless film,"Tim Burton managed to leave me totally void of any emotion through the entirety of this movie. I didn't like it or dislike it, just totally middle of the road. It looked real nice as Burton has a flair for the Gothic but it was as if he just didn't care about the material enough. Frankenweenie is testament that when the work is personal he can produce wonderful idea's and marry them to film with ease. Nobody springs to life and aesthetically the film looks decent but without the small details that set his notable works apart.There is no firm plot. The family have money troubles, Depp turns up and reveals a hidden treasure room. Money troubles gone. Seriously, that quick. The movie avoids any real interesting plot devices such as the recent string of killings upon Depps return. Or the story of the boy who can apparently see his dead mother. How about the secret around Moretz troubled teen, no we'll just address those in the last five minutes. The love interest also has a back story summed up in a matter of moments. The tumultuous relationship between Depp and Green opens this movie and delivers for the small part. Overall though it plays out exactly as you would expect. You'll be left wondering why the manner in which they deal with the witch didn't just happen right off the bat.Considering the eclectic talent filled cast you'd think there would at least be some interesting performances. There isn't. All actors deliver the bare minimum, totally due to the script issues. This just leaves the meat for Depp and Green. Green just mails it in and Depp plays his role like Jack Sparrow dressed for Halloween.I will never watch this again.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Love It!,"As a 19 year old student that has always hated the 60s/ early 70s i found that this film changed my mind. I've always had a hatred for this era, mainly due to the Beatles, but the films use of more talented artists, such as the Carpenters and Alice Cooper, have made it great to listen to.I thought the film, was typical of Tim Burton, and if you're not a Burton fan, you're not going to like it. If you do, then i think you will love it. I have always been a fan of Burton, and his style. I am a Visual Effects student, and to me i find his style much more appealing that a majority. People complain about his constant type cast actors, BUT i think you'll find that its mainly due to a very good relationship between them all, and the fact the actors love to work with him, who wouldn't!?I've not seen the TV series so i cant comment on whether they were alike or not, but i felt this film had a really good rhythm to it. It brought back my love for Alice Cooper, and reminded me of my childhood learning guitar with a Glam Rock lover teacher. I thought it was very good paced, i LOVED the VFX for it, and thought it was a great horror/romcom which is an odd combination, but done well by Burton. I think that with any other actors it would simple not feel right. The great thing about Johnny Depp is his ability to morph into a different character and you completely forget about his other characters in other films, as a posed to the awful acting by Jack Black, who will forever be, Jack Black.A Great fun film that has really cheered up my iTunes!Good Old Tim!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Confused Mess,"It wouldn't be hard to argue that Tim Burton has lost some of his magic in the last few years. Granted his bank account has grown considerable in this period especially since Alice in Wonderland. It seemed that financial wealth had paved the way to creative bankruptcy. Films like Charlie and the Chocolate factory and Planet of the Apes had shown that the Director was less willing to take a chance instead trying to adapt his ""quirkiness"""" to already established properties. Trailers for Dark Shadows provided hope of the director's return to form showing hints of both Beatle juice and Edward scissor hands. Sadly after watching the finished project Tim Burton fans may have to wait a bit longer for this return to form.Opening in 1760, Johnny Depp plays Barnabas, a well to playboy and local man about town. When he breaks the heart of the beautiful Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) little does he realize that she is a witch and that his decision will cost the life of his true love Josette(Bella Heathcote) as well has cursing him to spend all eternity has a vampire. When the townspeople get wind of this curse they quickly bury him alive. Barnabas remains buried for two hundred years only to be resurrected in the year 1972. He decides to return to his beloved Collinwood Manor where he is taken in by the remaining members of his family. Little does he realize that Angelique is also immortal and she is none too pleased when she discovers her old ""flame"" is back on the scene.From the above synopsis you can probably guess that Dark Shadows is a strange little picture. Tim Burton must be commended in a way for being able to use his clout to bring a picture like this to screen. Based on a short running soap from the late 60's Dark Shadows is a mix of comedy, horror, drama and satire. Where the film falls down is in its attempt to juggle all of these different tones together. First time writer Seth Grahame-Smith screenplay seems unable to sit down and decide what kind of film it wants to be. It seems to stumble from scene to scene shifting from violence to comedy. Upon awaking after 200 years Barnabas violently kills five people only to quickly follow it with a joke about the Mac Donald's. It's all a bit surreal and has the film continues you try to figure out who this film could possibly have been made for. It's too violent for children but to childish for adults. Dialogue scenes have the feel of a soap or melodrama but all this does is add a jarring sense to what is unfolding on screen. It is hard to believe that there is only two credited screen writers has it feels like the work of several different people.The members of the Collins family themselves are each poorly crafted. Each character is introduced only to be dropped shortly after. Johnny lee Miller and Chloe Moretz are reduced to walk on parts for most of the running time. Michelle Pfeiffer fares a little better but isn't given much to do for all the screen time she gets. The less side about Bella Heathcote the better. Her performance is fine but after she is introduced you get the feeling that most of her performance ended up on the cutting room floor. She is supposedly the love of Barnabas's life but she spends very little screen time with him. This only takes away any emotion from the climax because despite what is said throughout these two characters feel like complete strangers. All that leaves is the two stars of the show, Johnny Depp is his usual watchable self and he does well to keep his character likable given all the unlikable things he is asked to do. Eva Green is over the top and incredible psychotic has the lethal witch who refuses to accept the Barnabus will ever love her.The film is not without its positives. The look is fantastic and the attention to detail for the 70's setting is inspired. The texture of the decade is captured perfectly and it acts as a perfect counterpoint to Barnabus 18th century lifestyle. The soundtrack is outstanding with songs from T-Rex, the Moody Blues, Elton John and Alice Copper who makes a brief cameo in the picture. There is some humor to be had thought out and it's nice that the fish out of water scenario isn't used solely has a punch line unlike another big summer release Men in Black 3.Technically the film is top notch, it looks great it sounds great but most viewers won't feel too great after watching it. A botched and strange misfire from Tim Burton that is almost fascinating in how much of a mess it is. It is guaranteed to be unlike any other big summer release you have seen in a long time, it's just a shame that the end product never quite becomes what it could have been. By the time the 3rd act showdown kicks into gear viewers will be left cold by what's unfolding in front of them. What you a left with is a handsome looking imaginative misfire that will quickly be forgotten by all but the hard core Burton fans.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Better than expected! A fun ride for Dark Shadows fans.,"I stalled on seeing this movie because I hated the trailer. It seemed to suggest that it was going to be completely different than the TV show, farcical, and twist on the Barnabas character. I hated the way Johnny Depp presented in the trailer and thought it in no way equaled the original Barnabas character. I expected to be bored and disappointed. Surprise! It was a fun, yet dark and fast paced and quirky movie that entertained, while bringing back memories of an endearing TV series that was loved by many. Johnny Depp was far better in the leading role than the trailer suggested and it wasn't totally all camp, although being a Burton film, it had it's moments. The story, while remaining largely in shallow waters (how much depth can you cram into one movie storyline?), did spin a plausible tale of Barnabas history and existence. I would have liked to have seen more about the storyline between Josette and Barnabas, and also why Angelique was spurned. I would definitely return to see more episodes of this tale (as we once returned to view more and more episodes of the TV series). From beginning to end, this movie was entertaining, fun, mysterious and kept a fast pace to keep you interested throughout. I recommend it for a fun movie night although, I'm not sure young children should be viewing it as it does have dark and bloody moments which could be frightening and too much for young children to be exposed to.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Plodding, boring and nothing new from Burton.","'Burton-esque' (bert-on-esk) adj. by-word in movie circles for being artistically quirky yet sumptuous, darkly comical, beautifully bizarre; usually unlike anything you've seen before. Ironically, it's been some time since Tim Burton has actually been Burton-esque, and his latest, Dark Shadows, is another plodding, repetitive entry into the Gothic director's canon. His unique taste in visuals is omnipresent, but there's just nothing new on offer; the set dressing – dauntingly big houses, ominous furniture – is strangely boring and the costumes are drearily typical. Perhaps the film's principal weakness – if not the utterly ludicrous finale – is his determination to employ the same actors he always collaborates with. Johnny Depp has stretched his idiosyncratic persona too thin and Helena Bonham Carter's bonkers-by-numbers shtick can only stay amusing for so long.

It's almost as if there was a great idea for a plot and then everyone got caught up in the costumes, scenery and witty comments, leaving the plot to evolve through the scenes. I was bored about a fourth of the way in. The scenes where there were implied sexual encounters were pointless. I still don't understand being half in with sex. Either put it in and it's an adult movie and we can enjoy it, or leave it out. It doesn't work when it's half done. It's not cute or amusing.

No offense to anyone, the film can still be very enjoyable regardless of how awesome the original series was/is.There is a lot of obvious jokes, ha-ha funny stuff, but there is a lot in the dialog especially, that is understated and really funny. The acting was excellent from all sides, even the actress who plays the witch (I do not know her name, nor do I care to look it up...) was descent. Depp and the rest were great. One performance that didn't see a lot of dialog but was perfect was the sleazy brother (the father of the boy). The plot was hilarious and engaging. It was predictable on purpose. I wished that it was soapier, I guess, which would have been funnier. I think HBC's character was perfect, and the end was predictable, but oh so wonderfully promising. In fact, if it weren't the way it was, I would have been disappointed. Depp played something other than metrosexual pirate, which was perfect. The bad plot points were perfectly engineered to increase the soap opera effect, and I think served that purpose very well.All in all, it was a hilarious romp, a soapy vampire farce that I really enjoyed.

Tim Burton shouldn't be an A-Lister anymore.....,"Johnny Depp's only mistake was making so many Pirates of the Caribbean films for - in each film he has done since - a little Captain Jack Sparrow appears. 'Dark Shadows' is no exception. For the most part Depp's portrayal as a vampire is brilliantly dark and it's nice to see a vampire film where the vampire hangs upside down, tears people apart, drinks copious amounts of blood and, more importantly, doesn't sparkle in the sunlight. The only problem with Depp's portrayal comes when the comedy comes into it - he then slips into a crossbreed character of a nasty vampire and a drunken Captain Jack. Not the worst of things, though, and he is still the best part of this film.With regards to the film itself.... oh dear. It started off with a cracking intro giving us the backstory of the family's curse (nothing you haven't seen in the trailer) and it even had traces of Tim Burton's (recently lacking) brilliance too. Sadly, it even got my hopes up.As the film went on - it went from plot-point to plot-point with little effort, the rest of the characters were hardly explored and seemed more one dimensional compared to Depp's own character - clearly given priority by the writer. Occasionally some nice humour was thrown into the mix (the advert hints at it being a comedy, it's not.... there are some dark, comic moments though) but my heart sank further (along with my respect of Tim Burton for allowing it) when they had a party in the mansion. I agree with the other review stating it was like a set-piece direct from Austin Powers. Worse was to come when the special appearance of Alice Cooper came in, for he was the parties rock group..... Really.... was the entirely necessary? Throwing someone in, such as Alice Cooper, just made the whole experience feel that little more cheesy and cheap.Was the film entertaining? It was so-so. Just a further reminder that Tim Burton has either lost his touch or doesn't care now - instead relying on the pull of Depp. For let's be honest, at this stage, would a Burton film make as much money nowadays if it didn't have Depp in it? I fear he's losing his crowd.... I fear more that Burton could end up taking Depp down with him.As for Helena Bonham Carter - again, she wasn't needed. If anything, her small role was probably just a token gesture to her, from her husband. She acted as though her heart weren't in it.... probably felt some jealousy towards Eva Green who played the evil witch (quite well but, again, her character wasn't really explored so - like other characters - it was hard to really care one way or the other about her).So - a typical Burton film.... giving roles to his friends (Danny Elfman on music duties again) and his wife (quieter life at home and more cash for the couple, I guess)... to think - this man used to be a genius (Scissorhands, Beetlejuice)....",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"A Difficult But Successful Mix of Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Horror","13 May 2012. It's never easy and usually impossible to direct a good fusion of comedy, drama, horror, but Tim Burton successfully handles the task with this edgy but delightful black comedy that keeps the integrity of the vampire myth while acknowledging the current cultural influence of contemporary novels and television series' role of horror characters in society. There are elements from Practical Magic (1998) and Death Becomes Her (1992) along with same uneasy mix of oil and water as the comedy is interspersed with darker, suggestive bloody horror, and even Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) in their physical interplay together. In a way, Tim Burton has been able to transform these darker elements placing them into the light of day, transform the more acceptable animated horror that is soften by its more unreal forms of cartoon images such as Coraline (2009) into a idealistic live action romance drama, that heightens the good and evil elements that underlie our own realities in everyday living.Tim Burton has deliciously and perhaps deliberately created a set design and directorial, script presentation that slightly hyper-exaggerates the original Dark Shadows television melodrama (1966-71) and pays tribute to its more low-budget elements all the while keeping the quality of a full feature film experience. There were some consistently funny out of time ironic scenes, there were some emotionally penetrating scenes, and there was pushing the limits of edgy horror, yet with all the entertainment power at Mr. Burton's disposal.The everyday ethical dilemma of sexual relationships are on brilliant display in this morning, love spurned, love lost, love found and even the major characters are never stereotyped and have sufficient depth to elevate this movie into a more multi-dimensional experience those those willing to accept the penetrating look at our own foibles. The core theme of eternal love and eternal hatred are strongly integrated into this movie making it a solid foundation on which Burton is able to extend Johnny Depp's reach creating an inspiring and haunting, love story around one of the most famous mythical character's of our times and in a major way is more true to the power of love as powerfully shown in Dracula (1992) at the beginning of the movie but unlike Dracula (1992) which transforms this love into something corrupted by the end of the movie (a masculine form of jealousy), Dark Shadows (2012) stays true to the more resonate message of the vampire myth (a feminine form of idealistic romance).In many ways, this movie represents the continuing advancement of the craft of film-making and follows in the recent footsteps of other benchmark films such as the comedy-drama All Above Steve (2009), darker animated fantasy of Coraline (2009), screwball comedy of Ghost Town (2008), the underplayed but more subtle humor of Get Smart (2008), and more adult contemporary child adventure of Super 8(2011) and another darker comedy with Adam Sandler in Funny People(2009).",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
True Fans of the Original Series will be disappointed,"Watched this at the theater today. I'm not jumping up and down raving about it. My brother and I took our kids and our parents to see it for Mothers Day and I'm apparently the only member of the family that didn't like it.Dark Shadows was originally a black and white soap opera that ran from 1966 - 1971. It was the forerunner for future ideas like Twilight. It was the first series to introduce Vampires, Ghosts, Werewolves, etc.Being that Dark Shadows was intended as a Gothic drama, it seemed out of place since the movie attempted to portray the prequel to the series. Depp is popular for quirky, comedic roles, but I didn't feel it meshed well. That may be only because I've seen and enjoyed the original series, though.The comedy bits were just that -- bits -- and unfortunately that didn't play well on the big screen. It almost seemed as if the makers of the movie couldn't decide whether to make a comedy or stay true to the drama.Fans of the original series will most likely not appreciate this attempt, unless they are Johnny Depp fans. Hopefully, there won't be a sequel. To do so would only serve to finish trashing the legacy of the 1966 series.On an objective note, it's a good family movie. If you know nothing about the original series, then you'd have no expectations and the movie would probably be better received. But, don't look for it to spend time on the subjects of vampires, ghosts, and werewolves. Except for the supernatural powers exhibited by the ""good"" and ""evil"" characters, you'd almost forget that it was about a vampire.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"What an enjoyable ""romp"" this film was!!","I thoroughly enjoyed myself watching this film! Is it cinematic genius? Maybe not in the eyes of most - but when I can laugh out loud many times and forget about the troubles of the day for 90 minutes - then I say- a job well done, Tim Burton!!! In an era in filmmaking and TV where we are all kinda OD'd on vampires - Burton kinda pokes fun at the genre and I LOVE it! Also, if you are a child of the 70's then this is a must see! The music (songs) are fabulous and there are so many ""kitschy"" 70's things thrown in that I may have to watch it again as I'm sure I've missed some. Operation game, lava lamp (particularly funny), ""Tiny songstress"" (Karen Carpenter on the TV)!!!!!Oh- and the percussion organ! Priceless stuff! Depp was delightful in this! I loved him! And Michelle Pfeiffer as well. Really the only character I had a problem with was the witch Angela but that was mostly because her scenes were sometimes bordering on the ridiculous. The ""sex scene"" was pretty lame - you won't lose much by fast-forwarding through it. Yes the plot is somewhat predictable but who cares? I loved this movie! Tim Burton is the one guy that can throw in enough weirdness and fun and macabre all into one glorious melting pot -and brew up something wonderful! If you want a fun, lighthearted movie - I recommend Dark Shadows!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Chix Chat on Film Review: Some time spent with a vamp.,"When I originally saw the trailer for Dark Shadows, my first thought was why would Tim Burton remake this classic supernatural television series drama about a tormented vampire named Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) into a comedy? My second thought was this is going to suck, no pun intended. Turns out it wasn't really a comedy as much as it was a comedic take on the Barnabas situation. It was actually fairly masterfully done keeping the tone of the film balanced between comedy and creepy, although the funniest comedic dialogue was in the trailer. I was pretty young when the series aired on television, but I did recognize the names of most of the characters and their demeanors, so the film did stay pretty much true to the Elizabeth Collins (Michele Pfeiffer) persona of a cold and calculating woman putting her own interests first. I don't recall much about her daughter Carolyn Stoddard (Chloe Grace Moretz), but I was more fascinated by Ms. Moretz than her role. Did I miss the time warp memo? First of all wasn't she like ten in Hugo and wasn't that just last year and now she's fifteen. Speaking of a time warp, how is it that Alice Cooper looked just as old in 1972 as he does today? And for comedy sake the Alice Cooper being a woman joke is just old, as is the balls joke, and now I just feel like I'm ranting. So here's the thing, I wanted to see a wildly original film that would be fun and memorable, and it just didn't turn out that way. There were the obvious Beetlejuice moments, and there were moments that the story was so stalled that I almost dozed off. I will say though that the recreation of 1972 was pretty cool, as an eleven year old I found the psychedelic age fascinating and hearing the Curtis Mayfield Superfly soundtrack as a backdrop to that film with the name prominently displayed on the small town movie marquee totally took me back. Unfortunately, that same type of fond memory was not the end result from viewing Dark Shadows, even with Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer leading the cast, it just fell short. Angelique (Eva Green) was supposed to be a super villain and I found nothing about her or her vendetta to be at all interesting, the most interesting character was Willie (Jackie Earle Haley), whose apathy was probably what I could relate to most, with that I give this film an amber light, only because of my Superfly moment.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"""Ugliest woman I've ever seen""","After centuries of captivity, Barnabas Collins, a vampire, returns home to Collinsport to regain his cursed family's glory. The film is based on the series of the same name from the 1960s, replacing the more serious and darker tone of the original with typically Barton's humor and fairy-tale atmosphere. Vampires, werewolves, witches, and ghosts are never outdated, especially not when played by Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Eva Green, Jackie Earle Haley, and Chloë Grace Moretz, with cameo appearances by Christopher Lee and Alice Cooper.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Problems in all departments...,"First off, it is important to mention that I am an original Dark Shadows fan. After seeing the first preview, I realized that this was going to be more comedy than drama and not likely true to the original. OK. Reluctantly, I can accept the change of tone since I like Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. So maybe it will be a good Tim Burton movie regardless of the changes. It wasn't. First off-it was sloooooow (up until the last 15 minutes). I like good exposition, but it seemed pointless and uninvolving. Secondly, the story jumped around all over the place. No real build to anything. I don't want to give any spoilers (as if there are some to give), but the guest star was more of a side track and of no real importance to the plot at all. It was filler as was most of the movie. You would think that out of a thousand episodes of the original show they could have put together a decent story. I really wanted to like it. I tried to find a few golden moments, but there really weren't any. It just felt like a mess. I give it 3 stars only because I did like Johnny Depp's performance and most of the actors seemed well cast. In addition, I want Tim Burton to keep making movies (just not ones like this). Nice try. Getting a better script would have helped.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
I Just Don't Feel It Tim...,"When I first heard that Tim Burton would be directing 'Dark Shadows' I distinctly remember quite literally punching the air in delight! When the cast was announced for this film I was excited, finally a good vampire film and a good cast! Unfortunately 'Dark Shadows' lacks the 'oomph' that I thought Burton would surely provide...It gets off to a bad start with the film instantly jumping into the action, barely leaving any time for the development of the characters. This I believe is what lets 'Dark Shadows' down the most. The cast was impressive but some of the people who I most was looking forward to seeing (Chloë Grace Moretz, Helena Bonham Carter & Michelle Pfieffer) were severely underused! The film focused mainly on Johnny Depp and Eva Green's characters and their story lines instead of developing the other characters back stories! This ends up leaving the viewer bored and restless, waiting for the plot to thicken or the characters to actually do something.While the film had a lot of downs it did also have its ups! Green did a magnificent job of portraying 'Angelique Bouchard' the cold, broken hearted witch with a bone to pick with Barnabas Collins (Depp). Pfieffer was excellent and was one of the strongest actors in 'Dark Shadows'. She managed to gel the cast together and provided a sense of humour and realism. Depp was a big let down, he could have done so much more with his character (Barnabas Collins) but unfortunately he just comes across as wooden. I had high hopes for Moretz - our latest rising star - but she just doesn't get enough screen time...Overall 'Dark Shadows' was average. With barely any character development you feel as if there needed to be more to the story. There were a few shining stars and funny moments but I expected far better from Tim Burton... Better luck next time maybe?",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

What a Disappointment!,"Rather than 'how do I love thee', let's play 'how do I loathe thee'. This movie could have been so entertaining could have been a real tongue in cheek, hilarious take-off of Dark Shadows. I had anticipated such. Instead, it was witless, pointless, and worthless. Tim Burton obviously couldn't determine whether to go for funny or scary and as a result, it was neither. The premise of a movie was there, but it was pretty much there – and gone to the point of being invisible. The characters were without form and substance (in fact, all the female characters could well have been interchangeable, they were so look-alike and blah), the action rather meaningless. I'm thinking the team of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp had best go back to square one and start over again because once upon a time that combination was sure to result in something wonderful. That expectation was dashed and done in here. I almost dozed off several times and by the end of the film was rather disappointed that I hadn't allowed myself to do just that. At least I would have felt I'd gained some refreshing sleep from my time rather than ending up with a couple of wasted hours.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
My Expectations Were Blown Away,"I don't believe we ever had a movie quite like this one, it really means a lot to me and I am giving it a very decent score from my perspective. The imagery is fantastic. From the costume design to the set design. There is a definitely a dark shadow persona hanging over.I have to talk about the way it begins on the train. I was not expecting that from what I had thought would be a childish vampire movie. When Nights In White Satin kicked in I was blown away. That was the setup for the entire movie for me, it hooked me right into the drama. As it turns out, that train scene was a nod to the original creator of the television series who said, his inspiration was a dream he had in 1965 about a ""mysterious young woman on a train"". That is amazing.Some fans were expecting gore and violence and special effects. I have to say the use of CGI special effects on this film was minimal. This was not another vampire film. This turned out to be a drama about a time period set in the 1970's, based on the original ABC series Dark Shadows that ran from 1965-1971.For example, did you know that many of the cast of the original TV series starred in this, and some right before they passed away which makes this film special. Including David Shelby (Quentin), Lara Parker (Angelique), Victoria Winters (Governess), and Johnathan Frid (Barnabas). They got to see a modern interpretation of a quirky television show. This film was just as quirky and odd, and with an amazing soundtrack to boot.Over the vail of darkness there was a humorous touch, so really this was a comedy-drama in the best of examples. I have nothing but great things to say about this release. I wasn't expecting horror and guts, and wasn't expecting an Oscar award winning performance either because it was not supposed to be serious. Comedies have never been treated all too well by the critics. I think this was an amazing tribute to the show.Johnny Depp is also known for being a perfectionist. I was told he watched almost every episode of the series to nail the part of Barnabas. I find that admirable that they were able to recreate the characters for the big screen.If I had to pick one fault, it would be that I wish the end had gone on for even longer. They never made a sequel and maybe it's best they didn't. I know this film had a big impact on younger viewers who had never watched the show or heard the music. I know it did on me and will never forget it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Not terrible... not all that great either,"Just got back from seeing this film and was highly disappointed. As an avid fan of Burton, Depp and Bonham Carter, I had high expectations for this film. Despite the unfavourable reviews, I refused to believe that Dark Shadows would be a bad film... while I wasn't entirely wrong, I wasn't completely right.I haven't seen any of the original series, so I don't know how faithful it is (although the general consensus is that it's a rough re-imagining rather than a new adaptation), but I was unimpressed with what I saw.The movie had a weak opening, crammed with confusing history and topped with a dull, unimaginative opening title sequence. I kept expecting and hoping it to pick up pace and for the quality to improve, but sadly, it just didn't. The bulk of the film is a boring look at a dysfunctional family with a Gothic twist, and the whole fish-out-of-water premise quickly runs thin. The family in question is full of quirky, Burton- esque characters, but none are particularly engaging enough to make you care about what happens to them. The film's third act is a considerable step-up in the excitement levels, yet some unnecessary plot twists leave a foul taste, failing to save the film from ending up a muddled mess. There are a few genuinely creepy moments, and there's no doubt that several scenes will garner a laugh or two, but there's nothing wholly original or inspired on show here. The movie doesn't quite know what to do with itself; it's not quite a comedy, not quite a horror, not quite enough to be a horror-comedy. A lot of the story lines could and should have been left out, while most of the cast have little to do; there are far too many characters that are there purely for show. On top of this, a lot of the movie is just so weird and confusing that it is difficult to see why Burton made the choices he did - for people who are unfamiliar with the original series (probably most of modern audiences) a lot of the film would seem pointless and out of place.Johnny Depp has his moments as the dark hero (in fact, hero seems the wrong word; his character spends a vast majority of the movie slaughtering innocents. Yes, he is a vampire, and it's in his nature, but true vampires are not screen heroes, despite what modern society has spoon-fed us), but his performance is nothing we haven't seen from him before. There are some silver lining performances from the always- excellent Chloe Moretz, Jackie Earle Haley and HBC, but the majority of the cast (namely Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Lee Miller and co) seem to be on autopilot. Eva Green is beautiful and serviceable as the film's villain, while Bella Heathcote is awful and grossly miscast in her large role. There are also some awesome cameos from Alice Cooper and Christopher Lee. Aside from the huge amount of focus on Depp's Barnabus Collins and Green's Angelique Bouchard, the characterisation isn't great (although the pair share decent on-screen chemistry).The direction is off-kilter, and I expected a lot more from Burton - it doesn't seem as if Tim Burton is directing as much as it seemed like it was another director trying to be Tim Burton. Danny Elfman's score is good, but takes a back seat to the great 70s soundtrack. A huge redeeming quality of the picture is that it looks gorgeous, thanks to great set production, costume design and cinematography. Lastly, the film's marketing campaign does it no favours - advertised as a family movie, the finished picture is surprisingly adult, crammed with a lot of innuendos, shocking jokes about teenage masturbation, a rampant love scene between Depp and Green, a lot of implied fellatio and surprisingly graphic violence. This is not one for the little ones.All in all, I give the film 4/10. Dark Shadows is a perfectly serviceable flick, but gets weighed down by a lengthy running time, not enough action, horror or comedy to be classed as any genre, and an overall sense of mediocrity. It has its moments, but I'd expect a lot more from everybody involved. Watching this movie begs the question: ""what the hell was Burton thinking?"". It's not bad by any means, but by realistic standards, it is nothing more than a geek-out from Burton and Depp that leaves little to be enjoyed by the general movie-going audience. A damn shame.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Get over yourselves people, it's a perfectly watchable spoof that unfortunately misses the mark...","The cast is stellar, and I would genuinely watch most of them read a phone-book - However in this case, they've gone for a weird mishmash of slapstick, dark humour and Rocky Horror-level pastiche played by excellent actors having fun with underdeveloped characters and some dreadful lines.A great movie for a hangover with take out.There's some stunning cinematography, and I genuinely enjoyed how much Johnny Depp was enjoying hamming it up, but it was a shame to see some potentially great (female primarily) roles not given the depth the actors deserved.There are a lot of jokes both visual and one-liners, but few if any proper laughs - the climax was predictable and probably the weakest part of the movie to be honest, although I was lightly touched by the declaration of love scene.

In Defence of the Dark,"Having just read page after page of negative reviews, I thought it necessary to add this -DARK SHADOWS IS A LOT OF FUN!It's a campy, affectionate adaptation of a hammy horror soap from the 1970's. Granted, Johnny Depp is not Jonathan Frid, and the script never even attempts to give him that role. His Barnabbas is not the tortured monster of Dan Curtis' series, but a fish-out-of-water 18th century dude having trouble coping with 70's grooviness. Fans of the TV show may consider this a cop-out, but there's still a lot to enjoy.The supporting cast is uniformly fun - from Michelle Pfeiffer pulling faces at the camera to Johnny Lee Miller as the stuffy, twitchy Roger. The romance between Vicky & Barnabbas is hardly present in the film, but that's because Eva Green dominates as Angeline - and she's absolutely terrific as a demented, lovestruck witch.I think a big part of the issue people have with this film is that they were expecting a bit more darkness and a lot less froth from Burton. So try this - pretend you are going to see ""Robert Zemeckis' Dark Shadows"" instead. It'll give you a better idea of what to expect and if you just let go of your preconceptions you'll find yourself giggling through this as much as I did.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Mismatched Direction/Scripting/Vision,"IMO, this was not a good vehicle for Burton. I have to believe if Johnny Depp is a DS fan, he knows this did not hit the mark.Burton (nor Grahame-Smith and August) did not seem to understand Dark Shadows or the characters and, the result was confused, disjointed, and overall quite disappointing.Burton seems to have envisioned Barnabas as a 'sexier' Beetlejuice with fangs and treated the storyline, such as it was, as an inconvenient necessity. Not even Shakespeare could deliver a good script working with that.I think Robert Zemeckis (Death Becomes Her) or even Barry Sonnenfeld (Adams Family) or Brad Silberling (Casper) could have done much better. Fortunately, we spent the next few days absorbed in an original DS marathon to clear our minds of the unpleasant experience.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Predictable and dull but still watchable,"Johnny Depp playing a vampire in that takes place in the 70's seems like a cool idea. And I gotta admit when I saw the trailer to this movie I wasn't super excited or anything like that but thought it just might have potential. But this isn't anything special and is a flick that is easily forgettable. It starts out alright with the intro and all but soon gets dull afterwards. Now Depp is pretty good with his role as a vampire that got locked up for almost 200 yrs to wake up in the 70's. In fact it's a role that he suggested to Tim Burton, well him wanting to play a vampire at least. Even if you didn't know this is a Tim Burton movie, you can pretty much tell right off the bat. Although a lot of his movie are like this, but this story direction that has Tim Burton all over it gets tiresome. The style of it is alright, but there is almost no development when it comes to a lot of the characters. Now I am not really a big Tim Burton fan or anything like that but it seems he just focused putting way too much of his style into this movie. With Gothic elements and stuff that the focus didn't seem to have gone much when it came to the script. The quirky humor sometimes works but it just seemed forced sometimes. Cause most of the humor in this movie comes from Barnabas Collins(Johnny Depp) not necessarily being able to live through almost 200 yrs from being locked up and times have really changed for him. Thus most of the humor comes from his fascination and how he perceives certain things that are in the 70's. Even the set pieces and background didn't entirely seem all that 70's as well besides hippies, lava lamp, a certain singer and such. The idea seems decent for this flick but when it comes down to it all, there really isn't anything original about this and just about everything is pretty much predictable. It's watchable but still a forgetful film. Also some critics seem to bash on Eva Green's performance saying it's too over the top. But it worked for this movie since it made the scenes she is in less dull.5.6/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Tim Burton + Johnny Depp = ( Always good minus dark shadows ),"I cried after seeing this movie, not because i was moved, but because i could not believe that Tim Burton and Johnny depp have delivered this. I cried because i have seen Edward scissorhands, sweeney Todd, corpse bride, sleepy hollow and others.Dark Shadows is not a bad movie, but there is not much in this movie to really get you excited. Johnny Depp is brilliant as he always is, but there wasn't much for him to play around in this one. very plain story line, lame dialogs( for most part) and not many ( or none rather ) twists, it was more like watching an episode of those ever running daily soaps.the movie can be watched only for Johnny's charm but not much else. It is not a bad movie if you don;t expect anything from it, but to not expect anything from Burton-Johnny combo is a blasphemy.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
What a time to be alive,"I missed a Tim Burton / Johnny Depp movie probably because of the birth of our first born in the year of release. What a time to pick this up, while the Amber Heard / Johnny Depp case is allover, I watch this movie where an immortal Johnny Depp is stalked by a witch who's love is not returned. Priceless, but let's not get into that. I enjoyed the obvious Burton signatures and also was stunned at how ""90's"" this movie was. In many ways it also reminded me of the charm of some of the messy Dario Argento flicks. Lush and sparse at the same time. I choose it to be a feature not a bug, cause I really enjoyed this movie. There's also some funny/unfunny jokes that are also reminiscent of stupid 90's comedies they just don't make anymore. High five Timbo!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A disappointing entry into the Burton filmography,"Based on an obscure black and white TV serial that few have ever heard of, Tim Burton's latest has it's work cut out finding an audience.However, teamed with his regular acting team of Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp, adding Michelle Pffeifer and Eva Green for good measure, we should be in for another Gothic treat.In 1776 Barnabas Collins (Depp) is an aristocratic young son of the immigrant Liverpudlian self made wealthy family who owns and manages a large fishing and cannery business. The family lends it's name to Collinwood, the town they created on the eastern seaboard of America, the town and business continue to prosper and all is well.Barnabas, spurning the advances of his maid Angelica Bouchard (Eva Green), courts his one true love Josette duPres (Heathcote). Angelica does not take this well and being a secret Witch, has more tools at her disposal than most. Sending Josette to her hypnotized death off ""Widows Peak"", closely followed by a heartbroken and distraught Barnabas.Unfortunately for Barnabas, death is insufficient suffering to visit upon him and transformed into a Vampire, he must stay buried for two hundred years to endure his pain. These are not spoilers as most of these events occur in a lengthy prologue.Mistakenly and tragically unearthed, Barnabas returns to regain his lost life and is pitched into the massively dysfunctional Collinwood manor house, where time has not been kind to the firm and his rather hopeless descendants.Cue lots of 1070's jokes with Barnabas speaking as a 1800's gentleman, set against the ""Peace out"" man Hippy trip of the times. ""How soon can the horses be ready?"" he asks, only to be told they have a Chevy or marvelling at the TV, ""Reveal yourself tiny songstress"".Back at the manor we have matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Pfeiffer) attempting to pull the family together and through tough times. Roger Collins (Johnny Miller), drinker lover and general layabout, together with his ""delightful"" children, sullen Caroly teenager (Chloe Grace Moretz) and morose and distinctly disturbed David (McGrath). Helping David through his childhood traumas following his mothers ""death at sea"", is Dr Hoffman (Bonham-Carter) who spends more time holding a bottle than sitting by the counseling couch.Just prior to the arrival of a be-fanged Barnabas, is a new waif like governess by the name of Victoria (Heathcote), who appears remarkably similar to the lost love of Barnabas. This does not go unnoticed by the rival business entrepreneur, the very old but unchanged Bouchard, whose business succeeds as the Collin's diminishes.We are all set for either a rousing comedy or dramatic piece with Burton's usual directorial flourishes and Danny Elfman score. Unfortunately, the film never real takes off, presenting a mish-mash of tone and set pieces that do not come together as an enjoyable whole.The acting is good, no-one really disappoints and the CGI effects are first rate but the film lacks any real structure to pull all the elements together. There are times where the action is rather boring and emotionally, it is difficult to care for any of the characters, neither statements normally associated with Burton.The film builds to a frenetic denouement where Burton, perhaps in a last ditch effort to save the film, throws everything at the screen, including bizarrely Alice Cooper. With similarities to ""Death Becomes her"" and ""Addams Family"", the film descends into almost horror lite, seemingly largely disconnected to what has come before.The project appears very self indulgent, pushing ahead with subject matter and story that Burton wanted to see on screen, without perhaps knowing or even caring whether an audience existed. Alternatively, Burton has moulded the original quirky story into something hopefully more commercial, robbing the source material of it's charm. Either way, vanity projects are dangerous investments when they cost $150 million to make, audiences responded with a mediocre $238 Million worldwide.SummaryA Gothic comedy/dramatic film with a great cast and effects, let down by an obscure story that largely fails to engage the audience.A disappointing entry into the Burton filmography, could and hopefully will do better next time.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Magnificent Movie with Great story telling,"First of all let me say this movie wouldn't be as good if it wasn't for Johnny depp , his acting in this movie is one of his best,
aside from that the mixture of dark humor and fantasy works great here , also a great directing
Only problem I had with it was the underdeveloped character which her name is Victoria but still it's not that big of a problem
9.7/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Depp Supports This Wacky Film,"I think a good part of the reason this movie is rated so low is because of the devoted fans of the soap opera and previous pictures who truly enjoy Dark Shadows for the idiotic nonsense that it is(probably without recognizing that) and are disappointed and perhaps even offended by the lampooning rendition, heavily glossed with his style, that Tim Burton gave it. However, the majority of audiences will probably find it better off that way.The film is ridiculously wacky and while aspects of the source material bleed through at times it mostly feels like an eccentric Burton comedy. And mainly carried by Johnny Depp. He manages to walk that careful line of playing this role a little crazy and yet straight-even in that bizarre makeup-delivering every ludicrous line with enough sincerity to make it sound genuine.While still a pretty flawed film, Dark Shadows takes a lousy foundation and constructs something that's at least alright.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
At least it looks good...,"I love the way Tim Burton's films look. He is undeniably a master of concept and dark designs. Just look at the sets and costumes of Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sleepy Hollow The list is almost as long as his list of films as a director. His set builders construct vast, intricate worlds that dominate studio lots, his costumers dress the actors in exquisite creations and the geniuses holding the makeup palettes sculpt hideous beauty that draws the viewers eyes.However, beautiful sets and exquisite make-up do not compensate for poor direction and shoddy films and yet again I find myself starting a review with a defence of Burton with ""Well, it looks good "" I really wanted to embrace Dark Shadows and emerge from Cineworld proclaiming ""Burton is back!"" I really want to say that after a chronic dip in form since 1994's largely unappreciated but almost flawless Ed Wood, Burton has returned to the screen to fulfill the promise he showed with the heart-warming Edward Scissorhands and the anarchic comedy of Beetlejuice two years earlier. I want to but, as you'll have worked out by now, I can't.Yes, in 2003 he brought us Big Fish. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have watched it a couple of times in the past year alone, but it isn't a 'great' and it doesn't hit the heights of his best work. And it certainly isn't compensation enough for Planet of the Apes or Alice in Wonderland! So what of Dark Shadows? It should work; it has great pedigree, the source is a quirky (cult, if you will) soap opera of days gone by, the cast is a cocktail of Burton stalwarts (Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter), new-to-the-fold stars (Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Lee Miller, Eva Green, Chloë Grace Moretz) and barely known stars-in-the-making (Gulliver McGrath & Christopher Lee ☺) and even the plot is an engaging spin on a familiar idea.In the late 1700s, wealthy landowner Barnabas Collins (Depp) makes the grave error of resisting the advances of his maid Angelique (a delicious performance from Eva Green) who just happens to be a witch. She transforms him into a vampire and buries him alive. Two hundred years later workmen unearth his coffin and release him, whereupon Barnabas drinks their blood and returns home to find his penniless descendants camped out, suffering, embittered and unaware that the cause of their misfortune, Angelique, is also two hundred years old and that they've been sitting on a fortune locked in hidden vaults all these years.What follows is a fish-out-of-water tale of resurgence, revenge, unrequited love, death, blood and a tired, embarrassing, pointless, gimmicky appearance from Alice Cooper. It has all the ingredients to make an amazing black forest gateau but somewhere along the line someone has attempted to make a sausage with it and ended up with a mess that won't even enhance the compost heap.Cooper aside, there isn't really a duff performance. Depp is as controlled and delightfully off-kilter as ever, Pfeiffer engages as the matriarch, Bonham Carter reigns in her OTT tendencies to give a sad, sexual performance and Johnny Lee Miller's Roger is just enough of a nob to regard with enjoyable disdain.The inescapable problems are the direction and the hastily cobbled third act that ran out of ideas. The right amount of effort has gone into casting and visuals, but too little has been spent on writing and crafting a film that deserves our attention. The final act could have been written by a committee of performing monkeys with a decent collection of DVDs as a reference point. It flops about weakly in a resolution of sorts that fails to get under the skin, excite, shock or even entertain adequately. The script plods, much of the dialogue is leaden and the overall impression is of a high performance car being driven uphill, backwards and in third gear.Once upon a time, Tim Burton created; he crafted out of virgin clay and exhibited delights that surprised, thrilled and remain strong in our memories and hearts twenty-five years later. Here, he's borrowed, referenced, rehashed and recycled. Dark Shadows is a weak hybrid of The Exorcist and Mars Attacks! with a splicing of Nosferatu. Is Angelique anything more than the witchy sister of Lisa Marie's alien girl from Mars Attacks!? Even the sex scene, which should be hugely entertaining, and maybe a little titillating, is a diluted imitation of Jeff Goldblum's & Emma Thompsons in The Tall Guy.It's a pity. It's a waste of a fine talent and a great idea. But at least it looks good.Another film review from The Squiss.

Dark Shadows,"My sisters and I used to run home from school in order to catch entire episodes of the original ""Dark Shadows"" on TV. I still think that show was the best thing ABC ever aired. Sometimes a prop might fail or an actor might flub a line but they would ad lib or otherwise carry on; regardless. In my mind that cast were true, professional actors.As far as the movie goes- my wife and I enjoyed it. The story respected the original production and added some modern flair. Excellent acting. CGI. And music. Who doesn't like Alice Cooper and OMG The Raspberries top 5 hit?",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Loved the theme,"The quirkiness was a bit overdone in some parts and the narrative wasn't always clear, but this was definitely more enjoyable than how it appeared when advertised. Even friends who aren't big Depp fans found it pleasurable. It's one of my favorite gothic Tim Burton films and I'd watch again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
