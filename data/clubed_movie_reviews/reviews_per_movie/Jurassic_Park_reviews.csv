Such a classic.,"This movie is definitely one to remember. Despite being filmed in the 90s, Jurassic Park continues to be a classic to this day. 
Watching the movie now highlights the contrast between the effects then and the special effects available now. This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film. 
The child actors were especially hilarious to me-the young boy, Timmy, has moments that really capture a reaction that a child in real life would have (""I threw up."" ""Well that's ok! That happens sometimes""-Allen-is one of my favorite quotes). 
Another extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. 
As a classic worldwide, it's no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant,"What can I say? Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated movies ever. Yes, I did say underrated. True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as artistically superior. When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It contains all of Spielberg's magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful camera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flaws of a theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc. and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I've seen with great acting by children. Spielberg's camera usage ranges from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composed scenes of the dinosaurs' ""interaction"" with the characters. Aside from technical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-revering nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one of the first movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaurs is wonderfully developed. And, best of all, like star wars you can analyze the movie all you want or just sit back and enjoy the ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Movie to define a Generation.,"If you were born in the 90s or before, you had a connection with people...you absolutely loved this movie, and it made a mark on you. I think most people remember when they saw this movie first, because it was that awe inspiring of an experience. I remember that it was the first pg-13 movie I was allowed to watch, and what a way to start my grown up movie experience!!!
Everything in this movie screams adventure, from the opening scene where the jungle leaves rustle, the shot of mysterious sparkling amber, to the landing of the helicopter on a remote rainforest island, the movie sets the tone for the greatest adventure movie ever made. As you hear John Williams glorious theme start to swell, and you see Alan remove his glasses and start to tremble, you know you're about to witness one of the most magical moments ever put on cinema. I can't go into detail on all the incredible scenes, from the T-Rex reveal, to the kitchen scene, but each one of them revolutionized what we thought movie magic could take us. Thank you Spielberg for making this enchanting piece of art for us, an entire generation is indebted to you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Groundbreaking, Heart Stomping, Dino Sized film","In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn't seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn't the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn't even in the top 250. Today, people don't appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90's, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn't understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn't bad, but the third wasn't very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone's life is at stake.The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren't scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.Enjoy",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
incredible movie,"Even though it was adapted from a book, this unique story was destined to become an incredible film. Great casting, decent acting, great special effects, beautiful and perfect score by John Williams, incredible directing. I believe this movie has to be one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Although not entirely true to the book, (though someone should never say a movie is not good because it is not exactly like the book because that really doesn't matter) Steven Spielberg made this story a landmark in special effects and a standard for thriller films to be compared to. It also contains some scenes that are instant classics, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep. I will keep this movie in my list of favorites and classics till the day i die.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A rare breed of film seldom seen anymore: a true masterpiece.,"'Jurassic Park (1993)' is a landmark achievement, in as many ways as possible. While some of the exclusively digital dinosaurs don't hold up quite as well as the rest (despite having been only relatively recently surpassed by their peers - depending on budgetary constraints, of course), there are times when the superb CG almost seamlessly blends with possibly the best practical effects I've ever seen to create phenomenally believable, groundbreaking special-effects that truly are, still to this day, some of the best of their kind. Seriously, both the Raptor rigs and, specifically, the to-scale T-Rex are nothing short of breathtaking. They work so well not only due to the flick's fantastic technical prowess but also thanks to its beautiful blending of its core techniques (those created by clay and those by computer), its legitimate reactions from the compelling characters and its uncanny ability to put the audience right in the middle of it all, making you feel genuine wonder, fear, suspense and elation as if you're really sat alongside these long-extinct creatures. It's difficult to stress just how important the characters are in making it all so utterly believable, as well as so utterly captivating. Each of them feel like fleshed-out people, written to perfection by screenwriters who know how to get information across to the audience in a very organic way. It's almost as entertaining watching these people just converse with one another, discussing the morals of bringing extinct creatures back from the dead, as it is seeing them navigate the survival situation in which they are inevitably placed. It is only because we care so much about all the core players that the suspense sequences work so well, that we are kept on the edge of our seat every time a dinosaur lurks around the corner and that we grip our chairs when they leap for their prey. These scenes are some of the best in cinema, perfectly constructed with restraint and splendour. It's also difficult to describe how affecting even the simple moments can be, the moments in which we are asked to sit back and stare at the mere sight of a dinosaur. These should have dampened with time and yet they haven't, still eliciting the awe they did when they first hit the big-screen. They emulate the imagined magic of seeing one of these animals in real life for the first time. Running underneath all of this are some compelling themes that eagerly invite analysis, with the central debate being a tough and intriguing one. The picture is simply one of the most engaging I've ever seen, one that puts an ear-to-ear smile on your face just because it's so utterly amazing. It balances all of its core tenants impeccably, being a proper 'summer blockbuster' that's incredibly intelligent as well, to the point that every second is just supreme entertainment. It can make you lean forward in your seat or well-up with awe and, in general, have a blast from beginning to end. The movie is, without a doubt, a true masterpiece. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest films ever made.,"I don't know why I loved this movie so much.  Maybe it was the utter amazement when I first saw the Brachiosaurus eat from a tree.  Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors.  It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar.  Whatever it was, it made me write this review.Allan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) are two successful paleontologists who are asked by a rich man John Hammond to come at his park for a major tour.  They agree and are taken to an island where ""Jurassic Park"" logos are everywhere.  The two paleontologists have no idea what they are getting themselves into.  The first dinosaur to make an apearance is the Brachiosaurus, which both of them are extrememly amazed by its giant apearance, and so is the audience.  What the two of them don't know is that there are much more terrifying and carnivorous dinosaurs who are about to escape and run loose....Directed by the mighty Steven Speilberg, Jurassic Park relied on more character development than any other creature-feature.  Usually you get second-rate actors who can't act, getting terrified by monsters that don't really exist.  Jurassic Park was the opposite.  It changed the way we looked at the world, and it will forever.  Based on the novel by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park was an amazing movie.From beginning to end, Jurassic Park bedazzled us with dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs that are EXTINCT.  There are a lot of cool cameos and the stars give great performances.  The whole family should watch this movie.  Not for the glossy title, but because of the dinosaurs.  I remember being a kid when I first watched it, and I remember loving this movie so bad.  The climax was excellent, and I am not saying what happens, unlike the sequel to this film (Jurassic Park 3).  A climax-less bad film, that was.  But this....this was magic.  And yes, it was a masterpiece.The magic of this film is what brought me into dinosaurs, too.  I had a ""Jurassic Park"" marathon today and I watched this movie, and I can still feel the magic.  You will feel the magic too once you see it.  I just have absolutely nothing to say except that Steven Speilberg will put a spell on you.  Even if you don't like creature-features, this movie will entertain you.  Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the ""life will find a way"" speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.Absolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Groundbreaking!,"This was obviously the most sophisticated portrayal of dinosaurs at the time, and it doesn't age a bit.  Sam Neill plays Dr Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is persuaded to check out Richard Attenborough's new theme park, only to find that he has managed to clone dinosaurs.  There is plenty of action, and the dinos look so real as to be positively scary!  Sam Neill puts in his usual incredibly brilliant performance, and you can really believe he is acting with the creatures!  Jeff Goldblum as usual seems to play himself, as Professor Ian Malcolm, an expert in chaos theory who is convinced the park is a bad idea.  The cast are amazing, the effects are amazing, this whole movie is amazing.  It doesn't get any better than this!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"As said, the Definitive blockbuster movie","What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? Who knows. We all know that this has some of the greatest special effects, even today. Also, if there's anything that can match the awesome T-Rex, it's the movie's musical score. I swear, listen to it more than once, and you're bound to see the movie yet again, if for that sole reason. It's that powerful. Oh sure, acting isn't this movie's strong suit, but who looks for acting in a Dinosaur thriller? Who?!Anyway, I think I've made my point.

Dinosaurs are no longer extinct,I recently finished reading the novel and I thought that I would watch and review the film to see how the two compared. I think that the film was paced a lot more evenly. It cut out a lot of the novel's clunky exposition and development. The supporting cast were also great from Wayne Knight as the corrupt Denis Nedry to Samuel L. Jackson as Ray Arnold. The film balanced the scientific and action segments. Never at any point did it feel like one dominated the other. I also much preferred the film's presentation of John Hammond. Now only if the dinosaurs had eaten those annoying as hell kids.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/dM0Llf,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
exciting,"JURASSIC PARK was the film that ignited my interest in filmmaking and drove me to get a degree in it, so I will always have a soft spot for it. I was eleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I never finished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, I decided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast, my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it's premiere. We stood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even as the lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within moments I was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For the next two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as these marvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theater virtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been, and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was a turning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself, ""That's what I want to do."" Sure the characters aren't deep and the dialogue isn't great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actors are good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing (after a slow start) is relentless. The film has a few continuity flaws, but none of them matter. This film is great entertainment.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"With a bazillion other reviews, I'll keep this short.","By now there are nearly a thousand (not really a bazillion) reviews for this Steven Spielberg film. So, in the case of mega-hits where there is a strong consensus that the movie is exceptional (and I don't disagree), what more is there to say?! Apart from a few characters who seemed a bit one-dimensional (which is a minor problem in an action film) and the unwritten Spielberg rule that kids cannot die (taking away much of the suspense), the film is amazing. While the CGI isn't quite as beautiful as what we can do today, it STILL looks awesome. With only a few exceptions, the dinosaurs LOOK real!

Unlike anything the world had ever seen before.,"This movie was released during my childhood while I was already a dinosaur enthusiast. I saw it 2 times at the cinema and as far as I can remember these were the only 2 times I ever saw an audience applaud at the end. It made an big impression. Computer generated images were new at that time and we didn't know what to expect. But I think I can speak for everyone if I say we were blown away. The dinosaurs looked so real. And even in the years after that computer generated images in other movies were just not as good and realistic as in Jurassic Park.Another thing that made this movie is the soundtrack. John Williams (the composer) absolutely nailed it! The music at the arrival to the island combined with the the adventure ahead was just breathtaking.So you have a good story, good actors (I loved Jeff Goldblum for his humor), state of the art special effects and an thrilling adventure. This makes it still my number one of all time and I don't expect that to change anytime soon (or ever).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best dinosaur movie there is; one of the best movies in general,"I first saw this back when I was little. If I remember correctly, it was also a big thing when it came out. I even had a backpack with a Velociraptor head sticking out of it for school. It was such an amazing achievement as a movie itself and the film is so wonderfully done that there's no doubt of why it has held up as long as it has and will remain the best dinosaur film ever created.The dinosaurs in this film look more realistic than any other prehistoric film, or even most movies today that try to pass off crappy CGI has reality. The acting was spectacular, and aside from how wonderful the creatures look and how vicious and exciting they were like no other dinosaur film had had them before, the plot and characters were solid and incredibly entertaining where you didn't think they would be so amusing.I will have to say again that one really huge reason why most people loved this movie was because of the special effects, but here again, isn't that an accomplishment in itself? Having your audience enjoy the film because of how realistic and fresh you are able to make it feel and look? I have never seen another movie with better effects than this one, ever. I am sure none of these horrible effects dinosaur movies that have been coming out lately could ever live up to the greatness of Jurassic Park.I am always going to love Jurassic Park for it's witty, unbelievable maneuvers and incredible screenplay though, as well. It was so properly thought out and executed, where most might have been expecting it to be nothing but high levels of adrenaline rushes with brainless action, which there was pulsating action, it just certainly wasn't as mindless. Many who dislike Jurassic Park really just have all the same reasons the average movie-goer would have for disliking a film, yet I haven't heard anyone fully describe and explain, well, what they truly thought were faults with this film, which gives me reason to believe that Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, for I, myself, have no faults with this film, except that I have seen other films that I enjoyed more. . . just a little more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My favorite Movie,"Steven Spielberg is known for making great movies like, ""E.T."" and ""Schindler's List"". But on June 11 1993.

Also, the acting was good. Sam Neil does a nice job as Alan Grant and Richard Attenborough does a great job as John Hammond. Plus, the theme song was incredible.

A milestone in its time,"The biggest attraction of this film back in 1993, of course, was the realistic computer graphic animation of the dinosaurs by SGI coupled with the realistic sound effects and the good use of suspense built around them both.After I first saw this movie in the theatre 24 years ago, I laid in bed awake for hours, not from fright, but from the lingering excitement of the entire experience. Up to that time, nothing like it had ever been done on that scale. This is hard to remember when, since then, the Discovery Channel came up with the whole ""Walking with ..."" series of documentaries on dinosaurs, early man, and creatures before the dinosaur that use the same techniques that this film did, and thus people have become accustomed to this level of realism in animation both on the small and large screen.Thus with the ""shock value"" of the animation removed, this movie doesn't seem quite as ""5-star"" as it did during its first run. The dialogue, in particular, seems a bit thin now. One aspect of the movie that still impresses me that doesn't get much mention is the outstanding use of sound and sound effects. For example, when the T-Rex first appears in the movie, it is not just the sight of the thing that terrifies, but its tremendous roar. It is still great action adventure viewing for the entire family.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Dazzling spectacle, with the dinosaurs as the scene-stealers","I personally really like Steven Spielberg, and I like his films, especially Schindlers List, Jaws and ET:The Extra Terrestrial. While a tad too long and has one or two loose ends in the plot, Jurassic Park nevertheless has thrilling action and has sheer evidence of the director's vision and effortless verve at work. John Williams's score is absolutely terrific, definitely one of the more memorable scores in a Steven Spielberg movie, the score for Jaws like Psycho is one of the main reason why I am so scared to go into the sea now. The acting is really not bad at all, Sam Neill and Laura Dern have given better performances but they were good. Jeff Goldblum is terrific, and as Dennis Nedry Wayne Knight is suitably more subdued. Richard Attenborough, a talented actor and a even more talented director also is good as John Hammond, while child star Joseph Mazello, who surprised me in Shadowlands is appealing as Tim. However, the real stars are the dinosaurs, especially the T-Rex, the mix of computer animation and models is inspiring. The cinematography is astounding, the script is good and the direction is lively. I haven't read Michael Crichton's book, but regardless this is a hugely enjoyable film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Welcome to Jurassic Park.... Noodles Review,"Look up the word ""awe"" in the dictionary... ya know what you'll find? Jurassic Park. And now in 3D! Usually, I don't really like post- converted 3D in movies, but this one won me over. Ever since I was a little kid, I've always loved Jurassic Park (I think we all did) and I'd always heard that it was one of the best movie theater experiences ever. Unfortunately, I wasn't born when this originally came out so I never got the chance to experience that... until now! And damn, were they right when they said it was an awesome movie theater experience because it sure as hell is. It's so fun, engrossing, and thrilling to watch it on the big screen, with all the sound surrounding you (the sound in Jurassic Park has got to be some of the best sound in a movie ever). Jurassic Park is also one of the most monumental movies of all time. It defined CGI. The CGI and special effects in this movie still holdup today and are even better than most movies today.The story of Jurassic Park is that a really rich guy has cloned dinosaurs to make an amusement park full of living dinosaurs (you would do that if you could too). Because they are these live dinosaurs in the park, his investors say that he needs approval from experts, so he recruits Dr. Alan Grant (a paleontologist who is more or less the protagonist of the movie), Dr. Elli Sattler (a paleobotanist), and Dr. Ian Malcom (a mathematician who's character is pretty much the show stealer). Through a number of circumstances, the dinosaurs get loose and all hell breaks loose. Now, we have our movie being one of the most awe- inspiring movies ever; as well as being one of the most suspenseful movies ever. When the characters first enter Jurassic Park, you see the many dinosaurs in the distance and the theme (one of the greatest movie themes of all time) is playing in the background. Your jaw just drops. And the dinosaurs look awesome. Sometimes they're CGI, sometimes they're animatronic. Sometimes they're amazing... oh wait, that's all the time. One of my favourite scenes is when the T-Rex is attacking the car and a flashlight shines in its eye and the eye dilates. That just shows how detailed and alive these dinos are.But the dinosaurs don't wreak havoc until about halfway, or even 3/4, through the film. Even yet, the movie does a brilliant job of immersing you into it, bringing you onto this island, and getting you to care for the characters. The dialogue and acting are so good that you feel as though you're there with the characters (it drags sometimes but it's easy to get past that). And when they're in peril, you feel as though you're in danger too. I just can't stress how substantial the suspense in Jurassic Park is. The 3D does add to that, too. The 3D in this movie is probably the best post-converted 3D I've ever seen and it works really well.Jurassic Park is really a movie that everyone should experience (notice how I didn't say ""watch""). If you get the chance, see it in theaters and have your mind absolutely blown. The movie is full of awe and imagination; it sometimes makes me feel like a little kid again. The characters are likable; their dialogue is believable and sometimes humorous. The dinosaurs are awesome. The suspense is intense as hell. The soundtrack is perfect.

Jurassic Park will also be remembered as the movie that finally made George Lucas sit up and realise that it was possible for him to make his prequels.In hindsight, while it is still an extremely well directed and tension filled movie, the script did seemed dumbed down in order to appeal to as many people as possible - but that's really irrelevant since this film is all about dinosaurs.

Life finds a way...,"''Life, uh... finds a way.''One of the best & most iconic movie quotes of all times.I don't know what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said. Really...Considering this movie was made in 1993, visual effects are of incredible quality, as you see it better on blu-ray. When it comes to story, it's completely original, nearly flawless. I can't say too much about the acting. I believe acting is not the movie's strongest point. But still, it was enough for that movie. You don't need to be like Marlon Brando in a sci-fi movie about dinosaurs and has great visual & sound effects. The movie is very fun to watch.I also sensed a small message like, ''don't mess with nature''.Best thing about the movie (for me) was the score. Especially the ''Welcome to Jurassic Park'' scene.

A genre staple gets a much deserved re-release in 3D and IMAX.,"Perhaps more so than any other director in film history, Steven Spielberg has locked into that most desirable niche of movie-making: pleasing everyone at the same time. When his spectacular action-adventure Jurassic Park was first released in 1993, he left critics, film buffs, casual viewers, parents and children equally spellbound. Twenty years later, the film has been re-released in both 3D and IMAX, allowing a new generation to experience the magic, and old fans the chance to relive it again.Eccentric millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created the ultimate theme park on a secluded island, and he wants to offer a sneak preview to a select group of individuals (Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern). Of course, the prehistoric attractions don't much appreciate being detained for the amusement of others, and begin to cause havoc as soon as they take the opportunity to escape from their enclosures. An extremely imaginative plot adapted from Michael Crichton's novel of the same name, it sets the foundation for a rip-roaring battle for survival.For many viewers that first saw Jurassic Park as pre-teens, the greatest thrill will come from appreciating, to a greater degree, the way the film deftly builds suspense. Cleverly building up to the revelation of the 'meatasauruses' by stunning us with the visual treat of cuddly herbivores, when we do finally meet the imposing Tyrannosaurus, it is one of cinema's most exhilarating set pieces, only to be topped some time later by the thrilling cat-and-mouse game in the kitchen.It is a testament to the incredible skill of the animatronics and visual effects team that the film's most dated quality is the occasionally cheesy dialogue that burdens Lex and little brother Tim. The dinosaurs are clearly the main event, but the undercard of Jurassic Park spares no expense, with touches of class including Dr. Grant's personal evolution from a child apathist to a fully-fledged family man and a miasma of Shelley-esque criticisms of man's innate desire to play god while drunk on the illusion of total control.To call this the movie event of the year would be to make the grossest of understatements. Experiencing this glorious monument to total escapism on the world's biggest cinema screen is simply mandatory for anyone was has ever felt goosebumps in a theater.

Take his WAR OF THE WORLDS remake as a case in point: it had the potential to be a fantastic movie, but thanks to the ridiculous plot twists I can't ever bring myself to watch it again. However, JURASSIC PARK, despite containing an overload of sentimentality, manages to be a simply great movie, a classic in fact, thanks to an overwhelming amount of elements that work.Michael Crichton's story is fresh (if you overlook the fact that it's Westworld with dinosaurs) and inventive. Okay, I wish Spielberg had made this film for adults rather than kids – complete with the graphic bloodshed of the original novel – but then I guess I wouldn't have seen it in the cinema at the age of 12 and been hugely influenced by it. The cast is splendid, particularly Sam Neill, one of those rarely-seen character actors who really deserved the big time success he enjoyed with his role here. Goldblum is even better, although much underutilised in favour of the redundant Laura Dern character. Watch out for Wayne Knight and Sam Jackson in memorable bit parts and try to avoid the annoyingly precocious brats played by Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards. Bob Peck's big game hunter, straight out of the pages of a H. Rider Haggard novel, is a complete scene stealer.Of course, this is one of those rare movies where the actors come second to the special effects, and the mixture of CGI and animatronic models is still breathtaking to this day. The scene where the T-Rex escapes is hands down one of the most suspenseful moments in cinema, ever. Okay, what follows is occasionally ridiculous (the car dropping down the tree scene) and involves kids running around too much, but it's still the kind of breathlessly exciting movie that there aren't all that many of.I still remember feeling a little bit jealous of how this movie popularised dinosaurs in the mainstream. As a kid, I'd always loved the creatures and owned loads of books about them, but after JURASSIC PARK every kid in the world fell in love with them and it was never the same. I ended up a little jaded, as I'd wanted to stay in that little niche on my own. Anyway, I digress: this is an outrageously good family movie, one of those films with a little bit of everything in it for everyone, and one I can wholeheartedly recommend and enjoy over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A legend,"This movie is simply a legend. A date in history of cinema.With Terminator 2, Jurassic Park is one of the first movie that shows wonderful CGI. And now, it is forever one of the best, until his 21 years. Everything is just awesome. Spielberg at the summum of his art, John Williams create another time a legendary ost, and all the actors are just more than best, and especially two of the them. Richard Attenborough(RIP) play John Hammond, owner of Ingen and creator of Jurassic park. He is a very great actor (and director). He don't play John Hammond, for everybody who love cinema, he is John Hammond. And Sam Neil, what can i say about him ? Simply he is one genius. He is at the best with playing Alan Grant. For some people, he became just one role. Watching him in another program, i am sur that somebody would automatically said : it's the guy from Jurassic Park, Doctor Grant ! And that is the best for an actor, he leave his mark in the collective inconscious. Sam Neil is more an actor, he is a great man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as people think...,"Pure spectacle- no depth. This movie is famous due to it' s then ground breaking CGI dinosaurs. The plot is thin , there is no character development arc, no moodiness, no real atmosphere, not one single plot twist. Typical Spielberg. Despite this criticism, Jurassic Park is good entertainment for the entire family. Basically this is your typical monster-on-the loose flick, cloned dinosaurs chase a variety of humans, most of whom are sympathetic, while some of the victims are decidedly rotten. The CGI and the puppet animatronics really is the meat of this movie, no pun intended. This was the bleeding edge in film special effects in 1993 and holds up very well today. But overall the film is predictable, could have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A classic tale that will be enjoyed by all.,"This was a great and classic film which the world will remember. This is truly some of Spielberg's greatest work and I couldn't love it more. Jurassic Park is one of the three movies in the Jurassic Park trilogy. Jurassic Park is about John Hammond a dinosaur enthusiast who constructs a dinosaur theme park with living biological attractions. These are no animatronic animals but dinosaurs that are created to live and breath the air of man. As usual their is a dark side to every fantasy and the dream is threatened when the park systems break down, all hell breaks loose leaving the tourists and workers left for survival. Their are some great scenes with great uses of CGI and animatronic dinosaurs along with some extraordinary performances, cinematography all in this compelling adventure film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie! One of Spielberg's best,"Wow! That's about all one can say about this movie. The first time that I saw it I was mesmerized. The movie looked so cool and hey, it actually had a good plot.

If you have a DVD player I suggest that you buy the Jurassic Park 2 pack as soon as possible. The movie sounds and looks great, and the extras are cool too. So to summarize go see this.

I'm amazed this isn't in the top 250!!,"It still baffles me why this brilliant movie isn't in the top 250 movies for IMDB! it's amazing! I think this is the kind of film that people take too seriously and don't see the obvious reasons what make this such a great movie.  For one such as ""Jurassic Park"" it represents everything a summer blockbuster should be, (and why Spielberg is the king of 'blockbuster summer' movies).In all fairness, a film like this is only worth watching for the special effects (which still remain top-notch).  It is a dinosaur movie- it does exactly what it says on the tin- it thrills and amazes and never lets up, it is perfect popcorn fare and not since ""Jaws"" (the first proper summer blockbuster!) has a film so brilliantly had such an affect on movies which were to follow. Essentially it is ""Jaws"" on-land and it does so perfectly, with great pace great set-pieces.  I wish this film was in the top 250, if any movie deserves it , ""Jurassic Park"" does, not just for being such a great film but also for revolutionising films from there on out!!Brilliant!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My all-time favorite movie going experience,"""God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs.""Since we're only a couple of days away from the premiere of Jurassic World I wanted to share some thoughts on one of my all time favorite movie going experiences (perhaps my favorite). I was only 12 years old when Steven Spielberg released Jurassic Park in 1993 and from the second the movie started I was at the edge of my seat. From the breathtaking and groundbreaking visuals, to the outstanding cast, and the magnificent score everything about Jurassic Park made me fall in love with it. The dinosaurs had come to life before my very eyes, and Spielberg masterfully wrote a thrilling script that had me sweating for two full hours. I can never forget the thrills I felt during the T-rex scene and that final climax with the velociraptors in the museum's kitchen. I remember thinking there was no one cooler than Sam Neill's Alan Grant and I wanted to be Tim Murphy (played brilliantly by Joseph Mazzello). The rest of the cast was also amazing: Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Ariana Richards, Bob Peck, and Samuel L. Jackson. Many will consider Jaws as Steven Spielberg's most terrifying film, but for me it was Jurassic Park because I got to experience it on the big screen and it was my first memorable experience at a theater. I had seen many other films that had made an impact on me prior to this (Star Wars, The Goonies, Raiders of the Lost Arc, and E.T.) but none in a theater, so Jurassic Park holds that nostalgic value and it will forever remain one of my favorite films. It also became the first film I went to see again at a theater because I couldn't get enough of this world. There are so many quotable lines from this movie and many memorable scenes, and I realize it is going to be impossible for Jurassic World to live up to that standard but I am still highly anticipating it while I relive some of my childhood memories with Jurassic Park. It's a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A milestone in cinematic history, a huge achievement in CGI effects, and by the most well-known director in the world.","Jurassic Park. An island full of dinosaurs who terrorise people; a simple premise but extremely well done. From beginning to end this film is just an enjoyable watch. Back in 1993 when it was released these never-before-seen effects had to have wowed audiences, and even now it still holds up with the anamatronics, CGI combo, it is really good; I've seen worst stuff in other movies and TV series. The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favourite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D. So yes, I think Jurassic Park will continue being my favoured film for a long time to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best classic sci-fi action my number 1 personal favorite adventure Dinosaurs movie Steven Spielberg's ultimate thrill ride,"Jurassic Park (1993) is one of the best classic science fiction action adventure movie one of my personal number 1 favorite adventure Dinosaurs films of all time. It is Steven Spielberg's ultimate thrill ride. It has great visual effects, breathtaking story, it has heart and soul it defines my childhood. I grew up with the film I used to had a t-shirt with Jurassic Park. I love the film to death it is the best one in the franchise it is my number 1 favorite film In the franchise we can say it is the best animal family movie for everyone including kids.It has wonderful score from John Williams, great cast it has Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards.The film is based on a novel from Michael Crichton the book come out 1990 the movie come out 1993 and Michael Crichton helped writing a script for the film. It was brilliant direction from Steven Spielberg about scientists tampering with nature, the film is also mixed with horror in which velociraptor try's to eat Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) who finds a Ray Arnold's arm (Samuel L. Jackson). The effects are top notch, the CGI for 1993 is still good I love the design for T-Rex and the velociraptor fighting on the end. I love Brachiosaurus in this movie I love those dinosaurs so much.The story is original a group of scientist cloned dinosaurs they about to open a amusement park for people lead by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) who invites on a island of Isla Nublar, four people paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and a lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) to gave him their opinions. All three disagree with John Hammond that tempered with nature is wrong and only a lawyer agrees with John because he thinks the park will make a fortune. One of the employees Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) is planning to steal dinosaur eggs and during a preview tour, he causes a security power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok. Dr. Grant stays with the kids Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex (Ariana Richards) alone in the park and he has to return to resort complex, meanwhile John Hammond, Dr. Ellie Sattler, Ian Malcolm, Ray Arnold and Robert Muldon (Bob Peck) trying to get the power back.I love Dr. Alan Grant I love the character he was a great hero, great adventurer great paleontologist and great researcher. I love Sam Neill his character was writen on his skin. I love the kids Tim and Lex Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards they were great kids who were Hammond's grandchildren I love them. The most heart in the film was Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) because she cared about the animals she was a great human been she wanted to help a sick triceratops which I love the character so much. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) I really miss the actor I love his character I love what he try to do I love him to dead it is a shame he is no longer with us. I like Dr. Ian Malcolm in this movie he wasn't annoying in this movie Jeff Goldblum was likable and decent.My favorite scenes in the movie are: The T-Rex chases the jeep down the road with Dr. Sattler, Ian Malcolm and Robert Muldon in an exciting car chase of an action sequence. I love in which Dr. Grant and kids are climbing over the fences and the fences are electricity high voltage the fence electrifies Tim and he fly's down off the fence great breathtaking scene ever. I love that scene. I love the action sequence in which Lex and Tim are cornered by a pair of velociraptors inside the main kitchen and fight for their survival. Another favorite scene of mine is when Ellie discovers Ray's severed arm in the maintenance shed and she sees the raptor that eat Ray try's to eat her. I really miss this movies and I miss my childhood. My best friend from my childhood was a huge fan of this film he collected comic books, action figures and he borrowed me his VHS tape of this film because I never seen the film before and I loved it.I love this film to death it has everything atmosphere, good wonderful effects, good scares, awesome thrills, breathtaking suspense on your sit, wonderful directing, great acting from everyone everything that makes the best movie in the adventure animal franchise. This is the best one in the franchise and my number 1 favorite dinosaurs film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Just watched the new season of ""The Movies That Made Us"" on Netflix featuring this movie.","I love the Netflix series and it was wonderful that in season 3, they included this movie in the 4 icons featured. It also includes ""Forrest Gump"", ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Back To The Future"". Yes, I'm going to give a review within a review.The Netflix series is a must watch. I've seen so many behind the scenes on many movies but this goes as far back as concept and preproduction in actually getting movie from the infancy of the idea through it's finished product. It talks to those involved in making the movie, producers, directors, DOCs, special and visual effects, writers, etc who examine all the work that goes into creating a film and shows footage of the actual work. It's fascinating. Plus when you hear things from the horses' mouths, you realize that alot of the trivia you read is, well, not quite on the mark at times. Then again, I take some of it with a cautious eye, especially when you see several versions of the same topic.I have enjoyed Jurassic Park and it's sequels over the years many times over. I'm looking forward to the forthcoming sequel slated for 2022. Who doesn't love dinosaurs!! There have been many scientific discoveries and theories in paleontology in the the nearly 30 years since the movie came out. This franchise could go on for a long time due to new science being incorporated into the movies.In reading that the beloved main characters from the original are coming back ( hopefully in more than a cameo as a ploy to ramp up interest and ticket sales) would add depth to the story. The original team revisiting the wonders and then the horrors they experienced 30 years prior and it's emotional impact along with the changes that took place over the years. I'm excited for it.Is it the greatest movie ever made? No, there are far better but far more are worse. Spielberg has made better movies and some clunkers. Are the special effects great? For the time, yes. There were novel effects that changed the course of movie making and commonplace today. There are movies now that have big budgets and can still have so-so or poor CGI. The script has flaws but many great movies have a stinker or two. There were changes from the source material which is typical. As an example: they use ""Mr. DNA"" as a filler for exposition. It's a quirky juxtaposition from the movies tone, but funny. Great novels can't always be translated to a visual medium. Liberties are taken to accommodate the running time, the flow of the story and,many times, the movie makers vision. Heck, there are times when an author will admit they wished they had come up with something in the screenplay. And finally, the science. Come on people, it's a work of fiction based on theory. Again, think of the discoveries that have refuted science at the time the movie was made. Even in the novel, Crichton has admitted to errors and even those are based on what the scientists think, not know. It's a science fiction thriller not a documentary. Sure, there are mistakes made. Every movie has them. Unless they are blatant errors you can see, the rest.....I don't want to watch a movie frame by frame to pick out an insignificant boo-boo. It's entertainment and an escape. Those who nitpick every little mistake made is not really taking it all in they way it's meant to be. Get over yourself!! Your opinion is yours and it's on an internet movie site. These reviews are all virtual ephemera. You're not going to make or break someone else's experience who has an open mind.For those few who bashed the hundreds who gave it high marks simply thinking they are stupid and have no clue about a good movie...well I couldn't even comprehend the ones with nonsensical writing and poo poo on those who live in the ""I'm above this type of drivel"". Aaaah, no your not.Yes, there is a moral...Greed and playing God will eat you alive.

Flea Circus,"We knew going into this there would be little to kindle the intellect -- Spielberg is only interested in stories that can be explained in comic book panels...There's not much cinematic originality either, CGI notwithstanding. The primary visual element here is 'the hand' -- Spielberg's mainstay.Everything is told through borrowings from other movies, mainly ""King Kong"" (from the first remake in '76), ""Jaws"" (the raptor pen), ""Aliens""(the kitchen evasion and the dropped ceiling escape). Heck, even ""Crocodile Dundee"" makes an appearance.So back to the intellect - Spielberg's in way over his head when he attempts to explicate chaos theory; Crichton's parallel novel is better for this, if that interests you.Essentially, all complex systems must eventually behave unpredictably. The thing is, Spielberg never attempts anything complex, and never lets anything out of the control of the guiding hand...he just tries to purport the illusion of complexity: the flea circus writ large.The entire movie is mirrored by the tour's animated DNA cartoon -- all of the content is meant for the consumption of mental ten year olds.Malcolm is presented with the proper cerebral depth in the novel; Goldblum knows this is a joke, so he plays this as the comic relief.

"Some things dead, should stay dead","As a kid I so well remember my younger brother and those dinosaur toys he had as a kid. We've seen dinosaurs in film before going back to the silent version of The Lost World. But they were never better shown than when Steven Spielberg made Jurassic Park out of Michael Crichton's novel. These put other screen dinosaurs to shame.Through some cloning billionaire Richard Attenborough has succeeded in recreating those long dead creatures of the past and now has a theme park, Jurassic Park. All the herbivores and the carnivores of the past are now alive. But when you come right down to it, Attenborough has just become another Dr. Frankenstein. Some things dead should stay dead.At least that's what scientists Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum try to tell him. And I have to admit Attenborough does have state of the art security. But he has a greedy employee in Wayne Knight who has made a secret deal with some rival tycoon. His greed brings the whole operation to disaster as dinosaurs start running amuck.The tyrannosaurus rexes and the raptors are what captured the imagination of the public when Jurassic Park was reached. Up to that time dinosaurs when they were on screen were slow moving behemoths. Spielberg's dinosaurs have some speed to them, far more like what they were in the Jurassic Age.I have to say I loved Wayne Knight's performance in Jurassic Park. He's such a loathsome creep, but also a real putz. The end he meets is truly just.Jurassic Park and its successors and imitators have brought about a renewed interest in paleontology. That's always healthy in any society, an interest in the sciences.My brother Daniel loved this film when it came out. As will you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Stomping, chomping dinosaur action par excellence.","I was raised on a diet of dinosaur and monster films, and so when Steven Spielberg gave us Jurassic Park in 1993 promising unbelievably lifelike prehistoric reptiles, I was at the head of the queue (metaphorically speaking of course, since I pre-booked my tickets!!). Needless to say, Steve's amazing big screen version of the Michael Crichton bestseller not only delivered on the promises, making the film a deservedly huge box-office success, but it also redefined special effects for years to come.Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum play three scientists who are invited to a multi-million dollar theme park featuring cloned dinosaurs, which the owner (good old Dickie Attenborough) hopes the trio of boffins will endorse. However, when one disloyal employee sabotages the park's computer system in order to try and steal valuable embryos for a competitor, the guests get to see the exhibits extremely close-up, and must fight for survival against the mighty T-Rex and a pack of intelligent and voracious Velociraptors.The film's plot is a somewhat stripped-down version of the book, and the narrative suffers occasionally for the lack of detail, but with Spielberg at the helm, the result is still a juggernaut of an action film that provides enough thrills, spills and adventure to make it unmissable for fans of creature features. The director manages to pull off some spectacular shots that are amongst the most memorable of his career (such as the simple yet iconic 'water-ripples' as the T-Rex approaches), and with the industry's top FX wizards at his disposal (including ace animatronics expert Stan Winston), he has made a film that still looks amazing a decade and a half later.The best of the trilogy (although part IV is currently in the pipeline, so we shall have to wait and see what happens with that one), Jurassic Park is an excellent piece of cinematic escapism, and way better than anything Spielberg has given us in recent years (I'm still reeling from the latest Indy film and the debacle that was War of the Worlds).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I LOVE this movie!,"This film is easily one of my favorite movies. I saw this movie when it came out in theaters back in 1993; I was only 9-years-old and, though some scenes scared the crap out of me, it blew me away. I was amazed at how, for the first time in a movie, I felt like I was watching REAL dinosaurs. For those who haven't seen this movie (there are people like that?), it centers on a billionaire's attempt to create a new amusement park on an isolated island creating bio-engineered dinosaurs; when a group of specialists are brought in to examine the park, things go terribly wrong.I absolutely loved the story of this film; I loved it so much I had my parents buy me Michael Crichton's novel and I read it 3 times through the course of my fifth grade year. It was then that I fell in love with the work of Crichton and found myself reading the rest of his work. While, yes, the movie did divert pretty heavily from the book, I still felt it was a great adaptation. It's Spielberg's version of Crichton's story, so I don't mind the mass differences. The movie is much more family-friendly than Crichton's novel and I would love to see a another version eventually, a darker version that sticks closer to Crichton's novel. Unlike most instances when I can say ""The book was better"" or ""The movie was better"", I don't feel the need in this case because they were both fantastic.The cast did a terrific job. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Richard Attenborough...all were great in their roles. Though my favorite performance came from Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm, the arrogant chaos theoretician. I've been a fan of Goldblum for a while and I thought he was the perfect choice for the role in this movie. Of course, I have to rave a bit about the film's special effects. As I mentioned before, this film contains probably the most realistic dinosaurs seen in cinema. A seamless combination of practical animatronics and CGI were used to bring the dinosaurs to life. By now, the effects seem a little dated but they continue to stand strong even now, 15 years later.This movie is one of those films that every must see. It grossed $350 million in the US alone. The film marked yet another milestone in special effects in cinema. And most importantly, it's just entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Jurassic Park,"I will start off by saying the novel Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton is my favourite novel of all time. I first read it when I was 12, and about a year before the movie came out.Needless to say, I was pumped for the film. I loved dinosaurs since I was six years old and couldn't wait for the movie.Even at that age I was a movie buff and knew that movie adaptions of books are never 100% accurate. And Jurassic Park was no different.Obviously marketed towards young children, the movie toned down a lot of the violence which happened in the novel. Understandably. But the movie was still full of jump scares and still retained the adventurous side of the novel down to a T.Steven Spielberg always amazes and this film possessed the cutting edge of technology at the time. The CGI and practical effects were amazing. This is how a movie with CGI should look like today. Have real environments with CGI elements. Unlike most movies today where 99% of the screen is CGI.Steven takes us on an amazing adventure through Jurassic Park along with fine actors such as Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum, Linda Dream and Sir Richard Attenborough. The science behind the movie made it seem like it could really bring dinosaurs to life.I always wondered what a dinosaur would look like. And Jurassic Park showed me.

The plot was simple, but not in a good way; it was predictable, and that's not a good thing with thrillers. I felt like the movie was meant to be a 10 years old horror movie, which would have been fine if I knew it would be like so. Spielberg is the absolute king of Ex Machinas in this movie.

The visuals are a treat, the suspense and adventure is astounding and the characters are all interesting in their own way and the acting is pretty much spot on. I love this film as it effectively manages to capture what it would be like if man and dinosaurs somehow existed at the same time. It shows that dinosaurs can be big and scary or majestic and inspiring. I also like how the whole mosquito in Amber thing was explained, and dinosaurs didn't randomly just appear on the island!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Big summer movies simply do not get better than this,"One of the very first things we learn during the credits after ""Jurassic Park"" is that it is based on a novel by Michael Crichton, and that the screenplay was written by Michael Crichton with the help of David Koepp. It's for the best that he decided to pen his first screenplay since 1978's ""Coma"" when ""Jurassic Park"" went into development because it's hard to imagine a screenplay based on his dark sci-fi horror novel being successful in the same way this screenplay was. Crichton, writing a screenplay based on his own work, opted to change the tone and much of the plot for this Hollywood production. Rather than the dark sci-fi the novel is, ""Jurassic Park"" the movie is a fun, relatively light-hearted action adventure, and the decision to change the tone might go down in history as one of the smartest screen writing decisions in history.This is simply an exceptional film. Technically, it is an astounding achievement. As of 2007, fourteen years after ""Jurassic Park"" was released, its special affects are still excellent compared to many mainstream films. Steven Spielberg did no wrong with this film; you can't really criticize anything about it. The public likes Michael Bay because he blows up a lot of expensive stuff and films the explosions, but if one was to list the flaws in one Michael Bay film they could fill dozens of pages. But really, what's wrong with ""Jurassic Park""? The answer is: nothing. You can't fault the gorgeous cinematography, as there are more greatshots in this film than all the summer blockbusters of recent years put together and you certainly can't fault John Williams' classic score. So where does the criticism come from? Some think ""Jurassic Park"" could've been darker and dealt more with its central theme- don't mess with nature. Some think ""Jurassic Park"" doesn't build suspense for long enough, and shows the dinosaurs too often. This claims are without basis because ""Jurassic Park"" never claimed to be a deep film with heavy subtext (there is subtext, but it is dealt with only superficially), nor did it want to be ""Jaws"" (more like ""Indiana Jones"" with dinosaurs). One thing that has to be understood is that this is an action adventure. It eliminates the majority of the science and techno-babble from Crichton's novel, condensing it to a few minutes near the start of the film. The cast is memorable, in particular Sam Neill as Alan Grant, who really reminds me of Indiana Jones in a sense. The character is adventurous, smart, and funny and I really can't imagine anyone else playing him quite as well as Sam Neill did. Laura Dern, an exceptional actress who should've won awards for certain performances in certain David Lynch films, is good here as are Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough. The child actors could've been more annoying, which when speaking of child actors in general is a compliment.There are few films in existence as exciting as ""Jurassic Park"", and there are very, very few, if any at all, summer blockbusters as perfectly-made and memorable as this. If you're looking for intriguing science fiction dealing with intricate themes, this is not the place for it. There is depth to ""Jurassic Park"", but for meditative science fiction there are certainly better options. Watch this if you want to be entertained, or just to see an example of utterly phenomenal film-making.****/4",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just another Spielberg failure,"I will admit, when this movie came out when I was little, I was obsessed with Jurassic Park, but when I watch this today, I roll my eyes at Spielberg's many screw-ups in this movie. The movie is reasonably good up through the parts with the Triceratops, but after that, it gets rather ridiculous.For instance, when the T-Rex gets through the fence hunting down the kids, somehow once the dinosaur gets through the fence, the path back through there is suddenly a 200 ft. drop into the trees below. Then, when the (supposedly electric) SUV falls into the tree below and Dr. Grant comes to rescue Tim. He gets Tim out of the SUV safely, and right there, both Dr. Grant and Tim are safe out of the way of the SUV . Why do they have to get back in front of the SUV? Just so there can be a dramatic scene with the falling SUV chasing them? Plus, that SUV most likely wouldn't just fall like that, the SUV would most likely just tumble out of the tree.The movie does get a little better with when they power the stuff back up and when you get to see technical things again, plus scenes like Dr. Grant faking getting fried on the fence, that was entertaining. But, then it just goes right back to plain drama when Tim gets fried for real (while he's simply six feet from climbing down and off of the fence). Another one in this was where the raptor suddenly bursts through the circuit breaker panel in the utility room.As you can see, the majority of this movie was devoted to Spielberg's ridiculous need for drama, not making the story believable. I just don't understand how Spielberg can work so hard to make the dinosaurs look believable and then screw up so much else in this story.The story the book told was so much better than this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Contains One Very Thoughtful Scene,"JURASSIC PARK was released with a massive publicity campaign and went on to make a massive profit at the box office and unlike the majority of over hyped blockbusters ( Hello Harry Potter ) this movie deserved every cent it made from cinema goers . There`s only two things I can criticise1 ) I have no idea where John Hammond comes from but it`s not Scotland . Strangely enough Richard Attenborough has a holiday cottage on the Isle Of Bute . If he needed a voice coach to master a Scottish accent all he had to do was ask me2 ) A big game hunter . Forgive me for asking but hasn`t it been illegal to go around shooting elephants and lions and tigers for many , many years ? Shouldn`t this great white hunter be aged about 80 years oldI* can forgive the above because this is top notch entertainment with absolutely flawless technical aspects and most of it was achieved via CGI . Strange that the computer generated images of this 1993 movie are far better than the effects of latter movies , compare it with all these Stephen Sommer movies to see what I mean . Perhaps it`s also a good idea to compare them with all those old movies whose dinosaur effects are done by sticking a fin on a lizardThere is a very one very thoughtful scene amongst all the lizard excitement and that`s the scene where Henry Wu explains the process of how scientists have resurrected dinosuars . It`s a beautifully written , beautifully acted scene that in the context of the story is the greatest success in the history of human science , greater than even going to the moon and back again . It would be very easy - And very careless - for the movie makers to forget what the scientific endeavour involves but here Spielberg reminds both the characters and the audience that even the most blase scientist should feel pride in bringing back a species of animal extinct for many millions of years . It`s this scene that stops JURASSIC PARK being just another FX laden Summer blockbuster and lends credibility to an already exciting story",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Okay the first time, looks worse after the second viewing...","I saw this film twice, once at general release and later on video to appease a small child.  The first time I thought it was okay, but after the second view, I realized...NOT!  Spielberg and the rest of the production team have taken an interesting Crichton novel and made a terrible film with many changes, not all for the best.  The special effects and the ""island"" are great, as is Laura Dern's bottom (to summarize an earlier review), but the rest was just...there.  Too bad, too, because they waste some great actors, notably Sam Neill (who does deliver one of the most convincing lines I've ever seen, as ""Karen Davis"" notes).  Like ""Independence Day"", this could have been a great film, but falls far short of expectations, and could have used a better continuity editor.  The sequel is TERRIBLE.  ""The Lost World"" is a more enjoyable alternative.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Welcome to..."" you know the rest","It's always hilarious to me how adult this movie is. Not like, sexy, but just mature.

When I got the toy set, all I really wanted to play with was the dinosaurs. I mean, what kid is like ""Awesome I got the Laura Dern and Sam Neill figures - and the computer lab!""

This movie is so classic and contemporary,"I don't write reviews on here often, just for the times when you HAVE to stop the movie to jump on IMDB and give the review while it's piping hot fresh in my mind...There are 2 movies that really seem like there were time-travelers from 50 years ahead that came back to the 90's to give two movies that are so beyond their times from an effects standpoint that they below in their own cinematic categories all together: Jurassic Park and the Matrix, the former for animatronics mastery, and the latter for its 360 camera and CGI integration. In my opinion, these 2 films are major turning points in cinema.Just try and look at other movies in 1993 and 1999 for their graphics, for either the use of animatronics or CGI. Think of this, The Lion King came out a year AFTER Jurassic Park and was billed as cutting edge because they used computers throughout the animation. Seriously, name ONE movie in the last 28 years that came even close to looking and feeling as realistic as Jurassic Park? Name just one...I'll wait...Even compare all the Godzilla remakes they spend crazy money on and tell me that CGI looks more realistic than Jurassic Park animatronics, and I'll call you a liar.

How Is this NOT in the top 250?,"Jurassic Park is the main reason I became a dinosaur fan. When I first saw this movie when I was about 3 or 4 I watched it mainly for the dinosaurs, which I still do but after watching it when I'm a lot older I started to not just love the dinosaurs but the IDEA of a theme park zoo filled with dinosaurs! I also think the story is amazing. I don't see how anyone could hate this film or give it a 1 out of 10. Also as you may know, Dr. Grants character is based on the famous paleontologist Jack Horner. Who as we speak is working on reverse engineering a chicken to give is teeth, tail, and change its wings to claws. This is just one of the many reasons I am interested so much in JP.

Dinosaurs Are Back To Roaming...And Devouring,"I've always admired Steven Spielberg for his attempts to make different movies. Even though not all of them are exceptional, I've always liked watching them and 'Schindler's List', 'Jurassic Park', 'Saving Private Ryan', 'The Terminal'...just to name a few, rank among my favourites. 'Jurassic Park' is an exciting action adventure. I don't even remember how many times I've seen it but I do recall that I've enjoyed it every single time.The special effects are stunning. The dinosaurs look eerily real. Next to being detailed and well tones, the movement looks very realistic (as in most films one can see the go-motion which Spielberg had cleverly avoided). I wonder why filmmakers today don't use this kind of special effects instead of going entirely CGI. Thanks to the cinematography, the whole park is spectacular to watch and it has just as much an important role as the creatures. The background score and brilliant sound effects manage to create that chilling mood.Another thing that makes 'Jurassic Park' so exciting to watch is the suspense element which is very well built. The viewers wonder who will die next, which dinosaurs will show up, what's the fate of the main characters etc. The opening sequence already gives us the feel that it will be quite a bloodfeast. But, the events that follow thereafter are more 'laidback'. Spielberg starts the story by introducing the park and once the viewer knows all there is to know about the park, the action begins. Though some seem to find the plausibility of the theory about dinosaurs being revived and set to roam the world, problematic, I'd say enjoy it for what it is. It's not supposed to be a philosophical movie with deep meaning (but if someone sees it that way and appreciates it who am I to complain).The cast do a great job. Sam Neill and Laura Derns do a cool job of taking over roles that were offered to the likes of Harrison Ford, William Hurt, Robin Wright Penn, Juliette Binoche and Sridevi. Richard Attenborough always has a pleasant presence even though his character is initially somewhat of a jerk. Jeff Goldblum's charismatic Ian provides some comic relief. Poor Samuel L. Jackson and Bob Peck get devoured but at least they do put up one hell of a battle. Joseph Mazzello is a little annoying but cute and sometimes funny. Ariana Richards screams a lot but otherwise she's adequate.Perhaps it was because of my fascination with dinosaurs that I loved this movie as a child but for me 'Jurassic Park' has stood the test of time. I had just revisited it last night for the nth time and it felt awesome to watch. 1993 was perhaps the best year in Spielbergs career because that's the year he gave 'Schindler's List' and 'Jurassic Park'.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Great great movie, great actors, great effects, great music, great EVERYTHING!","I like many saw this as a kid and was so super enthralled. the movie was fun, scary and at times LAUGH OUT LOUD funny. people who only watch this for the special effects must pay attention to the dialog and story. its actually very deep and raises certain questions rely questioned in movies today. this movie for some reason people skip over the acting, but cm on! its got some of the best actors here doing probably there best work. who can forget Jeff goldblum as Ian Malcolm?? this guy was hilarious, almost every bit of dialog he said was brilliantly funny and just his whole unique idiosyncratic personality added so much to the film. no wonder he was cast again in ""the lost world"", although he was sadly less funny in that one. then you got Sam Niel as Alan grant, again, brilliant actor who fit his role perfectly and you really believed he was this smart scientist dinosaur guy. he was very down to earth and a very caring rugged type of guy, and also very likable in the main role. laura dern is perhaps the weak spot, at times she kinda annoyed me but yet at the same time, she was very real and her and Sam Neil had great chemistry. however i don't like what they did to them in JP3, it contradicts the ending of JP1, but ah well, i tend to just ignore JP3 ever happened. the kid actors are actually very good, the boy was so cute and funny always following grant around and being the comedy relief, and the girl wasn't bad either. its surprising actually, 2 kid actors that didn't annoy me! how refreshing! and even the small roles like with the fat guy dennis and the small role of samuel l jackson as the computer guy and of course the badass muldoon ""SHOOT HEEER!"" were actually really great acting and often times very funny! anyway, almost 20 years later i still remain impressed and this is a film that is not to be missed, and if i ever have kids i look forward to sharing this film with them, thats how much i love this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Life, uh... finds a way.""","Genetics can unlock the secrets of creating and growing biological life; we've already used these secrets to clone a sheep, to alter our crops, and it may allow us to repopulate endangered species. In his novel, Michael Crichton explored the unique and harrowing possibility that genetics could bring the dinosaurs back. When entrepreneurs try to turn the miracle of dinosaur cloning into a theme park attraction, chaos theory kicks in, proving that nature can't be tamed that easily.Stephen Spielberg's adaptation of Crichton's novel takes the original premise, complete with its cautionary warnings, and delivers it as a fast-moving adventure film full of color, wit, and thrills. There are moments where the film emphasizes the whimsy and wonder of creation, but when the deadliest of predators are unleashed, there are a fair amount of harrowing, suspenseful chases that follow. One of the most chilling scenes shows the dreaded Tyrannosaurus Rex breaking loose from its paddock and laying waste to a pair of jeeps, threatening to crush and eat everybody trapped inside. Velociraptors rush through the jungles and buildings, threatening to devour human prey. What starts off as a wondrous ""what if"" scenario eventually devolves into a struggle for survival and escape; occasional bursts of comedy keeps the film lightweight, but with groundbreaking special effects, carefully-staged action, and characters worth caring about, the film offers a grand spectacle and a perfectly-entertaining blockbuster experience.Much of the story is altered from the original book, but it's hardly an issue. On its own merits, the film tells the story it wants to and it does it well. It flips a few of the characters around so that there's a family dynamic at work. Most of the characters are likable, and the film sets them up so that we can understand and care for them when they're in danger. Some of them make very bad decisions, but even the dumbest characters are endearing, because the film shows them as being very human and prone to mistakes; these faults ultimately contribute to the plot's progression. The plot unfolds spectacularly, continuously building in tension and action. Throughout the picture, the characters speculate and dig up fascinating themes about playing God with genetics; the film's events prove that all human attempts to control nature and force a structure will never work, and life will always find a way to break free and thrive on its own. These themes carry both wonder and terror, and the film emphasizes both aspects aptly.This film is made with really good photography. Editing can be a little weak at times, but it is often punchy and good. Acting is pretty over-the-top, but it produces expressions and emotions that fit in perfectly with the film's tone. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are perfectly likable in their roles. Jeff Goldblum steals the show repeatedly with his character's wit and wisdom. Richard Attenborough has a great presence and personality as John Hammond. The kid characters put their best into it, and they do have some endearing moments that gives the film a more emotional punch. Bob Peck is cool, Martin Ferraro is a dude we love to hate, Wayne Knight is an even bigger dude we love to hate, Samuel L Jackson keeps it real, and everybody else is decent. This script is full of great lines, but some dialogue can be rather random, and it's all really low-key. Despite one or two shortcuts, this production uses good-looking sets, props, costumes, and creature effects. Special effects were fantastic for its time, and most of them still hold up to this day. John Williams' music score is catchy and emotional.Jurassic Park is easily one of the best blockbusters, not only because of all its visual effects and thrills, but also because it has heart, and it has themes worth thinking about. It's a must-see.4.5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Good)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Confinement,"Extremely good stunts, and the imagination of the sea and the sky. Spielberg is indeed a very great director. Looking back last night, the dinosaurs made by those stunts are still very, very cute, and the image of free walking in the primitive forest living freely is popular. This led me to be more familiar and familiar with the animals 60 million years ago than many animals that still exist today. At the tension of the plot, the brutal shot also scared me to blindfold. There are few loopholes.
One of the most interesting discoveries is that in this film, due to the high development of technology and the extensive use of computer special effects, Spielberg has questioned modern science through the genetic engineering of dinosaurs: can science make humans think they are the world The master of can control nature and transcend nature? Of course, the answer given by the director is no. It can be seen that this reflects the modern West's understanding of the limitations of science after introspection of science since the 20th century. Science cannot be an excuse for human arrogance. However, this does not affect the greatness of science. After all, because of the development of science, Spielberg can create, we can see the image of a dinosaur living freely in nature 60 million years ago.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"But if the Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the Pirates don't eat the tourists.","Science has advanced so far, to the point that scientists are able to clone dinosaurs to populate an island. Turning it into a maximum security theme park seemed to be a good idea, but when human mischief and a breakdown of said security occurs, the result is terrifying.One of the unwritten facts in cinema history is that some folk, no matter what he does, will deride Steven Spielberg's achievements in movie making. Be it popcorn bonanza's such as this dinosaur riot, or the serious, emotionally wrought likes of Schindler's List which was released this same year, Spielberg is not a popular name amongst the arty farty set. Thankfully, those people are in the minority because Spielberg and his movies cater for the mass majority of the honest cash paying movie fan, he is by definition a fan himself, to hear him interviewed and chatter away about cinematic greats such as David Lean is as enlightening as it is as entertaining as his best work.Jurassic Park finds Spielberg directing like a child locked in a sweet shop, all the tools available to him are used with gleeful abandon, the result being one of the most enjoyable sci-fi/fantasy/monster/disaster movies of the 90s. Going on to make a lifetime gross, at the time of writing, of $914,691,118 after being made for just $63 million, I think it's safe to say that Jurassic Park is loved by a lots and lots of people. The charges of the actors being secondary are of course warranted, at times stilted and plain, Laura Dern, Sam Neil, and even Richard Attenborough, possibly do their respective career phone ins; but that's OK in a film of this type, besides, elsewhere Jeff Goldblum rises to the challenge as Ian Malcolm, all quirky and sly, Goldblum gets to look cool and gives the picture it's comedic relief.However, we are ultimately here for the terror, the rampaging dinosaurs expertly assembled at ILM are a pure feast for the eyes, with Spielberg brilliantly creating edge of the seat set piece after set piece. Craftily he lulls us into a false sense of security {aided by screenwriter and novel writer Michael Crichton of course}, it's all lovely, vegetable eating dinosaurs and kiddie friendly fodder. But then, oh then, it's hello T-Rex, Raptors and thrills on the edge of your seats, from that point in it's time to strap yourself in for a magical roller-coaster ride.

Instant Classic,"John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) creates this park called ""Jurassic Park"" where he recreates the dinosaurs using DNA found in fossils (but also having to use frog DNA to complete it - don't ask me why, I don't quite remember all the technical stuff).
But before Hammond can open it to the public, he has to get it approved. So, he hires some fossil finders (played by Sam Neill and Laura Dern) to go to the park and look through it without telling them what occupies the park. Anyway, they go there and Hammond gets them to take his grandchildren along after the fossil finders express concern about the park's safety with the dinosaurs. A hippie scientist-type guy Dr. Ian Malcolm (played by the great Jeff Goldblum) also accompanies them as well as a lawyer.
That's where things start to go wrong. The dinosaurs escape. I won't say anymore, though.
I loved it! I think it is one of the greatest films of all time and is certainly a classic. I don't understand why everyone thinks this film is scary. It's not - apart from a couple scenes like the start and something later on. A lot of film writers should watch this and take notes on how to do tension as this film has brilliant tension.
It has quite a good sense of humour, and ""Jurassic Park"" is generally suitable for children, though you might want to fast forward the very start and maybe one or two other scenes, but generally, I think that children can watch it, though it depends on the individual child and what they can or can't handle.
Another brilliant subplot in the film is with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his dislike for children. During most of the danger, he is stuck with Hammond's grandchildren. There is great chemistry between him and the children.
Jurassic Park is a brilliant movie.

During a preview tour , Nedry (Wayne Knight) disables the security system so that he can make his escape with some stolen embryos , this enables all the dinosaurs to escape their enclosures . Then , the theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok against the paleontologists and the curator's grandsons (Joseph Mazzelo , Ariana Richards) .This is an enjoyable first entry , plenty of spine-tingler thrills , chills , emotion and lots of fun . The Dinosaurs are the real protagonists , they're terrifyingly awesome and almost completely convincing. Simple dialog and plain tale , but the story is very exciting and inventive . In the film appears numerous predator animals and colossal carnivores as Tyrannosaurus Rex , Velociraptors, Behemoths , Spinosaurious , Stegosauruses although most of creatures are large herbivores harmless and feed on vegetables as large dinosaurs , triceratops and Brachiosaurius accompanied by a herd of Parasaurolophus . Humans try desperately to escape of dinosaurs and they are chased through leafy jungle by fanged giant animals , specially by the Tyrannosaurus and of course by attack of the Velociraptors . In fact the prehistoric animals are truly the film stars , they are terrifyingly awful and create abundant and quite potent screams and scares . There're some stirring and exciting scenes dealing a van dangling over a cliff and Tyrannosaurius pushing while the starring are seized in a cord where the actors give vigorous physical performances . The biggest interpretations are by Sam Neill as a nice , resourceful paleontologist , Jeff Goldblum as a likable mathematician and Wayne Knight as greedy man with mean purports . Magnificent especial effects totally convincing are for combination of models in charge of Stan Winston Studio and computer animation from Phil Tippet , Dennis Muren along with Industrial , Light and Magic of George Lucas . As always spectacular music by John Williams and excellent cinematography by Dean Cundey , both of whom are Spielberg's habituals . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Steven Spielberg , plus including his typical touches . Rating : Above average , well worth watching . It's followed by ¨Lost world¨ directed again by Spielberg and Jurassik Park III by Joe Johnston . The film will appeal to teenagers and and growns-up , but no for small kids by violent, realistic and gory attacks by monsters animals.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Film!,"Jurassic Park is one of Spielberg's best movies. i was so awed by this movie when I first saw it. Everything is just about amazing regarding this film. The story is about a dinosaur park off the coast of Costa Rica. There were rumors that the park was in serious trouble, so the owner John Hammond decides to get a dinosaur expert, paleobotanist, a scientist, a lawyer, and his grandchildren to endorse the park. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs are free from their domains after the power went out. Now everybody must have their survival instincts in hand. The acting is very good. I Liked Sam Neill as Alan Grant. The special effects were amazing. The dinosaurs are pretty darn perfect. The sound effects are excellent as well. I really loved the music in this film. John Williams did such a fantastic job with this score and themes. Overall, this is must-see movie. I rate this movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I went on a helicopter ride over the area where this was filmed in Hawaii.,"Everyone knows what happens in ""Jurassic Park"", so I'll just talk about a few aspects. I think that it's fitting that the movie was released in 1993. With baby boomer Bill Clinton now in the White House, it was clearly a new era, and this movie looked like it was representing a new era - think of it as being 1961, with young John Kennedy as the new president (which it would have been for my parents)*. The fact that Steven Spielberg also released ""Schindler's List"" that year and won two Oscars for it backs up this aspect.Unfortunately, ""The Lost World"" was beyond pathetic. It was just a repeat of the first one and was totally predictable. So avoid that one and stick with this one. I never saw ""Jurassic Park III"". While in Maui during spring break, 2003, I went on a helicopter ride and we flew over the area where parts of ""Jurassic Park"" were filmed.*As it was, Rob and Laura Petrie on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" were loosely based on the Kennedys. I don't know of any characters based on the Clintons.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Life finds a way.,"Dinosaur DNA is discovered, and geneticists manage to bring the extinct species back to life,at Jurassic Park, however the peace and tranquility is broken when the power fails.Jurassic Park is one of those films I grew up with, and have loved since the day I first saw it. I would imagine this is one of those films you'll remember seeing for the first time, I think I went about three times, then subsequently picked up the DVD, then the blu ray, it's a film I watch pretty frequently.It has never lost its magic, it's an imaginative, action packed blockbuster, it has never lost any of its shine, even some of the atrocious follow ups have never managed to tarnish it.It spends the first hour building up, introducing the characters, the beasts, then it kicks into top gear, it really is edge of the seat viewing.The action sequences are still incredible, and will still entertain audiences young and old. It isn't just all about the special effects, which are of course excellent, it is incredibly well acted, Neill, Durn and Goldblum are all on point, especially when you imagine how much green screen acting they'd have done. Dickie Attenborough, I could watch him in anything.Jurassic Park was, and always will be, a wonderful, action packed family blockbuster.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
IN 3D - back to the 90s,"I remember attending the first screening for Jurassic Park in the 90s and there was much hype about this bigger than life theatrical experience. 20 years later it seems like a time capsule from the 90s. The 3D experience does enhance a few scenes but overall the movie seems a bit dated. Interesting about all these movies in the past that were look into the future missed the entire cell phone craze. Some of the scenes where DNA sequences are manipulated have turned into true modern science. Our expectations are more than was delivered in the special effects but it was nostalgic to catch glimpses of these young stars, especially a very young Samuel Jackson. The movie is about the ultimate theme park composed of Dinosaurs but oh no suddenly something goes wrong. Based on a novel by Michael Crichton and is produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Gerald Molen and directed by Stephen Spielberg. So if you want a trip to the 90s with funky colored glasses then this is the movie for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Laura Dern's facial expressions really annoyed me,"Once again, Spielberg over-directs a movie. He stretches and tweaks Laura Dern's face like Silly Putty.

I've always liked Dern but, in this film, her mug just got under my skin.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The way all blockbusters should be...,"This is a film that has truly stood the test of time and has remained a modern classic of the Hollywood blockbuster system. Deservedly becoming the biggest film of all time in 1993 and launching the most entertaining film series ever made, Spielberg's film contains all the cliches a blockbuster should have and ensures that it remains good fun. We have the courageous scientist in the shape of Sam Niell, his fiesty girlfriend courtesy of Laura Dern, a doom and gloom expert in the causes of the problem at hand thanks to a brilliant performance from Bob Peck and the quirky scientist type who prophesises doom from the get go in the shape of Jeff Goldblum. This is fun and has remained so for the last ten years.Where the film has remained so good over the past decade is in its use of CGI and at the time state of the art special effects. They still haven't dated and look fluidly real as if the technology had only been made yesterday. Undoubtedly the dinosaurs are the star here (none of the actors have headlined each film with a change of performer for each one, Goldblum in the second installment, Niell returning for number three), but it doesn't matter because the dinosaurs here are truly movie stars in their own right and like characters in an ensemble film they all get their moments. The T-Rex gets to cause spectacular destruction, the Raptors get to be the vicious and conniving villains of the story, the Brachiosaurus ensures it grabs our awe while the Tricerotops gains our sympathy.However, Spielberg ensures that it isn't just the dinosaurs who are the stars here. He creates tension in the way that only he can with prolonged set pieces such as the T-Rex attack and the moment Alan and Tim have to race down a tree with the threat of a car falling on top of them. Sure it ain't art, it's great entertainment and it is great fun and it here where Spielberg ensures the film classic status. He uses the two hour frame to set up events and the story in the first hour and then let the chaos rip in the second with suspenseful action sequence after suspenseful action sequence and it works. While you may not look to performances in a film like this, it does have some fantastic actors. Niell seems surprisingly well suited to being a Spielbergian hero who starts of disliking children only to have his heart melted at the end. He appears to be having great fun playing the guy who saves the day. Jeff Goldblum almost runs away with the entire film as Malcolm, the quirky off beat nature of the character ensuring many a great one liner while Richard Attenborough is heart breaking as the Walt Disney like John Hammond whose dream becomes a violent nightmare.The film is great fun from beginning to end and deserves to be up there with Jaws and King Kong as one of the all time great monster movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of Spielberg's Finest,"Up there with""Jaws"", ""E. T."", and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" as one of the quintessential Spielberg popcorn flicks. Although I doubt there are people who've yet to watch it or at who are least familiar with its effect on pop culture, ""Jurassic Park"" is one of those movies that completely captivates and hits the nail on the head in every sequence. Unlike its myriad of sequels and spin-offs, what Spielberg does with the original is craft a Hitchcock-esque thriller that happens to have great special effects that hold up nearly thirty years later. Even sequences that would be mundane in most other action movies, like a Ford Explorer sliding down a tree and chasing the main characters, is exciting. I give a lot of this credit to the original score by John Williams.Excellent performances by Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum. Samuel L. Jackson also makes an early career performance here and it's awesome to see as well.It's an essential movie, one that all movie fans ought to watch at some point.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Real Dinosaurs! Well, As Real As It Gets","When one looks back at the evolution of movies, Jurassic Park has to be on the list. It is not the greatest movie ever made, but it was THE groundbreaking movie on the 1990s on the special effects front. This was the first mass-marketed, studio produced movie to use computer generated creatures, creatures who were seamlessly inserted into a live action movie. Special effects we take for granted now were pioneered by Steven Spielberg and his crew of special effect artists in Jurassic Park. The movie requires fantastic special effects, the story based on the Michael Crichton book by the same name about genetic engineers bringing dinosaurs back to life 65 million years after they died out. The story is pretty much the standard scary creature movie, as the dinosaurs chase people, eat people, scare people, but is still entertaining through the effort of Spielberg. The tension created through the various scenes in the movie and the real-life quality of the dinosaurs. Herky-jerky, fake dinosaurs would not be real-enough for the audiences, diminishing the tension that is created by dinosaurs chasing the characters in the movie. A fun science fiction story is turned into an almost life-like dinosaur chaser movie because of the revolutionary special effects seen in Jurassic Park.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One Thrilling Dino-Film!,"I first watched this movie in the theaters and it was one heck of a ride. Here, two doctors who studied prehistoric plants and dig dinosaur bones were invited by a billionaire to his theme park, inhabited by cloned dinosaurs brought back to life by preserved DNA. All goes well as the doctors, joined by an attorney, a mathematician and the billionaire's grandkids, tour the park. But, all is chaos when a greedy park technician, wanting to smuggle dinosaur embryos off the island in exchange for some big cash, shuts down the park so he alone can escape, which releases he dinosaurs from their confinement. Then, it is a fight for survival for those remaining on the island as the dinosaurs roam free.The dinosaurs are very realistic and inspiring, very well-executed. The special and visual effects used to bring the creatures to life take the meaning of a dinosaur film to a whole new level.Each of the actors gave a memorable and solid performance in their respectable roles. I especially enjoyed actor Martin Ferrero's role as Donald Gennaro; him hiding in a public restroom trying to escape from the just-escape T-Rex is one of the most memorable scenes in the movie. I also enjoyed Jeff Goldblum's role as Ian Malcolm, as he gave the movie needed humor with comedy relief. Sam Neill and Laura Dern delivered good drama and on-screen comprehension and Bob Peck did an excellent and daring job as ""game"" warden.The music by John Williams is terrific and very haunting; his theme for the first appearance of the Brachosaurus will etch in the minds of many and will go on to become this movie's signature theme. Director Steven Spielberg gave some of his finest work, giving us a movie with a solid plot and a charming story that will delight an audience of all ages for years to come. And, all the running, screaming, and thrilling scenes of the dinosaurs and the human characters are edge-of-the-seat excitement.Excellent dinosaur film and definitely one of the greatest movies of its time.Grade A",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Should've Had More Malcolm,"Jurassic Park was Steven Spielberg's roughly fourth and perhaps final installment in the creation of the modern blockbuster and the death of cinema. The movie led to about a half dozen direct sequels but its effect is much broader than that, influencing almost countless films and filmmakers since.You can expect to find no shortage of tropes or weaknesses or major holes yet it still manages to gloss over them and hold it together with neat professionalism. Even when it's bad, it's not amateurish and it's always very Spielberg. In some cases that can be a bad thing but more often than not it's a benefit.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could and before you knew what you had you patented it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox""","Okay, it's a nice, knowing reference, but the sole one amongst the mire. Jurassic Park was, at least until the advent of Independence Day and Godzilla, a new low in brain-dead popcorn fodder. I really, really cannot stand this film. Appallingly patronising to its audience, it expects nothing from them and offers them nothing in return.WARNING: THE REST OF THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERSThe cast's roles are built up with the most cursory of characteristics. Witness how Sam Neill's Dr. Grant starts the story not wanting children, yet spends the whole film in their company, thus undergoing a typical ""learning process"". Plot points are given unsubtly for future reference in the film, such as the attack patterns of the velociraptors. (I wonder, do you think they WILL attack someone like that before the end?) ""I'm not a computer nerd, I prefer to be called a hacker"" offers Lex after being sneezed over by a Brachiosaurus. Let me guess, would her ability to hack a computer be relevant somewhere in the movie? Let's not even mention the dinos that open doors by the handle.Richard Attenborough is probably the worst performer as Dr. Hammond. He starts the movie with an effeminate Scottish accent, which fluctuates to English, then to Scots, then back to English... was the continuity adviser drunk? Maybe he should have played the part as ""Pinkie"" from ""Brighton Rock"". At least it would have been entertaining. ""Stick yer perishin' mincers on that T-Rex"". Jeff um Gold arr blum, joins joins him in ah clumsy ex uh position, then spends the rest of the film uh lying lying on a uh couch. Actually, despite having nothing to do, Goldblum shows why he earns every cent of his wages by being the only one to give some sort of life to the cut-out he's given.The rigid banality and cynical, transparent manipulation of the film, coupled with its overblown incidental music really starts to grate before long. And while some scenes might be disturbing for small children, its PG certificate, mainstream targets and lowbrow denomination means you know none of the cast will be harmed. Or would a family film really show a ten-year-old boy being electrocuted and then dying? Therefore: no tension. See also: Independence Day, or: if it was real they never would have got that saucer out of the nuclear explosion in time.What everyone always discusses are the dinosaurs, of course. While, for the most part, excellent, they appear for less than - count 'em - 20 minutes of the film's total. This leaves us with 85% of a movie that is stock, run-of-the-mill and predictable. Even the mighty Samuel L. Jackson looks bored in this one*. On reflection, it appears that novelty was fundamental to its success. The sequel, The Lost World, was a better film yet wasn't as popular, critically or commercially.Jurassic Park is a film riddled with ""cute"" kids, ""comedy"" fat bloke, feeble one-liners and double takes. There's even ""humorous"" use of ""ironic"" juxtaposition, such as the T-Rex bringing down a flyer from When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth. ""Now that is one big pile o'sh*t"" says Goldblum at one point. To highlight that quote for the purposes of mockery would be cheap and unkind.* I happened to stumble on my old review in September 2005 and edited it for a few minor typos. How ironic that in the five years since I originally posted this review every single part Sam Jackson has played is one that he's looked thoroughly bored in.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Almost perfect.,"Jurassic Park really is 65 million years in the making. I mean, wow. I have never seen a movie that combines action/adventure, intellectuality, in-depth characters, excellent storyline, great graphics, and perhaps one of the best soundtracks ever made (John Williams, of course) in one movie.  How the makers of this movie fit all this really baffles me. What else really amazes me is how close the movie was to the book (especially compared to other books made into movies by Crichton).  Don't let that statement fool you; Jurassic Park the movie is nowhere near the book, but the essential parts have not been ripped out of the book (like all of Crichton's books). Michael Crichton, John Williams, and Steven Spielberg--what an excellent combination!  Crichton wrote the awesome book (and the screenplay for the movie, too, I think), Williams composed and conducted some of the best contemporary/thriller music ever made, and Spielberg made the frightening dinosaurs so much more freaky. The only thing wrong with it was that it wasn't as close to the book as I'd hoped, although, like I said earlier, it maintained the essential parts, which is unusual in Crichton's book-to-movie transformations.  The book explained things a lot better and I could really connect with the book a little better.  I can connect with the movie, too, it's just that I needed to watch it several times before I understood exactly how everything happened the way it did. Watch this movie.  It has hardly any disappointment in it, if any.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The king of the monster sci-fi flicks, with the top director and athor in the field","""Jurassic Park"" clearly deserved all the awards it received for special effects - visual, sound and editing. The entire production team contributed to one of the best sci-fi films ever made. And, without a doubt, it's the best monster sci-fi film ever made well into the 21st century. I can't think of another creature feature that seemed so real. While CGI was obviously very important in making this picture, the realism has to be attributed as much to the fantastic models of the dinosaurs created for the film - especially the main villain, T-Rex.This film took the development and use of animatronics to a new level. These are robotic types of models able that can be moved, for sequences of shots that make them seem to come to life. The effect, with actual creations is much more realistic than CGI. People can see videos of the creation and making of T-Rex online. People can see videos of the creation and making of the big guy online.The basis of the film, and a succession of sequels and all sorts of spinoffs, of course is the 1990 novel of the same title by Michael Crichton. Crichton (1942-2008) was a Harvard Medical school graduate and M. D. But he never practiced medicine in favor of a flourishing, driven writing career. He was the master storyteller of sci-fi thrillers, especially plots around medicine and the physical sciences. Of his 26 novels, 13 have been made into films. He also wrote several original screenplays, and directed and produced films. His first smash film success was ""The Andromeda Strain"" of 1971. Jurassic Park is by far the most successful book and film, but his books by 2020 had sold more than 200 million copies.Crichton and Stephen Spielberg became friends while working on this and other films. While having great directing talent across many genres, Spielberg has had a particular flair for sci-fi films. The Jurassic Park series are the most prominent, but others of his productions include ""Firelight"" of 1964, ""E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" of 1982, ""Twilight Zone, The Movie"" of 1983, ""Gremlins"" of 1984, ""Back to the Future"" of 1985, ""Innerspace"" of 1987, ""batteries not included"" of 1987, and sequels of some of these and more.All of the aspects of this film are excellent. And all of the cast are superb. The plot is simple and while many, many more have reviewed and commented on this film, I decided this late just to give the recognition to the author and director, both of whom have a repertoire of films that will last and be enjoyed far into the future. And as for seeing this film, anyone who has not yet seen it on a theater screen should watch for any such opportunity in the future. This is the type of film that misses the grand scale of the subject on TV screens, even the large flat wall screens. Dinosaurs, especially in ""Jurassic Park,"" and its sequels, should be seen on the big screen for maximum enjoyment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely fantastic piece of moviemaking,"Okay, after writing reviews on The Lost World and JP3, and ranting and raving about just how awfully bad these movies are, especially compared to the prequel, finally I'll tell you just WHAT's so great about this movie. It's got everything. Yes, it has the, at the time spectacular and totally new dinosaur effects- but it also has great dialogue (bits of Malcolm's chaos theory strewn in without getting too scientific for a mainstream cinema audience- if you want the hardcore stuff, read Crichton's book-, Malcolm's sarcastic remarks), an INTERESTING STORY (it's the general idea of man trying control nature which goes wrong, but there are those subplots of Grant and children, Grant and technology, some rivalry between Malcolm and Grant, Hammond's not the greedy, nasty guy from the book [which is why he gets eaten in the book] but just an idealist trying to make his dream come true, and so on...), great music- it's just perfect. I've watched this film over and over and I love it every time. Someone reviewing TLW cleverly remarked that Jurassic Park has its fair share of plot holes too, only nobody seems to criticize them. Jurassic Park does have a fair share of ""flubs"" (there's a whole website dedicated to listing them), starting with the cliff that appears where the Rex paddock should have been, but also equipment seen in the background, crew seen in the background, robotic arms just disappearing, towels that suddenly change color, the emergency bunker directly next to the raptor paddock and so on and so on and so on. But these are not ""plot holes"", they're continuity issues, and sometimes smaller flaws of logic. ""The Lost World"", while I don't know how many of these smaller mistakes it has, already shows how acting, character development, dialogue and especially story move into the background and emphasis is on more dinosaur effects, more intense action scenes and mroe spectacular shots of people getting eaten, accompanied by a hearty ""CRUNCH"" of course. The first time I watched it, just after having seen JP3 I actually liked it, the second time I was more sceptical. There's a lot copied from JP (or Godzilla, or Hatari), and just about everything else is pretty stupid. (Hammond wants to show people dinosaurs for money, so for safety reasons he does this on a remote island with all sorts of security measures. Still, the project fails and the creatures break out and eat people. Now they have the brilliant idea of TAKING DINOSAURS ON THE AMERICAN MAINLAND to show them for money!!) And JP3 is merely a waste of time and money. It's got dinosaur effects and it's got action scenes but it's, if I may quote a newspaper critic, ""nothing but a slasher move, albeit with nonhuman villains"". Some STILL like this, say things like ""Gimme more dinos!"" or ""TLW didn't have enough blood and guts"" but this is what was so great about the first movie. It's got the effects PLUS characters you can identify with (in the sequels you don't give a damn who gets eaten. They could have eaten Goldblum's daughter for all I would have cared) PLUS an exciting storyline PLUS good dialogues PLUS the best soundtrack I've ever heard! But with a franchise like this they just can't help but squeeze money out of it until it's dead...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Dino-Mite!!,"Well, I have to hand it to Steven Spielberg, even though he often annoys me. He made us pay attention to archeology and the Ark Of The Covenant; he educated us on Great White Sharks;, a made us love an ugly little space alien and he even made Whoopi Goldberg look good. Wow, say what you will, the man has done some amazing things in the world of film. Here, he brings dinosaurs back to life and gives us another classic adventure story, unlike anything seen up to this time.I rank this one right up with the best of all-time among great adventure stories. Few people can forget how stunned they were when they viewed these life-like dinosaurs for the first time on screen. And who can forget the T-Rex in the first frightening scene and the Raptors in the last intense scene? This is truly memorable stuff. To this day, those scenes can still get your attention.The movie has always been fun to watch, and not just because of the thrills or special effects, of which there are too many to recite here. There is humor in here and characters are interesting, led by Richard Attenborough as the scientist who creates Jurassic Park. The kids in here - Joseph Mazello and Ariana Richards - do a fine job of acting, as good as the adults.This isn't perfect by any means. There are some negatives such as the usual Spielberg plugs for liberal/secular causes, but I'd rather keep this review on the positive side, since it was so entertaining and ground-breaking, in a way, with the special effects, plus anyone who is slightest bit interested has already seen this movie at least once and probably more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It's so tempting, and I can't help watch the dinosaurs roam around and eat people! I love it when the body parts fly from the dinosaur's mouth. All the blood and terrfied screams. The suspense just kills me. I will always watch this movie. It's a total classic. I seen all parts and it never gets old. The plot still thrills me. I just love it.

Not Made to Last,"Jurassic Park doesn't hold up against the test of time. Looking back at the plot you realize there barely is one. The movie establishes a good premise early on, but it doesn't succeed in exploring the possibilities that come along with it. The movie is really just a vehicle for the idea behind it instead of having a plot that succeeds in reaching all opportunities that the premise allows. A great example of a movie that does this is The Truman Show. It was very original from the start and had a plot that helped its premise stretch its legs. Jurassic Park's creators' only objective was to make money off of the world they set up around the movie. Second after that in their mind was to make a good movie. Hey, at least the special effects were good (for the time).",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Still incredible nearly 30 years on!,"When anyone asks what my favourite movie of all time, Jurassic Park is almost always amongst my first thoughts and it has remained that way since 1993.Maybe a slightly controversial opinion, but this is my favourite Spielberg movie and considering his body of work it's possibly the highest praise I could bestow upon it.Everything about it is near perfect, the effects, the cast, the story, the direction, the dialogue, the pacing, the ending. Obviously after 30 years the early computer effects do show a little age, but honestly they still hold up compared to modern movies. I'd say that is largely down to having a fantastic director at the helm and the fact they combined them with practical puppets/models. The lighting and using early CGI sparingly hides any major aging. Whereas newer films might have better effects but use so much that they can feel false, almost closer to a video game and you can still tell when they're in use. But here we're still on location and with the T-Rex paddock scene or the Triceratops those are still genuine practical effects, there is more reality because of that effort.Other than that, this movie will remain timeless it is one of very few movies that just has that level of quality. It's cliche but Steven Spielberg really has that golden touch, just think of how easy it would be to take the concept of a dinosaur island and make it too silly or a forgettable gore/horror movie. To make it into an all time classic is just true testament to the man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"30+ years later, still breathtaking...","There's nothing - absolutely nothing - that I can write down in a review for ""Jurassic Park"" that hasn't been said or printed thousands of times before. Spielberg's (and Crichton's) landmark is three decades old already, but still one of the most influential and inspirational movie-adventures ever made. This wonderful website alone holds nearly 1.500 praising reviews, it launched an incredibly popular franchise and countless of rip-offs, and since 1993 every kid in the world plays with dinosaur toys thanks to this film. ""Jurassic Park"" remains fantastic Sci-Fi/action entertainment, even after the 20th viewing.Oh wait, maybe there is something useful I can add! About the timelessness of ""Jurassic Park"". Yours truly is one of those annoying film-freaks who imposes his childhood favorites onto his own children, and I deeply desire that my offspring loves my favorites as much as I do. But with practically every film that I show to my children (aged 8 and 14), I always get the same comments: ""Dad, this movie is so old"". ""Those special effects look so fake"". ""This is boring"". Well, there was none of that during ""Jurassic Park"". More than 30 years after the special effects and dino-designs astounded 12-year-old me at the cinema, they still astound my demanding kids via the TV-screen.

The only people I think really stand out are Sam Neil, and Jeff Goldblum. The rest of the cast was kind of bland. The movie had weird pacing issues.

The Movie Event Of 1993.,"Continuing my plan to watch every Steven Spielberg movie in order, I come to 1993. The year of Spielberg and Jurassic ParkTHE movie of 1993. A true event movie. A 10/10 for me. I love this movie. So many memories. If Superman made me believe a man could fly, Jurassic Park made me believe dinosaurs can be brought back to life and run amok. There are some movies its hard to pick faults with. This is one such movie.All the cast are great Sam Niel is perfect as your typical Spielberg hero, the ordinary man who must do something extraordinary, Jeff Goldblum hits the right notes not delving into comedy relief, despite having the movies funniest lines, Laura Dern is an actress I really rate, she never puts a foot wrong in a movie. Though I have to admit, I never noticed the obvious ass shot until today!! Where have I been looking for 25 years?? And both kids (Arianna Richards and Joseph Mazello) are just the right amount of movie kid cute/curious/scared/resilient!! A hard balance to get right!!The special effects and CGI are almost faultless, with only one exception (the girl falling from the air vent) being obvious!! But that is seriously nitpicking!!And John Williams score!! WOW!! I love it.Jurassic Park scooped 3 Oscars and grossed $357 million at the domestic box office, to end 1993 as the highest grossing movie I'm of the year.

I thought this movie was great...when I was 12. Now I just point out all of it's flaws,"There are far too many errors in this movie. The T-Rex walks out of it's pen, then the jeep falls down a cliff at the same spot. The acting is the worst I've seen in any movie of the last 20 years. By definition, paleontologists mainly study geology of past periods, rather than biology. Thus, we can deduct that the main characters would be more surprised, or make more mention of- the dinosaurs physiological and anatomical attributes such as skin and eye color, body temperature, sounds, and overall appearance. The lumber some walking and bobbing of heads that Hollywood often adopts for dinosaurs is highly uncommon in modern cold blooded reptiles. Even the giant Gila Monsters move swiftly with grace and dexterity. The dramatic human like personalities of the dinosaurs is another purely Hollywood stunt. Yes, velociraptors may have the physiological ability to open a door, but without human reasoning, they wouldn't know ""why"" to open one. The biggest underlying question throughout the movie is ""why?"". Why do the dinosaurs want to kill? Why aren't the characters more surprised and ask more questions? Why are there kids on the island? Why did the director let so many slip-ups pass through the final cut? Why did the boy survive a 10,000 volt electric shock? Feel free to contact me at kingshive@yahoo.com PS Why'd they have to use Newman as Nedry??? Haha, I think he was the best actor in the movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Monster of All Monster Movies!,"The focus of Steven Spielberg's ground-breaking thrill-ride Jurassic Park, is a wondrous island theme park off the coast of Costa Rica populated by genetically engineered dinosaurs, masterminded by billionaire visionary John Hammond (a superlative Richard Attenborough), ready for business as soon as a handful of experts can declare it legally and naturally safe for paying customers. Soon we see a group of scientists head to Isla Nublar including paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), his paleobotanist colleague Ellie Satler (Laura Dern), and mathematician Ian Malcolm (a fast- talking, vintage Jeff Goldblum), a chaos theorist who recognizes that knowledge without discipline equals disaster. Of course he's right, and the park's maiden tour turns into a nightmare for the visitors, who include Hammond's two precocious grandchildren. Compounding this mayhem is the park's systems-control expert, who plots to sell dinosaur DNA to a rival corporation, and must sabotage park security to carry out his scheme. When a tropical storm threatens the island, our unscrupulous employee seizes the opportunity, leaving the billion-dollar attractions to roam free, as all hell breaks loose. What ensues is special-effects nirvana!Jurassic Park is an astonishing success in one sense and one sense only: It is the monster of all monster movies, guaranteed to challenge weak bladders and flutter heartbeats with its astounding full-size live-action mechanics and computer-generated imagery. But more than anything, it is Spielberg's pop culture wizardry that sells Jurassic Park. He retains a child-like glee in making us jump while giving flesh and blood characters the fright of their lives, with every mind-boggling moment of wonder and terror - from the gentle gracefulness of a gigantic Brachiosaurus walking across a green pasture to the horrifying attack of a T-Rex during a rainstorm to the first appearance of the dreaded Velociraptors. Spielberg orchestrates the action with effortless verve and, only the most Scrooge-like viewer will fail to be transfixed by the thrilling action and the sheer scale of the director's vision. T-Rex and his chums are indisputably the stars here but Jurassic Park is still a very character-driven movie, and part of what makes the film so successful is Spielberg's insistence that the dinosaurs may overrun the park, but never the film. Every character has something to do, and they are the focus of every scene with all actors pitching in commendable performances.Jurassic Park exists now as one of the pinnacles of popcorn cinema - a terrific thrill ride that is more than just the sum of its special effects. It may be easy to look at Jurassic Park as of a bygone era, but no rose-colored glasses or nostalgic impulses are needed to remain in astonishment at what Spielberg was able to create. It remains as potent an entertainment as ever - a watershed moment in cinematic history!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Classic that has stood the test of time!!,"Jurassic Park is an adaptation of the novel of the same name written by Michael Crichton. Even though the movie cuts various parts of the novel, it manages to capture the essence upon which the story is built.This movie combines elements of science fiction, horror, and suspense which makes this film a singular achievement in the realm of cinema. Despite the ubiquity of CGI in today's big budget blockbusters, no other movie has utilized visual effects more effectively to tell a story than Jurassic Park.The casting is so good that there is no element that can be criticized. Both the child actors do a wonderful job as they have as much screen time as their vastly experienced compatriots. John Williams, Steven Spielberg's frequent collaborator, has once again given an iconic score that has one of the most memorable tunes ever written.There is hardly any aspect of Jurassic Park that I did not enjoy. In the beginning, there is a genuine sense of wonder at the unbelievable feat of recreating dinosaurs. At the end, we dread the sight of these creatures due to several horrific incidents during the course of this movie.

A magnificent but fragile fantasy,"As other flicks in the hall of classics 'Jurassic Park' is a common reference between adults and children, but among film addicts it is also known for its incredible novelty and use of practical effects that defied any expectations.As a child, I was not that into dinosaurs but one thought of having a full park inhabited with those ancient lizards would stir up my blood and whirl my head. Stephen Spielberg has created a dream attraction that makes you regret that you are living in a wrong reality. However, not everything is so perfect and bright; you need to take care of your child or it will sneakily bite you and throw a bunch of unexpected surprises.The atmosphere of the film is the thing that glues my attention right away: you could see that the owner of the park cares about the park as for nothing else in his life and frankly I believe that this love comes directly from Stephen Spielberg. You could feel the touch and the struggle to make everything as real as possible, the music throws you at the state of admiring serenity with occasional moments of trembling tension that hold your breath without you even noticing it.For the cast, the picture is fairly good but still the conduct of the characters is extremely weird and unnatural, we will omit the behavior of Jeff Goldblum because he is an exceptional diamond that cannot be judged. Anyways the human part was overshadowed by the real heroes of the time - dinosaurs - the complex and, for sure, costly machinery paid back handsomely: even for the current standards it is considered as a masterpiece.Back from the messed up trip we go and I must say that the idea shines brighter than a sun, implementation is amazing, performance slightly limps behind but overall the motion picture for sure has to be on your home shelf with ""Cool stuff"" label on it, however, the fragility is that the older you are at the time of the first look, the less you are impressed by it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Iconic and Fun, Even if It's Not Your Thing","This week I've been watching the ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy in preparation for ""Jurassic World"" which hits theaters next weekend. I am ashamed to say that I've gone twenty-two years since this movie came out without ever having seen it. I think that likely had to do with the fact that I've just never been that big into dinosaurs, and so the general theme of the film just didn't appeal to me. Having watched it, I can say that I enjoyed it quite a bit.I'm giving the film an 8/10 stars, albeit with thoughts of giving it just a seven. I decided to go with the eight because I think that if I try to be as objective as possible, the film probably deserves that. It's an extremely well made film about the dangers of science run amok. The dinosaurs at times look a bit awkward, but, hey--it was 1993...animation and CGI effects have come a long way since then. Still, the film has aged relatively well. The story is good overall, and the acting is not half bad, though I would say that it has more of a feel of an 80's popcorn movie than a 90's blockbuster hit. Throughout the film I could see shades of ""The Goonies"" and ""E.T."" in Spielberg's filmmaking style.That said, my relative disinterest in the whole dinosaur vibe still was a bit of a wall toward getting into the film, which is why I say I toyed with the idea of only seven stars. But this movie is definitely fun and engaging, and I would recommend it to just about anyone. If you've never seen it before, you're sure to find yourself catching a scene or two that immediately screams ""classic movie moment"", and it's a great movie to just enjoy with the family for an evening of escapism from the real world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I fear that mass produced CGI is flooding the theatres these days with, in my opinion, unsatisfactory results.

A Well Loved Generational Shift Movie,"I recently had a conversation with a friend about the filmography of the great Steven Spielberg. My friend, who is considerably younger than me, tried to argue Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) was not the horrifying, stupefying train wreck that it was. While I could probably go into the technical reasons that movie is an abomination, my arguments were limited to a concentrated level of hatred indirectly flung at my friend with reckless abandon. I stopped myself before things got out of hand but I realized one thing; generational bias does matter when it comes to movies and our discussion hit a little too close to home.It matters for many when I say I prefer Jurassic Park (1993) over Jaws (1975). I'm not saying one is a better movie over the other, all I'm saying is I prefer the movie that first capitalized on my obsession with dinosaurs when I was six, over one I saw in high school because I wanted to be a Spielberg completest. I much rather watch the movie I saw peering through holes in my own clammy palms than the movie I tried figuring out ""what that guy was in."" To put it bluntly, in the imagination of the child I was and the child I still am inside, Jurassic Park is first in my heart.Jurassic Park is still the premier movie I recommend to Spielberg novices. It encompasses everything that artificially created the childhood of those raised in the nineties; a childlike sense of wonder, visionary special effects and a score by John Williams who composed the anthems of at least two generations. Additionally the film showcases the acting abilities of thespian veterans Richard Attenborough and Jeff Goldblum, familiar faces like Laura Dern, Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Night and strong novice performances by Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello.Under the surface of Jurassic Park lies its cautionary tale written by David Koepp and Michael Crichton. A modern retelling of Frankenstein only instead of one misunderstood ogre the characters are faced with a menagerie of primal monsters. That and the movie doesn't mind cranking the scare-meter up to eleven. Those who have seen the movie no doubt will instantly recall the scene with the children versus the velociraptors. It's a scene that would have made anyone in the audience scream lengthily along with Joseph Mazzello's character.Those who know me know I'm not a fan of the theme of science and technology overreaching and causing something horrific. If we were scared of every boogie man that could happen, we would have never left that cave. That's not to say we shouldn't acknowledge the dangers of bringing dinosaurs back from the dead. We should acknowledge that it's a double edged sword for sure. But there's no doubt that finding our limits is what makes humanity great and we shouldn't limit ourselves because Mary Shelley, Michael Crichton or Jerry Falwell tells us to.But if you're looking for deeper meanings in a Spielberg film (other than the phallic appearance of E.T.) you're trailing up the wrong Devil's Monument. Spielberg's main goal is to entertain. Does that make him a less talented or less important director? Does that make him a huckster of the Barnum Bailey variety? I would argue that film can be used as an art form, as a form of entertainment and/or a form of storytelling with many, many overlapping traditions in-between. If a director's intent is to tell a good story which is what Spielberg does, then who am I or anyone else to judge? Movies are the things of dreams and Spielberg doesn't cheat in giving you the goods.A great yarn, a pulse pounding theme park ride, a childhood memory; Jurassic Park is all that and more. It was a movie that intelligently combined the cheap thrills that made Jaws so daring and revolutionary, while smuggling in ethical quandaries about the darker side of scientific discovery. On a related note, those in the know, no doubt have heard about the mammoth they're planning on cloning. Regardless of the hardships experienced by the characters of Jurassic Park, who isn't excited to see something like that?http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of Spielberg's best; an exciting adventure,"It's been 5 years since I've seen this and today I re-visited this timeless classic. I never realised it was so exciting and a movie that just never gets old. Steven Spielberg adapts the novel faithfully and brings the dinosaurs to life with amazing technology which still amazes me to this day. John William's score is still as unforgettable as ever, it's just a really beautiful and moving score that suits the movie perfectly. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are perfect as the leads and Richard Attenborough is a great support.The standout here, though, are the special effects. The dinosaurs are re-created beautifully and all the action scenes are genuinely believable and never hokey. When this came out in 1993 audiences worldwide were amazed, they had never seen something so amazing and it topped the box-office (until Titanic arrived in 1997). This is truly the ultimate blockbuster and I don't think it can be beaten. This is a true cinematic gem and it is what entertainment is all about.4½/5",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A film that deserves better- give it a shot with open mind.,"Why the severe disdain for this film? Is it as good as the Spielberg films? No, but it doesn't try to be. Also- look at it from the filmmaker's perspective: You know this film is about dinosaurs chasing people, most of the cast is returning meaning they don't need to chart the backstory or waste time with character development. And this is what JP3 is- a taunt 90 odd minute thrill ride. The Dinos look great, the lush locations always impress and the pacing of the film is so good you'd be hard pressed to find where the time went. This is a good film and if you like the JP series or just love Dinosaurs you should watch Jurassic Park 3.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Creative for its time,Jurassic Park was a groundbreaking film when it was released. The computer animated generations were new at the time and would have blown a lot of people's minds. I've watched this film 28 years after its release and the graphics feel dated but I think (similar to Star Wars) there had never been anything made like this before. I can appreciate how huge and monumental this film would have been. I think its value in its creativity was a huge part in garnering so much of its praise.

cute to see dinosaurs and that's about it.,"It's so funny how different peoples' tastes are. When this movie first came out I went and saw it and my feelings haven't changed on it through the years. I basically moderately enjoyed it while I was watching it and then didn't think much about it. It didn't really stay with me.The main thing I liked about the movie is of coarse the amazing special effects. But in terms of the story itself I did not get to involved. Once the awe of the concept wore off, That was it. But perhaps that's because I'm not terribly into science fiction pictures anyway.I have certain friends who consider this a masterpiece. I will admit the special effects were amazing but I wouldn't consider it as a masterpiece, though it was definitely an extravaganza. And it is worth seeing for the rare Few who may not have seen it, particularly people who maybe into this type of flick.I'd give this about a 10 for the special effects (seeing dinosaurs running around was kind of cool) but I'd rate it only about a 5 or 6 or so for level of interest.

A fantastic film!,"What a movie! What a fabulous movie! Steven Spielberg does it once again with ""Jurassic Park."" He proves that he can do anything and that dinosaurs weren't monsters, they were animals. It may not be accurate to the book, but it's still a masterpiece.In case you don't know what it's about, it's about the idea of genetically enhanced dinosaurs who are engineered to be harmless, and how a group of scientists are invited to see them and judge them on how safe and how real they are. But, something goes wrong...and that's where the action comes in.One thing that I liked was Jeff Goldblum. He was always my favorite actor. I find him to be a natural actor and the way he delivers his lines is great. It's like he's not even sticking to the script, he's just making it up as he goes along.

The one that started it all,"This is the film that launched one of the most expensive and popular franchises of all time. 1993's ""Jurassic Park"" has spectacular special effects that still hold up today, a great cast, and suspense.Interestingly enough, the effects in this film are actually better than 2015's Jurassic World. This may be due to the actual use of animatronics in this one versus an abundance of CGI in the new film. The T Rex is frighteningly realistic and those raptors, Oh. My. God.Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough....ahhhh!! A stellar cast you won't find nowadays. And this coming from a huge Owen Grady fan. There was just something like Dr. Grant, Ellie Sattler, and Ian Malcolm. I loved these characters.The plotline here is more simplistic compared to later films. Power goes out on island. Scientists must figure out way to stop dinos. Oh, and there are kids running around the dino park with a guy who could care less about kids. But it worked. This is a very enjoyable film, even today.

"Mayhem, Mathmatics and Megasaurus Egos!","Jurassic Park taught us many things. It taught us that there is nothing scarier than being hunted by a giant wingless bird. It taught us that the T-Rex is a creature of such stealth that it can sneak into a building unnoticed to save the day. But most important of all, we learned from J-Park that the most formidable species to ever exist in this world was the ever adaptive egosaurus. And I'm not talking about prehistoric creatures, I'm talking about modern humanoids. There are three main subspecies that stand out in Jurassic Park. We have Hammond, the Deiasourus who thinks he's a God. There is Malcolm, aka Dr. Chaos, aka the Prophesaurus, who thinks he's the voice of truth and is so full of $#i+, he could probably benefit from an existential enema. And then there's Grant, the Academisaurus who thinks he's the voice of reason and logic. Unfortunately – SPOILERS - all three of these sores survive the carnage and show up for various sequels as well. I guess we're supposed to get some satisfaction out of watching a blood-sucking lawyer get turned into a dino's dinner while he sits on the crapper. Sam Jackson is here too. But unfortunately, you won't hear him say, ""I've had it with these futha muckin' dinosaurs in this futha muckin' park!"" No, the man plays it cool here. The plot is as follows: Hammond can't wait to show his dino pets to the world. He seems so giddy at the prospect that you sense he's gonna wet himself if he has to wait a day longer. But before he can have his grand opening, he must endure a lawyerly island evaluation and the unwanted knee grabs of a leathery mathematician. Hammond is a Scot intent on showing his guests a bloody good time. But for all the expense that he hasn't spared, it turns out that JP has a few glitches. But when things go wrong and Hammond's grandkids are almost eaten by a Tee'd off T-Rex, Hammond is careful not to overreact. ""It's just a delay,"" he says. What follows is a tyrannical trip through the dino dome as Samuel L. Jackson chain smokes, the sole Jurassic park ranger mopes around like he was rejected for the role of Crocodile Dundee and Laura Dern slaps the $#!t out of a log.

Breadth-taking and smart as well.,"The plot, though devoid of twists and turns, is competent enough. But that is not the point of the movie.

That don't impress me much,"So OK the song (by Shania Twain) came out 4 years after Jurassic Park was released, but I was aiming at what I felt back in the nineties when I watched the movie. I know that people are still (as they were back then) impressed by the visuals, which might have faded a bit since then, but still are decent. But the movie itself or the story it ""tries"" to tell is seriously flawed.But there is enough special effects moments and moments of suspense to cover anything up. Didn't work for me though, because I wanted and needed something more than just ""Dinosaurs for the first time feel like they could exist"" (read be in a movie and feel real). Again good job with that, but lacks in many other things (that's my humble opinion). So if you can't be swayed off your feet by the idea itself and start questioning the characters and their ability to think in general, you still might be swayed by some of the actors.

Dinosaurs and Directors,"Jurassic Park (1993) Steven SpielbergMovie ""Jurassic Park"" is considered by many a classic. This move made us jump out of our seats because of the dinosaurs. It also made us awe at the stunning visual effects that were way ahead of the time. The plot is that John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people to his new island on Isla Neblar to see his new attraction with living dinosaurs. The problem is that these dinosaurs are unpredictable and eventually break out. Steven Spielberg has done a great job at directing this movie and has given us a good look into the past, but is this movie actually good. Take away the nostalgic affect and critically compare this movie and its effect to others at the time. This movie blew our mind. Now 1993 was a great year for movie culture. There were many movies that came out such as ""The Sandlot"", ""The Nightmare before Christmas"" and even ""Mrs. Doubtfire"". Obviously there was some competition in that year but ""Jurassic Park"" blew these movies out of the water delving stunning cgi/animatronics. Although there was a lot of things done right with this movie it is not perfect. First of all this movie is not scientifically accurate. The Velociraptors as shown in the movie have a distinct lack in feathers and are estimated to be only about half a meter tall (1.7 inches). This movie may be inaccurate in some parts but it still blew our minds. I was only about a few years old when I first saw the movie and the thought of dinosaurs chasing people around just blew my mind. This movie may not be what the past was exactly but it delivers a good representation of what would happen if we tried to tame these beasts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

We had never seen something like it before on screen. It ushered in the concept of DNA to a wide audience in the most effective and believable way... and then there were the dinosaurs. Oooooh weee how about them dinosaurs. I'd never seen something so real on screen. This movie made believers out of everybody.

American cinema at its very best.,"The visualization is practically perfect, even 20 years later. It's because the CGI here is used in a discreet, moderate fashion and to give credibility to a fantasy, not to show you bullettime shots of the dinosaurs pores. Beyond doubt, it's visually fascinating, but Mr. Spielberg wisely remembers to use characters and performances to get you trough the plot, one that is based on ideas, research and fantasy. Thank you too Mr. Criton. Also perfection and imagination in detail seems natural for the director. A merely flawless piece.But Jurassic Park is not just good because the applied technology was revolutionary at the time, it's good because it serves an otherwise superbly crafted movie full of technical finesse. Spileberg shows, how to be not just ahead, but beyond your time. Not that technology did not advanced in the last two decades, but it's users generally degenerated and stupefy technological advancement to circus level and regarding the correct use of cgi in cinema Jurassic Park has yet to be matched.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A groundbreaking experience,"Steven Spielberg is a MASTER of filmmaking. This is common knowledge, he has proved it many times and especially with ""Jurassic Park"". It's a legendary blockbuster and was an amazing hit when it came out in 1993. It has been loved by audiences everywhere and it's a movie all 90s kids grew up with.The plot is that a rich man named John Hammond wants to open up a park with genetically made dinosaurs, but has to have the approval from a certain dinosaur expert named Alan Grant who reluctantly comes along and brings his girlfriend Ellie. He also got Dr. Ian Malcolm who is a mathematician studying chaos to come along to the island. This is where the adventure starts.I personally feel that he (vaguely) made ""Jurassic Park"" the same way he made ""Jaws"". Everybody is so excited to see the T-Rex and the shark but they find themselves more invested in the characters because they are amazingly written and fleshed out and the dialogue is perfect. As with Jaws, the dinosaurs doesn't have too much screen time which is good. It makes the scenes they are in much more special and let's us use more time on the amazing characters.The trouble of having an old movie which relies on dinosaurs is that it could easily look dated (like Jurassic Park 3 looks now), but this movie holds up amazingly well. Steven Spielberg shows again that he is a master by only using CGI in the wide shots and using an animatronic in the closeups. This makes the dinosaur look real and even 23 years later it feels real.The score is probably my favorite score of all time, i like it better than jaws, Indiana Jones and maybe even Star Wars. It's John Williams at his best. Everything in Jurassic Park is as close to perfect as i could want it and it is a movie everybody should see.Please enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The groundbreaking effects work is the king of this park,"With Jurassic Park, director Steven Spielberg made a film that became the new yardstick for cinematic special effects back in 1993. In fact, the ground-breaking CGI work used here to bring dinosaurs to life before our eyes is still very impressive over twenty years after its release, so you can only imagine the impact that they had back in the day. Truthfully, the effects work is by far the most impressive thing about this one, as it has a fairly by-the-numbers story-line populated with clichéd characters. A select group of people are invited to an island retreat owned by a millionaire who has been able to recreate living dinosaurs from ancient DNA. It's here that he intends to give an early tour of his planned new resort, Jurassic Park; the trouble is that things go wrong and the dinosaurs go on the rampage.This was adapted from a Michael Crichton novel of the same name. I've read the book and seem to think that the novel and film are at the very least broadly similar. It's the second film from the pen of Crichton based on the very specific sci-fi idea of a futuristic high-tech amusement park going fatally wrong, leaving the humans to battle the dangerous inhabitants of the park; the other film of course was Westworld (1973), where it was deadly androids who filled the same roles as the dinosaurs do here. Both films speculate on questions regarding the dangers of man tampering with science in careless ways. For me Westworld is the better film but I do still enjoy Spielberg's dinosaur blockbuster. The effects work are worth the price of admission alone of course but the story-line and characters, while being extremely standard, do still get us from A to B and allow us to seamlessly experience the deadly wonders on hand in the park. It's a pretty solidly entertaining piece on the whole and one of Spielberg's better out-and-out popcorn movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nothing HAPPENS in this movie!,"Two hours worth of vintage special effects, the likes have which have never been placed on screen, are corrupted by screenwriters Michael Crichton (who authored the book) and David Koepp's refusal to incorporate anything remotely resembling a plot or characters. Crichton's book, which was tedious but rich with characterizations and scientific plausibility (without being overly technical) gives way to a script in which the characters have no personalities, the scientists have no backgrounds to bring them or their ideas to this point, and the dinosaurs are, for all intents and purposes, just THERE. You can say all you want about how wonderful it was be frightened to death by real-looking dinosaurs (would you really know one if you saw it?), but even ""Land of the Lost,"" a 1970's Sat. morning live-actioner about a man and two children (his own) transported back in time and trying to survive amid free-roaming dinosaurs, had more of a plot than this garbage. And for all the hype about visuals, I, for one, would like to think we still go to the movies to be drawn into another world and other lives, not just an amusement park. Look for a few good one-liners out of Jeff Goldblum as chaos-theorist Ian Malcolm (allegedly based on at least one real-world ecologist), and completely lifeless performances from the otherwise reliable Sam Neill, Samuel L. Jackson and actor-turned-Gandhi-director Richard Attenborough, as well as non-actress Laura Dern.

In his blockbusters he always puts the fun of the movie ahead of the logic of the movie, but always in a way that doesn't betray the other parts of the film which make it fun. This is what makes him the master.There are directors with higher box office totals, more awards, and higher rotten tomatoes ratings, but none of them create the holistic works that Spielberg does.

Immerseful,"The story of Jurassic Park is certainly a unique one, and is based on the book of the same name by Michael Crichton. The creative world of Jurassic Park shows us one possibility of how dinosaurs would live if they existed in modern society. Though the science of it isn't very convincing, they did a great job at creating a scientific sort of atmosphere.Adding to that, the cast fits well into their roles, and the acting is pretty good. Sam Neill is a little expressionless and mumbles quite a bit, but is otherwise a good fit for his character. Larura Dern gives a great performance, and I especially like her rebuttals in the face of sexism. However, Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello, who play the grandchildren, are pretty much the only ones who react like they should when faced with a dinosaur- that is, with fright and terror. Jeff Golblum seems to be there only for comic relief, and mostly delivers his lines awkwardly.Surprisingly, the visuals for this film is very realistic and not at all like I would have imagined a 90's film to be. Not like some films with horrible CGI work, the film-makers and animators of Jurassic Park went through extensive renderings and scans to compile realistic visuals and movements of the dinosaurs. Some action is obviously fake, but overall, this film had great visual effects.Finally, the soundtrack for the film is amazing, with each song fitting into the setting of the scene perfectly. The suspenseful and thrilling scenes have music that aids in giving the audience that sense of anticipation. In some scenes the music is a little cheeky in that the film-makers are deliberately letting you know that something is going to happen, and is aware that you know.Overall, a fun film with excellent production quality and great directing. A film worthy of being in the 'classics' category.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pure excellence,"Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite films. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if it was in every single human being on the face of the earth's top 10 of all time. Jurassic Park was way ahead of its time, and is exactly how a blockbuster is made. I was lucky enough to see the re- release of Jurassic Park for its 20th anniversary. To my supprisement, they were not re-releasing it in 3D, which was also pretty good.The reason why I love Jurassic Park so much is because its completely perfect in every sense of the word. Steven Spielberg's classic will always be amongst the greatest Sci Fi, adventure films of all time. Brilliant structured story, great character development, amazing special effects and sound mixing, very interesting characters and brilliant filmaking.I would highly recommend Jurassic Park to anyone who is a fan of Spielberg and Sci fi films. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Timeless Classic,"Jurassic Park is by far the best movie I have ever seen.  Even now, when the film itself is over 6 years old, it still captivates the mind with every viewing.  The special effects are still mesmerizing, the awe of the scientists as they see the living dinosaurs for the first time is still believable, the terror of the kids in the midst of premordial danger is still felt.  Three cheers and four stars for this timeless classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
CGI is the star of this show,"The visual effects really are the star of the show here. The audiences continued fascination with dinosaurs has made this film a hit. Aside from the effects and CGI this film is pretty tired. There is no character development and the adults behave just like the children which seems a little strange. There isn't a lot of personality here and when the Dinosaurs are not on display it tends to be a bit boring with very one dimensional characters. I remember at the time expecting way more from Steven Spielberg and his amazing Directing abilities from his previous films, JAWS and close encounters to name a few. If CGI is your thing and animatronics are fascinating for you then this is your film. If you are looking for a tight little story with great characters, not so much. Overall it's a pretty inoffensive film so watch and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Awe-Inspiring Thriller,"I have yet to see a movie whose practical and CGI effects have aged as beautifully as Jurassic Park. This film also brings a sort of thoughtfulness that similar science fiction adaptations often neglect. While much of the movie showcases the violence and chaos that resulted from the hubris of Hammond, it also gives viewers a chance to feel the awe of the paleontologists when they first glimpse the living flesh of the fossils they had studied for decades. The low camera angles in most of the scenes let the viewer feel as though they are in the park, gazing up at the Brontosaurus for the first time. The ""evil"" in this film is not the dinosaurs, but rather the individuals trying to exploit them for monetary gain and power. It showcases the folly of man's arrogance in their attempt to control and breed creatures who thrived millions of years longer than humans, and continue to adapt despite their efforts to control them. ""Life finds a way"" despite all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic Park,"This time Steven Spielberg makes a movie about dinosaurs. He made some films about aliens, about sharks, and about action heroes before, and now he's made a film about dinosaurs. If you can't tell, I'm pretty apprehensive about this movie. I didn't like this movie. No, actually, it was okay. It was just too mawkishly sentimental for my tastes. Spielberg has obviously become the master at manipulating emotions as scene after scene barrages the viewer with images that breathe too sickly sweet in my face. Behind the excitement of a movie about nature running wild lies the heavy-handed morals of the film: stealing and double crossing is punishable by the innocent and unguided forces of nature, money is a corruptible power, sometimes nature might be better left untouched, and keeping the family unit intact is priority number one, as is always the case in all of Spielberg's movies. But in the foreground of all of that morality is this awesome visual roller coaster ride filled with some of the most breathtaking computer video images and hand crafted puppetry I have ever seen. It's a toss up. I can take those images of the ""Jurassic Park"" banner falling around the tyrannosaurus rex being attacked by raptors on one side and compare that to the image of a tyrannosaurus rex chasing one of the jeeps in the rear view mirror with the words ""object in mirror may be closer than it appears"" on the other. Those are some cool images, but one smacks of contrived metaphor and the other screams with raw power juxtaposed with situational irony. I'll always respect Spielberg as one of cinema's powerhouse figures, but there will always be something to disagree about. On the disc with the movie were a number of behind the scenes featurettes including Spielberg with his creative team planning out images from the movie in pre-production, as well as a perfectly matched stop motion animation mock up of the raptor hunt scene in the kitchen. I would personally love to see someone take the whole movie and turn it into this kind of film-making. Picked this up at the University library.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Almost totally forgettable,"After 7 years, the only thing I remember about this movie was the near-cameo appearance of Samuel L. Jackson (pre ""Pulp Fiction"", no less), as the chain-smoking programmer who derides the nerd who programmed the JP systems (a character The Simpsons crew must have had in mind when creating ""Comic Book Guy"").  Loved his reaction to the Quicktime movie that nerd-boy had programmed to play if someone unauthorized tried to log in (unprintable here).  I've worked with both ""hard-boiled chain-smoking programmer"" and ""eternally self-important and irritating nerdboy.""  Give me a staff of the former any day of the week.Oh yeah, I remember some part where a guy in an outhouse got killed when a dinosaur sat on it.  That was pretty funny.

Spielberg Suspense Thrill Ride,"Despite being not as good as the incredible book by Michael Crichton (largely due to Spielberg's concerns over what could be filmed at the time), this is nonetheless a highly entertaining thrill ride, with dinosaurs that looked stunning in 1993, and, while they still look amazing execution-wise, design-wise they are really showing their age (we know much more about dinosaurs now), but the film is so good it scarcely matters.Steven Spielberg delivers his usual thrill-a-minute style in spades here, and everything he did in this film showcased that he was really at the peak of his career. This movie is a blast. If you've somehow never seen it, you absolutely should.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great Film overall,"Jurassic Park is a 90s adventure film and is part of a four movies series. It was directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Sam Neill and Laura Dern. The plot is fantastic and was well thought. It is about a rich man who decides to invest in a revolutionary development by some great scientists. It consists of getting Jurassic mosquitos that bit dinosaurs in order to acquire their genes. This would lead them to bring dinosaurs to the present time. So he asks a few archeologists to approve a kind of dinosaurs zoo, it will not end well. The cinematography is excellent. In one scene, some kids are hiding from two lethal dinosaurs. In another, you can see how a dinosaur is being born. This movie may sometimes be harsh and maybe scary for kids under 8. However, if you are a teenager or an adult that loves suspense and thrilling movies, you'll love it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My favourite film,"I´m sorry for my English, I think you will find a few mistakes in my comment. But now I start the comment: Jurasssic Park. That´s ( one of ) my favourite film(s) of all time. I loved it from beginning to the end, esspecially the scene which in the T-rex  comes out of his area and starts to hunt the people. The action is great, the music too, Steven Spielberg ( the best director ever )does ( again ) a great job,the special effects are well-made, of course, too and just everything is great. I´ve only seen one Steven Spielberg film which I didn´t like, and that´s Close Encounters of the third kind. But all the other films of him ( Indy 1 - 3, Jaws, Duel, Jurassic Park 1 & 2, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, SCHINDLER´S LIST ) impressed me a lot. I don´t understand why this film doesn´t get the Top250. I don´t understand why films like L.A.Confidential,Touch of Evil, The Godfather Part II, and get the Top250, but not this film. I´ve been interested in Dinosaurs my whole life and so this film is of course great. This isn´t anything like King Kong or Godzilla: The monster(s) must be killed, because we are human and we have the best technology of the world, we can win against the nature ( that´s no English I think ) and so on. This film shows that the dinosaurs are also animals like dogs, cats or fish ( but not sharks ). If you haven´t seen this film yet, GO AND SEE IT ! ! !",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spielberg's greatest masterpiece of adventure and thrills,"Welcome to Jurassic Park! I love Jurassic Park when I was a kid and to this day. When I watched the film, my eyes were wide opened. T-Rex is my favorite killing dinosaur. There were great thrills with the T-Rex and raptors. John Williams is a pure genius when he composed the soundtrack of the entire movie. Jeff Goldblum was hilarious as Ian Malcolm. Ariana Richards who played Lex got her screaming skill from the legendary Fay Wray. I saw that from behind the scenes that Wray was on set. Stan Winston was incredible at his work on setting up the dinosaurs.I did see The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 3. I also viewed the first two Jurassic World films. The third Jurassic World film is coming soon.Jurassic Park. What can I say? The greatest film in 1993.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A masterpiece!,"When I first saw this movie in 1993, it was breathtaking, even for me at 6 years old!!! Never before had they looked so real. This movie would later spawn 2 sequels, and possibly another soon. What was so great about this film was it's feel. It had a feeling that made you want to watch in awe and excitement. The dinosaurs were acting like animals, not monters. The cast was great, especially Sam Neill, who played Dr. Alan Grant (Also in Jurassic Park III, which I loved!). Grant, and Dr. Ellie Sattler are getting their digsite funded for 3 years if theu accompany John Hammond on a toure of his island. His park, which they really don't know what's about. When they find out they sit their with awe and wonder, asking themselves they they could ever do that. But it soon becomes clear (Dinosaurs in fences, living like they should and not one of them escaping) that it's too good to be true! The park shuts down. Electricity off. And in the Tyrannosaur paddock the group was stopped. Never before had a film ever been so great in the ealry 90's. It's truly one of the best classics that's ever walked the earth in 65,000,000 years! this is never going to extinct! ***1/2 out of ****",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Still Epic!!,"I watched this movie for the hundredth time the other day because of course it was on TV. With Jurassic World now out and having a massive box office success, I thought I would review this movie next. It of course is about some dino experts, programmers, financial men, and Jeff Goldblum (he is hysterical in this movie) that come to the island and review it to make sure it is safe and correct for the rest of the world if they were to open it up as a park. Of course the dinosaurs get loose and run a muck, forcing the characters to survive with deadly dinosaurs.Jurassic Park, after all these years, is still as big and as epic as the first day it came out in June of 1993. The wonder an amazement still works fabulously and all the dinosaur moments are gripping and intense. The characters are still interesting and like-able. There isn't really much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. The effects are great and the direction is spot on by Spielberg.If you are looking for a fun action packed movie then be sure to check out this colossal film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I want to see Tertiary Park,"I'm amazed how badly this film has aged - it's only been six years.  I enjoyed it back in 1993, but on seeing it again last night all manner of uncharitable thoughts kept popping into my head, chief among them the impression that Spielberg, who had lavished so much effort on `Jaws', just wasn't trying.The dinosaur mystique is hard for me to understand.  Sure, they're fantastic beasties, but so are many other extinct animals; and if I had a choice I'd rather pay to see a mammoth, or a giant wombat, or a tiny Eocene horse.  But PART of the dinosaur mystique is bound up with the idea of a lost world. That's what really thrills people about `King Kong'.  The island Spielberg's dinosaurs occupy, by contrast, is prosaic and modern.  No doubt it was a deliberate artistic decision to combine dinosaurs with cars, electric fences, cafés and air vents, but it's hard to find two consecutive shots that don't remind us of the modern world in some way, most of the charm of the creatures is thereby lost.  This is the more inexcusable in a film that throws everything else to the winds - story, character, wit, plausibility - to concentrate on the strangely attractive flavour of dinosaurs.As for the dinosaurs ... Some time before `Jurassic Park' there was the Cambrian explosion, when all manner of special effects techniques proliferated; after `Jurassic Park' all, with the exception of computer animation, became extinct, or virtually extinct.  It's not the film's fault. Most of the dinosaurs on display did NOT originate in the belly of a computer; those that did look neither better nor worse than those that did not.  The computer animation is more than adequate but charmless, with something subtly but deeply wrong - exactly like all subsequent computer animation.  The art hasn't progressed.  `Jurassic Park' is still as good as it gets.So far, so bland: what's intolerable is the preaching.  This was the only thing that irritated me in 1993 and it irritates me more now.  The moral of the story, with which we are repeatedly bludgeoned, is twofold: (a) people who think they don't like children are either mistaken or villains, in either case in need of therapy; and (b) man should not play God - any attempt to develop some biological science will strike us down, because of chaos theory, or quantum mechanics, or some such.  This is all piffle.  But it's not the ridiculous messages that annoys me: it's the fact that I'm being preached to AT ALL, and so clumsily.  (Did you, too, develop a desire to throttle Jeff Goldblum in mid-speech?  I hope so.)  `Jaws' didn't pretend that it was a statement about how we will be struck down by divine anger if we arrogantly disregard nature and go swimming at the beach.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of My Favorite Movies Period,"Jurassic Park is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of all time. If I made a list of my favorite movies Jurassic Park would be in the top twenty or even top ten. It's an amazing experience that everyone should see if you love cinema. The characters are great and fun, it's grand, it's suspenseful, and the effects look monumental. These are among some of the best effects I've seen on film.The music is also iconic and has a lot to do with why the film is as good as it is. John Williams, in my opinion, is the greatest composer to come out of Hollywood. He's done some of the most iconic themes in movies. You have Jurassic Park, The Lost World, The Star Wars films, The Indiana Jones films, Superman The Movie, Home Alone, among others. He is a legend in the world of music.The cast is great as well. I often feel like these people are very underappreciated. Of everyone in the cast the one who has gone on to do the most by far is Samuel L. Jackson. Jeff Goldblum was big for a bit after this film but he pretty much went nowhere by the 2000s. He also gets a lot of crap from critics now which I feel is undeserved as I actually like him as an actor.Sam Neil hasn't done much either in the 2000s at least as far as American films go. He's done some TV shows which went nowhere. I feel he's one of the most underappreciated actors as he's personally one of my favorites.The same applies with Laura Dern who's probably one of my favorite actresses. Richard Attenborough also does a great job as John Hammond. He is greatly missed. The rest of the cast does good work as well.Overall, if you want a grand and epic experience or just want to see a great monster movie than here you are. Hell, if you're a fan of dinosaurs in general than this is the movie to watch. This and Land Before Time made me fascinated with dinosaurs as a kid. It was one of my favorite films then and now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Majestic Spectacle of Film,"A game-changing masterpiece in film, Steven Spielberg brings dinosaurs back to life before your eyes with ground-breaking special effects and a genius for intense and exciting film-making. Its not just about having big scary monsters stomping around, Jurassic Park gives the dinosaurs a transfixing majesty and wonder that its sequels would fail to grasp. This film goes beyond being just another monster movie, with more character and more heart than any others in the genre, dealing with themes of ambition and the consequences of playing God with nature. With an exceptional score by the legendary John Williams which further drives home the feelings of swaying melodic wonder, this film may well be the reason I have such high standards when it comes to film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just as magical now as when it was released,"I was too young to watch it in 1993 but I remember the huge hype and marketing that came along with this movie. We kids even had jurassic park backpacks without having seen the movie - they simply looked so cool. It puts a big smile on my face watching nowadays the scene where they show the merchandise. I bet all that stuff was actually put on the market when the film was first released.I only saw the movie on TV a few years later, but the special effects were and still are absolutely amazing even on the small screen. The excellent casting, top acting and Spielberg's great directing make us experience the movie through the eyes of the cast. At first we're amazed by the gigantic and beautiful dinosaurs, later we fear with the cast for their lives.The movie still looks and feels amazing more than 20 years after its release. Several things it does so much better than most other big action movies: The kids aren't annoying. Their acting - especially the girl's - is great. The dialogues are written with great care and the characters feel like real people. I can't pick a favourite character or actor in this movie, I liked them all. There is no needless display of violence. People die, but you never see it directly. The film knows that it works well as a thriller without descending to cheap gory effects. There is a reason though why this is rated PG-13 and I would not advise to show it to younger kids.One of Spielberg's best, this is one all time classic and if you haven't seen it you definitely should.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Impressive, even if you are watching the film for the first time 30 years after its release","Summary: In the end, I end up with 8/10 of points and can say, even without emotional attachment, that Jurassic Park is an absolute highlight and is rightly considered a classic in film history. I can also say to anyone who didn't grow up with it like I did: watch this film. The story is very cool, the characters strong, the camera and effects impressive and the soundtrack unsurpassed. Deductions are made for the simplicity of the story, the slightly too long running time and the fact that I don't feel emotionally connected to the film, but that's not the film's fault.Detailed: I must confess that I had never seen a Jurassic Park film until now because I was born much later and never got around to watching this classic. Now that Jurassic World 3 is about to be released in cinemas, I've made it a point to watch the whole series in advance and after the first part I have to say: I didn't think I'd like the franchise so much.The scenario evokes a total childlike fascination in me. A huge, unexplored island on which a park is to be opened. This basic story is simply cool. Yet I'm not even the biggest fan of dinosaurs and had little fascination for them when I was a child. But bringing the dinosaurs into the present day is an idea that I find quite exciting. The story is not earth-shattering, but rather classic dramaturgical, but it is simply fun to watch this film and that is enough. I was absolutely not inclined to look at the clock, but sat really spellbound in front of the TV. That is a very good sign.The characters are well done overall. In the first part of the film I still had the feeling that they weren't particularly approachable, but in the course of the film you really come to love the explorer couple and the park manager. I especially like the chemistry between the children and Dr Alan Grant. I can't really agree with the criticism that the children are annoying. I actually think they are pretty cool.The atmosphere within the film is really strong and even by today's standards the film still manages to build up tension. The camera angles and animations have aged really well. Only a few films that are almost 30 years old manage that. Add to that the incredible music by John Williams. It is really impressive how catchy and fitting the melodies are.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Watson & Crick discover double-helix structure of DNA on February 28th, 1953","Jurassic Park (1993), became a phenomenon, because of its director, Steven Spielberg. Also, the source material, from a novel of the same name, by Michael Crichton, is adapted to screen so well, because of the advances in CGI technology, that debuted around this time. It's also to note, that the performances of the excellent cast completely help sell the tension, fear and unknown, that the characters have to face.The film is full of action, in-between a dazzling story about, man tampering with nature, trying to play God. It is a concept that goes all the way back to Mary Shelley. In this case, tampering with DNA, by successfully cloning dinosaurs and letting them live in the middle of a theme park. You then add in Spielberg-faithful, John Williams, majestic trumpets and you have a perfect film. This film tends to appeal to a wide range of audiences. It doesn't just, tickle the heck, out of science fiction fans. It is enjoyed by many. That is what makes it the mot special, because it is something everyone can enjoy.Jurassic Park (1993), played a huge role in film history, as being one of the earliest films to influence the arrival of digital CGI effects.

Jurassic Park,"During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.Jurassic Park is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough. When I first saw this film it was the most mind blowing film I had ever experienced. On paper, the movie was made for Steven Spielberg: combining the scares of Jaws with the high tech, romance of E.T the Extra-Terrestrial , Close Encounters of the Third Kind and of course adding the challenge of creating the dinosaurs themselves. This 1993 dino-fest, has gone down in movie history as the film that cracked open the Pandora's box of cgi. This film is a true movie milestone, a real experience and it made an entire generation of children fall in love with dinosaurs. Jurassic Park changed the entire game of film making for ever, creating cgi dinosaurs that still holds up 20 years from then: good work Steven! He steped the bar so high that it's still there today. Michael Crichton who co-wrote the film with David Koepp presents his story on a fascinating and detailed note on both the possibilities and evils of modern science. Moreover, characters are all very good as each one of them have something special that make them human. Sam Neill isn't particularly close to children, Laura Dern actually has a strong female role and has a good chemistry with both Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum; who is one of those supporting characters that steals the entire show. Jeff Goldblum character is so much fun, he's smooth and smart, not this goofy guy that pops jokes every once in a while. Ian Malcolm is actually a well written character with a great brain and he seems to foreshadow what is going to happen. Plus, Richard Attenborough's character has so many layers which is very interesting. Each one of them are important and not just funny, they are likable characters who seems like real people with backgrounds and who all relate to the story. ""Welcome to Jurassic Park"" doesn't quite cover it. Spielberg did such a good job engrossing us into this world. From just a visual and technical aspect this film is near flawless. Watching this film 22 years later, there obviously some point where you can tell it's cgi but for the 95% of the film the cgi is still outstanding. The realism with which they were able to create those dinosaurs is amazing. They are all indeed a triumph of special effects artistry. Steven Spielberg created one of the most jaw-dropping scene in movie history. The brachiosaurs Neill and Dern see for the first time are tall, majestic leaf-eaters, grazing placidly in the treetops. There is a sense of grandeur to them. Half of that is due to John Williams brilliant theme. This music is fantastic! I love it so much, I may even love it more than Star Wars. This very scene when Sam Neill stares at them, with this music, at that point everything's okay with the world. Everything's perfect. We don't make movies like this anymore. That kind of silence in a movie when a character stares at something and the music swipes you into it. I miss that awe. Nowadays most of the movies are so quick-edited, so packaged and ready to be delivered on a theatre, so an audience could sit there and not be bored. This movie takes its time to tell a story, get you to the characters, make you understand the plot and then the dinosaurs are everywhere. Clearly dinosaurs dominate Jurassic Park in every way. Amazingly graceful and convincing, they set a sky-high new standard for computer generated special effects. They create a triumphant illusion. You believe you have spent some time in a dino-filled world. Plus, Spielberg built up an imminent sense of threat over the first hour of the movie. In fact, Jurassic Park keeps its viewers on edge of their seats while leaving the real violence to the imagination. Besides, this film has the best jump scares ever, that I won't spoil if you didn't already see the movie (but if you don't I beg you to), because Spielberg didn't go for the numb cliché. He knows how to create legitimate tension in his film and it's not just the tension in the last half which is so fun and impressive but the sustain wonder through the entire first half of the film. Two set pieces ares especially effective: the first one is a scene where a T-Rex mauls a car with screaming children inside, and the other one is when the children play hide and seek with two velociraptors in the park's kitchen. Everybody can stage a fight, but it takes Mr Steven Spielberg to show just how the plots and pans might go flying at the stroke of a velociraptor's tail. This scene also helps to look at the bigger picture. Who but Steven Spielberg could convince an audience that there are dinosaurs loose in a kitchen at all? Jurassic Park smacks everyone in the face with awe, imagination, and all the things that are the reasons why movies are made. Tastes in movies are subjective but in my opinion the answer to: why movies are made? Definitely is movies such as Jurassic Park, Star Wars or even recently Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy.Overall Steven Spielberg, the man who invented the summer event movie took Michael Crichton's book and transformed it into an awe-inspiring legendary blockbuster, using every inch of the screen he was given with cool characters, impressive cgi, wonder and danger. Jurassic Park changed entertainment at a genetic level.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Some Of Steven Spielbergs Finest,","Jurassic Park is a brilliant movie with a great storyline,characters,cast,thrills and suspense.The film was directed by Steven Spielberg,I,like many movie buffs,am a huge fan of him.No movie this man has directed,wrote or produced has disappointed me (some exceptions but,whatever).This movie is brilliant and there where two other installments,The Lost World:Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 3,they where nowhere as good as the original,but,Steven Spielberg is currently in talks for a fourth Jurassic Park,and it seems very likely that there will be one by 2014.I will definitely go see one,I don't wanna give my hopes up but I for some reason feel it will be better than the second and third,lets hope so.A man takes a preview of a new theme park with his family that he is positive to sponsor.The theme park involves real cloned dinosaurs,trapped in cages.But after a power breakdown,the dinosaurs escape,and no one is safe.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of Speilburg's best,"Almost 30 years later this movie looks stunning and has become one of the most iconic films ever. A lot of my love for the film came from being a dinosaur kid, but it's still a great film. The characters are all so much fun (except Dennis, his character sucks) and all have such unique traits that all come back in some way. The music is stunning (but you already knew that) and so is the concept of a dinosaur theme park. If only I could truly visit this place. 9.9/10 a Spielberg masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Groundbreaking classic,"This is an almost a perfect movie. Terrific cast, great story, action, adventure, suspense, humor. This is one of those movies that changed cinema forever.

"Groundbreaking, but slightly dated now...","I think Spielberg is hit and miss. This one is a hit.The hype, when this film first came out, was justified, and the film still stands out today as an example of technological achievement.The cast is okay, and the storyline is believable most of the time.The film isn't just a mash up of computer-generated dinosaurs eating people. It poses serious questions about playing God, and mankind's right to alter what they do not comprehend. The dinosaurs eating people makes it even better! The action is terrific and there are numerous moments in the film when the suspense is unbearable. Spielberg has done a lot of good in this one. It's Jaws for the nineties, as far as advancements in special effects go.The only negative point is that the film has dated somewhat. The films that have followed it, have broken new ground, but could not have done it without this movie having been made.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best blockbusters ever.,"There's a line in a trailer for the upcoming sequel Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in which Chris Pratt's Owen Grady asks, ""do you remember the first time you saw a dinosaur?""I do.It was twenty-five years ago, back in 1993, when I watched the original Jurassic Park in theaters for the first time. I was nine years old, and the dinosaurs seemed so real. It wasn't so much the CGI, though that was state-of-the-art and holds up shockingly well. It was the wonder of seeing something for the first time, the spectacle and power of prehistoric life on the big screen.With that in mind, and the imminent arrival of said sequel, it felt more than appropriate to revisit Jurassic Park as it celebrates its silver jubilee.The movie was such a landmark, its easy to forget it was based on an equally successful book by Michael Crichton. The relatively simple story didn't change much from page to screen. You all know it anyway:Idealistic promoter recreates hundreds of dinosaurs with preserved mosquito blood; group of scientists travels to exotic island for sneak peak at theme park of the resurrected beasts; things go terribly wrong; those visitors that don't get eaten spend the remaining time running and screaming.It's funny-based on this description, the movie sounds like a disposable piece of horror schlock. Nothing could be further from the truth. But how?Let's start with the most obvious reason-it was directed by Steven Spielberg. And this at a time when he was in his prime, the king of Hollywood. He'd already made Jaws and E.T., and still had future hits like Saving Private Ryan and Lincoln to come. But while he delivered with expected, well-rounded expertise, there's one aspect of Spielberg's approach that's worth highlighting above all others.It stems from the fact that Jurassic Park the novel is darker and more violent than the movie. In fact, James Cameron (The Terminator, Aliens) nearly nabbed the rights to direct the film instead. By his own admission, his version would've been more intense and graphic-closer to the source material, and almost certainly rated R.That would've been interesting, but hardly suitable for most nine-year-olds. That's where Spielberg comes in. As with Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark and War of the Worlds, he possesses the special ability to create tension for all ages. Whether a child or adult, when you watch his movies your pulse is racing, nerves consistently brought to the brink but never over the edge. You leave the theater not afraid, but exhilarated, a smile of sheer energy spread across your face.But he doesn't do it alone. There are so many other reasons why, a quarter-century later, Jurassic Park still feels new. Take John Williams' legendary score, which nearly upstaged the dinosaurs themselves and remains popular today. Or the way David Koepp's underrated script peppers in saving doses of humor (""I'm always on the lookout for the next ex-Mrs. Malcolm"").Who were Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum before this movie? Certainly not household names. They were never really movie stars, either. Instead, they were-and are-skilled actors that lend Jurassic Park an envious on-screen pedigree among summer blockbusters. And despite many modern complaints of 'annoying' child stars, Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello have consistently avoided such a label. The credit is theirs, displaying a genuine combination of fascination and fear, making them simply what every actor hopes to be-part of the movie.Like Star Wars, Terminator 2 and Toy Story, Jurassic Park broke technological ground. But also like those movies, it connected with its audience beyond mere scale and pixels. This is why, twenty-five years later, we keep coming back to the original. And why its next twenty-five will roar just as loudly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A good movie, with some suspense.","This film tells the story of John Hammond, an eccentric millionaire, and his dream of creating a theme park with living dinosaurs, recreated from the remains of its former genetic material. But the park becomes out of control due to a sabotage act who will put everyone in danger.This film is one of the most remarkable of Steven Spielberg, helping the director to consolidate his career and reputation in films outside of the sci-fi genre. And there is no doubt that this is an excellent film, with an innovative script which exploits a theme little-seen in the movies of that era: the dinosaurs. Also the pseudo-scientific theories used to give logic to the act of ""recreating"" these animals are interesting, almost making the audience believe that could be possible in real life. The subject of cloning was controversial at the time and was a bit fashionable because of some investigations that had been made recently in this field. In addition to the skill and talent of Spielberg as director and screenwriter, also have a good cast of actors, headed by Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum in the main roles, a group of paleontologists and scholars who visited the theme park before he is officially allowed to open to the public. Richard Attenborough, the extraordinary English actor, also comes in this film, playing the naive and dreamy Mr. Hammond.This film was a huge success in the nineties. I was a child at the time but, like many others of my generation, I lived the magic of the dinosaurs, which became fashionable thanks to this film. Moreover, we still feel a special attraction for these animals, we have never seen or know exactly how they were, but we wanted to know better. For this, and for the suspense that the film provides, this is a movie that deserves to be in our living room.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic Park,"There's a thing about films that are based excessively on special effects: they age quickly as the technology of special effects progresses. That's how it is with ""Jurassic Park"", which made a sensation when it came out because of the special effects, but the same special-effects look painfully ordinary now.So, putting the effects aside, as a film this is pretty bad. In the first hour pretty much nothing happens, while the second hour is a series of chases (which get boring by the end). In the meantime the message is: god was wise to extinguish the dinosaurs, so how dare you bring them back? Which is the eternal paradox religion-believers find themselves in all the time. Because if god's axiom is the survival of the fittest, then moralistic values have no place in such an axiom.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the GREATEST movies of ALL TIME!,"What can I say that hasn't been said already? Jurassic Park is a film like no other! When this came out back in 1993, it was a huge hit with a great story and groundbreaking special effects and they STILL work to this day! To be honest, I would actually consider Jurassic Park my favorite Steven Spielberg film since Jaws. This movie is THAT good. As a matter a fact, it's GREAT! I'm a huge fan of dinosaurs and I also love watching prehistoric films such as The Land Before Time, Dinosaur and other films, but NO other dinosaur film in the world topped Jurassic Park. This movie is an instant masterpiece and a HUGE classic on so many levels and became a franchise later on with 3 sequels and 4 next year. And although the sequels don't really live up to the original, I really did enjoy watching The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic World. I thought they were great sequels to a successful franchise and for a grade, I would give The Lost World and Jurassic World both a 9.5/10. However, I'm not really a huge fan of Jurassic Park III, but it's ok and i'd probably give it a 7.0/10. But to this day, Jurassic Park is the BEST in the entire franchise and it has stood the test of time successfully and absolutely without a doubt Jurassic Park gets a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dinosaurs combined with great music,"I must admit, I'm a big dinosaur fan. As all kids I liked dinosaurs and movies with big lizards like Godzilla and Gorgo. The first thing I heard about Jurassic Park were the toys. I thought: 'what a lame idea, people trying to catch dinosaurs' but then I heard it was about a movie.The movie is great. When I first saw it I was really convinced that the dinosaurs were for real. The movie made a big impression to me. After viewing to movie a couple of times, I noticed how John Williams soundtrack added so much to the movie. The  acting isn't as horrible as some say. Jeff Goldblum is great as Ian Malcolm, Laura Dern is as usual... good looking. The jokes are funny, I still laugh about them (not the Timmy jokes).The movie is a definite must see. It meant a turning point in special fx, and it started the debate of cloning. But it's just a very entertaining movie. Nothing more, nothing less. This movie is one of my favorites.My condolences for the family and friends of actor Bob Peck (who portrayed Robert Muldoon) who died recently",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Very well written and executed, yet underwhelming","This was my first movie from the Jurassic Park/World franchise and after this experience I'm planning to see the sequel ""The Lost World"". This was quite a good movie, however it has some issues.Now that the fifth movie of this franchise has just hit theaters it might not seem that way as much anymore and I wasn't alive in 1993, but this was a very original idea, mostly executed very well. The script had many strength, a few weeknesses and great dialog.The first act of this movie sets up a great, interesting and intriguing world. The buildup to the first time we see a dinosaur is so well done using great cuts between the characters and good camera angles. Our two main protagonists are paleontologists and they sold their amazement of seeing real dinosaurs for the first time so well! There's a scene where what looks like a T-Rex hatches from its egg and it looks cute at first but they foreshadow the danger that is to come using really good dialog and character interactions.The second act is underwhelming, it has two strengths however. We know that one of the employees of the Jurassic Park hacks the security systems, but the idea is executed much better than it looks on paper. We also get the first scene where a dinosaur is an immediate threat to our characters, which is one of my favorite scenes from the movie. Despite that, the fact that the dinosaurs weren't in the movie that much until the third act make them seem like a little bit less of a threat.The third act on the other hand is great and it did most things right. It had great action, yet not too much of it, a great finale and my favorite scene. There were two scenes intercut , which meant that one group of characters was not aware of the consequences of their actions while the other one isn't aware of the danger they were in, those two scenes being intercut made for so much suspense.The special effects are very very good and ILM did a great job with them, as always. The dinosaurs look so gorgeous, every part of them looks real. There wasn't a single poorly done piece of CGI, not one.The main message of the movie is that humanity might be orchestrating their own extinction and that we should be careful with what we use science for, but there's also a message telling us that nature will have its revenge if we don't treat it with respect and it's very well-integrated, but they don't portray nature, especially the dinosaurs as purely evil, they show that nature can be both dangerous and peaceful.Most of the characters are realistic people you care about and you want them to survive. It's not their profession that makes the two paleontologists so great, it's their concerns about the whole idea and their actions and the fact that they try to save everyone. Scenes like the kids being so interested in their work is what endears us to them and what makes us root for them. And I know that we're not supposed to like the park owner, but he's my biggest flaw with this movie. In the third act we see three of our characters working on their plan, so the movie should let us think that he's becoming reasonable which would be good character development, but he literally tells Ellie, one of the paleontologists, not to do something because she's a woman and that he should do it because he's a man. This was a very bad decision in the script, especially because we're that far into the movie. How are we supposed to at least support that character? This movie wasn't released in the 70s or 80s when moments like this were unfortunately accepted amongst the public.All of the actresses and actors are giving really good performances, especially Samuel L. Jackson even though he wasn't in the movie that much. I always praise kids though when they are doing well in movies because giving great performances at a young age is a higher accomplishment than doing so as an adult. Ariana Richards is doing an amazing job, even when she doesn't speak, her face expresses so much of the fear that her character is experiencing and her screams of pain are even more convincing than those of Carrie Henn from ""Aliens"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Spielberg redefines the modern blockbuster once again in a high concept rollercoaster that still holds up,"On the island of Isla Nublar, eccentric visionary and bioengineering magnate John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is constructing Jurassic Park, a mysterious new amusement park. After a worker accidentally dies, Hammond's investors send lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) to inform Hammond, they have concerns about the viability of the park and insist a panel of experts tour the park and sign off before any further developments are undertaken. Among the experts invited are paleontologists Doctors Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and chaotician Doctor Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). Once at the park it's revealed the main attraction is none other than real life dinosaurs brought back to life by genetic engineering. As the experts embark on an automated tour of the park with Hammond's grandchildren Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex (Ariana Richards), a disgruntled tech worker for the park Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) enacts a plan of industrial espionage which has far reaching consequences that lead to the prehistoric beasts running amok.Jurassic Park is a 1993 adaptation of the 1990 book of the same name by Michael Crichton. Originally having been conceived as a screenplay before being turned into a novel, the book became the subject of a bidding war with many different studios and directors (WB/Tim Burton, Columbia/Richard Donner, and Fox/Joe Dante) all chomping at the bit to acquire the rights with Universal acquiring the film for Spielberg as part of a package deal that included a production commitment to Schindler's List. While initially intended to use computer assisted stop-motion (called Go Motion) that had been used for things like ED-209 from Robocop or the Rancor from Return of the Jedi, Spielberg's dissatisfaction with the look of the dinosaur sequences lead to experimentation with doing animation fully on the computer in a move that would set the standard for effects filmmaking and blockbuster filmmaking throughout the 90s (and arguably even today). A critical and commercial juggernaut in its day, Jurassic Park set the standard for blockbuster filmmaking for the decade and even inspired a long lasting media franchise that continues to this day. Jurassic Park is the best kind of blockbuster sci-fi fun with all the technical polish that elevates the experience.Playing like a mixture of a disaster movie and a monster movie, Spielberg avoids going diving into uninteresting melodrama or dry technical details that can sometimes be the undoing of a film like this. Mixing Chrichton's detail techno writings with some light tapering from co-writer David Koepp, Spielberg and his crew create an engaging lineup of characters who are memorable and engaging. Sam Neill is quite good as Dr. Alan Grant who plays the character as someone who really doesn't like children but also give him a nice sense of humor and an arc that yields a nice payoff. Neill is complemented by Laura Dern's Ellie Sattler who has a warmer more welcoming personality but is just as competent as Dr. Grant and also holds her own during some of the thrill sequences. We also have Richard Attenborough as John Hammond who is massively likable as a showman in over his head with a kind of Scottish air of Colonel Sanders by way of Walt Disney. Jeff Goldblum is the breakout character of the film in Ian Malcolm and his status as the smartest guy in the room couple with a suave and relaxed sense of humor show why this character was so liked. Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards are also very good as Tim and Lex (even if the screenplay does rely on the occasional boneheaded move from them).And of course you can't talk about Jurassic Park without talking about the dinosaurs. As true today as it was then, the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park look fantastic. Using a mixture of Stan Winston animatronics and computer assisted visuals whose work comes from Dennis Muren, Phil Tippett and Michael Lantieri to name but a few, Spielberg and company do give you the feeling that dinosaurs are back from the dead. While upon rewatch there's the occasional jerkiness or slight break in compositing illusion, most of the time the computer effects and physical elements are seamlessly used to create thrilling and dynamic interactions. While the story carries the subtext of companies wielding technological advances in an irresponsible manner, this is kept secondary to the main adventure/survival aspect of the film and helps to give the film weight without weighing it down.Jurassic Park is peak blockbuster filmmaking once again from the man who invented the concept and framework of the modern blockbuster. Filled with likable characters, engaging setpieces, and groundbreaking special effects, Jurassic Park earns a lot of goodwill being entertaining and clever enough even in spite of those little gripes that come from having seen this movie several hundred times because it's just that good.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
In depth analysis,"Based on a rather slow moving book by Michael Crichton (Sci-Fi author and screenwriter of ER), The movie Jurassic Park is an excellent adaptation that provides staple entertainment.  The movie has flaws  some of the typical cliché's of Sci-Fi movies, but is presented so well, that we can forgive it and enjoy a good old-fashioned Dino romp.The central theme of the book  Chaos theory  underpins the plot, but it fails to come across effectively in the film.  While chaos theory finds order and pattern in apparent disorder, the film bastardises this into the philosophy that `life cannot be contained', as embodied by the dinosaurs. They break through the boundaries of time through being reincarnated, and then proceed to defy the control imposed upon them by the park owners. This theme is at times subtle (such as when the lawyer trips on some uneven rocks), and at times garishly unsubtle, such as some of the debates that take place.  If it were not for Jeff Goldblum's superbly awkward acting of mathematician Ian Malcolm as he explains, it would be cringeable, and yet he pulls it off  we can forgive him.  Again, however we are made aware that the screen adaptor did not understand chaos theory  he has his `Chaotician' (a mathematician specialising in chaos theory) telling us that chaos theory is all about unpredictability and chaos (and implies a celebration of such concepts).  WRONG! Chaos theory is the opposite  it says that there are patterns in chaos, even if they are too complex for us to understand. Mathematicians are the worlds best at managing order.  In the book we are educated about chaos theory, fractals and such matters which apparently are too deep for the big screen.  Dr.Malcolm's little potted theme `life breaks free' about how living things cannot be controlled is even proved wrong  we watch a dumb placid cow being hoisted to its doom, still chewing the cud like the controllable beast that it is.  Shame on you cow, for your poor acting skills  didn't anyone tell you to wriggle about a bit?The characters are rather hit and miss, a flaw present in the original book, which is not character focussed  rather pop-science and monsters based. None are particularly likeable or memorable, and even Richard Attenborough struggles to maintain sincerity in his acting.  His character, Hammond (the orchestrator of the park) is a supreme control freak, and he is good at it. He succeeds in manipulating our two protagonists into visiting the island by waving his fat cheque book: we loose all respect for them at this point. We are slowly shown how paper thin Hammond's control is, first by the jerky helicopter landing, then by how easily the scientists escape his guided tour  indoors, and later outdoors when they leave their vehicles in the middle of the next tour.  His statement of `No expense spared' is revealed to be a complete lie as it is his underpaying one of his employees that undoes the park.  Left at being said once, this would be a nice irony, however, the line becomes laboured after a while, and after the n-th time it is said, our upper lips curl impatiently.Dr Grant (Sam Neill) is a simple run-of-the-mill luddite who is a fossil himself  unwilling to co-operate with technology (he cannot even do up his seatbelt).  While the character is unsubtle, Sam Neill does look rather like a dinosaur, and the zooming in close ups are in keeping with the films shots of the dinos.  Apart from that, he is rather dull, and is only partly saved by the growth of his affection to the children (a cheap way of making us like him, that did not fool me).Despite such flaws, there is a solid scientific basis for the film, with nice explanations that are plausible with no need for deeper exploration. In the light of the cloning in recent years, the JP concept is even more acceptable.It is not enough to call this just another special effects movie, as if that in itself belittles it.  The excellent documentaries on the DVD provide insight into the enormous effort that went into making the film look so effortlessly good, employing Industrial Light & Magic (George Lucas' SFX company), THX (Lucas' digital sound company) and top animators, the results are truly breathtaking, especially in the cinema (other links with Star Wars include a soundtrack by John Williams, and James Earl Jones narrating the documentary).Computer imaging and animation are art forms, and like most art forms, attempt to recreate life; to understand it.  Whereas quality fiction authors look at character and plot in an attempt to mimic human society, sci-fi authors use their imagination to further existing ideas and create new worlds, focusing on a more immediate and less subtle approach such as brightly coloured lasers and massive aliens.  What they skimp in character and plot (and they always do), they make up for in creativity in other areas.  It is very rare to excel in more than one area of creativity  it takes a genius such as Leonardo Da Vinci to be a superb painter AND a genius scientist.  JP will never be Shakespeare, but then Shakespeare never had dinosaurs walking about munching on each other, which is also pretty fun too. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Welcome To Jurassic Park.,"A start of a wonderful franchise, the original Jurassic Park is pure amazing-ness, I've always loved dinosaurs growing up, and Jurassic Park was the first pg-13 movie I watched when I was 10, my grandma actually put it on cos she knew I liked dinosaurs, so its no wonder why I enjoy this movie and the franchise itself so much.

Uniformly uneven performances...,"JURASSIC PARK has one thing above all else going for it: those dinosaurs. Unfortunately, the uneven performances of most of the cast tend to undermine even THOSE fx. Laura Dern appears BEMUSED throughout the whole thing, like a kid who's wandered onto a playground when in fact she was looking for an indoor outhouse; she appears oddly out of place. Likewise, Attenborough himself: he often seems to be waiting for direction. Goldblum constantly mutters to himself like he's stumbled into the wrong movie and can't figure out how to get out. His reactions to the monsters are almost sedate. Sam Jackson literally chain-smokes his way through his wantonly gratuitous scenes as if he has nothing better to do.

Then they did show up after an hour(I think) and it totally blew me away. The sound, the sights! It was too real.

The perfect use of animatronics and CGI (it revolutionized the CGI industry in hollywood) is unsurpassed these 10 years later.  It sparked a million knockoffs, whether in genre (dino-movies) or special effects (every God-awful pixel of CGI puked out by the hollywood braintrust)-- for further info on bad CGI, be sure to catch the upcoming HULK movie). They remain some of the greatest (if not THE greatest) special effects in cinematic history.  The story, however, is pitifully inferior to the book.  The characters are unimportant in the movie, taking backseat to Steven Speilberg's Dino-F/X.  Jeff Goldblum's character, who was pivotal to the book (as he spoke for us, the reader), served no greater purpose than comedic value in this movie.  Thus, it garners the low rating of 6 stars I gave it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spielberg at his worst,Box office grosses of this terrible movie make all the box office grosses of Titanic extremely deserving. That's right and how in the hell did this abomination of a movie get a better rating than Titanic on this site. The reason for my strange praise for Titanic is because at least Titanic had a story at the foreground and special effects were used to support the story. The opposite is happening in this movie where the special effects take the front seat and in fact is the only purpose of this movie. Everything in this movie is horrible except for the special effects. If you want Spielberg at his best then watch Saving Private Ryan or Minority Report. 1 out of 10.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Not just another Jaws,"It might sound like little more than 'Jaws' with dinosaurs as this Steven Spielberg thriller focuses on mayhem at an amusement park where dinosaurs have been brought back to life, but 'Jurassic Park' a unique and exciting thriller in its own right and one that stands up to multiple viewings. The dinosaurs are quite breathtaking CGI creations, and more than that, they are menacing at all the right times. The dinosaur attacks are very well done with Spielberg not relying on music (sort of the opposite of 'Jaws') and instead dead silence to render the attacks frightening. Spielberg throws a lot of neat directing tricks in the mix too, such as extreme close-ups on Samuel L. Jackson's technician and decent doses of humour, like an 'objects in mirror are closer than they appear' warning visible as a dinosaur roars into an automobile side mirror. Not so successful are the film's attempts to drill home messages such as the risks of tampering with nature, all spelled out through character dialogue. The way the child-hating Sam Neill eventually learns to bond with kids is also so forced and obvious from early on that it never really works despite a credible turn from Ariana Richards as a surrogate daughter of sorts. In fact, the film is very well acted overall, give or take Wayne Knight's inappropriately comical performance as the closest the film has a human antagonist. The strongest of the cast is Jeff Goldblum as a mathematician who finds himself often talking to himself, but Jackson, Neill and Richard Attenborough as the amusement park owner have their strong moments too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great summer blockbuster,"So, full transparency, I watched this movie for the first time ever in 2021. It's one of those ""how did I go this long without watching this incredibly popular film"" moments for me (we all have them).I was impressed. The biggest shoutout to this film I have is the special effects hold up tremendously...it's almost shocking how well they still work almost 30 years after the film was released. John Williams' score is, as always, epic and adds a ton to the environment. Steven Spielberg utilizes his camera for escalating tension filled scenes to the max and the kids aren't terrible, which was encouraging because the obligatory kid characters can unfortunately really sink movies like this in my opinion so kudos to them.It's a fun movie: the experience must have been awesome in the theatre and I can see why it captivated kids enough as to spawn off some sequels and why it is now a classic. It's a textbook summer blockbuster and a great illustration on how to do popcorn movies correctly.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A waste of great  talent and special effects,"The actors are among my favorites. The special effects for the time were great. And, the film has a reasonably sound premise.But the writing and direction I thought were both simply awful.Anyone who rated this movie at or near the top needs to see it again. I've seen it for the first time on TV this morning. Over and over again, I kept asking myself at different scenes, ""How can anybody be that stupid?"" and, ""What screen writer can REALLY believe an intelligent audience above the age of 4 1/2 would think people would do these things under similar circumstances.""Sure, the special effects were great for the time.

Pales in comparison to the novel.,"Spielberg took a great novel and turned it into blockbuster cotton candy for children and young teenagers.I couldn't believe what was unfolding before me when I watched this film. Crichton's book was so much richer in detail and much more edge of your seat suspenseful.I hated the way it was rewritten for the screen and I didn't like how the characters in the film were pale shadows of their book selves. The characters in the book were easy to like. In the movie they were entirely peripheral to the CGI dinosaurs. The magic of the novel was that the characters were equally as important as the peril they faced. In the film it was all about the dinosaurs, the actors might as well have been cardboard cut-outs.I know people who didn't read the book don't want to hear this kind of thing but trust me if you did read the book first you know what I'm talking about.I can imagine if I didn't read the book first I would have maybe liked this film more. As it stands I didn't entirely despise it. The scene that properly introduced the first dinosaur for our pleasure was somewhat moving. Yet they didn't save the poor story telling and lousy translation from book to novel. Situations that made the book a great read were entirely omitted from the film in true Hollywood form.I like Spielberg's work and he's proved his worth but this movie would have been better left to someone who wasn't so hell bent on getting the effects right, while almost completely ignoring the elements of the novel that made Jurassic Park great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The film is boring most of the time, but still my parents loved it & even loves it till date.I hope I'm not the only one to hate it. So true dino lovers don't watch this film-it's really a waste of time. The things that made me love movie at first was- 1.The T-rex's first appearance. 2.The raptors. 3.The climax where the t-rex kills the raptors.But now I'm not satisfied with any special effects of JURASSIC PARK!!!!",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What can you say about one of the most brilliant films ever.,"When I sat down in the theater seat I had no idea what to expect. I hadn't seen a big screen movie in a long time, but I'm glad I saw this one the first time there. I'd have to say Jurassic Park was brilliantly executed from start to finish, with absolutely outstanding CGI blended in with some very stunning acting. I'm kind of a science follower anyway, so when they incorporated some sound scientific elements into the story, it sort of added to an almost perfect story. Don't believe you could ""genetically engineer some dinosaurs??? While there are two conflicted camps in the Genetics realm, there is generally agreement that it is possible. It would simply be very difficult to create the right genetic conditions, then you wouldn't quite know what you had until the animal hatched. So yes, the apparent ease of manipulation you see in Jurassic Park is a bit over the top, which is one of the reasons I only gave it a 9. The other reason is that about half the dinosaurs depicted in the movie were from totally different time periods. The Brachiosaurus is about the only truly large dinosaur that was firmly entrenched in the Jurassic period. There were a couple other plant eaters that were really huge also, but no large carnivores. The majority in the movie belonged in the Cretaceuos period.Oh well, it was and still is the leader in movies that bring dinosaurs to life!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best movie ever.,"Jurassic Park is the best example of how a movie can literally change your life. Back in 1993 and being just a little kid it just blew my mind, the dinosaurs were so real at the time -and even now- that you could really feel them coming back to life. This movie, 65 million years in the making, created a hole generation of paleontologists and children who, like me, loves dinosaurs even today. It inspired a hole generation to pursue the dreams of discovery, the dreams that something bigger and incredible could be achieved just with the power of curiosity and imagination.Forever grateful to the genius minds of Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg for this wonderful and eternal movie.""Welcome, to Jurassic Park."" — John Hammond",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mild Amusement Park,"Cloned dinosaurs run amok at an amusement park! Yes, the plot is as ridiculous as it sounds. However, even if one accepts the silly premise, the film rarely rises above the level of a 1950s monster movie like Godzilla and it goes on too long. It's not clear why the dinos are angry, perhaps they're thinking, we came back after 65 million years for this cheesy movie? The computer-generated creatures (no actual dinosaurs were harmed during the filming) are the main attraction here and they're fairly well done.

Quite Good...,"""Jurassic Park"" is an entertaining and occasionally inspired movie directed by Steven Spielberg, based on the novel by Michael Crichton.To my mind this is a very good popcorn flick, with occasional flashes of inspiration. The CGI work, which still holds up decently today, is stunning and groundbreaking stuff for the early 90's. Spielberg directs with a deft hand, and the action never lets up.If I had any complaint, it would be that the acting (except for Goldblum and Attenborough) is merely average -- in particular, the usual weaknesses involved with child actors applies here. Also, the movie is long on popcorn action and relatively short on brains... the subjects of cloning, ecology and paleontology are lightly and briefly touched upon but that's it (if you want more in this area I'd suggest reading Crichton's book, which is quite good).Overall this movie is worthwhile, and easily one of Spielberg's stronger films. Recommended for rental or purchase, kids will love it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"This film was not as good as the book(as often seems to be the case with movies) and like many adventure movies, its plot isn't exactly strong. Nonetheless, one complaint level against this film isn't fair.  That is that some critics have argued that Spielberg made a mistake by showing the dinosaurs too early, making it less fun.  In Jaws, for comparison, the shark isn't see clearly until half way in the movie.  But the dinosaurs shown early in Jurassic Park aren't dangerous or intimidating; they aren't monsters.  They dinosaurs that do attack people, such as T-Rex, aren't seen until halfway through, while the stars of the show, the ""raptors"", aren't seen clearly until the end.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Moreover, the directing is some other great part that made the movie successful but a normal guy like me can not really talk about it, but I will refer the viewer to watch documentaries and behind the sets to feel the great work that happened in the early 90s.

Timeless Movie,"The film Jurassic Park is about a theme park that Dr. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) and his team created. The theme park, called Jurassic Park, is like a zoo of dinosaurs which were created through genetic engineering. Before the park is able to be opened to the public, Dr. Hammond must get approval from an array of people, including scientists Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), stating that the park is safe for the public. The dinosaurs end up breaking out of their electric cages due to a power outage and wreak havoc on the entire island and the people on the island. I believe the important lesson to learn from this movie is that technology is great to a point, but technology cannot be completely relied on; the human mind and variables are crucial in many applications. In the film Jurassic Park, Dr. Hammond and his team used technology to create an island full of deadly genetically engineered dinosaurs. Technology was also used to contain these animals; the entire island relied on a computer system. As we all know, most computer systems fail at one point or another, which is what caused the destruction of the island in this film. The writer of the novel and the screenplay Jurassic Park, Michael Crichton, also directed a film with a similar theme. The film Runaway (1984) focuses on what happens when a machine goes bad; again, technology can be helpful, but it can also be hurtful if not used in the correct way. The special effects used in this film were amazing, especially for their time. The dinosaurs in the film seemed like they were actually real thanks to special effects. This goes to show that technology can be extremely useful; but when taken too far, it can also be devastating. There is a fine line between the helpful use of technology and the destructive use of technology. Also, the sound effects were excellent. The sounds of the dinosaurs made you feel like you were actually a part of the film. When a dinosaur would roar, it made me feel scared for the characters of the movie; especially when you could not see where the dinosaur was, you could only hear it. The sound effects used added to the film to make it seem more realistic. The sound effects also instilled emotions, such as fear and anxiety, in me as I was watching the film. I thought that they were implemented very well into the plot and the theme of the movie. All-in-all I thought this was a great film. The theme is timeless because we will always be dealing with the ups and downs of technology; especially nowadays when everything seems to be turning to technology because of the preciseness and the cost-savings. I saw the film when I was a young kid, and to this day, I still love to watch it over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A sick park.,"I need to get one thing out of the way first - I hate those awful children. Spielberg often makes huge mistakes when casting children in his movies (Hook, the aggravating Henry Thomas), but the JP kids really get on my nerves. He should have done with little Tim and Lex what he did to Alex Kintner in Jaws in have them devoured in torrents of gore. This would have pleased me a great deal.Sam Neill (one of my favorite actors) plays Alan Grant, a dinosaur expert who is called to a remote Pacific island with his colleague Ellie Sattler and Chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) by excitable billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to give a fresh perspective on his new theme park and appease his anxious investors (although why a billionaire would need investors is kind of odd). The theme park turns out to be a dinosaur zoo, but nothing works as it should.Park computer nerd Dennis Nedry (Peter Griffin in a rare live-action role) shuts down the security in order to smuggle dino embryos to the competition, and with the electric fences switched off the big things with pointy teeth step out into the bits of the park where they're not supposed to be.Jurassic Park has often been nicknamed ""Jaws with Claws"". I don't think that's a good description. Where Jaws was a difficult shoot, was organic, and was a huge hit against expectations, Jurassic Park is deliberately designed to be a blockbuster without any of the raw edge that made its big brother so believable. I just can't get excited by a film that was made to sell merchandise.My favorite aspect of Jurassic Park, is often the most overlooked. Dean Cundey's photography is great, full of darkness and backlights. I just wish that Spielberg allowed him to give the film a harder look as it sometimes has a fake, plastic feel. The CGI, having been rendered just a little shy of 20 years ago, are mostly photo-realistic but there are a few dinos that look incredibly fake (the brontosaurus on the grass plain looks terrible).When making Jaws, the animatronic shark rarely worked. With nothing much to show on screen Spielberg compensated by giving us lots of shark POV shots, and Williams gave the unseen predator a constant presence with his iconic score. Now, in an age where filmmakers can give us anything with a computer effect (in a way, Spielberg made this trend mainstream with the success of Jurassic Park), the monsters are brought right out into the open, lessening our fear of them. A monster is only scary when it is in the shadows. Bruce the Shark was also an unstoppable force of nature, his random appearance out of nowhere giving him a mythical edge. The dinos in Jurassic Park were designed, within the movie, to entertain kids, and intended, as a movie, to entertain the kids in the audience.They're not scary.Jurassic Park is a good film, but it absolutely does not deserve the classic status that pop culture has marked it with.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spare No Expense and Buy it Now!,"""Jurassic Park""There's not a whole lot to say about the acting. By no means is it bad, it's just obvious that the actors are not the stars of the film, but the dinosaurs themselves. If there were any actors that stood out, though, it would be Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum, and the late Richard Attenborough. I always liked Atteborough the most, as he is the man with a vision so great, that it blinds him to the obvious flaws with his park. My favorite scene with him is when he's talking to Sattler about his humble beginnings, and how he wanted to give the people an attraction that was not an illusion, but something that was real and awe inspiring.The dinosaurs look amazing, and are a perfect example of combining both practical effects and CGI. All of them look amazing. From the Brachiosaurus, the raptors, and of course, the T-Rex. The buildup to the T-Rex's appearance is superb, with the setting being in the middle of a rainstorm, and the small sound of footsteps approaching the car with Hammond's grandchildren in it.To this day, the T-Rex is still the biggest puppet created by Stan Winston's studio. There's not a whole lot of criticisms I have with the film, other than a few nitpicks revolving around common sense.That's really nitpicking though, as this is still best described as a popcorn film, which I'm saying as a positive thing. Are my nostalgia goggles shielding me from any other problems with the film? Probably. But, the film still succeeds in presenting likable characters, an entertaining story, and effects that will forever stand the test of time.If you have not seen ""Jurassic Park"", spare not expense and buy it now!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pop-Culture Friendly,"Leave it to Spielberg to trivialize such a profound topic. The big draw is the dinosaurs. Yet they appear in only about 15 minutes of the film's 120-minute plot. Mostly what we have here are banal humans, and even an obnoxious character named Dennis (Wayne Knight), engaged in trite conversations, and exposition contrived to bring viewers up to speed. At the film's worst, viewers and the two lead ""scientists"" are treated to what is literally a cartoon on the relationship between mosquitoes and dinosaur DNA. The film talks down to its audience.And there is no intrinsic need for those two kids. They are added to draw in viewers from across all age ranges. ""Jurassic Park"" is a popcorn flick that's pop-culture friendly. At least it's not as bad as Spielberg's ""Jaws"", a kiddie movie lacking in thematic depth.The only character in ""Jurassic Park"" that acts like an adult is Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). He conveys a skeptical view of the intent of the Park's creator, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), when Malcolm says ... ""Gee, the lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here, staggers me"". He further critiques Hammond: ""You packaged (your discovery), slapped it on a plastic lunch-box and now you're selling it ... What you call discovery, I call the rape of the natural world"". So there is a bit of depth to the film, if only in passing.By far the best element is the visual effects, truly spectacular. The dinosaurs look realistic and believable. These visuals are enhanced by sound effects accompanied by a subtle echo. Which, when combined with the rain forest background, create a faraway feel, consistent with the historical remoteness of the Mesozoic era in which the dinosaurs lived.Casting is acceptable. Acting trends a bit overblown. Production and art design are almost as good as the special effects. But I did not like the overbearing and manipulative background music.With a huge budget and a famous director, this Hollywood blockbuster aims at a mass audience. Though the visual effects are spectacular, the script gives us a childish story, with childish characters, that I find mildly insulting to the study of such a fascinatingly alien era in Earth's history.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Extremely overrated, IMHO","First things first: I loved the book. I read it 1990 in one overnight session, couldn't put it down for a single minute. My head hurt the next morning from all the reading.Three years later: the movie. Even back then, as a teen, I was disappointed: THIS is supposed to be the hotel/entrance hall for literally thousands of visitors each day? You must be kidding. And everything follows a toys 'r us color scheme? The enclosure for the (high-speed!) Raptors is laughable tiny, the IT-Headquarter - responsible for one of the most complex systems in the world - features a handful of Home-Computers, some blinking lights, one fat Nerd and a Chainsmoker. And the operating system (""Multi-XMP? You mean... they have more than one?"") features a clunky, 2 fps 3D-Interface because... Well... VR & 3D is soooo hot right now (1993)! Most of the Movie looks surprisingly small, like they had no budget. Only the Animals look great, absolutely fantastic job, ILM!The pretty dark and violent story of the book has not only been watered down (extremely) but taken apart - so bits and pieces of it can be smeared onto subsequent parts of the franchise. The deeper statements (science, responsibility etc) of the book were simply put in the mouths of the protagonists. And they don't even try to give these words gravitas. And if they do: Cheesy overacting at its best.Speaking of cast/acting... Laura Dern plays a scientist? Yeah, sure. Grrreat choice, Steven. ""Laura, you see a dinosaur for the first time in your live, give me your best ""surprised""-Look."" Laura opens her mouth as far as she can for one minute. And I LOVE the scene when she tries to hold the HQ-door shut - on the side with the hinges.Goldblum? Plays more or less himself, as always. Way to schmaltzy and like many Hollywood-Stars he seems to confuse acting with ""cultivating my brand"". Attenborough? I was expecting a gritty, unscrupulous, unlikable CEO. But all I got was a ""casual friday"" Mall Santa with a cane.I would LOVE to see a legit, darker version of Crichtons Masterpiece. With some atmospheric old-school.matte-paintings, film noir lighting, a literary adaptation that finds a way to distill 576 pages in a 100+ minute movie without butchering it - and a more capable cast.

A delightful adventure,"Let's all agree that Jurassic Park should have been just a stand-alone film. The sequels do have much better CGI and more thrilling action but no one of them has the brilliance and thematic richness the first hasJurassic Park is a rare example where it not just only works as an exciting dinosaur movie, but also as a dark, serious-toned film. The characters were pretty well-written. The plot had clever twists and writing in general. The casting options were just right as well.I was actually surprised that the CGI wasn't terrible. I was genuinely ready to see some really dated-looking CGI since this is a feature film from 30 years ago. Although, it does still look a bit dated, it still looked fine and surprisingly had better CGI than some 2000's films. So due to that, none of the action scenes have aged. They're all exciting in their own way and gave us some variety. (Such as Raptors and T-rexes)But unfortunately, Jurassic Park also fell short on a few aspects. It's a little inconsistent because Timmy and Lex both had bad bruises from the T-rex but suddenly healed overnight. One of the Raptors searched for the kids but when it saw them, the raptor just stood there so I theorized it could be the baby raptor from earlier that grew up. But then in the next scene, it is going all out. I also felt like it took a bit too long for the whole dinosaur shtick to begin.In conclusion, a really fun dinosaur film that can also work as a family-oriented dark movie, although having some minor issues with consistencyRating: 8.6/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Truly a classic...,"Well, the 1993 adventure movie ""Jurassic Park"" definitely is a classic, and it was a movie that definitely set the benchmark for movies to come back in the day.I have seen director Steven Spielberg's 1993 movie ""Jurassic Park"" many times since it was originally released, and the movie continues to be every bit as entertaining as it was the first time seeing it. So writer David Koepp did a good job in bringing Michael Crichton's novel to the big screen.They had a great cast ensemble for the movie, with the likes of Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum in the leading roles. But also with the likes of Richard Attenborough, Martin Ferrero, BD Wong, Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight on the cast list. So you are in quite capable hands as these performers bring the characters to life on the screen.Visually then ""Jurassic Park"" was spectacular when it was initially released back in 1993. Sure, the effects are starting to show fatigue and they are 30 years old already, but I will go as far as saying that the special effects and CGI in ""Jurassic Park"" still holds here in 2023, and actually is still better than a lot of more recently released movies. So that certainly counts for something of an achievement. And with ""Jurassic Park"" being a movie about dinosaur, then having realistic and believable creatures on the screen was a must, and they most certainly did have that.Not only is the visual great in ""Jurassic Park"", but the score as well. The music is very atmospheric and suitable for the movie. And that main theme definitely has a ring to it, doesn't it? Right up there alongside themes such as ""Star Wars"", ""Jaws"" and ""Indiana Jones""If you haven't already seen the 1993 movie ""Jurassic Park"", then it is well due time to do so, because this movie is entertaining, enjoyable and was a fantastic kick off for a great movie franchise.""Jurassic Park"" is a timeless classic, a movie that can be watched again and again, and that just makes it all the more enjoyable.My rating of ""Jurassic Park"" lands on an eight out of ten stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Bottom line is, this is THE movie of all movies.A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic Park directed by Steven Spielberg,"Jurassic Park is an adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Sam Neill, Richard Attenborough and Jeff Goldblum. I tried to watch this film not too long ago but I wanted to watch a film that had the big blockbuster thrills of Jurassic World (the only Jurassic Park film I had seen at the time) and didn't want to go through the slow-burn beginning. But when I became a little older and a little wiser I put in Jurassic Park once again and viewed it with a lot of pleasure. The slow-burn beginning I now appreciate for the scientific ideas it raises to how a dinosaur could be brought back to life-though I do understand that was from the book. The beginning also sets up the characters who are all well realised by actors subtle and realistic performances and the beginning also has moments that are awe-inspiring still today with the timeless music and blend of amazing practical dinosaurs and CG that still makes me believe that I am seeing a real-life dinosaur moving. But even though I do love the beginning I love the rest of the movie ten times more. Every scene after that is memorable scene whether it's a car falling through a tree or velociraptors trying to kill kids in a kitchen or even just innocent scenes with herbivore dinosaurs. Steven Spielberg's direction and unique camera techniques I could go on forever but you already know what he's like. His direction strongly elevates the film to such a higher level than if the film was directed stalely and stiltedly like a very intense kitchen scene that instead of just cutting to close- ups every ten seconds pans for long amounts of time. Now that might sound that it doesn't mean much but it really gets you more invested in the situation. Now I don't want to make too many comparisons between films but what elevates the dinosaur aspect of Jurassic Park from Jurassic World is that Jurassic Park uses practical aesthetics whenever it can which gets you much more into the scene than if it's complete CGI. But just for clarification I thoroughly enjoy Jurassic World as a blockbuster monster thriller but it's clear which film comes up on top. Now as for the cast they have to be well-acted and likable for you to root for them and hope that they don't die. The two children, the brother and sister aren't annoying and stupid but are genuine kids who are terrified but don't just stand there wide-eyed in front of the dinosaur waiting to be pushed out of the way by an adult. They're genuine kids who would certainly be terrified but they get on because just because they are kids in a movie doesn't mean they shouldn't have the basic human instinct of survival. Sam Neill plays a solid, grounded and kind character that tries to protect the kids and while doing that learns something about him, Jeff Goldblum could be deemed the funny guy but he really is just a good character with some very witty dialogue and Richard Attenborough is excellent as the excited Park manager. My only flaws with the film is that I would have liked a tiny bit more of T-Rex action and I could sort of tell a disposable character would die but the T-Rex action bit I think will be fulfilled in the sequel when I get around to watching it and the disposable character death's while predictable had a brutal pay-off. But apart from those nit-picks I was immersed into the situation and looking back on it I don't think that there was one disposable scene. I was in awe at Spielberg's direction, the practical aesthetics and ground-breaking CG that created the dinosaurs and impressed by the really good performances so for that I am going to give Jurassic Park an A",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A lesson in movie-making,"Jurassic Park, the first one and the best of all three, is a masterpiece of visual effects...The film was made in 1993 but the effects are very good even in the year 2006...This film shows the true work of Steven Spielberg, who's directing this movie brilliant and very sharp (watch the scene with the feeding of the T-Rex)...The acting is good for this kind of film where you don't care so much about the actors as for the effects and the action of the movie...This movie is one of my favourite and Steven Spielberg is my favourite director...He is truly a visionary and a director who knows how to keep his audience thrilled...This is a must see not only for Spielberg's fans, but for everyone, remaining one of the most powerful and brilliant films ever made....We thank you Spielberg!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than expected.....,"When I first saw this film, I didn't think they could do as good a job as they actually did.  'Jurassic Park' has an incredible mix of puppetry and special effects combined to make it one of the single most impressive films of the computer special effects era.  Now, almost every film is using computer effects.  Even in shots that look natural.  You can't tell that they're there.  Steven Spielberg's direction is Disney-esque, like his work on 'E.T.'  The cast shines, especially Goldblum.  Michael Crichton's story of man tampering with nature is a lesson for all ages.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another glorified disaster movie,"This is another glorified disaster movie full of cliches that receives ridiculous amount love and being called a ""masterpiece"" by clueless idiots only because people watched it as a kid, they feel nostalgic about it and they miss those days. I remember also watching this movie as a kid and loving it but when I watched it again after growing up, I didn't enjoy it half as much. People her just cheapen the meaning of the word masterpiece by calling literally every single movie a masterpiece.The first half of the movie where they set up the storyline and discuss scientific and ethical implications of creating a dinosaur park is great but the second part of the movie is so bad, it feels like a cliche-filled disaster movie. For about an hour we watch a couple dinosaurs chase a few humans through jungle, then through the campus and then inside the buildings. Chase scene after chase scene where our humans always barely get away at the last second which becomes tiresome and boring after a while to a point where you want them to actually get eaten for a change.If this movie was made today it would have received a 6-7 rating but it gets an extra 2+ points only and only because people feel nostalgic about their childhood.

The dinosaurs however, are absolutely incredible and the the scenes involving them (which are by far the best parts) still look authentic nearly three decades later.

If You See A T-Rex - DON'T MOVE!!!,"There are a lot of good things about ""Jurassic Park."" The effects on the dinosaurs are excellent. The dinosaurs look, sound and move like real animals. They are completely and totally believable. There's a good reflection on the dangers involved when humanity insists on interfering with the natural world - dinosaurs went extinct without any help from human beings; maybe - even if we could bring them back - human beings should leave them that way is the most direct theme of the movie, although one can easily see the application of that theme about the dangers of human interference in the natural scheme of things going far beyond dinosaurs. And when ""Jurassic Park"" is exciting - it's very exciting and when it's suspenseful it's very suspenseful. I think of the t-rex chasing the car and trying to get at the children, or the children desperately hiding and trying to escape from the velociraptors. That's all well done, and the children were actually pretty good in their parts, very believably terrified. This is one of the better performances I've ever seen from children. But, to be honest, it wasn't very consistent.The action was good when there was action. There were, however, sustained moments when there really wasn't very much action and when not much interesting was happening. Actually, that sums up much of the first half of the movie. In addition to that, we were given a collection of characters that I for one at least didn't really care about - at least two of whom (Dr. Malcolm, played by Jeff Goldblum, and Dennis, played by Wayne Knight) seemed totally extraneous to the story. Neither part was necessary to move this along. Dr. Malcolm's ""chaos theory"" really didn't interest me, and Dennis added a ""conspiracy"" element to the story that really went nowhere. Everything that happened could have been explained by natural causes - like the big storm approaching! Even the children, as well acted as the parts were, seemed like a rather forced addition. It's almost as if someone realized that having no characters to really care about (as I mentioned above) was a problem, and so a decision was made to add a couple of kids for that purpose. Even the leads (Sam Neill and Laura Dern) didn't come across to me as giving much spark to their characters.For all the strengths of this movie - and they were many - there were also more than a few weaknesses.

Timeless classic... a film that doesnot age... loved it,"To express the feelings about this movie in just 1000 words is impossible. Directed by the mighty Spielberg with the ""living"" dinosaurs created by the Stan Winston team, this is truly a milestone in film making. I cant remember a single scene in which i felt the movie like dragging or slow paced. Every shot felt like so flowing that simply flowed into one thrilling adventure or another. The music by John Williams is another highlight that blends so perfectly with each and every shot. Instead of portraying super humans trying to stop the dinosaurs on loose, it portrayed the dire result if humans try their hands in the creation of life. I don't remember a film I felt so original like Jurassic Park- in story, execution, visual effects-almost every aspect- even after watching today's movies that simply aim at an exhibition of technological advances instead of telling a story as convincing as this. A true masterpiece....!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome making - Spillberg,"Steven Spielberg, is one of my favourite Director Ever. Jurassic Park nevertheless has thrilling action and has sheer evidence of the director's vision and effortless verve at work. John Williams's is extra Ordinary, definitely one of the more memorable scores in a Steven Spielberg movie, The acting is really not bad at all, Sam Neill and Laura Dern have given better performances but they were good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Unlike the dinosaurs, Jurassic Park never gets old","I was the dinosaur kid growing up. Books, toys, movies, drawings, my eight year old imagination was often filled with images of meat-eaters, plant eaters, T. rexes and triceratopses. So one could figure that watching Jurassic Park for the first time was a milestone for me. Technically, I did not see the suspenseful opening scene the first time because I was cowering through it. After that, the movie eased up and I was able to take in all of the thrill that the characters, story, music and, yes, the dinosaurs brought to it. The film was everything I had hoped it would be.A decade and a half later Jurassic Park still holds up as an incredibly rewatchable movie, right up there with big hits like The Dark Knight and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's also super quotable. Instead of covering my eyes in the opening scene I enjoy anticipating each line as it comes, almost like a game. Ian Malcom's character, played by Jeff Goldblum in perhaps his most iconic role, has some classic deliveries. ""Dino d-droppings? Droppings?"" That line itself is too much fun, and there are dozens of others that stay with you.Do not think I am all tongue-in-cheek about what makes the film enjoyable, however. Jurassic Park is extremely well made. In addition to the dialogue, the story is very effective. While it can be corny at times, its strength lies in the fact that it does not try to do too much with the dinosaurs and with the carnage people often associate with monster films (which is what JP is at its core). This allows the film to be more concentrated on one location and a small set of characters, and thus make the overall story stronger. It also helps with the suspense! With Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg has mastered the art of the monster film by not revealing too much of the dinosaurs too early. These were techniques he certainly learned while working with B-movies and ones he further cultivated with Jaws as well. But Jurassic Park's effects blow the shark flick's out of the water. Not only does the CGI from Jurassic Park look more realistic than the one from Jurassic World (released more than two decades later!), the crew even created legitimate animatronic dinosaurs that were as close to perfect as anyone has ever attempted. Put that all together and you have a film whose special effects make it timeless.I haven't even gotten to the music yet! John's Williams' score for the film is tied to its legacy in the same vein as the dinosaurs and Ian Malcolm are. I cannot imagine the film scored any other way. The music will stick with you just as much as the memorable lines.I may be biased towards Jurassic Park, as it is intrinsically tied to my childhood. But unlike other movies from my early days, I still find myself watching it again and again. The story may not be the deepest, although it does contain an important message about the power of the natural world, but the craft and wonder that is behind the production make you feel transported whenever you watch. It is a special moment when John Hammond steps out onto the field and utters the famous words, ""Welcome to Jurassic Park."" Even on the twentieth viewing, it still feels as if you have arrived for the first time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Steven Spielberg's Best Science Fiction,"Jurassic Park is about a person that wants to make a park about dinosaurs. He brings a group of people to see the park and it all goes south.Jurassic Park is one of the best science fiction films of all time. There are many things that are good about. First, the score is amazing. John Williams to me is the best composer of all time. He has composed many great films. Next, the writing is amazing. The story is pretty basic but it is the thought behind the film. It's not just like we made dinosaurs. We are amazing. It is more here is our way how we made dinosaurs. It also made you think if that could actually happen. Last, the acting was great. Steven Spielberg made the best possible cast for this movie. All the actors made the film better.Jurassic Park is a great film. It is probably one of the most monumental films of all time as well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worthy of the 65 millions years of production (DVD),"This is the great joke of Spielberg seeing the famous stick of Hammond and its mosquito trapped in the sap! Beyond the special effects, this movie remains for me a essential milestone: it speaks about the power of nature, the childish ingenuity of man, human relationships. I forget that it is also funny with the boy character and lines. John William's score is another masterpiece from him because it rejoices ancestral, primitive melody with powerful and peaceful theme.There are also a lot of remarkable ideas: dealing with dinosaurs today is fascinating but mixing them with the theme park and locating all this on a remote island is a great chain of genius. And the best thing is the parallelism between the technology resurrecting extinct animals and the same technology making extinct the traditional craft of special effects. In this field, there is a before and after JP and the first attack of the T-Rex will be on pantheon of filmmaking! However, the extras of the DVD offer a glimpse of puppets velociraptors (made by Tipett) and they are surprisingly cool as well.Having finishing reading the book, I can say that novel and movie are very close: it's like the same story told by two witnesses even if there are some changes. Having the author writing the script seems to be the golden rule of a decent adaptation. But you can understand also the strength of each medium: ""T-Rex roars and attacks the jeep"" is better seen than read. On the opposite, all the remarkable speeches of Malcom about chaos and science are better read than heard!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Big dumb fun that relies on special effects to cover the gaps (Jaws with claws),"Wealthy businessman Hammond has developed a process for recreating dinosaurs from DNA held inside insects encased in amber.  He uses it to create an island theme park, Jurassic Park, to cash in on the spectacle.  Hammond invites a select group to visit the island under tour conditions - his lawyer, a mathematician, his grandchildren and two archeologists.  However during the tour the man in charge of the computer system shuts down the fences so he can smuggle out stolen dinosaur embryos to sell to the higher bidder.  With the fences down the dinosaurs escape their compounds and the visiting group find themselves with a much closer view than they expected.Adapted from Michael Crichton's novel, this is basically a summer blockbuster that relies on special effects to cover the holes in the plot. The story is a little daft from the very start however once you get past the first 30 minutes of science you get to the dinosaurs and Spielberg's set pieces and nothing else really matters.  The effects are good and the action is well handled by the master director himself.  The film has plenty of suspense and drama - especially when the raptors break free!  However the film also has plenty of problems that come out when you look past the spectacle.Firstly the kids!  Why does Spielberg always feel that he's got to put cute kids in every film - just cause it worked with ET doesn't mean it'll come off every time.  They both quickly become annoying and I wished that they would just move that little bit slower so something could get them.  The film also wants to be a family blockbuster and it doesn't want to upset the audience, hence several main characters that die in the book live in the film so as not to upset sequels etc.  The other main weakness is the huge merchandising that came with the film, making it feel like a happy meal package rather than a film.  However outside of all this baggage the film moves quickly and contains plenty of good action scenes that more than cover the other weaknesses.Neill is OK as Dr Grant and he is clearly happy to get involved in a franchised blockbuster.  Laura Dern is not as good - she is far too hammy and isn't convincing in  her emotion.  Goldblum is excellent as the chaos-therorising mathematician, but it's his usual stuttering scientist stuff so he doesn't have to try too hard.  The rest of the cast are quality, even if they are only to be dinosaur fodder.  Jackson,, Peck, Wayne Knight and of course, Attenborough.  However those children - who seem to have most of the screen time really should have been better.Overall this is a good summer blockbuster - the effects and the action scenes are big and exciting.  However the plot is weak, the performances mainly poor - without these major flaws it cannot be as good as it should have been.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Isolated theme, lack of purpose, medium text and good direction.","The goal of the film is focused on the action scenes against the dinosaurs and on making the process leading up to this coherent and interconnected. And in fact, there are no problems in that process as a whole, the film just ends up ultimately being mediocre:The lack of a more concrete goal moving the film makes the context flabby, uninteresting, and uninvolving. The film doesn't incite alternative paths you can take, it only assures you and is confirmed to be totally geared towards your reaction with the action scenes and the presence of the dinosaurs.Now the reasons why the film is so lacking:First: the science fiction presence is shallow and does not create any relationship with the viewer; the viewer does not feel part of the film, he just accepts the information he receives, not caring about it, and continuing to watch, losing much of the tension he could feel if the text could convince him to imagine that this could be real.Second, the characters are not well written, they are just average for a movie - there is no character development even a little bit well worked out at the moment when their emotional structures are stable, at the height of the action. What there are are just basic character aspects that circle the plot, but in no way show fascination, creative effort, or good textual quality. They do not serve as a taste and as a narrative pillar, they are not organic, they are just tools of the plot. What could be an avenue to conclude the story well was not given space to be placed.The third and final point: the plot. There is no connection to the dinosaur park, you can barely know how it works or be impressed by its mechanisms, so it's hard to get involved with the characters trying to survive in there, us not even knowing where they are and go. Besides that: the plot is not wise at all; the reason for all the confusion, aka the bad guys in the story, doesn't interconnect with the rest of the characters and is left aside in the narrative, as if it were a lever for the rest to move along. And that's exactly why there is nothing to look forward to and why the film doesn't seem to conclude - which is what happens.Developing characters while placing them in an electrifying theme?Showing what horror it would be like to face the dinosaurs and the emotional aspect possible being in front of them?Make a critique, present unknown and fascinating information about dinosaurs?Create a thriller narrative with the theme of dinosaurs?That's right, the film just doesn't connect. It makes use of the dinosaur theme alone and ends up lacking charm and meaning.And just as a last point, Spielberg's direction, although good and presenting a dirty atmosphere, deals here and there with clichés, some conveniences, and is a little limited: many action moments have camera cuts that spoil the feeling of reality, especially involving the dinosaurs' movements; and, personally, I think the ""dirty"" direction, the best aspect of the film, should be even more excessive and melancholic.After all, having no concrete goal, the film creates a longing and expectation in the dinosaur-human relationships, and in the end it is a shame that it is so mainstream - a really heavy, dirty, psychological film would be the solution to finally give a sense of direction to the film and get it out of the mediocre camp.Despite treating the film as ""average"", because of Spielberg's direction I considered it exactly one point above that.For all this I considered Jurassic Park to be a grade 6 film.Overall, Jurassic Park is a film with an average, but not offensive, screenplay that lacks perspective, not being ambitious enough to bring a concrete goal to the film, and apparently feeling satisfied for pioneering the dinosaur theme and addressing the raw persecution relationship between dinosaur and human - with the limitations they had.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic Park: a wonderful piece of cinema that will leave an impact on popular culture as one of the greatest films of all time.,"Steven Spilberg's blockbusters have never stopped amazing people in the 90s, and it's this humble critic's opinion that the pinnacle of his films is his massive summer blockbuster known as Jurassic Park.It's been 23 years after it's first theatrical release and it holds up like no other film. How? were do I begin?.The story is great. Based on Michael Chricton's bestseller with the same name, Spilberg's masterful directing manages to capture both an awe an wonder that just doesn't exist anymore, and some thrilling terror than gives goosebumps to anyone that watches it. All while giving a thought-provoking commentary about man's interference over nature. The characters are memorable and likable. From the paleontologist Alan Grant, to the witty Ian Malcom. From the positive Ellie Satler the whimsical yet developed John Hammond. If this doesn't sell you as to why this movie is absolutely fantastic, we haven't got to the dinosaurs, so let's talk about them.The dinosaurs in this movie are as close to perfect as you can get in a motion picture. Not only do they successfully deliver the terror, but the wonder as well. And they are brought to life like no film today can. The use of both computer generated imagery that, on it's time, pushed the boundaries of technology and animatronics that are done to the absolute best, these effects hold up just as well as they did back then. The effects are so amazing that they surpass most modern movies made today (including it's sucessor, Jurassic World). On top of that, the spot on sound mixing to generate the creature's sounds makes them feel more life-like than any other film.On a film level, regarding the camera-work, lighting and pacing, this movie is great. And I cannot go without mentioning John William's musical score. This score is so amazing, that rivals that of Star Wars, William's most well known soundtracks. And considering the music for that film is regarded as one of film history's best, that's saying a lot.I could go on and on as to why this movie is amazing, but I think you all know this.If I could give a higher rating than 10, this movie would get it.

In this film John Hammond played by Richard Attenborough created and owns a ""theme-park"" he has named Jurassic Park. This park is different than most in that it is inhabited by cloned dinosaurs. Dr. Ian Malcolm played by Jeff Goldblum, Dr. Alan Grant played by Sam Neill and Dr. Ellie Sattler played by Laura Dern are all asked to come analyze the safety factor of the park after someone is attacked. At the same time Hammonds two grandchildren Lex and Tim, played by Ariana Richards and Tim Murphy, are also visiting the park. While all of these people are observing the park things go haywire due to a power outage and the dinosaurs start attacking the people.The theme of Jurassic Park is just because you can do something, doesn't mean that you should. John Hammond was so wrapped up in being able to use his money and technology to do something that no one else has or could do, that he didn't take the time to think about the consequences. Sure, it's great to be cutting edge and create something great for people to enjoy. However, before doing something like this it would be best to stop and rationalize what you are really doing. This movie is a great example of how things can get out of hand really fast. Hammond had great intentions going into this ""project"" of his but he also put a lot of people in danger including Lex and Tim, his grandchildren. They were there to visit with him and see the park and ended up fighting for their lives. Thankfully, Dr. Malcolm and Dr. Sattler were there protecting them as best they could.It is imperative that people take the time to analyze things before taking action, especially when dealing with something as sensitive as cloning an endangered species. Dealing with something so volatile, you would never know what to expect. Hammond was so caught up with being able to do something because no one else could and with greed of how much money he could make that he didn't test the parks safety until it was too late. It would have been wise to request the Dr.'s visit before actually cloning these animals and starting a park. It would have been wise to think about those animals as well. The whole idea of creating these animals that have been extinct for millions of years and placing them on ""display"" seems a bit over the edge. While Dr. Malcolm and Dr. Sattler are amazed at the genius at the park and the beauty of the animals, they also realize from the get-go that things must be thought through scientifically and logically.One motif that is repeated throughout the film is the way the film encourages anticipation through movement. There are the scenes where you see water movement making you anticipate what is coming, how big it is and what is it going to do when it gets here? The ground may start to vibrate and this alerts the Dr.'s, the children, Hammond, etc. that something is coming. The movement of the trees and bushes in the scene where the cow is being fed to the raptor is unforgettable; you can tell by the movements what is happening. Leaving it up to the viewer's imagination was classic. This coincides with the theme nicely. Not knowing what to expect is clearly displayed throughout the film. This film thrives on the unexpected. Could Hammond really not foresee something like this happening? This film used sounds effectively. The sound worked with the movements to build to the excitement and fear for the characters, as well as, for the audience. The sound of the dinosaurs roaring make you feel like you are there and actually sends fear through the viewers. The stomping sounds of the dinosaurs approaching the characters send chills down your back. Again, the scene where the raptor is given the cow is a prime example. You can hear the cow's cries, the dinosaur attacking, the movement in the trees and the crunching sound of that poor cow being made into dinner. These sounds actually make you sit back and say, ""he really should of thought this thing through"" or ""is revenue really worth risking all of this for?"" The film Splice compares with Jurassic Park. It's another case of hindsight being 20/20. The scientist in this film also don't stop to think things through because they are so wrapped up in creating something because they can. They ""splice"" DNA of different organisms together to create other species. One of them takes it too far and add's in her own DNA creating this creature that ends up destroying them all.In the end, technology is great; making money is great. However, when faced with a challenge or an opportunity, we must step back and decide if we should do something just because we can. It's important to remember that technology is not fool proof and the movie is a prime example of that. Take into account that things can go wrong and that negative consequences can outweigh benefits in situations. Using rationale, logic and moral code is important in any venture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest,"Jurassic Park is one of the greatest if not the greatest science fiction movie(s) of all time. This was the movie that inspired me to get into filmmaking and inspired my love for dinosaurs. The combination of animal-electronics, practical effects, and groundbreaking CGI make the world of Jurassic Park as well as the dinosaurs feel real and one of the greatest technical achievements in cinematic history and still holds up perfectly today. Unlike movies like Avatar that rely on a cookie cutter story to afloat the CGI, Jurassic Park features a thrilling adventure story that captures the excitement of seeing park that has recreated dinosaurs. The movie explores the themes of consequences that happen when mankind plays with nature that is explored perfectly. The cast is excellent in their performances especially Jeff Gouldblum who brings a lot of comedic spark and flare as Malcom. Jurassic Park is one of the finest examples in cinema of how technical achievement and story can coincide as one whole amazing movie and will continue to be held as an example for generations of future filmmakers to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good!,"I remember seeing ""Jurassic Park"" on its opening day, and was blown right out of my seat.  It is very much like Spielberg's ""JAWS"".  It's scary, exhilarating, funny, and all in all, enjoyable.  I loved it!  It was really the popcorn movie of the nineties.  I'm not saying that it's the best movie made.  In fact, my opinion of the film has changed over the years.  But I will say, it was very enjoyable!  It was well acted, scripted, and directed. Best of all, was the sound and the special effects.  This was the first movie to use DTS DIGITAL SOUND in movie theaters.  I can remember it being so loud, that when I went to see a different film, I could hear the T-Rex stomping around from the other room.  It also made me jump out of my seat many times.  My brother was a little dissatisfied, but I like this film.  I still do.  It's a shame that the ""Jurassic Park"" saga suffered the usual fate of sequels, as seen in ""The Lost World"".  Nonetheless, ""Jurassic Park"" is pretty damn good!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Start of an Icon,"It may be a little dated, and possibly not as good as the newer ones but the first Jurassic park was the start of something fantastic.The dinosaurs are stunning, and the way we get to see them as wild animals is superb.Not the broadest of plots and settings but this only improves as the series goes on.A classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Steven Spielberg´s best movie yet is a technical masterpiece,"Interesting story, breathtaking special effects, great sound & sound effects, believable actors, super brain director, very good score from John Williams, atmosphere, locations and all this did something special for me. They gave me a ride in the dark theater i will never forget. The score should have been Oscarnominated but John Williams got one the same year for schindlers List. This was maybe the first time, one director release two films in the same year and both of them getting oscarnominations and even win. Schindler´s List & Jurassic Park got 10 Oscars in 1994. Spielberg did the same thing in 1997. To release two big films in the same year: Amistad & The Lost World. And this year the same thing: A.I & Jurassic Park 3(only producer). Steven Spielberg IS THE BEST DIRECTOR of all time, and there is no doubt about that. He is one of my biggest inspirations to know that: dream works. Dream and fight for your dream, then it´s a matter of time before you can get it. The greatest story teller of them all and Jurassic Park is his best art work yet. Raptors, T-rex´s, guns, haunting, car crashes & a cool story. Go Steven Spielberg..... You are THE BEST!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It was alright.,"This movie for me was kind of overrated.  I liked it ok, but it is really nothing special.  Most of the movie is people looking off into the distance in wonder and amazement and it is a bit slow moving.  I actually like part three the best in the series and two the least...this one is just an ok flick to me.  Jeff Goldblum is good in this one as is Sam Neil.  Neil would be good in the third, but Goldblum sucked in the second.  The kids as some have mentioned are kind of annoying, but you learn to put up with it. Samuel L. Jackson is wasted in this movie, but this was before he was really a big name.  Most of the movie is just people touring the park...then something goes wrong and the movie really gets going and is more enjoyable.

DYNA-HYPE! Big let down!,"Plenty of hype was made about this film when it came out that it was almost as if P.T. Barnum himself was behind it.  Needless to say it was not ""The Greatest Film of All Time"". It sadly strayed far from the fine novel it was based on. Good actors were on hand but were only there as furnishings for the Spielberg special effects. All attempts at suspense were on the level of a childrens Saturday morning TV show.

jurassic park,"Jurassic park is a film on which many children grow up on,and i am one of them,i still remember as a kid watching them and playing with my dinosaur toys and imagining that im in their world,so i give this film i rewatch to see does it hold up now days and through my more experienced eyes,and i must say that it holds up in a still great way,spielberg was able to take something impossible and to make it brilliant,animatronics and effects on dinosaurus expecely close ups are still very masterful made and they basiacly look real,only some scenes from distances look maybe not so impressive like brahiosaurus scene when they feed one of them,jurassic park is another big success from spielberg where he put interesting characters and dinos together and mixed a great final product",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Heartwarming adventure which holds up to this day.,"I had never seen Jurassic Park before and going into this movie, I was scared that I wouldn't like what is considered by many an absolute classic (this had happened before). I'm glad that I had a very good time with this film. -Just real quick I'm sure everyone has seen this film but if you are one of the few that haven't then you should definitely go and see it because this movie is incredible!- SPOILERS AHEAD!!!I think that this movie pioneered a lot of the things we have come to expect from modern-day blockbusters, this just goes to show how big of an impact it has had on society and culture. Sure the CGI is quite dated, some moments are unintentionally laughable and the science behind it is just ridiculous, these things did ruin my suspension of disbelief. However, these moments were brief and for the majority of the film, it did not bother me at all because I was too busy enjoying it. The reason this movie works so well is because; at its core, it is about the characters and their relationships. Take the final scene for example, visually it is identical to when they first arrive on the island. However, everything has changed we see that the main protagonist who at the start wasn't very fond of kids, by the end they were taking a nap on his shoulders on the ride home. Or when the park founder finally realized that his dream was not going to play out the way he thought it would and needs to simply accept this as fact. At the start of the film, this guy was living in complete denial refusing to let go of this utopian idea of a dinosaur theme park. The final scene says it all, it takes its time on this beautiful shot of the helicopter flying away into the sunset, letting us process what we just witnessed; giving us time to think. The movie is filled with these heartwarming moments (with the kids especially) that seemingly come out of nowhere but do not feel out of place whatsoever.Steven Spielberg is truly a master, he has this ability to suggest to the audience something incredible is there without actually showing it. For example, when they take the ride on the island for the first time there is a very long reaction shot (almost above 2 minutes) where it is a close up on the characters faces, this is followed by a push in of the camera along with the beautiful sound cue. All these little things combine to create this mesmerizing effect that lets our imaginations run wild. It leaves us thinking what could they possibly be looking at that is making them stare in awe; with jaws dropped? The sequence ends with a stunning shot of the dinosaur finally revealing the thing to the audience. This technique of suggesting instead of showing is used throughout the film. Before the T-rex makes its first appearance there is an extreme close-up on a glass of water and how it violently shakes as we hear these monstrous footsteps. Again the same execution is repeated the second time around where we see Jeff Gold Blum's character through the reflection of a puddle (before the t-rex car chase). Ambiguity makes the whole thing feel all the more real. I believe this is ultimately more powerful than any amount of CGI could produce at that time, and I would even go so far as to say it is more powerful than any VFX from today.Essentially, this movie is a heartwarming adventure with great characters and a cool concept. It still holds up to this day and I can only imagine what it must have been like to see it in theaters when it first debuted in 1993. The term classic gets thrown around a lot when it comes to movies however, this one is without a doubt worthy of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Quite Possibly The Best Film Ever Made.,"Sometimes, you just need to revisit a classic. 30 years ago, a film was released that would give birth to not just a franchise, but a reinvigorated craze for dinosaurs for an entire generation of kids (especially boys), several theme parks, unparalleled leaps in film technology...that film is Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park.To say this is a perfect film almost goes without saying at this point. It is perfect; okay, not LITERALLY, to the extent that any human made creation can't really just literally flawless. I still can't get over the shot where Arnold's (Samuel L. Jackson) arm falls on Ellie (Laura Dern) near the end. Where did it come from? Why did it fall? Who knows. But little nit picky moments like this are really the only things I can think of.What sets this film apart from other big monster movies is that it's actually ABOUT something. It's about the human desire to control nature and play God and the rapacious and uncaring nature of capitalism; the externalities of our decision making that we never account for. Yet, it's also about family and personal growth; rewatching it, I'm struck by how truly incredible an arc Dr. Alan Grant (immortalized by Sam Neil) has. He goes from a guy perfectly content with his fossils and a ""will they, won't they"" relationship with Ellie to a person who seems ready for fatherhood and responsibility.Then there's the tension that only a master filmmaker like Steven Spielberg and the incredible team he works with could get right. The initial T-Rex scene and the velociraptor finale are burned indelibly in my and I'm pretty sure everyone's mind. They are iconic scenes, honestly, some of the best set pieces EVER put to film. But even the quieter moments, the scene with the brontosauruses, the initial reveal of the dinosaurs, the interactions between Ian (Jeff Goldbum - amazing, as always), John Hammon (Richard Attenborough), Ellie and Alan...And don't even get me started on the visual effects. Yes, there are some rare moments where you can see the early 90s CG. But they're so few and far between; the near perfect marriage between practical and computer effects is something I'm sure VFX artists to this day study intently.A 10/10 isn't really enough for Jurassic Park. It's a bona fide classic, an achievement in film making you don't get very often and something that can never truly be replicated again. If aliens were to visit us and says, ""show us your best stories and if we like them, we'll spare humanity,"" I'd send them a copy of Jurassic Park. That's how incredible this movie is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This Classic 22 Year Old Movie Is Still Awesome!,"""Jurassic Park"" has been around for twenty two years, and it has been one of those movies that has always been part of my childhood and it is definitely one of my all time favorite movies. This is the best of best, because none of the sequels lived up to the original. So the story is about an old man name John Hammond, who invites three doctors alongside with a lawyer to show them that dinosaurs are alive and real, and shows them how they were actually created after they were extinct sixty five million years ago (If anyone knows math on what I just typed). So he sets up a tour for them, but things go haywire as dinosaurs start to break loose when the power goes out during the storm, and it is a chance for our main characters to survive and to get off an island that is filled with dinosaurs. I did not see on the big screen back in 1993, but only saw it on home video. However, I was able to have the opportunity to see it on the big screen, but only this time in 3D as it came out back in 2013 for honoring the film's twentieth anniversary and I really had a blast to see it like I never had before. I love this movie, and it just never ages for me. To me, it feels timeless as if this movie was made today or any other time that was made. Of course, this movie was famous for its use of groundbreaking digital technology, and I know many filmmakers when nuts about this and it does upset many people that they choose to use CGI over practical effects. Although not many filmmakers overuse CGI as they decide to remain old school, but still use CGI if its done right. With that said, I thought it had a very good story from beginning to end as you first introduce the characters, then you show the island and how it went wrong, and you see how these characters are able to survive. The characters are very good, and likable at the same time. Sam Neill; Jeff Goldblum; Laura Dern and Richard Attenborough all gave out such terrific performances on their own; they may not be three dimensional, but there is still enough characterization in the movie and still to care about. The two child actors all did great too. The movie is filled with wonders, excitements and having some pretty good actions. Steven Spielberg has made such beautiful looking movie, and knows how to make a movie about how much we like about dinosaurs. John Williams' music is so darn memorable, and it is completely unforgettable. The special effects done by Stan Winston Studios and Industrial Light & Magic are top notch perfect for the use of practical and CGI effects. They continue to look impressive as I watch it, and it never feels dated for my own personal taste. If I had to pick what is my favorite dinosaur, I would say the T-Rex which it is obvious that everyone loves the T- Rex. I do love the scene where we first meet T-Rex as it has perfect build up that is perfectly suspense, and it is perfectly well edited together. Heck, the movie doesn't bored me and it was always keeps my interest. The ending that everyone remembers when the T- Rex saves Dr. Grant and the others by Raptors was awesome. I do love how the movie ends, where they finally go home in a helicopter and it gives you that good feeling as Williams' music plays along as the movie ends. I love ""Jurassic Park"" so much, and this classic twenty two year old movie is still awesome! I give it a perfect 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
DinoWorld,"After seeing the film for the first time I realized that it was nothing but Westworld with dinosaurs.  If you take out the robots and replace them with geneticly created dinosaurs then you have the movie Jurassic Park.  A few items that Jurassic Park(1993) borrows from Westworld.  The idea of a spectecular theme park that is to bring out the child in tourists. Something goes wrong and the exhibits of the theme park turn on its creators and anyone else that's around there.  The heroes overcome the exhibits and barely flee with their lives.  Although I wasn't impressed with this movie I did find it more entertaining to watch than the sequel The Lost World(1997). Attempts to do for dinosaurs what Jaws did for sharks.  Wasn't as good as Jaws(1975) because at least in that film there were genuine attempts to create suspense, tension, and terror.  The direction is average for the talents of Steven Spielberg.  The cinematography is excellent for an average film.  Sam Neill plays in his fourth genre film besides Possession(1981), Omen 3:The Final Conflict(1981), and Event Horizon(1997).  The rest of the acting ranges from over the top to very good.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A film 65 million years in the making,"Most film fans will have one film that ignited their love of cinema. For many that movie experience will come at a young age and in a dark theatre where the large screen envelops you in a whole new world you never thought possible. For me, like many of my generation, that film was Jurassic Park. Of course I liked many movies before that point but it opened my eyes to the potential of the medium like no other film, before or since. Scorsese talks about the religious-like experience cinema can create in its audience and watching Spielberg's classic for the first time I can fully appreciate what he means. It instilled a sense of reverential awe in me and whilst I had witnessed fantastical places like Oz and Tatooine I had never truly been transported to a foreign world as I had with Jurassic Park.It's a hard film for me to talk about rationally. It holds such a special place in my heart that I will never be able to find fault with the film, so instead I'm just going to gush about the movie's many positive attributes. Attributes like the groundbreaking special effects. The film is always assured of its place as one of the great technical achievements in cinema. CGI had been used in films for many years before but never quite to the point that you believed wholeheartedly in the events and creatures on screen. It is remarkable to think how far computer graphics have come since 1993 yet the film still looks utterly convincing, even more so than both of its inferior sequels. I can only put this down to the seamless blending of effects from the use of CGI, model work and animatronics. The film constantly tricks the audience into believing the dinosaurs were real by having creatures the cast could directly interact with. Because CGI has become so advanced now filmmakers rarely rely on the other types of effects work yet without them Jurassic Park's major moments would never have worked as well. Just imagine the T-Rex scene with the children trapped in the car, it is frighteningly believable because the creature is really there. Much of the critical attention is given to the computer wizardry but for me Stan Winston and his team are just as crucial to the film's success.Whilst the story is little more than a reworking of Westworld it is still so taut and full of genuinely magical moments that any familiarity in its conceit is immaterial. I can think of no other film with quite so many memorable sequences. The movie is packed with them, big or small, from the reverberating cup of water to the first dinosaur reveal, it is a film that has created more indelible memories than most filmmakers achieve in their entire careers. The cast are, with the possible exception of Laura Dern, perfect for their respective roles. When you compare it to a lot of modern blockbusters the film is surprisingly small in scale. Sure, you've got giant prehistoric creatures stomping around but the film doesn't have a sprawling cast of characters and it has no end-of-the-world climax. Yet it is the narrow focus that makes it all the more effective. Each character is given time to develop and whilst they may fulfil defined roles in the story they do at least feel like real and believable people. Jurassic Park may be a theme park but the film is more than just a thrill ride as you feel emotionally invested in the characters and events on screen.I've waffled on and not even mentioned the brilliant score by John Williams (a score so amazing it still sounds fantastic when slowed down by 1000%) or the film's perfect balance between comedy and scares. The film is a masterclass in blockbuster filmmaking and a bona fide classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I see dead species,"You know what? I recently wondered if I had actually seen Jurassic Park. I vaguely remembered I had done it some years back but couldn't be sure the couple of images in my memory arrived there while watching it or because images of JP have been so ubiquitous since.I decided to watch it and it really felt like I had never seen it... and I understand why: it is so much of a marketing product and so little of a real movie with interesting characters, elaborate plot and timing. Well I watched it anyway and it turned out that I had already seen it since I previously had given it 4 stars on IMDb.I admit I have never seen it on the big screen. Not in 1993, neither when it was reissued in 3D (I seen dead species, but not 3D... like 40% of the people). I never bought the hype because I was never interested in dinosaurs, so that makes me a blank viewer who can tell the true quality of the movie. And quite frankly it is the worst Spielberg movie I have watched (I skipped Always, and couldn't sit through Hook). Actually I don't know where it takes a talented director to shoot this. Maybe in pre-production for the artistic and ground-breaking technical choices. But that is mostly a producing job. The story itself is weak (I haven't read the book but feel it's always a bad idea to let the writer chose what to keep or not i the script) and action feels disjointed as we cut to various places that end up feeling more like the shooting sets they are than like parts of the fantastic island we are shown during the outstanding helicopter trip.Why wasn't I more impressed by the CGI + animatronics? Maybe because I didn't run to watch it back in 1993 and 10 years later this was just commonplace SFX. And again the still pictures from the movie had been so publicised that I knew exactly what to expect.So I will maintain my 4/10 rating because of the technical work in it, but it really is a poor movie. Spielberg did an excellent job with poor SFX in Jaws, here he does an excellent job at getting the right amount and quality of SFX but forgets the job he dreamt of when he had his first Super-8 camera. He even soften the evil Dr Hammond who is mostly like him: he initially has a passion for what he does and wants to do good but gets overwhelmed by the business stakes and the fact that most people around him are sycophants blurting how good he is.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Never Gets Old,"For me this is a movie that never gets old. I saw it first when I was two (and proceeded to want to watch 'the monster movie' 24/7...but once I called it monster movie my mom didn't want me to watch it too much). I'm sixteen - almost seventeen - now and still enjoy watching it. In fact, this movie was so good it's helped me finally choose a career path. I just had to read the book after seeing the movie. And thankfully for that I'm now going to be a paleontologist.And I'm not the only one. This movie (and the book) was so explosive that the year it came out the number of paleontologists exploded, and has been at an all time high ever since.But back to the movie. The actors play their characters extremely convincingly, and you really begin to believe that you could look out your window and see a Velociraptor stalking you outside. And it's not just the actors. The CGI is amazing and the Dinosaurs are extremely believable - though some of the Dinosaurs are not completely realistic according to their bones. And the pacing of the movie is amazing. It's not all non-stop action, or all blood and gore. It takes the time to give you breathers, develop characters, and actually has a plot besides 'OMG-Dinosaurs-r-goin-2-eat-us,' like it might had it been handled by different people.This movie is true movie magic.

Spielberg's exemplary dinosaur adventure holds up like it was released yesterday,"I was 9 years old when Jurassic Park came out in theaters and I looked forward to seeing it for months. I read the novel, I bought the toys and trading cards, and asked my parents every single day what day we were going to see it. Sunday of opening weekend, we drove to our nearest theater to see it. Sold out, we drove up Wisconsin Ave. in Washington, DC until we reached a multiplex in Bethesda, Maryland that was showing it on half of its 10 screens. My dad parked on the side of the road and ran into the theater, came back out with tickets that were starting in five minutes. We parked in the garage and I ran into that theater just as the previews were starting in a dark, packed theater.For the next two hours I was transfixed, terrified, and entertained. As soon as it was over, I wanted to see it again. At nine years old, it's hard to make your parents take you to see a movie for a second time, but somehow I did talk them into it, and then late in the summer I was able to see it a third time for a friend's birthday.As soon as it came out on VHS, I bought it and watched it every single day for a good year.Flash forward twenty years later during the 3d re-release and I had a day off in the middle of the week. My wonderful wife talked me into going to see it in IMAX 3-D by myself in the middle of the day and as the movie started I was so thankful to have agreed. I was nine years old again in that dark theater all by myself on a tuesday at 12:00. The opening credits shook the theater just like the THX sound did back in '93. The T-Rex was awe-inspiring and terrifying, the Raptors had me jumping in my seat.This is what the magic of movies is all about and why going into a dark room to watch a story that could never actually happen on a big screen is my favorite thing to do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The dinosaurs here are so realistic too, it's amazing.The cast including, Jeff Goldblum, (<-Especially.) Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Richard Attenborough, Bob Peck and Joseph Mazzello are all fantastic here as usual.Jurassic Park is a brilliant movie, which will always remain a classic. I think it's the best one of all three Jurassic Park movies so far. (Even though the others are fantastic too.) I give this movie a 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Got better with more viewings,"I recall that when I first saw this film fourteen years ago(in a theater,of course),I was more turned off by the amount of pat,cliché family/action caricature's(i.e. incorruptible,socially challenged expert or experts in field;oily,greedy lawyer;weaselly underling who will sell out anyone for a price;wide-eyed believer and,of course,kids--smart,cute,can-do kids)than I was in love with the impressive visual and sound gr4aphics. It wouldn't be until a couple more viewings of this movie would I come to appreciate the true entertainment value of this film.In case you're not aware of the plot or story,here goes: The opening day of the Costa Rican-located them park ""Jurassic Park"",populated with dinosaurs made from fossilized DNA just-found,promises to be a grand event. That is,until someone shuts down the security grid,thus throwing the whole area into chaos. It's up to the pluck of two Paleontologists(Sam Neill and Laura Dern),two kids(Joseph Mazzello and Arianna Richardson),an eccentric but insightful Mathematician(Jeff Goldblum,still the best element of this film or its sequel!),the game warden(Bob Peck) and the PArk's creator,a cheerfully optimistic tycoon(Sir Ricahrd Attenborough) to survive this dilemma.Director Steven Spielberg(who started on Schindler's List soon after this wrapped) doesn't seem to make any pretense as to what he's trying to do here,which,I must confess,is a good thing: He wants to make a fast,furious and eye-catching film that is light on characters or even some elements of logic and heavy on emotional and visual effects.Probably better as a wide-screen,big screen viewing experience,this is still a keeper,particularly of Mr.S's visual style and excess.

How did they know so much about the dinos?,"This films gets worse every time I see it.  The worst part of it is the fact that the scientists know so much about the dinos, even though they've been gone for so long.  For example, how do the scientists know that if they don't move then the T-Rex can't see them?  How could have they possibly figured that out by looking at bones?  And they tell us that the raptors hunt together and use teamwork to sneak up on people.  How can looking at fossils convey that sort of information?",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best dinosaur film ever made,"when i saw this movie for the first time i felt very curiosity by seeing those dinosaurs and all. This is perhaps the best movie ever made in Hollywood about historic stone age ,where human beings aren't still evolved on this planet. I got surprised because i thought that how Steven Spielberg got that idea that in this modern world , how can we again recreate dinosaurs which are extinct long back many thousands of years ago. coming to the movie, when i had seen this movie on screen, really i was felt very happy to see those many special effects in this film. really , it was a great job done by director and all technicians who worked for this film. And this movie had also broken many box office records upon release and soon it became the highest grossing film in history at that time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Truly incredible film-making,"I've watched this film many times and have yet to see a technical flub. The only disappointment is Jeff Goldblum. He was the only distraction of an otherwise brilliant film and singlehandedly destroyed Jurassic II. Attenborough was certainly the highlight of the actors and the rest of the cast (excepting Goldblum) were adequate to good. The real star of course, is the brilliant film-making. The only other film that impressed me as much was the original Star Wars. I would give a 10+ for Star Wars compared to a 9 for JP because SW used humor as well as fabulous technique. Too bad so many movies become too tense that the director doesn't realize the audience needs a little break. A prime example was ""Psycho"". The tension just kept building right up through the attack on Janet Leigh. It was about unbearable until Anthony Perkins rolled her car into the quicksand to hide it and it only sank halfway before giving a burp and sinking the rest of the way. The only laugh in the movie but in the perfect spot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is How You Do It,What an impact this film has had and still has. Never before have we seen dinosaurs on the screen in this magnitude. Even today nothing and nobody has done to dinosaurs what this film has done a film that unlike Jaws were not necessarily terrified to go into the water or in this case a zoo. With this we feel awed like we are looking over the Grand Canyon when we first see Jurassic Park. When I go to watch I don't just watch it for the casual sake of doing so because when I watch this it is an unbelievable and exhilarating experience that can appeal to the likes of anybody with a pulse. Another stand out is John Williams outstanding score that will be listened to for years to come even after 20 years it still holds up and that is the magic of Steven Spielberg as only he can bring us such a one of a kind experience and a film that gives a reason why we love films in the first place. The only negative I would have to say is the performance by Ariana Richards as Lex and Bob Peck performance is a bit overdone. Other then that this is a near perfect film. Now to grade.

Dinosaur Heaven,"So many reviews.  So much praise.  What could I possibly add?  Well, not a whole lot really.  This film is the best dinosaur movie ever made without question.  It is above the scope of the normal film of this nature, it transcends the ordinary to become the extraordinary.  Director Steven Spielberg has created a timeless gem here that entertains on many levels, but ultimately is a scary, horrifying look into what would happen if dinos and man mixed.  The special effects are what keep this film going and they are spectacular.  The dinosaurs look so real and animated with life.  Their ability to move, eat, and even think is a sight to behold.  The acting in this film is also very good.  Most of the characters have very definable personalities and you care for them throughout their struggles to survive. Sam Neil is excellent and Jeff Goldblum easily has the best lines in the film.  The musical score is wonderful.  For me, some of the best scenes in the picture are when Sam Neil is watching the dinosaurs that he has only theorized about his whole life.  He looks on like I imagine I would...with almost a child-like fascination.  The scene with all the little dinos running in a herd in the middle of a field in particular stands out as the enchanting musical score plays in the background.  This movie is one of the all-time money makers.  It is obvious to see why.  I cannot imagine that there is still someone that hasn't seen this, but if you are out there and have not - make sure you watch it lest you become a dinosaur in your own right.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great Idea, but not got the most out of it","THe idea of the way of bringing dinosaurs back from extinction is great and also of the Park, how it operates. The whole movie was actually consistently exciting concerning all what happened. So definitely entertaining. Some scenes and especially the characters were admittedly stereotyped, but Not in a negative way. The plot was obviously too minimalistic to my liking and a bit more background information would have been better.

What did he want to achieve with these stolen Embryos of Dinosaurs? Me personally, I lack this in the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Fun; Spielberg Creates Prehistoric Magic,"Spielberg's Jurrasic Park deserves the cult following it has generated. Essentially the forces of the Jurrasic period are let loose on a team of unsuspecting experts miles away from civilization who must then rely on their cunning to survive the onslaught. Sounds simple but by god is this movie breathtaking.Jurrasic Park stubbornly refuses to be classified as 'mindless', 'simplisitc' or 'boring'. It isn't high drama or socially relevant but it is entertaining. The best advice you can have for any film is to enjoy and respect what the director is trying to achieve. Spielberg is trying to tell an interesting, if not far-fetched, story hence we are obliged to sit back and enjoy it in all it's glory.Bearing this in mind, Jurrasic Park is great fun. The acting is subtle and witty, particularly Sam Neil and Jeff Goldblum. The younger actors fulfill their roles very well, a facet of the ensemble which can often destroy a film. Even the support characters with limited screen time are given sufficient opportunity to be developed.Furthermore, the special effects are unlike anything witnessed on screen. The dinosaurs are stunningly realistic and still hold up 10 years later. The photography is also deployed effectively, only giving little wisps of the more intimidating creatures until a scene's climax. The sound too will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck. The audio and visuals combine perfectly throughout. The scene in which a T-Rex's gait sets off vibration tremors in a harmless cup of water is unforgettable!Despite these bells and whistles, no film is complete without strong direction. Spielberg displays why he is one of the most famous directors of our time. The dramatic pacing in this film is spot on. Characters are well developed before the inevitable 'something goes wrong and we must now run for our lives' scenario sets in. And unlike some of his other films, Spielberg is not overly dependent on special effects early on, letting the viewer's imagination fill in the gaps.This is simply a fantastic movie. As far as an engaging and well-constructed adventure goes, Jurrasic Park thoroughly deserves its reputation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Jurassic Park Review,"On a remote island a theme park has been built that features genetically engineered dinosaurs, but after a worker was killed by a velociraptor the owner of the park John Hammond, must make sure it is safe before opening to the public.I remember watching this movie as a kid but I do not remember most of it. So this is essentially my first time watching the film and my god is it good.The entire film is mesmerizing, as we learn more and more about the park and the wonderful creatures inside it. That is all of course because of the phenomenal direction by Steven Spielberg. His ability to create an amazingly immersive experience is astonishing and something everyone must see.The cast is across the board perfect with amazing performances from them all. There isn't really one standout character in this film all of them have a role to play and a character arc to go through. I will individually mention the performance from Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards as they both give great performances as kids which is not a common thing.This movie also has some great horror type elements to it, with some really well timed jump scares as well as a constant sense of tension throughout.My only gripe is there are a couple of unrealistic moments. Now I know it is a movie about genetically engineered dinosaurs but certain things happen that just don't make sense, but it's not a common occurrence.Overall Jurassic Park is a quality film with phenomenal direction, great storytelling, and an amazing cast.9.5/10

One of the greatest adventure movies ever made.,"Steven Spielberg sure does know how to make a good film. And Jurrasic Park is no exception. I may only be 14, but this film is still my favourite movie of all time and righteously deserves the title of one the greatest adventure flicks ever made. I first saw this movie at a friends house, as it was released in cinemas when i was just only 1 year old. I was in awe when i saw it then, and still 8 years later i can watch this movie over and it will never lose any of it's charm, thrills or pace. It is a pity, that there has been no film, i believe, released since Jurassic Park that was truly able to capture the excitement and wonder that is a proper adventure flick. The special effects, while amazing (and still stand up proudly over 14 years later), are blended very smoothly with animatronic puppets so as to give an extra sense of realism to the beasties, and the whole thing is strung together with a fantastic sense of pacing, so you are never bored. One thing that has always bugged me, is that this film is never truly recognised as it should be. You wouldn't have to look very far to find a scene that blatantly rips off the classic kitchen scene, and yet Jurassic Park is never recognised as it really should be. I implore you, if anyone is looking to make a fun, energetic, thrilling and charming film then they need look no further for inspiration that the one, the only, the classic JURRASIC PARK.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Nice dinos, but what about the people?","After watching Disney's ""Dinosaur"", I simply had to come back and watch this movie to see why I had liked it more in the first place.Well, it might have been because Jurassic Park is, unabashedly, a grown-up film, while Dinosaur walks the thin line between a kiddie flick and an all-out adult assault on the senses. And I couldn't stop noticing the fact that 7 years of advance in CGI haven't been all that wonderful. I still somehow think that JP's creatures are more realistic than Dinosaurs'. Maybe the fact that the Disney flick had to make the creatures talk and have facial expressions were the reasons I give the nod to JP's beastly creatures any day, any time.But then, I focused on the characters. Excluding Ian Malcolm and John Hammond (Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough), I reached the conclusion that I hated the rest of the cast almost as much as I hated Jar Jar Binks (and that's saying I really hated them). The best example I can think of is the one where the child is playing with the computer saying she is a computer wiz. Or when Laura Dern and Sam Neill stare in desbelief at the first dinosaur in the movie. One can see in their eyes they are trying to be impressed by something they are trying to visualize, without much success. Talk about bad acting!I guess the day when someone decides to make an epic with CGI dinosaurs *without* facial expressions and voice, and where no humans are present, that will be the day a dino-flick will earn my ""10"" rating. As it is, JP earns a solid 8 on the basis of acting from the dinos.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the Greatest Summer Blockbusters in History,"I don't need to say too much about this film.

Great Movie,"This movie was really great. Don't get me wrong. I loved it. But I really think the first half of this could have been A LOT better. The action doesn't even start until an hour of viewing. But what follows is absolutely terrific. It scares you at times when dinos pop out of nowhere and it is one f/x movie that people really liked. Most movies of this kind (Independence Day, Godzilla, Armageddon, etc. Which I liked ALL of) are movies that don't really please like this movie. It's got really smart action sequences and fairly good acting but I think they should have used more popular stars, but you mostly concentrate on the dinosaurs, which do good acting jobs. I thought they would have been nominated for Best Actresses. The f/x are another thing. They look really good! Only if the first half was more exciting but oh well. The rest of the movie makes up for that mistake. That leaves one more thing. The sequel. I thought the sequel was top notch. It was even better than this movie. In my opinion, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is just slightly better than the first because it starts out with more action. That's unlikely for sequels. Watch them both. They will be remembered for generations. Until they become extinct. Or when the next blockbuster hits with great f/x and good script.

"Stomped its competition, and had fun doing it","Part of me wonders if this movie would've had such an impact on me were I just a bit older back in 1993. At its heart, ""Jurassic Park"" is really just a monster movie, but it rides high on Spielberg as the master showman; it plays like an amusement park full of impressive effects and plenty of scares. In one scene, he takes the vibe from wonder to dead to horror, and I still appreciate that as a much older adult; same for the CGI, which is used perfectly as a tool (and still holds up for that reason).I can't say whether the science is accurate (though I still think it's cool), but the thrills deliver and the cast is good (letting the smartass Goldblum steal every scene).

The simple visuals are just as effective as the CGI dinosaurs,"A group of scientists are invited to an island to see the results of some ground-breaking genetic engineering.I saw this in the cinema several times on its release and have to say it blew my mind at the time. Everything from Michael Crichton's initial concept to the magical effects that brought it to life all seemed like a yet another cinematic milestone from Spielberg in the same year that he made Schindler's List.The effects probably seem standard when you compare to films made in the twenty-first century. Bringing dinosaurs to life with the same kind of epic excitement and horror as witnessed in Jaws was a big deal in 1993. Unlike in Jaws, thanks to Industrial Light And Magic, Spielberg shows us the principle creatures in all their glory.The spectacle is presented in fairly measured way, as I was equally thrilled by the visuals that use no special effects. Simple sequences such as an arm being pulled through someone else's grasp, a raptor shadow, a shaky spoon of jelly and the famous tremor in the puddle are all example of cinematic moments that tell me exactly what's happening and stick in my memory.Most characters play second fiddle to the excitement and visual spectacle. Jeff Goldblum's mathematician Ian Malcolm is by far the most memorable with all the best lines of the script. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are solid as the two main characters, while Wayne Knight, Samual L Jackson, Martin Ferrero and Bob Peck give strong support. Richard Attenborough is perfectly cast as John Hammond. Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards fill the roles of the obligatory child characters well, but for me the movie didn't need them.Alongside the dinosaurs whenever I think of Jurassic Park, I think of yet another beautifully written piece of music from genius composer John Williams. Again Spielberg has Williams to thank for elevating one of his movies to the level of modern day classic.I recently watched it with my four year old daughter and (a few scares aside) she sat through it all with great interest.

There's nothing not to love about this movie.,"Jurassic Park (1993) is a movie in my DVD collection that my daughter and I recently rewatched together on HBOMAX.

The financial backer of the science wants to create a theme park for the dinosaurs for people to see his creations. As the scientists partake in the first dry run of the park they quickly discover dinosaurs cannot be contained so easily...This movie is directed by Steven Spielberg (ET) and stars Sam Neill (In the Mouth of Madness), Jeff Goldblum (The Fly), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), Laura Dern (Blue Velvet), Wayne Knight (Seinfeld) and Ariana Richards (Tremors).The background music from the opening to closing credits is absolutely perfect in this movie. You feel the intensity of every scene from the music in the background and wonderfully created tremors elements anytime a dinosaur is present. The cast is relatable across the board and Knight played the perfect ""villain."" The special effects in this are magic as is the delivery of the science on how this could be possible. The concept really feels believable. Also incorporating people getting killed by dinosaurs was brilliant as was unleashing the raptor species into the world like we had never seen before was well done.

Who doesn't love dinosaurs?,"Jurassic Park is one of the landmark films of my childhood. One of the earliest memories I have of ever going to see a movie at a movie theater was of seeing this movie. For simple nostalgic reasons this has always been one of my favorite movies, but I think in a way I never fully appreciated the film until I have become an adult.Jurassic Park is truly up there with Jaws as one of the most thrilling monster movies of all-time. Each time Tim and Lex get chased by the velociraptors, my heart pounds. When the T-Rex attacks the jeep on that rainy night, I always get filled with raw excitement. It is hard not to be thrilled by Jurassic Park's many death defying set pieces, but the film truly shines thanks to its characters and its director.What makes Jurassic Park more than your average amusement park ride, is that the director, Steven Spielberg, knew that the film would need great characters in order for the audience to feel any sort of attachment to the film's story. This was a ploy in which he utilized so well in the past in Jaws, and he does here once again with Jurassic Park. The story of Alan Grant leading Tim and Lex through the dinosaur filled Jurassic Park would have not been as thrilling, or even as heartwarming, if Alan Grant was a fan of children. Still the characters on the page were not enough, they needed great actors to bring them to life, which Jurassic Park had; ranging from Sam Neil to Richard Attenborough. I mean could you imagine watching Jurassic Park without Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm. It's almost impossible isn't it.Overall I think Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated films in movie history. The classic Spielberg magic is there, and in my opinion even more so than Jaws. What Spielberg did with Jurassic Park was give it an awe inspiring scale, but also he gave this film true heart. As a kid I thought this was one of the greatest films of all-time, and I still think the same today.I give Jurassic Park a perfect 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Steven Spielberg's best film,"Plot: paleontologists Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) are among a select group chosen to tour an island theme park populated by dinosaurs created from prehistoric DNA. While the park's mastermind, billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), assures everyone including his grandchildren that the facility is safe, they find out otherwise when various ferocious predators break free and go on the hunt.I have loved this film ever since I was a kid. Each time I watch it, I'm always amazed at how they managed to pull this off without any problems during production. This is a fascinating story about how we shouldn't tamper with nature of any kind of species. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough all give terrific performances, fully realizing their character's motivations and not trying to make them blatant stereotypes like some movies would do. Even the kids , Joseph Mazzello and Arianna Richards are not annoying little brats that never shut up and whine, they are very likable and very charming. The special effects are top notch and are one of a kind. They changed the way special effects would be along with Terminator 2. Stan Winston and his team did an amazing job combing animatronics and CGI beautifully making the dinosaurs realistic.While there are minor differences from the Michael Crichton book, Spielberg stays true to the themes and ideas that Crichton had in his book, hell Crichton even co-wrote the screenplay to help keep the movie as fairly accurate to his book.Jurassic Park is my favorite Spielberg film, with great performances, fantastic special effects, a terrific story, and my all time favorite John Williams score from any film that he's done, Jurassic Park is and will always be in my opinion, Steven Spielberg's Masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Still Some of the Best Special Effects You're Going to See,"Jurassic Park (1993)*** (out of 4)Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel about a group of people invited to an island to try out a new amusement park, which just happens to have real dinosaurs on it. Before long there's a breach in the security and the dinosaurs are running loose and man has to face them. JURASSIC PARK was recently re-released in 3-D and I must say that I really didn't think the format made the film any better or worse. There were a few nice shots in the 3-D but overall I'd say people can just be happy with the original version. As for the movie itself, I still remember the lines around the block when this thing came out and I still remember the hype of opening day. I've always thought this was a good movie but at the same time I have never fallen in love with it like so many other have. I think my biggest problem with the picture is that I just didn't find it scary enough. Spielberg spends the first half of the movie getting the viewer to let their mind go in the wonder of dinosaurs being alive. The second half of the film is when the action takes place and I just didn't find any of it scary. I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that I never believed for a second that any of the major characters were ever going to be harm and I won't spoil how the film turned out. Outside of that, the film is technically well-made by Spielberg who does a great job hinting at what we're about to see early on before actually bringing out the dinosaurs. Once they're released on screen you can't help but be impressed by the special effects, which hold up incredibly well when viewed today and I think a strong argument can be made that these type of effects haven't been beaten by any other film. Another major plus is that we're given a good cast but I will say Jeff Goldblum's one-liners are as bad today as they were in 1993. The music score from John Williams is another classic as it too really brings this fantasy world to life and makes you believe in the miracle of how they came to be. JURASSIC PARK certainly isn't one of my favorites but it still has a lot going for it that makes it worth seeing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Don't read the book first!,"Upon hearing that Steven Spielberg was planning on releasing Jurassic Park, I immediately bought Michael Crichton's book and read it. Since I love science, I was mesmerized with all the scientific aspects which sounded VERY believable. The rich details of the island, scientific processes, and fears for the characters on the island caused me to start from page one once I finished the book. If you are into biology, genetics, or science, in general, this is an awesome book. When I went to watch the movie I had images of the book in my imagination and I was deeply saddened to see that the visual representation only teased some of the aspects of the book. I thought that with Crichton writing the screenplay, the movie would closely resemble the book, but I was wrong. He left out all the best parts and inserted ideas that weren't as good as his book. It is true that Crichton adapted a screenplay with one image in mind: teeth. He understood that, like in Jaws, movie-goers love flesh eaters. Computer generated dinosaurs with menacing teeth running amuck on an island is basically the standard he lowered his book to. He eliminated the experiments the scientists made to create the dinosaurs, the egg factories, prehistoric plant life, how the dinosaurs evolved to reproduce on their own, and the fact that some dinosaurs escaped the island from his book. Sure, I thought the movie was cool, if it was a stand alone, but when you compare it to the book it was a flop. Then Crichton did the unimaginable, he wrote two more adaptations and released movies for them. He understands that the public, especially children, wants to see more `chomping,' hence the PG-13 rating. Now, I've noticed that he plans on releasing a fourth installment in 2005. Sounds like a rental to me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dino -mite! (sorry),"As a kid who was fascinated by dinosaurs JP was a dream come true for me. I was obsessed with this film. Because of this I still love the series - even Lost World and JP3.A lot of people miss the point I think when reviewing Jurassic Park films. For me anyway its all about the dinosaurs and the set pieces involving them. I don't watch for the in depth science talk or character development. Altho having said that the science babble in the first film here partly inspired my love of science.By todays standards Jurassic Park takes a long time to get going and unless you are interested in the science behind it you're going to get pretty bored during the first 45 mins or so. Until of course you are hit when one of the most memorable moments in film history - the Rex attack. From then on its a dinosaur onslaught, and while I think the dino attacks are better done in the later films, here they still pack a punch.I loved everything about this movie. Even the music has become synonymous with some of my favourite summer memories.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Rex: Dinosaur Island,"Humanity has been fascinated with dinosaurs since their discovery. The prehistoric creatures eventually made their way to the big screen. But since they no longer exist, there has to be a way to put human actors and the creatures together. Different movies do it in different ways. This one, for instance, has scientists bring some species back to life on a tropical island to function as a revolutionary theme park.The scientific way of resurrecting dinosaurs in this movie is such nonsense it isn't worth discussing. The creatures themselves are not numerous. There are a handful of herbivore species that have little screen time and three carnivore species that the movie, obviously, uses as unstoppable death machines. What the movie focuses on heavier, though, is a couple of kids whose behavior is quite annoying and the danger they go through is insane, as is their survivability in the movie. I do not want anybody to get hurt. But the movie knows you, audiences, care a lot more about children than you probably do about adults. That is a cheap move.The music, the cast, the visuals in general, the dinosaur effects, are strong. But here is an interesting thing. The first time I saw this movie I was a little kid, and my dinosaur fascination was as big as ever. And I didn't like the movie at all. I did not see enough dinosaurs and hated the rain. Later, especially with the 3D release, I saw it in a more positive way because I paid more attention to the visual effects, and they were great.I hear, James Cameron was once interested in making this movie, only he, allegedly, would have chosen more of a horror direction. But as far as dinosaurs go, ""Jurassic Park"" is a monster movie already. The main stars in it are two scary predators, and people do get seriously hurt in the film. Perhaps, Cameron would have chosen to keep kids away from the action. His sequel to Sir Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" does not suggest it, though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dumb movie,"I went to see this original Jurassic Park when it first came out.At the time, I was struck by how really, really dumb it was. Over time, I've come to recognize what it was I'd seen: It was a nasty case of Producers' Cold Feet Syndrome. Possibly compounded by the Director and other artistic voices not having the cajones to countenance those dumbing-down voices and redeem the exercise a bit.The characters are reduced to cartoon caricatures. The flick plays like a first-draft storyboard animatic. Driven by the producers' knee-jerk responses to dailies, the ""denouement"" is funneled into an insulting joke of a resolution. And they think the whole exercise in narrative dim-wittedness can be redeemed by closing out on an off-the-shelf, one- size-fits-all ""geez-aren't-kids-'n'-family-just-the-coolest-thing"" scene.I give it one star (over the minimum '1') because you can see that some folks tried. They really did. But... No Cigar. A lot of money spent on a big nothing'.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest movies of all time!,"Tagline: 65 million years in the making.Plot outline: John Hammond(Richard Attenborough), discovers a way to create dinosaurs and clone them. Now the creatures who have fascinated people for years now roam freely in Jurassic Park, and all the world can see them. For a price...Until something goes wrong...This movie, based on the novel by Michael Crichton, deserves to be called one of the greatest movies of all time. The dinosaur effects were awesome, the cast was great, and the plot was also excellent. I'd say this is one of Spielberg's greatest accomplishments. Of course there were other people to thank. Stan Muren for the dinosaur effects, all the cast and crew members, including Sam Neill and Laura Dern, who both put up an outstanding performance. It was also thanks to these people that the movie was possible. I dont know why I never saw it in theatres, but when I did see it, I instantly loved it. I also loved this movie because it's not beyond the realm of possibility.

An Awe Inspiring Special Film,"With Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom coming to Netflix on Friday I have decided to go back and rewatch the other films in the franchise starting with the legendary Jurassic Park and here is my review. The premise of the film sees a group of experts sent to an island where an excentric Billionaire has cloned Dinosaurs for an amusement park, but the obvious happens leading to the beasts escaping and causing chaos.Main Character
Sam Neil plays Dr Alan Grant and he is great in the film. He is basically the audience as he is mesmerised by the dinosaurs and as an expert in the field he gives us the lowdown on the different dinosaurs. He has a great mix of gruff and charm which makes him an interesting character, he also has an arc which fleshes his character out even more changing him up from where he starts the film.Supporting Characters
We have one of the greatest supporting characters in any movie here, with Jeff Goldblum playing Dr Ian Malcolm. He is so charismatic and cool, he has one liners coming out of everywhere and it makes him the guy that you are drawn to when he is on screen even with huge dinosaurs here. Laura Dern plays Ellie and does a really good job, she is a strong female character and one you can root for really easily. One thing I noticed here more then before is just how good the late Richard Attenborough is as Hammond, he is such an interesting character who goes through a phylosophical journey through the film and sees his character have a fascinating arc. Samuel L Jackson, the kids and all the other smaller roles are good and help boost the film even more.Story
The story here is brilliant, for the first half of the plot you are wowed by the dinosaurs and the park itself. Also the characters are all really interesting and the debates they have about science and morales is really interesting and full of depth. Then the 2nd half of the film is where everything goes wrong and the film becomes a brilliant thriller, you care about the characters and the film builds the tension really well. Seeing the different dinoasurs and how they react to the people is great to see and it does a great job in it's ending not sequel baiting, even though we would get sequels.Script
The script is great, as I have mentioned there are some really interesting debates about whether the idea of cloning Dinosaurs is right or wrong and the characters make it interesting. The humour is here, Goldblum brings so many laughs here and the drama is well handled too.Style
This is where the film is at it's best, this film's style changed cinema in my opinion. Along with Terminator 2 this film is heavily credited with progressing CGI and animatronics, the dinoasurs look incredible, better then some things that come out now and this film came out in 1993 it is just incredible. Watch this film for the amazing effects alone and get a film that hits every level with it. Plus this film has one of the best scores ever by the legendary John Williams,Overall
Overall, this is one of those epic and special films that have been made. The awe and wonder of the film is a real highlight and this is a must watch for people that haven't seen it.Rating - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Ultimate Technical Achievement,"One thing about this movie that is obviously a very important part is, like I said, the effects. The effects started the craze of CGI in films for effects that would be impossible to do with practical effects (and fast forward to today where CGI is now been run into the ground and a movie that has an extended use of practical effects seems like a godsend, but I digress.) The thing that this movie also did well was mix a use of both CGI and practical effects. When there was something they could do with practical effects, they used practical effects. But when there was a scene where they couldn't, then they used CGI. The CGI also holds up pretty well today, except for one dinosaur that was really obvious that it was CGI.When talking about Jurassic Park, when people stop talking about the effects and go on to the story, this is where some people find the movie ""meh"". And, while its not terrible there some aspects of the story nowadays that kinda seem ridiculous. Like the whole mosquito blood DNA thing was introduced, it was pretty ridiculous. But I do like the movie is kind of a battle between nature and the advance of science. But the story does have a few flaws.The acting was also pretty good. Sam Neill was good as the main character, so was Laura Dern. Jeff Goldblum was good, but there were some points where he was really corny. Everyone else was good in the movie to. I feel as if the movie isn't really praised for its story or characters. Its praised for technical achievement in film history. And I really enjoyed it, but some aspects of the story lowered the score down for me personally.Final Score: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I think the actors do an amazing job, and the screenplay is really awesome. Sam Neill is one of my favorite actors and in this film no one could ever do as good a job as he did.

The Genius And Vision Of Spielberg,"It's indeed rare when a movie comes along that is so special, and has such a tremendous impact on audiences of all ages, that when it happens, it's an occasion for celebration; which is exactly what Steven Spielberg gave the world with `Jurassic Park,' a film that made the impossible possible:  It enabled dinosaurs to walk among us.  He put these monsters from a bygone era on the screen for all to see, and the unique thing about it was that they were real; so real you could reach out and touch them it seemed.  And in doing so he touched the imaginations of every child who sat there in the dark of a theater and watched his creations come to life, and he touched the child that still resides within every adult who came to see his show as well.  Jaded moviegoers and those who affect cynicism as a mission statement of life may scoff, especially now, after some time has passed and the magic has worn off somewhat, but it doesn't alter the fact that with this movie, Spielberg surpassed any and all standards of the cinematic world and set the precedent for all that would follow.  To borrow a line from one of his own characters, he `Spared no expense,' and simply made one of the most exciting and memorable films in the history of the Silver Screen. 	Spielberg pulled out all the stops to make this remarkable film, and it goes without saying that the special F/X are incredible; what's easy to overlook amid all the spectacle of it, however, are the performances turned in by one and all, and most notably by Jeff Goldblum, who brings such nuance and style to the role of Dr. Ian Malcolm.  It's a supporting role into which he immersed himself to create one of the more memorable characters in the film, and his performance-- with the countenance and attitude he lends to Malcolm, even the commanding, mesmerizing way he speaks-- has never received the attention it so richly deserved.  Nor has the performance of Richard Attenborough, as John Hammond, the entrepreneur who makes Jurassic Park a reality.  He's such a gifted performer that he makes you forget he's acting; Hammond becomes real, which makes what he's doing real, and it's just another example of the many things that add up to make this such an incredible movie.  Spielberg and his cast and crew have given such care to detail that it, in effect, releases the viewer from the baggage of even having to suspend disbelief because they're given a world that is `real' from the ground up.  The result of using all of the magic available, and using it wisely. 	Also turning in outstanding-- and entirely believable performances-- are Sam Neill, as Dr. Alan Grant, and Laura Dern, as Dr. Ellie Sattler, each creating figures central to the plot and around whom much of the action revolves.  And there are a number of performances in supporting roles that are just too good to go unmentioned as well,  including Bob Peck, as Muldoon, the park's head gamekeeper; Martin Ferrero, as the `blood-sucking' lawyer, Donald Gennaro; Wayne Knight, as computer hacker Dennis Nedry; Samuel L. Jackson, as computer programmer Ray Arnold; and last, but not least, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards as Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, through whose eyes the child in all of us vicariously experiences the wonders of Jurassic Park. 	The wonderful thing about a movie like `Jurassic Park' is that, not only will it forever remain as a testimonial to a filmmaker of genius and vision, but that it will be there for all the generations that follow to discover anew.  The world may change drastically around us, even from one day to the next, but as long as even a single spark of imagination survives, one thing will always remain constant:  The fascination by children of all ages for these legendary beasts that once ruled the earth.  And that is why, when all is said and done and the skeptics have become no more than shadows and dust, this film-- as well as Steven Spielberg-- will remain a cause for celebration.  This is the legacy, and the true magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The greatest mind trick of all time.,"When I first went to see this in a theater back during year '93 I was blown away for being a typical nine year old. Time went on, my collection of dinosaur toys grew and I dreamed of an effects artist career. So it's an understatement to say that I was merely inspired. I'm certainly less gullible presently when it comes to movies. I've felt for a certain period that the first movie lacks a lot of substance thanks to it's sequels. But as of today I now accept this movie for what it is, a great sci-fi piece of it's own that entertains if you have the right sense of mind to allow it to while adding to that a remarkable tale. The story is clever in all it's simplicity, about man needing to learn about the responsibilities to the power of altering nature. The characters aren't overly complex and can sometimes give you the usual cardboard image. But all that they manage to represent with success is enough to still make us care about their fates. But the most valuable aspect is in how the movie handles the dinosaur effects, the first time computer animation is used to enhance a scenario too impossible to show practically while still managing to enhance said practicality with magical end results. This reciprocity is a total success. It was ironically also the last time a movie would use CGI as an enhancement instead of a replacement. No such luck with it's two follow-ups where the dinosaurs become out-shadowed by a cast of human characters with too much saturation for their own good starting with The Lost World that totally messes up the moral successfully represented here in favor of larger sequences and laughable human motives with Jurassic Park 3 dumbing down the rest as, some may say, the final nail to the coffin. In the sequels the entire concept has become mere overcomplicated padding to sell the excuse of ""dinosaurs chasing people"" and forgetting what actually made it so good here. That really is a shame. It is because of it that to me there is only one true Jurassic Park, a promising concept of man playing god with a moral dilemma strong enough to reach out to the reality which we ourselves live in but sadly diminished by neglect in the follow-ups. A watered down yet entertaining version of a smart science fiction novel that manages to keep most of that smartness without compromising the enjoyment. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A lot to endure to see dinosaurs,"I first saw this movie in 1993 for one simple reason: DINOSAURS!  15 minutes into the film, I stood with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), craning my neck upwards to stare in awe at a 40-foot tall Brachiosaurus pulling leaves off the tops of eucalyptus trees.  For it's time, the special effects were astounding, and still are today.  But more important, they did their job, they left me feeling as though i had truly walked among dinosaurs.  I had seen them presented not as bizarre monsters, but simply as animals, as part of nature. I left the theater largely satisfied.Unfortunately, this movie fares much worse upon second viewing.  All the trademark Spielberg cliche's are brought out in full force: shafts of light penetrating smoke and mist; painful sequences of expository dialog, such as Dr. Grant's encounter with an obnoxious kid at a Dinosaur Dig in Montana; long, slow zoom-in shots of dumbstruck actors with astonished looks on their faces; overwrought action scenes in with even the suspense becomes tedious. The dialog is not even entertainingly campy, it's just plain awful.  In 1993 in a dark theater, the thrill of seeing a few minutes of these marvelous dinosaurs roaming the countryside vastly outweighed such annoyances. Chancing upon a viewing in a video store, or renting it for my son, the annoyances become just too distracting.John William's score is, as usual, tremendous.  The signature tune captures the sense of awe and majesty in gazing upon an animal that has not walked the earth for over 100 million years.  Of the cast, Richard Attenborough, Wayne Knight and Sam Jackson are the most satisfying.  I recommend this movie only if, like me, you just really really want to see dinosaurs.

Hold On To Your Butts,"Jurassic Park is one of the films I just couldn't stop watching when I was younger. Although I used to watch it just for the roar of the T-Rex, the movie was still a perfect way for me to kill two hours on those boring Sundays I still deal with. While the idea of a movie that has the plot of ""resurrecting"" dinosaurs, the movie does an excellent job in making the plot believable and actually made me think: ""If we had the right preparations, could we create dinosaurs?"" It sounds crazy, but the movie really gets you thinking that after the easy-to-follow description of how they brought back the extinct lizards. As a movie directed by Steven Speilburg, the least one could've expected when watching a movie like this for the first time would be excellent CGI, and let me tell you, this looks better than many movies of today, and it's over twelve years older than them. Not only do the dinosaurs look astounding and believable, but the action they're put in (along with the actors) is equally satisfying and thanks to all-around great acting performances, there's plenty of well-done suspense throughout the film as well. But one of the many parts of this movie that immediately made me dig it was the music. The theme music in this film isn't only instantly recognizable, but it's also unforgettable and always a joy to listen to when watching a movie as fun and thrilling as this. While Speilburg has made (and still does make) some disappointing flicks he's still one of the top directors in my eyes and this one in particular stands out as a big hallmark. If you're looking for real entertainment that's larger than life, look no further than this thrill ride through the jungle.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Ever so don't knock it,"I thought Jurassic Park is a great movie. I've watched it many times over and still think it's great although it doesn't freak me out like when I first saw it when I was 9. Look, when you're older and seen it a few times,  Jurassic Park is not supposed to freak you out! It's not like aliens with a +M15 rating.

Pure Entertainment!,"Steven Spielberg's body of work is legendary. He is widely considered to be the most influential storyteller of this generation. I once quoted by saying 'Speilberg can't afford a single hater'. I personally feel that he's immortal, in fact, I feel he'll be around Film-People & Buffs alike, for the longest time.His 1993 Blockbuster-Hit 'Jurassic Park' is Pure Entertainment. It's a joyride, that keeps you gripped till the end. It's fantastically shot & executed.'Jurassic Park' takes place on the fictional Isla Nublar near Costa Rica in the Central American Pacific Coast, where a billionaire philanthropist and a team of genetic scientists have created an amusement park of cloned dinosaurs. While During a preview tour, the theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.Based on the novel of the same name by Michael Crichton, this Sci-Fi Thriller offers interesting & engrossing moments all through. Spielberg directs each sequence beautifully. Cinematography & Editing are perfect. Visual Effects are stunning. While in the acting department, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Richard Attenborough & Jeff Goldblum pitch in superb performances.On the whole, A Joyride, that deserves a watch for various reasons.

An adventure that's worth the 65 million year wait!!!,"My dad was a huge fan of the book Jurassic Park and its sequel, The Lost World. The books became huge hits when Universal bought the rights from Michael Crichton three years before the movie came out, months before Spielberg's academy award winning movie, Schindler's List, came out. I was too young to see this movie as I was only 10 years old and dad was undecided on if I'd like it or not due to the pg-13 rating. I grew up being fascinated with dinosaurs after seeing exhibits about them and seeing them in cartoons and playing with them as toys as in Dino Riders. When i finally saw the movie on vhs more than a year after it was in theaters (dad saw it in Wayne Preakness, one of the few theaters that showed it in DTS 5.1, with my stepmom kathy two years before they got married), i loved it!! I saw it a few more times then bought the movie on tape at now gone Suncoast and I still have that tape somewhere lol. The CGI still stands the test of time nearly 25 years after it came out and the action is nonstop yet it drags a bit. The sequel that followed it, The lost world, i saw twice, first with my family and the second one with a group of boys and girls club teens and thought it was the best jurassic sequel. Jurassic Park III was the weakest in the franchise until Jurassic World became a humongous hit. Hopefully fallen kingdom is ok....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great. What else can I say.,"This movie is great.

Appalling,"A gaudy and showy story but also appalling. A crazy billionnaire decides to create a jurassic park in an Island where his team starts cloning dynosaurs from ADN taken from a mosquito kept in fossilized amber and that had sucked dynosaur blood. He plans to open the park to visitors and even tourists.
Of course this will turn out badly. The huge beasts are set free when the electrical fences are put off by mistake or something else I cannot remember now and chase the visitors and the park premises.
As a matter of fact one of the characters at a certain moment doubts that it is legitimate to reverse the natural evolution process recreating species that Nature has destroyed and putting them to live together with human beings that didn't exist at the time of those extinct species.
It is a movie that is worth what is worth bur it is undoubtedly technically very good namely at the several scenes in which the animal monsters intervene and that develop themselves with a brutal and terrifying realism.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The art of entertainment,"When I saw Jurassic Park back in 1993 as a young lad I was obsessed and inspired. It was a feast for the eyes and mind. However, it did not age very well with me.The story, well there is virtually none, is entertaining like only Spielberg can entertain. But I'm afraid is not inspirational anymore at my older age.There is little substance and not much meat to chew on, so to speak. They try to debate the role of humans in nature and how interfering can lead to harmful situations even if/when we had the best of intentions. However, the problems of the park had nothing to do with the dinos or gene manipulation. Just a disgruntled IT employee, that's it. The only true issue was the breeding bit, but that's not the biggest problem.Much ado about nothing. It wouldn't be any different if this was about a bunch of people stuck inside a zoo with loose lions, tigers and bears. Oh my!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Where were you when you first saw Jurassic Park?,"A thrilling and ambitious journey, Jurassic Park can suffer from a handful of formulaic tendencies- but that doesn't stop the film from its incredibly fun ideas and worthwhile execution. First off, the cast is just so well done in the film- from Laura Dern to Sam Neill to Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough- everyone just gives it their absolute all and it just works so well. The plot is simple, and at times a bit predictable- dinosaurs coming back to reality is always a fun idea however so thankfully to its execution it never feels bogged down too much narratively. I wasn't a huge fan of the kid characters throughout, the actors did fine, but I couldn't help but feel they were all but unnecessary- and only a plot device to see Neill's character grow. The special effects were of course brilliant at the time and mostly hold up rather well today. I love the combination of CGI and animatronic and feel it never surpassed the grand ideas this film had in terms of that collaboration in the future. The score is absolutely excellent, of course its iconic, but even lesser known tracks just flow so well throughout the film. In the end, Jurassic Park has some minor flaws here and there but is mostly a fun and solid little adventure flick that for once deserves the hype.My Rating: 9.3/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An adventure sixty-five million years in the making,"""Jurassic Park"" is Steven Spielberg's immensely popular movie about a theme park with live dinosaurs made possible by replicating preserved dinosaur DNA. Through a calamity the dinosaurs escape their fenced confinements and run amok in the park. The park was created with impressive sets and scenes. John Williams' score is of the highest quality and greatly adds to the majesty and intensity of the film.On paper it sounds as though ""Jurassic Park"" could be just another ""monsters attack"" movie, but there are several factors that make this film far better than just another monster movie. There is some character development and importantly each part is perfectly cast, which means that each character makes a distinct impression and has memorable lines. Richard Attenborough is the perfect man to play the genial park owner John Hammond. The way Hammond mused about his dream of creating Jurassic Park even when the park was in shambles was great. Sam Neill and Laura Dern were apt choices to play the respectable paleontologists Drs. Grant and Sattler. Jeff Goldblum creates a memorable character in the eccentric Dr. Malcolm. I enjoyed seeing all of the characters in this film.Of course there are the film's famous dinosaurs, which are amazingly realistic. There is enough variation in the types of dinosaur encounters and the context in which they are encountered such that they don't become boring. The situations with the dinosaurs are created such that tension is created. ""Jurassic Park"" manages to rise far above being simply another monster movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

About the influence of  Dr. Grant in Jerassic Park on a little boy,"To the makers of Jurassic Park movies.My grandson started to watch Jurassic Park (all three of them) when he was three years old.

He scrapes them and discovers from what kind of dinosaur they are! of whom he knows all the names. I just wonder if Dr. Grant is aware of the tremendous influence he has on little children and how he is an example of bravery and encouragement and for applying knowledge on the history of the universe in little minds. Justin now has dozens of dinosaurs and takes them everywhere he goes. He is a very smart and beautiful looking little boy and I wish I could send Dr. Grant a photo of him.

It's then end of 2021 and this movie holds up.,"It's 2021 and it's the age of super hero movies with greatest visual spectacles and world's biggest blockbusters have released in last couple of years. I am here to tell you that this is one of those movies that stands tall as a thrilling entertainer and people are still holding this as benchmark for visual effects, sound design and production design. If you're reading this in 2031 chances are this film making is still being taught in film schools and people are still yearning for practical effects of this manner.This movie is childhood adventure, horror and fantasy of many like me who would pick this movie as one of the firsts to show to their grandkids.

Jurassic failure as Frankenstein ripoff and Harryhausen homage,"I suspect that the makers of Jurassic Park inserted a subliminal message into the film like ""YOU MUST LOVE THIS MOVIE."" or ""SHUT YOUR BRAIN OFF!"" or ""PLOT AND DIALOGUE DONT MATTER!"" since so many people seem to be under the illusion that this is a good movie--when it has some of the worst dialogue and annoying characters I have ever had to endure, and a non-existant story structure.Dinosaurs are cloned, but we get little sense of the moral issues surrounding this. We have no sympathy for the dinosaurs, nor do we have discernable villians to hate. Hammond is portrayed as a cruel industrialist one minute(when feeding the raptors), and a Daddy Warbucks the next(the hatching of the raptor). The scientists who did the sinful deeds are in the background, and we are left with a lawyer to hiss at! Some may say the Raptors are the villians, but this insults the Frankenstein mythos(since the raptors were created by humans). If there is any discernable moral to the story it is that Alan Grant goes from hating children to ""kinda liking"" them--which is amazing when considering the whiny brats he was stuck with.But I could forgive the moral nihlism of the story if it wasnt for the hackneyed action of the narrative. A few humans running around for two hours, whining and gushing at the big dinos does not for great entertainment make. It lacked the imagination of King Kong, or the spectacle of Harryhausen's Gwangi effects work.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bloody good film,"Considering this film is now 7 years old, it has aged incredibly well.  It still impresses youngsters and grannies alike, and more importantly, it still impresses me.  Disregarding the book (which seems to be the only book anyone has ever read), the plot about meddling with nature seems more relevant now than it ever did.  Admittedly, the film isn't very well paced, with whopping areas where the only object of fascination is Sam Neill's face, but the now-famous T-Rex chase and bit-with-raptors are both landmarks of cinema and a little bit pant soiling.

'Westworld' revisited,"Steven Spielberg's popular crowd-pleaser rode the crest of a passing dinosaur craze (a craze engineered, in part, to coincide with the film's release), but it also delivered enough genuine summer matinée fun to justify all the hoopla. There isn't anything particularly original about the film: the skimpy plot, following a group of reluctant tourists trapped on an island theme park with marauding dinosaur clones, is a state-of-the-art update of 'Westworld', also written by Michael Crichton; Sam Neill's paleontologist hero is a cardboard ringer for Indiana Jones (the role might have been written for Harrison Ford); and if the film is Spielberg's most effective thrill ride since 'Jaws' it's only because his dinosaurs are distant cousins to Bruce the Great White Shark.The script may be thin and the (human) characters unforgivably shallow, but none of that should worry viewers expecting to be scared half out of their seats. Spielberg's only aim - reinforced by an anticlimactic ending almost begging for a sequel - is to provide two hours of undiluted distraction, and (fortunately) the best moments lean more on expensive lab work than on decent writing or depth of character. For one tenth the budget (and one tenth the profits) Ray Harryhausen could have made essentially the same movie, but 'Jurassic Park' is a legitimate blockbuster, with one nagging reservation: after so much advance publicity, did the director really need to plug his own promotional merchandise in the film?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Definitive Evolutionary Thriller,"The father of the summer blockbuster tradition's third time around making the most commercially successful film ever is a real cinema signpost, presenting wonder- and terror-stimulating highlights, the more stunning of these concerning the ferocious, realistic dinosaurs that trail through the film with a still amazing simplicity. Just as intimidating, though, maybe more, are those features of Jurassic Park that determine it as the meteoric forerunner of a mint entertainment kingdom. Even while seizing the imagination of its enormous audience, this film sets the stage for the amusement park rides, sequels and souvenirs that assure the Jurassic Park event would continue for over a decade.The calculation of this cinematic marketing takeover didn't seem like it could be surpassed, because a whole age bracket had become infatuated with dinosaurs, turning the fossils of long ago into the monolithic props of the '90s. This at times almost unbearably intense thriller is still today a riveting, worthily scientific story of a classified theme park, branded for the age throughout which dinosaurs existed. Jurassic Park's centerpiece is actual sentient dinosaurs, which have been produced through the regeneration of dinosaur DNA taken from blood unearthed in prehistoric mosquitoes sealed in amber. The film describes this procedure by way of a ""Mr. D.N.A."" cartoon.Crichton, who adapted his source with David Koepp, relishes such particulars and illustrates his plot as a beguiling, fanatically comprehensive discourse on both the promise and harms of prevailing technology. The coolest character in Crichton's story, wry chaos theorist Ian Malcolm, is among various scientists taken to Jurassic Park to examine it before its opening. Faced with the seeming foolproof environment of this mechanized paradise, Malcolm is incredulous. He repeatedly refers to applied mathematics as a means of indicating that supposedly faultless representations have a way of toppling once they contend with the real world.Theoretically, this plot is custom-made for the talents of the man who could buy everyone on Hollywood's Power List, merging the alarm of Jaws with the state-of-the-art parable of E.T. and Close Encounters, and sure enough including the trial of constructing the dinosaurs themselves. In a few key scenes equaling the fright rate of Jaws, the difference is that this film's dinosaurs tread on its humans both literally and metaphorically, however persuasively sympathetic and amusingly distinctive the cast is. They show just for concise interludes, yet the they rule Jurassic Park in every sense. Remarkably fluid and realistic, they set an exorbitant benchmark for the still budding CGI. However, thinking about how those effects were pulled off aren't prone to arise while the film's in progress. The key to the dinosaurs of this undeniable pleasure is that they form a conquering fantasy. We believe we've hung around in a dinosaur-filled realm.That realm, on an island nearby Costa Rica, is the innovation of John Hammond, a tiresomely cheery gray eccentric who enlists Drs. Grant and Sattler as members of a party presumed to give Jurassic Park its stamp of support. But a quaint thing occurs en route to the Tyrannosaurus pen. Thanks to an business saboteur attempting to appropriate dinosaur embryos, power within this programmed theme park is deactivated. Enormous, unpleasant, ravenous creatures begin to roam free.Helming the dinosaurs' exploits is Spielberg's forte, and the professional dreamer's excitement is unmistakable. He has an immense party with every single roar and shudder indicating the advanceing threat, as when Malcolm notices a mud puddle tremble. He also hurdles to the test of composing inspired duels, as in a tremendous sequence where brutal velociraptors hunt Hammond's two grandchildren through the outsized kitchen of the visitor's center. Anybody can show a battle, but it takes Steven Spielberg to portray just how the pots and pans might go soaring at the thump of a velociraptor's tail, or how the children might mislead their cunning assailants. In considering such a scene, it also helps to behold the broader picture. Who but the most represented filmmaker on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies of All Time could persuade an audience that there are dinosaurs at large in a kitchen by any means? But the film's deserving centerpiece is the sequence where the Tyrannosaurus scrutinizes and masticates a Jeep containing desperately frozen-stiff characters is one of the most exhilarating scenes ever put on film. It's hopeless discerning the effects from the real, and it's equally as suspenseful when you're 22 as when you're 5.His fourteenth film keeps us nervous while leaving much of its actual brutality to the mind. When it's dinosaur dinner time, Spielberg sidesteps obvious gore, getting a superior quiver out of showing farm animals that are left near the famished creatures and swiftly vanish. To give the velociraptors a fitting initiation, he starts the film with a character whose upper body stays seen while the rest of him is being accosted off screen, a la Jaws. Such tense and gruesome strokes are joined with over-romantic ones and intermittent droll sight gags and observations. As an action adventure, as an auteurist visualization, as a blockbuster, as a humanist assertion, however capitalistically inclined, it's a tour de force.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Clever Girl,"There are a few truly awe-inspiring moments in movie history. One of the most memorable occurs when Dorothy steps out of her Black & White farm house and into the full color wonderland of Oz. Not far behind is our first glimpse of the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Director Steven Spielberg brilliantly focused on the stunned reactions of Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr. Ellie Attler (Laura Dern). We smiled because we knew their reactions mirrored ours! Now, twenty years later, the film has been re-released with a very effective 3D re-mastering.The movie has its place in Hollywood history for its revolutionary use of George Lucas' ILM CGI and the animatronics and visual effects under the supervision of Ray Winston. This was no ordinary science fiction special-effects movie. It was a very interesting, entertaining, thrilling story that brought to life the plastic dinosaur toys of kids and dinosaur dreams of curious adults. This was light years from the Ray Harryhausen stop-action dinosaurs we had seen before. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park had back-stories, childhoods, ferocious roars and a realistic look that tied right into our childhood fantasies.Never-before-seen special effects would be enough to set this one apart, but it's the story and characters that draw us in and elevate the movie to classic status. John Hammond is a very likable, little old rich man played by Sir Richard Attenborough. In fact, Attenborough is genuinely such a nice guy, he was cast as Kris Kringle in the 1994 re-make of Miracle on 34th Street. He is also an Oscar winning director for Gandhi (1982) and ironically beat out Spielberg (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial) that year. Attenborough also directed A Bridge Too Far (1973), A Chorus Line (1985) and Chaplin (1992); plus, one of my favorite hidden gems: Magic (1978). Unfortunately, Attenborough, now almost 90 years old, has recently been moved into hospice for health reasons.John Hammond and his team of scientists have taken ""dino DNA"" and brought life to dinosaurs, previously 65 million years extinct. Hammonds' instincts as a showman lead him to develop a kind of amusement park where people can come and see his dinosaur creations in a natural habitat. Facing a lawsuit  what could go wrong??  his investors bring in a team of specialists to inspect the park. Dr. Grant, Dr. Attler and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) take the tour with Hammond's grandchildren (Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards) and a bean counter played by Martin Ferrero. Of course, things go terribly wrong thanks to a sub-plot involving the park's computer guru played by Wayne Knight (Newman from ""Seinfeld""). Don't miss the photo of J Robert Oppenheimer (the atomic bomb creator) on Nedry's computer monitor. Samuel L Jackson has a classic line of dialogue, but also seems to be prepping for his role in Deep Blue Sea (1999). The other key player is the park's game warden played terrifically by the late Bob Peck  he mutters the ""clever girl"" line.Real life Paleontoligist Jack Horner worked as an adviser on the film and was the inspiration for the Dr. Grant character. It's also interesting to note that there was quite a bidding war for the rights  even before writer Michael Crichton had finished the manuscript. When Spielberg won the rights, he hired Crichton to write the screenplay, and David Koepp was brought in for the final version. Crichton is also known for Westworld (1973), Twister (1996) and The Andromeda Strain (1971). Mr. Koepp is known for his screenplays that include Mission Impossible (1996), Panic Room (2002) and Spider-Man (2002). And of course, the majestic score was composed by the great John Williams, a frequent Spielberg collaborator.Jurassic Park was nominated for and won three Oscars: Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. Many believe Jurassic Park should have nominated for the Best Picture, but I doubt Mr. Spielberg much cares. See, he released another movie that same year  Schindler's List did win the Best Picture Oscar. Many ask about the child actors from Jurassic Park. Tim was played by Joseph Mazzello, who was most recently seen in TV's ""Justified"", as the snake-charming traveling preacher. Mr. Mazzello has also appeared in The Social Network, and the mini-series ""The Pacific"". Lexi was played by Ariana Richards and she won the role based on her amazing ability to show and express fear  and her believability as a teenage hacker. Ms. Richards has focused more on her work as an artist, but does act periodically.Jurassic Park is definitely one to experience on the biggest screen possible with the clearest sound possible. This 3D re-mastering is worth the price of admission and I enjoyed seeing the look of awe in the eyes of a few youngsters in the theatre. No need to wait for Jurassic Park 4, which is scheduled for release in 2014  go experience the original in its full big screen glory!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
All time Great,"This movie was so great. It's one of my mom's favorite movies. Love the characters, Graphics, I love everything about 90s movies. Must watch before seeing the new ones. I watch this movies 3 or 4 times a year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My favorite movie of all time.,"Jurassic Park, directed by one of the greatest directors, Steven Spielberg. I watched this movie and I was hooked, I couldn't stop thinking about it. It has everything a movie is suppose to have, action, suspense, I guess you could say there is some comedy in the movie.But best of all, its graphics. The dinosaurs looked so real, and even though you know that they are fake(or are they)Steven kept you on the edge of your seat, especially in the kitchen scene with Tim and Lex Murphy.So basically if you haven't seen this Blockbuster yet, you better go see or otherwise you are missing out on a great movie expierience.(Note:This is an O-K family movie, just don't expect a pure family movie)If you have seen Jurassic Park, you should check out The Lost World, the sequel. Or you can check out some other great Spielberg films, Schindler's List, ET, and The Indiana Jones Story with Harrison Ford.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spielberg seems to have forgotten his own lessons from Jaws,"""Jurassic Park"" is a movie that is technically advanced (for its time) and smartly made. The animations of the Dino's are amazing. Moreover not only is the T-Rex very scary, the Vega-Dino's with their long necks are really majestic.An experienced director as Spielberg knows exactly how to manipulatie the emotions of the audience. The T-Rex just eats the right persons and the problem of the couple of whom the woman has a child wish and the man does not get along well with children is solved along the lines of a Disney family morality.So ""Jurassic park"" is in no sense a bad movie. However it could have been so much more than it actually is. I will give just a few examples.The discussion between scientists with various fields of intererst could have been more than the few generalities postulated by the mathematician specialised in chaos theory (Jeff Goldblum).The subplot about the corrupt computer criminal (Wayne Knight), the subplot which turned out to be the most predictive one, is very caricatural.The character of Dr Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is not profound enough. It could (and should) have been a new Dr Frankenstein, playing for God and paying a high price for his hybris.All in all it is strange that Steven Spielberg seems to have forgotten about his own lesson from ""Jaws"" (1975): ""Don't show the monster in the first hour of the movie"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

STILL THE SAME TERRIBLE MOVIE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN,"Today, I noticed that Jurassic Park was going to air on one of the cable channels. I figured that, since I haven't seen it in over a decade, it might be fun to watch....so I did. It didn't take long for the movie to remind me exactly why I hated it the first time I saw it!! The biggest problem is that it's a Spielberg product with his fingerprints all over it! In typical Spielberg fashion, many of the scenes don't make sense, are ambiguous or are totally illogical, as if he was making it up as he went along. Then, the movie tanked when Dern showed up in the very beginning. The whole movie would have been better without her attempts at acting. Another huge problem is that the only similarity to the book is that there are dinosaurs. The book was a thousand times better than what Spielberg turned out.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Jurassic Park is director Steven Spielberg at his best, but sadly, it doesn't come out as a polished picture","Before starting, let me ask you: doesn't a premise about a park attraction of genetically recreated dinosaurs on an island which is about to turn deadly sound exciting? For me it surely does and it should for you too. Now let's talk about my opinion on Jurassic Park. To start off with, I find Jurassic Park to be a hearty, thrilling (and compelling), thought-provocative and creative motion picture. Not only that, but I also find that Jurassic Park has a powerful attention for details because the way all the dinosaurs from the movie look, move, behave, react and sound is absolutely credible, life-like and realistic to how the dinosaurs might have been or probably were like in real life. There is no doubt about it. Furthermore, we are being happily given enough scenes featuring the fiercest dinosaurs ever to have ruled the earth: the smart Velociraptors and the mighty and powerful T- Rex. The leading characters from the movie deliver fine acting. The by- polar personalities of paleontologist Alan Grant and botanist Ellie Sattler are interesting, including those of the two kids characters. Moreover, Spielberg delivers an irresistible and strong sense of terror, beautifully sustained awe and a beautiful sense of grace. The movie did not entirely satisfy me however and I hate to say such a thing because of what Jurassic Park is specifically about and by whom it is specifically directed by (but of course I must be an honest critic). The movie's big problem is that it somewhat lacks a dramatic structure and deviates from what happens in the novel the movie is based on. What's more, the T-Rex-chasing-jeep scene had no visceral feel for me whatsoever. I have to say that I'm extremely disappointed about all of this. Now let's conclude my review. Mr. Spielberg, one word for you: thank you very much for the wonderful, if not entirely well handled, ride. My rating for Jurassic Park is 8.1/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best!,Jurassic Park is one those movies you can keep watching over and over again and never get sick of. The cgi holds up amazingly and it will give you a new interest in dinosaurs.

Best science fictional dinosaur movie ever!,"It is the best science fiction movies with dinosaurs I have ever seen.

There should be a real life Jurassic Park, So I would be really happy. It was also the best movie ever, Having advanced CGI, animatronics, etc. back then, There are sequels to this movie I thought were also great, even if the other fans didn't like it. The sound effects are really life like. The dinosaurs even had most of their behavior almost accurate. I love how the scientists are attempting to bring back dinosaurs in the franchise. Best movie series ever. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Simply stunning,"This film offers a stuning sequence of sheer thrills in the last thirty minutes, and its visual effects look utterly real, both for dinasours and the computer systems.

A tour in the park,"To me, Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all time, just one movie is enough to call him a master; Saving Private Ryan. Jurassic Park was a very big disappointment to me, because I had expected much more from Spielberg, instead, it was a solid and at times very slow paced and mediocre adventure film. The first half was like an interminable introduction, it was too slow paced, I expected some action or fun, had none of them. Then I ask, where is fun in the first half? I had expected a perfectly directed, also perfectly written action, suspense, suspense or a gribbing story, but it was uninteresting till the second half. The only successful thing in the movie is visual effects, as you know, it was a revolutionary experience in cinema in that year. I appreciate, but as an adventure or action, I think that the movie is just OK. In the second half, I had expected that there would be a battle between the family and the dinosaurs. A do-or-die fight, but couldn't find anything spectacular. JP is a movie which when you are shocked by electric wire, nothing happens, but your hair bristles! Jurassic Park is like a tour in the park rather than being trapped feeling. When the family arrives Jurassic Park, we see dazzling dinosaurs, CGI is flawless and the famous car scene takes place which was impressive, but no more than that.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Still holds up in 2013,"Jurassic Park is another movie I first saw in high school - my entire year went on an excursion to Underwater World and finished the day off with a trip to the cinema.

My friends and I sat in the very front row (which, you know, sucked, but it didn't make the movie suck) and I remember being so excited to see this groundbreaking new movie with its purported amazing special effects.Well, watching the movie today in 2013, it still looks incredibly good - better than a lot of CGI crap I've seen in recent years. And the story is still compelling and fascinating, but then I guess we have Michael Crichton to thank for that. Thanks, Michael, may you R.I.P.!As a tiny aside, back in the day I thought Ariana Richards was THE coolness.

Best thing to happen to cinema,"I was in my 5th grade when i saw this movie. The year was 1994. As far as I remember, this was 1 of the 1st Hollywood movie that turned out to be a blockbuster in India. Prior to JP, there were no Hindi dubbed movies. All you had Hollywood movies on VHS. Even movie theaters never dared to play an English movie, especially in smaller cities. JP was the 1st 1 that was watched by almost half of the Indian population. They had never seen such a thing. the cinematography, special effects, sound effects, etc. Last but not the least, no one had even seen a picture of how a dinosaur looks. People rushed in with there kids to see this movie. House full everywhere. Then there were the merchandise: t-shirts, stickers, water bottles, tiffin boxes, school bags etc. It was a phenomenon in India. Never ever saw such a thing again.

3D Blu-Review,"Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite films, it is a masterpiece and a landmark in film history. For anyone unfamiliar with the story, the Steven Spielberg adaptation of the Michael Crichton novel is about a rich entrepreneur named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) who has designed and built the world's first amusement park with live dinosaurs. Hammond needs specialists to sign off on the park before the insurance company will allow him to open for business so he enlists Dr. Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) to take the ride through Jurassic Park, along with us. Of course after the ride begins things start to go wrong, due to sabotage, and chaos ensues as the dinosaurs take over the park.The movie is a fast paced, suspenseful, and well done, in the tradition of ""Jaws"", not an exact reference of the source material but the version that was meant to be. The effects are still astounding and the movie still works 20 years later. The film's 20th anniversary 3-D convert is excellent. It has a lot of depth and the movie lends itself well to the added dimension. The movie was ""sweetened"" for the 3-D release, adding just some environmental elements for 3-D and the soundtrack was also tweaked to engulf the audience more.The only new extra is a short featurette on the conversion of the film, that is also in 3-D, nice touch. The original blu-ray from the box set and a DVD is also included in the 3-D combo-pack. The extras on the blu-ray are a very good combination of older extras and a new documentary, which has counter parts on the sequels in the box set (or separate releases that are now available).The only changes are environmental objects for stereo- viewing, and the soundtrack has also been enhanced to engulf the audience. No there has been no real ""changes"" made, so no need to get upset that it is really more than what it is, a 3-D version of the classic film.Well worth the upgrade, though I now have more copies of ""Jurassic Park"" than I can countyou want one???",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of my favorite movies of all time. Still great after all these years.,"What is it about Jurassic Park that makes me, and MANY others, love it? The special effects? The thrill? The fact that it's possible to watch this movie 800 times and it never gets old? I'd say all of the above, but also keep in mind: Humans NEVER saw dinosaurs, and along with fossils, this is about as close as we can get.This remains one of the most successful movies in WORLD-WIDE box office history, and it's not hard to see why. The acting is great, full of humor, the story is well-paced, and the Oscar-winning special effects and sound speak for themselves.1993 was clearly the year of Spielberg. He struck both box office and critical gold with Jurassic Park and Schindler's List. Both movies are amazing, and both won Oscars. However, the fact that only Schindler's List is on the IMDb top 250 boggles the mind. It deserves its spot on there, no doubt, but so does Jurassic Park.So this is, and will always be, on my top 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Amazing piece of art,"Jurassic Park starts off with a glimpse of the danger the dinosaur represents then introduces the characters and the park. The park is first showcased as potential visitors would discover it, they see the dinosaurs, then learn how they're made, before everything start to go awry.The film plays with our fears of the unseen because in a good portion of it we don't actually see the scary dinosaurs being scary. We hear them, we know they are lurking off camera but we don't actually see them. It's such a good build up that when we see ""the monsters"" it's scary. My heart was racing like the little child I was when I first saw it. The suspense is one of the things that get you, even more than the few jump scares the movie has.Watching Jurassic Park now made me realize how smart the plot is. lt plays on concerns people would have if this park was really about to open. Some characters only have dollar signs in their eyes and others see it as something incredible that can turn deadly, which it does but it doesn't take away from the fact that it could be wonderful.The special effects in this film look as good now as they were when the movie first came out. My guess is that they used a lot of practical effects, animatronics and great camera shots to make us believe that these dinosaurs are real. It thought me that even the most incredible things can be dangerous.Jurassic Park is such a good movie, it was for a long time the closest thing to an horror movie that I could watch. The film is great fun and very much enjoyable now. @wornoutspines",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic Park,*What I liked:* Very important in the advancement of CGI. World building is great and its a great concept for a film (book originally). Often entertaining with some good tense bits.*What I disliked:* No emotional reaction to this film whatsoever. One dimensional with no redeeming subtext. The most boring and unbelievable characters and mostly poor performances. Really predictable. Full of cheesy lines. Maybe I expected too much from a family blockbuster but I was a bit disappointed.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Gotta ask yourself the question ...where are you now?,"John Hammond is a PT Barnum style billionaire and as such wants to create the greatest show on Earth. Through the miracle of science and some preserved dinosaur DNA trapped in amber he recreates an entire range of dinosaur species. To check out his island he invites a number of scientists to endorse it for the brochure or something. Anyway after invoking Murphy's law (What can go wrong will go wrong) it all goes wrong and the Doctor's soon find themselves at the wrong end of the dinosaur experience.At the time this was the most successful film of all time. I never really saw why? There were lots of other films before (Jaws, Star Wars, Raiders) and since (Matrix, Inception, Transformers, even) that are all better paced, acted, written special effects-ed. The beginning sequence when a worker is eaten and they try to shock it looks, well, cheap to be honest. Due to them using multi-coloured lights in the container it looks like a disco. This opening thrilling bit didn't work me, and then the pace of the film slows down even more as we then get a huge preamble until anything exciting actually happens as plot plot plot plot plot is explained over and over and over again.Eventually we get to the good stuff and some actual dinosaur moments as the T-Rex finally appears, but then we get to the real killer, the thing that trashes the movie, the set piece with the car falling down the ravine that isn't there. We watch the dinosaurs walk out of a flat pen and then five minutes later that isn't a flat pen, but a massive drop ravine. It's just utter nonsense and from that point I had switched off as clearly the makers had so little regard for the viewer they thought that they could have anything happen and no-one will question it. This is no minor effect error or continuity blooper, it's an entire set piece that forgets where people have walked out of. For a movie this hyped it's just not good enough.At the time it was praised by critics as being one of the best films ever. While it's sad that it's still far higher than it should be (try watching it again, folks. It's slow as hell)nit's good to see that some element of sanity has returned to this films rating.That said it's a five alone for Bob Pecks thighs, they're stunning and they're not even an effect.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A classic everyone should see,This is the movie that became a milestone in terms of special effects. A real actors who are acting in the open field blend with animatronics and computer generated special effects in a way that it is really hard to see what is real and what is not. Every installment of the franchise goes deeper and deeper in making this difference even more impossible to see and this is one of the many aspects why it is so great. Add to this an interesting story with strongly carved characters with who you are attached to and you get a classic title which is enjoyable to watch even 30 years later.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Everything about this movie is incredible: John Wiliiam does not disappoint with another amazing score, the special effects have aged mostly remarkably well, the characters are all incredible and have defining personalities and traits. I especially love Alan Grant's character arc about growing to be a sort of father figure to Lexi and Tim. The dialogue as well feels so natural. It doesn't feel scripted, which is something you rarely see in movies and holy cow is the dinosaur action amazing. The lack of music really helps.

A Classic Amongst Classics,"Wow!  It doesn't matter how many times I watch ""Jurassic Park"" I always come away with the same expression...WOW!  This has got to be one of the BEST movies ever made.  Some may think it an exaggeration but I reckon that if you can watch a movie over and over again and still be glued to the screen as if it were the first time you'd ever watched it, then I say it's no exaggeration.  It is a classic amongst classics.This movie had something for everyone.  The dinosaurs of course were the real stars of the show and how could they not be?  They were so realistic, so scary and menacing...even the nice gentle ones were awesome!  They played their roles perfectly!There are so many things in this movie that I liked, too many to mention here but I have to say that one of my favorite sequences was  Tim and Lex being stuck in the kitchen with the Velaceraptors.  Talk about scary!  I don't know what I would've done!!  The chills, the intensity, the fear, those Raptor noises, those Raptor eyes...brrr...gives me chills just thinking about it.I have to say that the whole premise to Jurassic Park was brilliant.  A ""Dinosaur Disneyland"" for everyone.  Of course, I never got chased by a Raptor at Disneyland and hopefully they never introduce that attraction there either but the story itself was great.  It's a wonderful fantasy, the stuff scientists dream of.I loved Sam Neill from his role in ""Hunt For Red October"" and can't imagine anyone else playing Dr. Alan Grant.  Laura Dern was great as Ellie and how could you just not love Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm?  Bob Peck was very likeable as the Park's Warden and Wayne Knight as the very detestable Dennis.  The actors had great chemistry and stronger hearts to survive all those dino chases!All in all ""Jurassic Park"" ranks up there with such sci-fi's as ""Star Wars"" and ""Jaws""  Those are films that will last forever in the annals of film making.

Man becomes a bit too smart for its own good as a way is found to bring dinosaurs back to life by using DNA from fossilized insects.

What a waste of a good starting premise.,"I really wanted to like this. It took me nine years before I finally got around to seeing it, and, well, I should have made it 50 more years, give or take a couple decades.Look, I'm not necessarily categorically against movies that are mostly a special effects extravaganza, but this is too damn much. This movie had NO POINT whatsoever. I was lead to believe early on that there would be some sort of ""don't mess with Mother Nature"" moral to the story. Instead, things went to hell strictly because of human greed, rather than as a direct result of us playing God.Did it have redeeming qualities? Yes, barely. Jeff Goldblum's hilarious character, for one, and a couple of all too rare decent child actors. Normally I would include the ""general concept"" as a redeeming quality, because I've always been good at filling in the blanks of a bad plot with my imagination, but there is a limit. Sometimes, the plot is so bad that all I can think about is how bad the plot is.Ah, well. Will I go rent JP II and III? Yes. Why?

One of Those Moments,"There are a handful of movies that absolutely grab a person. The case I had on jury duty had been settled out of court and so I had an afternoon to see a movie. This is the one. I had anticipated it for so long and was ready for the disappointment that usually follows. It didn't happen. From the moment that Richard Attenborough says, ""Welcome to Jurassic Park,"" I was hooked. And when the Brachiosaurs come lumbering across the grassy park, I was stunned. I know that since that time, computer generated special effects have become regular fair, but this was amazing. The other part of it, however, is that this a masterful story with a great deal of complexity (chaos theory, etc.). The people are interesting; the villain foolish and in over his head. Then there is wonderful set up of a park that is foolproof, suddenly losing its security. I don't normally like child actors, but the two in this express the terror that they indeed should. Some films hammer one with so many images; this one still relies on the greatest method of scaring people. It's not what you see; it's what you don't see. It's what's lurking in the bushes. The other thing is that the characters are on the playing field of their adversaries. Kowledgeable as they are, they are not in their own world. Those veloceraptors are a nice touch. As I was growing up, enamored with dinosaurs like most kids, I had never even heard of these creatures. Granted some of the threat is orchestrated, the scene in the kitchen is as frightening as anything I've ever seen",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Welcome to Jurassic Park... Best... Line... Ever!,"Plot:Just a quick note, the book and film are almost nothing alike. But it doesn't matter! This movie is a masterpiece! Dinosaurs are brought back by using DNA found fossilized THAT is used to create Dinosaurs. Much like with the modern film Avatar, it's not so much about the plot, it's about the experience of being in this world.Characters:Jeff Goldblum is the star. He's the only one in the movie who has a brain or common sense. In fact, some, if not all, famous lines from this movie come from this character. Ian Malcom is a scientist (Rockstar according to John Hammond) and is the ONLY one who finds this whole phenomenon to be a mistake and a giant spit in the face of god and nature.Visuals:The dinosaurs and visuals are groundbreaking. It's the first time CGI was used extensively to create full objects that interact with the natural objects or characters. Animatronics are still used, courtesy of Stan Winston studios, and are incredi-amazing. Ah-Ah-Amazing...Sound:The musical score from John Williams steals the show. Even without seeing the visuals, just hearing the music sends me back to this world.Enjoyment:They really should remake Jurassic Park instead of making of fourth movie. Why make ANOTHER?!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"If you want dinosaurs, this is your film!","Well, yes, it is good. If you ignore the unbelievabilities, but then you should do that with all films! At least these dinosaurs are mildly realistic ('cos I know what they really looked like!), as opposed to dressing up lizards and super-imposing aging actors as explorers over the top. And don't forget Geoff Goldblum also did the fly!!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good movie!,"This was a really good movie! The story was great and so were the actors, like Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern, and the kids. The little boy was especially cute. The effects in this movie were awesome, and there was actual suspense, like with the water in the cup vibrating. And I LOVED the ending, with the raptors and the T-Rex roaring and that sign coming down that said ""When dinosaurs ruled the earth""! Definitely beats the ending of JP 3, although that movie was OK. Oh and going from the end to the beginning, I like that part in the beginning when the guy on the toilet gets eaten up! That was pretty funny! And everything in between is good too, so this is a movie definitely worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
GiddyUp!,"Well, I've never seen a movie like this before!  Monsters, or in this case Dinosaurs, are locked up in cages, they escape and go on a rampage.  No, we've never seen that before!That statement was a statement of sarcasm.  This kind of plot has been done so many times, I'm surprised lawsuits haven't been thrown out.  But even though we've seen this kind of plot before, 'Jurassic Park' is still at least half decent.  I saw it for the first time when I was 10.  And at that age, a movie like this will terrify a young child to the bones, and this one did just that.  The scene in the kitchen with the raptors was horribly tense.  I can't think of a time I've been more scared. But now that I'm older, and a little more mature, it's hard to find a movie that will scare me like that ever again.  And that's a little sad, because I like it when a movie scares me.  It shows that the people who made the movie did a good job.  But aside from the fact that I was scared, I also enjoyed it very much.  The dinosaurs looked real, some of the acting was pretty good, which in my opinion is important for any movie.In the end, this movie is one of my favourites.  And even though that kitchen scene doesn't scare me anymore, I will never forget how it scared me the first time.  However, if you want a movie that will create the same tension, only make it last longer, see 'Aliens'.  It will terrify you. Believe me.  But if you haven't seen 'Jurassic Park', I'd like to ask you where the hell you've been the last 6 years?",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Frightened After All These Years,"As an avid fan of horror, sci-fi, and action flicks, I had become pretty numb to the adrenaline effects typically brought on by such movie experiences.  By the early 1990's, I figured I had seen it all and may never be frightened by a movie ever again...until Jurassic Park!  As a mother of young children, the ""t-rex attacking Tim and Lex"" scene just about knocked me into the theater aisle!  I couldn't get enough of the adrenaline factor. I watched the movie in theaters every weekend in the summer of 1994 and waited in agony for its release on VHS.  Now I own it (as well as II and III) on DVD and watch it every six months or so.  The continued appeal comes from the performances of Sam Neill and Robert Peck, the special effects, and the primary moral of the story (don't mess with Mother Nature).",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is THE MOVIE!,"Jurassic Park is simply one of the greatest blockbusters ever made. The plot is simple, a group of experts and friends are invited to explore a theme park that has yet to open. The park is filled with living dinosaurs cloned from DNA. And quickly, the tour becomes a terrifying thrill-ride of survival. Of course, all of our humans are overshadowed by the real stars of the film, the dinosaurs. It's indeed rare that a movie comes along that is so special and has such a tremendous impact on the audiences, that when it happens, it's a reason for celebration, which is exactly what Steven Spielberg gave the world with ""Jurassic Park"". This is a movie everyone can enjoy, except for those who want to try and find something wrong on purpose. Jurassic Park is one of the best, if not the best, movies made about dinosaurs. The CGI effects have become common in about every movie, yet the creatures appear real.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, Kind of a Classic","This was a hot movie went it came out. Even the new ones are top notch in my opinion. This movie had it. The magical spark of movies. It makes you dream, yet keeps you in line. Spielberg at his best.The movie is about a park that opens with actual dinosaurs. Things go bad when the dinosaurs escape and start feeding. However, our leads make it to safety.It's good. I would watch it.7 stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not that believable but still thrilling,"I'm not sure If they did a great job making the central premise believable but ignoring that, the film does a great job showing the dangers people would be in if Dino's really did come back.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"An enjoyable watch with a partner, but otherwise average","Jurassic park is one of the most iconic films of the '90s, known for its groundbreaking special effects and thrilling dinosaur action. While it remains a fun watch, especially with a partner, it does have some limitations that may make it feel average for some viewers today. The story follows a group of scientists and visitors who find themselves trapped in a dinosaur theme park after the creatures escape containment, leading to plenty of suspense and action.The film's special effects were revolutionary at the time, and the dinosaurs still look impressive today. However, the plot can feel somewhat formulaic, and the characters are not as deeply developed as in some other action-adventure films. While there are moments of genuine tension and excitement, the film occasionally leans too heavily on spectacle over substance.Overall, jurassic park is still worth a watch, especially if you're in the mood for a fun, nostalgic movie night with a partner. It's an entertaining film, but perhaps not as compelling as it once was. I give it a 6/10 for its enjoyable action, impressive effects, and iconic status, even if it may feel a bit dated.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best Spielberg pictures ever,"Michael Chrichton's Jurassic Park is one of the most memorable pieces of action/fantasy ever made.  Stunning computer graphics (used for practically the first time) and great stuff make this a must see (and must saw).  Story revolves around the re-birth of dinosaurs and the'yre rampage in a research facility.  Sam Niel, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Sir Richard Attenburough star as the people ho go to the island (Jurassic Park) and see the wonder, and horror of Dr. Hammond's (Attenburough) new life.  Great effects, great score, and fantastic direction make this not only one of the best Spielberg films ever, but one of the best suspense films ever.  Great fun (but it might scare the kiddies).
