The Lost Boys & Girls...,"Beneath the surface, in the shadows, a dark sphere; two hostile factions, scythe and rip, and claw and shear; a battle born of ages, a perpetual war rages, without forgiveness, without compassion, just hate sincere.A warring vampire makes a link to treachery, this wolf assassin's stalked Lycans for centuries, hidden secrets are revealed, open wounds that never healed, genes are diced and spliced to halt adversaries.It's only downhill from now on, as the franchise ruptures, the bloods gone, not quite knowing when to stop, perpetually draining a good plot, leaving a husk, a shallow spectre of what was.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly good!  I'm impressed!,"As soon as I saw the preview to this film I wrote it off as a silly Matrix rip-off trying to attack a subject that is so tired (vampires/werewolves). I really never had any intention of seeing Underworld until my girlfriend, who saw it in theaters, repeatedly suggested I watch it.  After watching the DVD just now I must say that I enjoyed it a lot.  I was completely into the story, which is surprisingly rich and engaging.  One would have to be a bit na√Øve not to admit that Underworld does indeed borrow from a variety of action films, most notably The Matrix.  It should be obvious to any free-thinking person that none of the ideas present in Underworld are original, but what this film does well is take ideas that were established in the past and build on them more.  This is by no means a carbon copy of any of the films from which it borrows from.  Slow motion gun battles didn't originate with the Matrix films.  The most refreshing aspect of this movie is the story, which surprisingly has many layers and puts a totally fresh new spin on the vampire/werewolf stories.  This aspect, along with the excellent visual effects makes Underworld an enjoyable experience.  A sequel for this is inevitable, and I must say that I'm really looking forward to it.  Underworld was a very pleasant surprise.*** out of **** stars",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Still one of the best action horrors ever made!,"Wow, wow, wow! 'Underworld' is an action-packed, visually stunning spectacle!As mentioned in my 'Underworld: Rise of the Lycans' review, it is best to view 'Rise' first, and then 'Underworld' - although 'Underworld' was the first film in the series. It makes more sense, since you will now have a much better background on Lucian. Lucian is the leader of the werewolves, and the antagonist (he was the protagonist in 'Rise of the Lycans').Centuries after Lucian became the Werewolf (Lycan) leader, the feud between vampires and werewolves still rages on. Lucian is trying to join vampire and werewolf blood to create a super species, but he needs the blood of a human, Michael Corvino, who is the direct descendent of the vampire/werewolf ancestor.'Underworld' features excellent performances from a very good cast - especially Bill Nighy as Viktor, and Kate Beckinsale as Selene. The make-up and visual effects are fantastic. There's loads of action, and incredible chase sequences, with stunning photography. This truly is a perfectly polished production. There never really is a dull moment - considering the film runs 132 minutes (I watched the extended version).This is non-stop action and entertainment from beginning to end. There's also more than enough suspense and horror for the horror buffs. 'Underworld' is an incredible action horror like no other. And the ending leaves you hungry for more!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ignore...,"Everything you've heard from the critics, everything you know about vampires and werewolves, everything that is standard in most fantasy/action films. Then you'll enjoy this film. I, unlike a lot of fans, will not claim that this is a move masterpiece, I will not claim that this will change movie making history. I, however, will go against the critics and say that this is a good film. Not getting a chance to see this in the cinema, when it came out on video I rented it out immediately. Now, at first, I could see what the critics meant it wasn't how the trailers depicted it and the script and acting in places was a bit rusty. I put it back and gave no more thought to it. However I soon found myself thinking about the film and the bits I'd enjoyed. I soon realised that this was good because it wasn't conventional and I couldn't stop thinking about it. There had been so many plot twists, so much to take in that I knew I had to see it a second time. This time I bought it, on DVD, and I found myself watching it again and again. This film gives you wonderful villains and just when you start to hate them something nastier comes along or they give you a motive which makes you confused. In one film the world which you are presented with at the beginning, Lycans (Werewolves) vrs. Vampires, is thrown into doubt. There are no longer good and evil, it is no longer this side versus this side and our hero Selene is stuck in the middle. The thing is every villain in this film seems to be fully justifiable in their actions yet completely nasty. I was trying, after falling in love with this film, to work out where it went wrong. I realised there was too much. You are thrown into this world and you have to keep up, there is no chance to sit down and work things out. That comes after seeing the film, this world explains itself through the characters actions. It is as if this world is real and we are meant to know about it already. Their is a history, their is a false history, their are legendary characters and not all of it is gone into in particular detail. Pieces of the world's history are just thrown in by the characters, as they would be in real life, with no long detailed explanation. That mixed with the cliff hanger ending, the promise of more characters from the past. MEans that even if you weren't sure about this film, the sequel Underworld: Evolution looks like it will be amazing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Quit whining and enjoy yourselves.,"I knew I was in trouble when I saw the previews for this film, I loved them.I know I would love this film. I knew that I would take much flack for loving this film. I know that I would not care. I did, I did and I don't. People who complain about films like this should spend more time at the library and less time at the cinema, and even less time telling everyone else how smart they are and how silly films like this are beneath them. Cut it out. Film is an art form about light, the lack of light and the bending of light, I thought the light was marvelous. What do you want from a film about a war between vampires and werewolves?, I know what I wanted and this film delivered. It was stylish, amusing and well paced. This film was a testament to people who know priorities, no big money star vehicles, just fine actors, young and old, wonderfully silly duologue, played straight, appropriate screeching metal music and lots of shooting and many scenes of Kate Beckensale doing her thing, marvelous. I adore Ms. Beckansale and this film almost allowed me to forgive her for ""Brokedown Palace""....almost. I can't wait for the sequel, I will be there when it opens, to blazes with all the snobby nae-Sayers who are unable to appreciate the genius of lines like ""You are acting like a pack of rabid dogs"" delivered, straight faced, by the disgusted head of the Lycon community and for the Amazing Ms Beckansale who managed to be every bit as sexy as she was in ""Haunted"" without removing any of her clothing...any of it, a true movie star if there ever was one.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

New Blood For Vampire Legends,"""Underworld"" is no ordinary horror movie.  It tells the tale of a secret war between vampires and werewolves (or as they're called here, lycans).  Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene, a lethal assassin on the vampire side.  Scott Speedman plays Michael Corvin, a man who finds himself wrapped up in this brutal war.  This movie is rather well done, despite all the blood and graphic violence.  The look of the movie is dark, Gothic and brooding, which fits very well with the story.  The script is interesting, using science to bring the vampire and werewolf legends into the modern age (such as saying the lycans are allergic to silver).  The story of the bitter rivalry between to two mythic characters would make a fascinating prequel, and the sequel should follow ""Underworld"" with real impact as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The most stylish action-horror movie ever made,"I'm currently revisiting the Underworld series and have to state that the first movie has aged particuarly well. The stylish costumes still look incredibly sharp. The special effects don't look dated at all but rather have a timeless flow. The locations are perfect for an action movie with horror creatures. The lighting, sound and visual effects still offer a cinematic experience of the greatest kind. Even the nu metal soundtrack still blends in perfectly. This film represents the stylistics of its time while having achieved an outstanding legacy that has lead to the creation of four sequels so far.The story revolves around a human medical student named Michael who gets stalked, observed and attacked by a group of werewolves in a dark metro station. Vampire Selene intervenes and saves his life. She wonders why the werewolves have been following the young man while her immediate superior Kraven who fancies her is jealous of her sudden interest for a human being. Selene starts investigating on her own and saves Michael's life once more but he gets bitten by a werewolf. Despite the ongoing conflict between werewolves and vampires, Selene helps him once again as she is slowly falling in love with him. She soon discovers that Michael has a unique genetic strain that could allow him to become a vampire-werewolf hybrid. When Selene starts suspecting that Kraven is involved in a conspiracy with the pack of werewolves, she decides to awaken hibernating vampire elder Viktor who has always been a father figure for her as she seeks his advice. The growing conflicts quickly spiral out of control as Selene learns that nothing is as it appears to be.To keep it short, Underworld has stood the test of time and is one of the best action-horror movies ever made. Vampires and werewolves have never looked as stylish as in this franchise. The first entry oozes with atmosphere, convinces with a strong cast and features special effects that are still breathtaking nowadays. No matter if you are familiar with this franchise or haven't heard about it yet, now would be a good time to enjoy this timeless franchise that should immediately appeal both to fans of action and horror movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than people want to admit,"I can understand why some people were unwilling to give this movie a chance. I started out thinking, OK, so Anna Valerious from Van Helsing is now a female Blade! I was wrong! I also went in thinking it was going to be a push button movie with no real twists.Again I was wrong.I didn't really see the twist coming at the end (surprising, since I figured out who Kaiser Sosay was!) I liked this move for a lot of reasons. The darkness in the movie wasn't oppressive. The acting was good, and the story strong.I give it a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Blood, bullets & Beckinsale","This is another one of those types of films that should not be taken too seriously. If you watch the film from a critical standpoint then you will miss how enjoyable the film can be.Those who have no interest in vampires etc will not like this film but for those who do, this film is well worth watching. While the script may not be perfect, the actors manage to keep a straight face and are entertaining to watch.What many will like is the back story of Kate Beckinsale's character and the history between the vampires and the lycans. This may not add a lot of depth to the characters but it succeeds in progressing the story.Both Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy are great as the leaders of two opposing forces. The two steel the film whenever they are on screen.Since the film is about vampires vs lycans, you can expect a lot of bloody action. The actions scenes can be compared to The Matrix and Equilibrium but they are still fun to watch. Even though some scenes do look dated (the lycans often look like puppets at times) they are still enjoyable to watch.The sequel may have improved CGI effects but that is not enough for it to triumph over the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Waste of Time,"Selene(Kate Beckinsale) a vampire warrior and a death dealer, along with the rest of her kind, is in a war with the lycans and hunts them down and kills them. But things get complicated when a human(Scott Speedman) gets bitten by a lycan and Selene falls in love with him. Slowly she starts finding out about her past, how she became a vampire in the first place and why vampires and lycans hate each other. Now, this movie may sound and look good in the trailer but it definitely isn't. I like old-fashioned vampires, not vampires who wear leather pants, own guns and spend time on the internet. There was way to much action going on but not much of a story. This movie was very boring and too long and just a big waste of time. I would give Underworld 4/10, for some good scenes and because it could have been a better movie if it tried.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Features on the 2 Disc DVD Make It the Way to Go,"The ""Underworld"" sequel will soon be out so now is a good time to revisit the original. Personally I enjoyed this film more than any high budget ""mainstream movie"" I have seen in years years. But I can see many of the problems others have pointed out. Although the small action scenes work very well, the more elaborate scenes are disjointed, confused, and somewhat silly. If you compare the opening subway sequence to the train station sequence in ""The Untouchables"", you see an illustration of why less is better; and ""Underworld"" expends more ammo for less effect than anything this side of a ""Godzilla"" film.Along with too much aggressive confusion is the silliest head-splitting in cinema history. Similar to the way Tarentino dispatched Lucy Lie in ""Kill Bill Vol.1"" (i.e. a delay in the actual detachment-I don't know which film did it first but Tarentine did it way better), the effects editor overlooked the need to show a slice in the head before it topples off. Surely this was just simple incompetence and not deliberate, because there are ways to show this (i.e. a line) that would still make it a relatively shocking scene.The story itself breaks too many horror genre conventions and fails to generate much real suspense (although the climax is somewhat surprising). But ultimately these problems did not interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.This was because it is first and foremost a Kate Beckensale's vehicle, as emphasized by recent trailer for the sequel. It is likely that your feeling about the film will depend on your impression of Beckensale. She has never looked better and I'm just talking about her face which I could watch in closeup for two hours without the slightest complaint. She is increasingly an absolute ringer for a 1940-ish Loretta Young. An earlier comment noted that: ""This 30 year old has the figure and face of a magazine model, with the bored flat expression to match. Pour this tight little body into a rubber suit with especially reflective pants and you have something to anchor your movie"". All this is very true but add intelligence, subtlety and nuance not seen since Diana Rigg was playing Mrs. Peel. The film does not demonstrate her range (you have to watch ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" for the best evidence of that) but it is one of those rare cases where you can't imagine anyone but her in the role.The production design, lighting, and cinematography are all excellent and the DVD has some great features explaining these aspects of the production.The film has a nice consistent look that fits very well with the story. I don't understand the comments that are negative overall, or what films these people are unfavorably comparing it to, can't be the garbage films that have been coming to mainstream theaters over the past few years. Bottom line, if you like the genre, appreciate stylish production design, and think highly of Ms. Beckensale you should make it a point to see this movie.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Expect Nothing, get a little more","I enjoyed Underworld. I expected it to be absurd, awful, plot-less and pointless. While it is certainly not the most brilliant and original story, nor does it teem with insight about the human condition, its not awful, its plot heavy, and it really isn't pointless. It's just a tad absurd, though.This is the story of a human (Scott Speedman) entangled in a six hundred year old war between vampires and werewolves, and the vampire death dealer (Beckinsale) whose compassion for him permits her to seek the truth in ways that few of her species have before.The acting is of variable quality. Kate Beckinsale is wonderfully cute, and does a pretty fair job of acting when she's not doing a Keanu Reeves/Neo impression. Michael Sheen provides a great supporting performance. Shane Brolly isn't really up to the task, in my opinion.The script is good, although it's full of clich√©s. The editing and directing are both impeccable, and help to move everything along at an entertaining and brisk pace.This is a fun action-oriented film, with stylish darkness and enough originality to make it worth seeing. Mildly recommended for vampire and werewolf fans.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I'm ""Lycan"" the leather","I first saw Underworld upon it's release in 2003 and honestly upon my first viewing of the film I thought it was just another generic vampire/werewolf action movie. A few years later the sequel (Underworld Evolution) (2006) was released and again I didn't really enjoy it all that much. Over the years more sequels were made that I didn't even bother watching after the first two. Since it's been almost eighteen years since I first watched Underworld. I decided to give the movie a second chance and watch the extended special edition on Blu Ray.Underworld tells the story of a modern coven of Vampires who after over one thousand years of war with their arch enemies the Lycan (Werewolves). The Vampires have hunted the Lycan to the brink of extinction. A vampire named Selena (Kate Beckinsale) uncovers a secret nest of Lycans hiding in the sewer lead by a powerful Lycan named Lucian (Michael Sheen) who was thought to be long dead. Selena brings the news to the Vampire leader who doesn't believe her leading to Selena breaking the rules and going solo so she can uncover the truth behind how Lucian survived and how he plans to end the war between the Vampires and the Lycan.Underworld is filled great looking action scenes of Vampires and Werewolves fighting with fangs and claws. Instead of using old fashioned weapons like wooden stakes and silver daggers. The Vampires shoot the Lycans with siliver bullets from modern day weapons like handguns and machine guns. They also use bullets with liquid silver in them that slowly kill the Lycans by entering silver into their bloodstream. Aswell as transforming into their Werewolf form and using their claws and teeth to kill the Vampires. The Lycans also use modern day guns with Ultraviolet bullets that burn the Vampires from the inside.There's plenty of blood and gore throughout the movie including things like decapitations, severed limbs, Werewolves being blown up leaving chucks of meat and body parts everywhere aswell as Vampires and Werewolves biting each other and humans. The body transformation from the Lycans human form to their Werewolf form is done well with great looking special effects and CGI especially by 2003 CGI standards. The Lycans always look like they are in extreme pain when transforming which adds to the transformation making it look and feel more intense and frightening.Kate Beckinsale is dressed in leather in every scene of the movie even when there's no action going on and she's just using a computer. The same goes for practically every character in this movie they all wear leather or black shirts with leather pants. The only time a character is without leather is when they take their shirt off or transform into a Werewolf.I'm not sure if it's due to nostalgia or my taste in movies changing over the years but upon my second viewing of Underworld after almost eighteen years I actually really enjoyed the movie this time around. I grew up in the late 90s early 2000s when movie's like (Blade) (1998) and (The Matrix) (1999) were extremely popular. That particular era of movies can be defined by four simple words leather, guns, brooding, angst. Watching Underworld now in 2021 I realise just how much this movie is a product of it's time and really if it was released just a few years earlier in the year 2000 this movie would of been a lot more popular. Sadly by 2003 these kind of movies had started to become all to familiar with audiences including myself.I highly recommend watching Underworld especially if you have never seen it before. If you have seen it before and you didn't enjoy it the first time around I recommend giving it a second chance especially if you grew up in the early 2000s.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This was - and still is - quite an impressive take on vampires and werewolves...,"I remember back in 2003 when director Len Wiseman unleashed ""Underworld"" upon the cinema, I was in awe. The movie was such an amazing action movie that put two of the most iconic horror creatures in battle against one another; that being vampires and werewolves (called Lycans in this movie franchise).The storyline, as written by Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman and Danny McBride, was and still is quite enjoyable. It is a well-written script that immediately immerses the audience into the depths of the night where vampires and werewolves struggle against one another, each race with their own agenda.""Underworld"" also has a pretty interesting character gallery, and that goes for both sides of the struggle - vampires and werewolves. So there is definitely something for everyone in the audience here, whether you root for the vampires or the werewolves.And to bring the characters to life on the screen, ""Underworld"" had a pretty good cast ensemble, which includes the talents of Kate Beckinsale, Michael Sheen, Scott Speedman, Shane Brolly and none other than Bill Nighy. So you are in for quite a treat when you sit down to watch ""Underworld"".This is an action movie with a lot of fast-paced and impressive action sequences. Not only are the action sequences nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, nay, they are also visually impressive to look at, given the cinematography. The action is definitely eye-candy and it helps bring the movie to life on the screen in a very enjoyable manner.If ""Underworld"" somehow have managed to elude your viewing pleasure, then you most certainly should sit down to watch director Len Wiseman's 2003 movie, should you find yourself presented with the opportunity to do so. This is a movie that packs a lot of punch and has a lot of contents to it, so it can be watched again and again.My rating of ""Underworld"" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I especially liked the acting of Bill Nighy as the vampire lord Viktor, and Micheal Sheen as the werewolf leader Lucian. I think that the plot is quite strong, and it does not ruin the vampire or werewolf legend. What i didn't like as much was the werewolf costumes. I didn't find the convincing.

The music is also a very good fit.Yes there are a certain amount of fairly cheesy elements to this.

An underrated title,"I'd heard so many negative reviews about this movie but I actually saw it in theaters with a friend. This was the first Kate Beckinsale film I actually liked. She made a good vampire she-warrior. It's no longer good versus evil but a story of survival. Who are the true villains? Vampires or werewolves? Or is there something darker at work? There's a lot going on and I found myself wondering who was who and what was going on throughout the film. It went pretty quickly. But in the end, it was a satisfying story that ended with an opening for a sequel. I remember coming out of the theater and hearing two people, a man and a woman, talking about it. They were both older than me, and the man apparently enjoyed it, but the woman said it was stupid. Or something like that. But as for me, it wasn't the worst film I had seen. It's no Oscar contender either but most movies aren't Oscar worthy. I mean, who really needs the Oscars? It's just a clique. Anyway, back to the movie. I was entertained and I especially liked how the makeup was done on the characters. Really creepy but cool. If you want action and vampires and werewolves, try this.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Lots of depth in the idea, skimmed over by people in tight leather shooting lots of bullets","I avoided this movie for a long time because of bad press and reviews I had read in IMDb. However this is, THAT, type of movie. You know, werewolves, vampires, guns, lots of leather (why don't armies issue all their troops with tight fighting leather outfits, as they are sooooo practical for fighting in), lots of black and CGI.Vampires fight and kill werewolves, the question is why. Set in Eastern Europe such a plot has a range of intelligent options that could be explored, but a ignored and simplified (and explained repeatedly so Americans can follow the plot).I loved the action, and yes the CGI is not that great, but this is not a big budget movie. The plot idea has depth, even if the story skims over it. There is enough plot material for an entire series, unfortunately it is crammed into one movie.Bad guys and good guys are ambiguous in so many ways. At the end of the day, this little, effects driven movie that follows on from Blade and The Matrix is an interesting story for lovers of THAT type of movie.Others may not get into it so much, but we can wait for the sequel and the prequel to see if they have the courage to delve into the true depths of this story.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cool Sexy Cool,"There has been a war between the Vampires and Lycan even six centuries after the supposed death of the Lycan leader Lucian (Michael Sheen). Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is one of the great Death Dealer or ones who hunt down the Lycans. The Lycans are supposed to be close to extinction. However Selene battles the Lycans to a possible underground pack with more advanced weaponry. She becomes interested in human Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who seems to hold the key to the war and a mystery that is centuries old.There are really only two elements to this movie. It's the cool looking all-encompassing action, and Kate Beckinsale in her leather outfit. The story isn't very deep. It goes right into a war. There isn't much setup. Not much is really needed. Then there is the super sexy Kate. She looks cool in her action mode. She is without a doubt the movie's best asset.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Can't wait for the sequel!,"I have just watched Underworld for the second time, and I was gratified to discover that it was every bit as good as I remembered - if not more so. No two ways about it; this is one terrific movie.The action scenes and some of the special effects could be better, but the movie has utterly superb style, mood, plot and acting! The story itself is probably the best vampire-slash-werewolf story I've encountered (though admittedly I don't know many, as I'm not really a horror fan), and the ending is just fabulous.I also just love the thing about the chief vampires sleeping for predetermined periods of time, and are then revived - this is incredibly cool.And the whole thing is borne aloft by the great skill of the British lead actors - particularly hard-hitting cutie Kate Beckinsale, wild-eyed Michael Sheen and that late bloomer of a genuine acting icon, Bill Nighy, who gives an unflinching performance.It won't be long now till Underworld: Evolution comes out - and I'm just thrilled at the prospect of seeing more of this stylish world! If they can fulfill my expectations of the sequel, I will be making an upward correction of my rating of this movie from 8 to 9, because then we'll have a larger universe which makes sense in a larger context.

"Underdeveloped, but not bad","As I left the theater, I overheard bad comments coming from behind me- ""I couldn't get into that story"" ""Man, this movie kinda sucked"" ""I don't know what that was all about"" It's true that the same flock of people that came in expecting ""Blade"" like flick, or perhaps ""The Matrix"" of vampires and werewolves, would probably be disappointed. The movie doesn't stay on one concept, it's lower budget (23 million) gives it less CGI and smaller, reused locations, and the touted romance between main characters Michael (Scott Speedman, kinda boring) and Selene (played well by Kate Beckinsale) never really has time to develop. But if you take a closer look at the story, you'll find some interesting aspects.Vampires and werewolves have fought for many centuries, with the vamps having the upper hand. They live in large mansions above ground, while the werewolves live in underground sewer-like conditions. The war between them is about to become worse, and in the thick of it is Selene who suspects a conspiracy, one that may eventually lead to an attack by the werewolves. Lucian (Michael Sheen), is the leader of the werewolves. His rage is one that will lead to secrets that unfold later in the movie. As they hunt down a human who carries what is needed to create super 'werevamps', Selene has to deal with the clan at home. No one seems to believe her that something very nasty is about to happen. Which is too bad, since, in this movie, everyone here seems to go with their gut feelings and fantastic insights on what other people are thinking and doing.Acting wise, everything is as expected, but Shane Brolly, who plays Kraven, the leader of the vampires, does a rather poor job. He did not convince me, as an actor, that he was a leader, and when he gets upset, he looks like a little kid who had his blood candy stolen. Kate Beckinsale and Michael Sheen are quite good, however.Action sequences were a bit mixed. There was hi-tech gun play, and there was plenty of it, but the actual confrontation sequences left a lot to be desired. Usually what you saw when it came to the hand-to-hand shots were closeups of the werewolves teeth... cut to the next smoke filled fight scene, wash, rinse, repeat.Rules of how vampires get killed were changed a bit. In here, they can die rather easily in comparison to other vamp movies like this one. But water doesn't hurt them, that's for sure, since half the movie is drenched in rain. Perhaps to balance the werewolves weaknesses? Roleplaying games, books and movies have gone through various different ways of rules that can be applied to how vamps and wolves function, so this is a moot point.SFX department- with Editor Martin Hunter and several dozen visual effects techs didn't do a bad job. With hardly any CGI in site they manage to do a bang up job with the werewolves' changes. The locations where the movie was shot, Prague and Budapest, give the movie a very authentic feel.Overall, the movie had more potential then what you see, perhaps a little more on the romance side? Better characters? But hey, I still liked it.Just don't expect oscar winning performances, mind-blowing CGI sfx, or originality. Just sit back and enjoy the film for what it is.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I wish I could Lycan this to a good film,"Amidst a generations old war between vampires and were-wolfs, Selene (Kate Bekensale, ""Haunted"", ""Uncovered""), a sexy vamp, finds herself inexplicably romantically drawn to lycanthrope, Michael, whom she saves despite facing the ire of her own kind, and whom might just have the key to finally eat this decades long feud.An exercise in style over substance, this overly long, overtly (almost to the point of clownishly) melodramatic piece of fantasy action assembly-line product looks good but all is for naught as it lacks any kind of heart (or indeed brain). I truly tried to watch this flick with an open mind and choose to give it the benefit of the doubt. My friend loves this franchise, alas I had to come to the uncomforting conclusion that his taste in films is quite suspect to say the least.My Grade: D+",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Underworld is a great movie with phenomenal casting,"Underworld is a great movie with phenomenal casting. The actors did a great job of portraying the characters without that ""empty"" feeling you sometimes get when bad actors are cast in supernatural roles. The characters are rich and integrated into the story without a feeling of overcrowding. Unlike most vampire films which I feel loses that ""gothic"" feel, Underworld brings it all to the table to keep you on the edge of your seat. I loved the way vampires and werewolves were explained, which I felt was an original take, which I felt translated to film in an excellent way. The characters didn't have an ""all of the sudden"" hatred, the reason between any angst is explained and very logical. A great movie from start to finish, I cannot wait to see what else comes from this franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excess bullets=Cool!!,"Why is it that most action movies these days have to have a scene in which thousands upon thousands of bullets are flying all over the place, and yet maybe one person actually gets shot? I guess action films are trying to get a high rating for ""coolness"". In the opening scene of Underworld, we are treated to a shootout between the Lycans (Werewolves) and the Vampires who are at war with one another. This shootout takes place in a subway station, with many, many helpless humans around. And guess what? Only one human actually gets shot. The other 100 or so people actually dodge or dive out of the way. And it ain't like the Lycans or Vampires are using six shooters either. These are full-auto guns, and as a result a gazillion bullets fly. Now, the shootout does look good, but the logic with it is just heinous. But then again, this is an action movie, so we should just enjoy shootout. But, I actually thought to myself, ""Hey! No wonder one side can't get rid of the other. They can't shoot a damn gun!"". But, and I have to state this so here is a MINOR SPOILER ALERT......when Selene (Kate Beckinsale), who is a Deathdealer for the Vampires tracks down a Lycan in the sewer shortly after the subway shootout, she nails the guy with three or four shots. In the Subway, she couldn't hit a damn thing (except for the walls and columns). I just had to point that out.In any case, aside from Underworld being a bit illogical at times, this is actually a good film from an entertainment point of view. Beckinsale does a good job playing her role. I was concerned that she couldn't pull it off, but trust me. She is Selene, and she looks good at being a bad-ass. Scott Speedman is......well........I just don't know what to think of him. I see a lot of potential in him, and he does a good job playing Michael. Michael Sheen as Lucian is great. I wish he would have had more screen time, but at least we get to know why Lucian hates the Vampires.Shane Brolly? He is the guy playing Kraven, who is the worst character in this film simply because I am convinced that Shane Brolly is one of the most horrible actors I have ever seen. I mean, Jean-Claude Van Damme could teach this guy a thing or two about acting. Brolly looks so much like Trent Reznor (of Nine Inch Nails) that I thought he was gonna break down and start singing ""Closer"" at any moment. I realize a film like Underworld won't give you Oscar type performances, but this guy should never have been given the part of Kraven. Hell. Trent Reznor could have done a better job.Overall, Underworld is good for what it is. It entertained me, and has me looking forward to the sequel. It has its' holes and can also leave you confused at some points in the film, but the story does fill the holes (or it tries to). Get past the subway shootout and you should enjoy the rest of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Trouble suspending disbelief,"I love vampire movies and unfortunately for this flaw I will always rate said genre higher than Mr. Joe Public would care to.  In the case of this particular movie I found that I couldn't accept the ineptness of the immortals.  The werewolves at least had the cool ability to change shape, but the vampires seemed almost helpless, almost lethargic at times.  They seemed to level the playing field not with mystic power but with fully automatic weapons. Mayhap that was intentional, to show that the two species were almost identical.I don't want to spoil the movie so I'll tread a delicate line when I say this:  the fight scene at the end was terrible...I would have greatly sacrificed the well light chamber for a dimly lit, blurry, high speed scene, more reminiscent of John Woo.That said, Kate B. does a good job of delivering her lines and even though you can't see her very well, looks stunning in that matrix style pleather jumpsuit.  The overall plot is some what predictable, but at least not worn out.As I said, I love vampire movies and I rated this 7.  If you like the genre, and can get over some of the more deeply fouled 'immortal' considerations then you'll like this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Solid Gothic action flick about vampires n werewolves.,"I saw this first in a theatre in 2003. Revisited it recently on a DVD. Seen all its sequels in theatre. The plot - Kate Beckinsale is a vampire looking incredibly hot in ridiculously tight leather matrix style clothes whose job it is to eliminate the werewolves as part of the centuries old war between the two species. Her acting is good too. Things change when Beckinsale tries to protect a human, Speedman who is targetted by the werewolves for some reasons. The movie has a distinctively Gothic look, with great attention given to the backdrop. Every inch of the cinematography is polished. The architecture and costumes are true fashion statements. This world is so dense with aggressiveness it is almost surreal. Borrowing from The Matrix and Blade, the director Len Wiseman made Underworld more of a goth action flick n less of a vampire/werewolf. Nonetheless pretty enjoyable action flick. Was happy that none of those hand held shaky cam stuff was added.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good movie,Underworld was the best of the seires. It was stylish. It held a simple storyline and the acting was good. For that matter this one had the better actor lineup.

"Interesting racial undertones evoking the Civil War era, some good special effects, and some OK fight sequences make ""Underworld"" a decent Friday night matinee...","It was only a matter of time before a film like this was made. Unfortunately, the end result isn't quite as amazing as everyone had hoped it would be.Nevertheless, if you like werewolves and vampires, then ""Underworld"" will probably wet your teeth. For the most part, I found the film an enjoyable enough experience to recommend--although there are some scenes that seem to slow the film down and add nothing to the story. I was also disappointed in the way that the film pays more attention on keeping its vampires and werewolves in human form, talking for the duration of the film, rarely fighting and evolving into beasts of the night. As Homer Simpson once said, ""Less yakkin'; more zappin'!""""Underworld"" is about a vampire named Selene (Kate Beckinsale) who lives in a scary mansion in Europe with dozens of other gothic beasts like herself. They're so busy fighting werewolves, it made me wonder where they all get their stylish leather attire--it's like a ""Grease"" reunion or something.Selene is a ""hunter""--she seeks out werewolves and slaughters them, and this happens in the opening sequence which is pretty ""Matrix""-esque. The vampires fight them with silver bullets, and the werewolves fight vampires with big teeth. Not much of a challenge for the vampires, eh? You'd be surprised. With the help of CGI, Selene has trouble fighting the animals. (They are apparently pretty strong, and apparently a big rip-off of the creatures from ""An American Werewolf in Europe"" and ""Paris."")Werewolves, we learn, used to be slaves to the vampire species, before Lucius--the head of the werewolves--fell in love with the vampire ""lord's"" daughter. The latter was killed, and the former escaped, only to form a pack of followers that would battle with vampires over the ages.Now Lucius has targeted a young doctor who has the capability of forming a hybrid between vampires and werewolves. I didn't understand everything regarding how, exactly, this is possible, since I think the explanation is purposefully quick and slurred so that audiences can't stop to evaluate any implausabilities.Selene falls in love with the man and tries to stop Viktor, the lord of the vampires, from killing him. He tells her that the doctor is an abomination--that vampires and werewolves cannot be mixed together. She doesn't believe him.The film is basically politically-correct. Werewolves used to be slaves, freed themselves, and were still faced with racism until a lone vampire decided that the two species could unite. Doesn't that sound a bit like truth? Regardless of any implied backdrops, the film will probably satisfy any action fan who is looking for some neat battle sequences and cool special effects.My only problem with the film is probably the fact that the vampires and werewolves never really evolve into vampires or werewolves. We do see some large dogs occasionally, but for the most part it's just people with glowing eyes battling big muscular people who sometimes rip off their clothes and turn into big hairy beasts.But the film is an enjoyable Friday night matineee; a good movie if you're in the mood for something light and enjoyable. It rips of ""The Matrix"" a bit with its style, but what gothic action film hasn't since 1999? Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous here, and worth the price of admission alone. The film isn't too original, and it's not nearly as great as it could have been (chances are ruined here), but it works as a dumb, fun movie.3/5 stars.John Ulmer",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Original Vampire & Werewolf film,"I loved Underworld. But I love most decent Vampire or Werewolf films, so that's a bit biased, eh? Basing the two species on a genetic, scientific idea makes them work exceedingly well, and removes all those problems that mysticism brings to a film, like reflections or holy items. This Vamp-Werewolf model make explanations easy, rather than requiring long prologues or in-depth discussions. The whole 'virus' idea is logical, and easy to follow. It's slick, modern, fast-paced action combined with classic, Gothic Vampire & Werewolf ideas, like the Vamp's high-tech weapons being kept in a massive, stately manor. I'm a real fan of the whole colour scheme, with few colours used in any one shot, and blues used for almost everything, keeping it looking cool, and sleek. I am also a Kate Beckinsale fan, and I love Action films that don't use women like an extra person to shout 'watch out!' or hit someone over the head. K.Beckinsale's character is great for this, it's someone who could easily be a guy. (Although, I'm thinking the outfit'd need a bit of enlarging if it were)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I have been mugged at the movies!,"I am stunned and horrified to read the comments on this movie.I can scarcely find words to describe how badly this movie stinks. I can only assume that many of the US reviewers were fooled by a bunch of English accents and dreary shots of a dismal Eastern-European city into thinking that this was somehow a classy piece of work.Beckinsale was a leather clad plank - I felt no sympathy or empathy for her character simply because her character did not exist - she was just speaking a few words.In fact this applies to damn near everyone else in this mess. There were virtually no character building moments at all - we just have no idea who these 2-dimensional S&M fetish-freaks are at all.There is no plot to speak of - all we need to know is laid out wholesale in the opening monotone monologue. If the director had not been so keen to slap his now-fiancee up on screen at every opportunity, he might have realised that there was a story to tell - that of the unwitting human caught in the middle of events he doesn't understand. Had we seen the story through his eyes we would have been shocked at the initial battle and surprised as the extent of the 'underworld' is revealed to us. Quite simply the director is telling the wrong story.Instead the movie treats the audience like bunch of slack-jawed morons and spoon feeds us the whole story up front just so we don't have to worry our pretty little heads with such nasty complicated stuff as plot.Okay. I love vampire movies. All of them Nosferatu, right through to Blade, and I'm pretty sure that in all of these pretty much the whole point is that vampires are like, *evil* and, you know, *drink blood*.Wearing a bit of leather bondage tat and moping around a big old house at night does not make you a vampire. Where was the blood-sucking? We barely even saw a set of fangs - these were simply the most boring vampires I've ever seen.The werewolves were a bit better, but the CGI was very poor and the man-to-sort of mutant pig-gorilla thing transformation is totally eclipsed by twenty year old classics like American Werewolf and The Howling.The less said about the noise which passes for a soundtrack the better. In fact I've said too much already. So I'll stop.I hated this film so much I can't even be bothered to rant about it any more.Go see this film if you want leave feeling like someone hit you over the head and stole your money - or just find a dark street and wait to be mugged for a similar, but possibly more entertaining experience.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Vampires: evil or just really constipated?,"Pros: - Pretty decent cinematography; there are a few key shots that make this movie almost worth seeing - Excellent makeup jobs; the director for this movie was all about staying away from CG as much as possible, so some very stunning makeup jobs were done- most impressive of all was Viktor's during his regeneration - I really liked the costume design for the vampires- very cool - The story was interestingCons: - Number one: 90% of the actors in this movie were god awful; Shane Brolly was the worst- in every scene he look horribly constipated; I guess a diet of blood isn't really high in fiber but that's not an excuse for having a butt-ugly grimace in every single scene; just about everyone in this movie over acted their part; Kate Beckinsale and Michael Sheen are the only 2 that I feel were decent in this movie - The werewolfs looked stupid; if you are going to move away from CG, let's make some costumes that have more than just facial movements; every werewolf walked as if it were wearing a girdle under its fur; oh, and the whole running on the wall thing doesn't work in a world where there is gravity- I guess everyone is also part spiderOverall: As I said before, there are a few key shots in this movie that are excellent.

Good Mix of Story and Action,"Just watched Underworld: Blood Wars in the theater and it made me want to review the 14 year run of Underworlds that began in 2003 (wow that seems so long ago). So, I forked over some money to Amazon to watch the first Underworld. It's amazing how much I'd forgotten. I think I watched mindlessly the first time because I missed so much of the story line.This was the genesis hence it requires a certain level of adoration. I think the sequels are actually better (which is a rarity for franchises) but this movie started it all. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) simply wants to be a warrior--""death dealer""--for her species against the Lycans. It's this dedication that led her to unveil a lot more than she'd bargained for.The movie is high powered, fast-moving, and dark. Sure, Vampires are allergic to sunlight but that doesn't mean that the sun never rises! The entire movie takes place at night to the degree you'd think it was one long continuous night. Even with that the lighting is good enough to distinguish what's going on and there is no strain on the eyes.Underworld was an excellent mix of good story with action. It was a lot more to it than I remembered and I'm glad I watched it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Underworld Franchise (2003-2016),"Still a better love story than Twilight :DSet (predominantly) in the present day, this fantasy franchise tells us of a centuries-old war between vampires and werewolves. We follow the story from the perspective of Selene (Kate Beckinsale), one of the greatest vampire warriors, who leads the werewolf hunt. When she meets Michael (Scott Speedman), a man who is persecuted by werewolves for a mysterious reason, her life and worldviews change drastically. This saga has quite a well-crafted story and characterization, though as the franchise goes on, the quality of the story declines to eventually turn into a shallow action. The acting, the camera, the directing, the effects, the music ... it's all pretty well done, but nothing spectacular.Underworld (2003)The first film introduces us to the dark world of vampires and werewolves, which secretly coexists with ours. While vampires are a well-organized society with a powerful army, werewolves are a wild unleashed horde that is gradually exterminated by vampires. And then emerges a leader capable of uniting werewolves, as well as a man capable of uniting the features of both races in one hybrid being. A good thriller with a story that will intrigue you, and with just the right amount of romance and well-directed action.7/10Underworld: Evolution (2006)""Evolution"" continues directly to the first movie and now Selene and Michael are trying to break into the history and secrets of both races, in a desperate attempt to bring the centuries-old war to an end. A worthy sequel in the same manner and quality as the first film.7/10Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009)""Rise of the Lycans"" is an ""origins story"" and takes us into the Middle Ages. Vampires were aristocracy, and werewolves were their slaves, until the young werewolf Lucian rose into a leader who led his race in the struggle for liberation, thus beginning a centuries-old war between the two races. The franchise still holds a level.7/10Underworld: Awakening (2012)Humans discover the existence of vampires and werewolves and decide to exterminate them. Michael and Selene are hit while fighting humans and she wakes up twelve years later, not knowing what happened to Michael. She now has a twelve-year-old daughter, the first natural-born hybrid, who she must protect from Lycans that want to take advantage of her in their fight for dominance.The fourth film is slightly weaker than its predecessors. The action continues in the same manner, but the story is underdeveloped. I was under the impression that I was watching a long movie trailer, not the movie itself. But basically, I liked it.6,5/10Underworld: Blood Wars (2016)The latest installment in the ""Underworld"" franchise is by far the worst, but not redundant. ""Blood Wars"" rounds off this saga, but it does a rather lousy job, and the movie is reduced to eighty minutes of shallow action and two-dimensional characters that are there just to keep the story from staying unfinished. I don't want to recommend it, but again, you have to see it if you wish to know how the story ends.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Not bad, not great either","UNDERWORLD is a hybrid horror movie, a cross-pollination of genres containing elements of action, fantasy drama, and good-old-fashioned chills and thrills. It tells the tale of a war amongst the supernatural underbelly of a city, in which a clan of Vampires is pitted against that of the Werewolves in a savage guerilla war sparked by an archaic feud between the two races. While this rather interesting concept sets the stage for what looked like a decent horror film, the ungainly, confused script, overdone visual effects and a few rather grating performances let the entire movie down into the depths of mediocrity.The basic thematic premise of the film - that is, that the viewer must ultimately choose which side, the Vampires or the Lycans, is in the right- is very interesting, but unfortunately, the poorly-planned and unbalanced plot doesn't give us much room to manoeuvre. For starters, the central character, Selene (an aesthetically appealing but often emotionless Kate Beckinsale), is a Vampire; as a result, we are given a fairly one-sided view of the action for at least the first half of the film. The plot would have been much more balanced if the key protagonist had therefore been Michael Corvin, Scott Speedman's character, a human with the potential to resolve the conflict. Through his perspective, this film would have unfolded much more coherently - however, with Selene dominating the film, the result is that the Vampires have much more screen time.Then again, this may not matter, for another flaw in the plot is that, in the end, we aren't given any scope for a moral choice between the two sides - and one is much more appealing than the other anyway. The Lycans are excellently presented, well-acted, and the scariest and most interesting characters in the film;while they don't exactly turn out to be in the right, so to speak, they come off with the moral high ground. The Vampires, on the other hand, are mostly boring and poorly acted, too similar to ordinary humans to be remotely frightening or interesting,and come through as a bunch of hedonistic toffs in Matrix-style leather; furthermore, their leader, Viktor (played by Bill Nighy) turns out to be a fascist old viper who instigated the war between the races in the first place. As for the war itself, while the action scenes are well-planned and blisteringly kinetic(particularly the fight in the subway), it simply doesn't try hard enough to frighten you. It may say ""Horror"" on the video case, but don't expect nightmares from UNDERWORLD.Presenting this interesting but half-baked plot is a mostly skillful cast, who have been held back, if at all, by their overdone and unconvincing dialogue. Only Michael Sheen and Scott Speedman shine, putting on masterful and appropriately Gothic performances, and respectively providing some of the rare, genuinely frightening moments in the film. Bill Nighy is too brilliant an actor to ever come off badly, but he doesn't seem to be exerting much effort in this characterisation; Shane Brolly is stomach-churningly woeful, with his ""acting"" consisting primarily of scowling and muttering through clenched teeth; and Robbie Gee, while his delivery is good, is failed by his ridiculously corny dialogue.The visuals in this film are its major saving grace. The cinematography is fluid, atmospheric and energetic; the sets are intensely Gothic and hauntingly beautiful; and, while the graphically-depicted blood and gore gets a little tiresome towards the end of the film, the special effects are otherwise dazzling, particularly the transformation sequences, which are the best I've seen in a long time. While the Vampires' leather and the martial-arts antics of the Lycans remind us, not fondly or amusingly, of THE MATRIX and THE TERMINATOR, they fit in surprisingly well with the strong Gothic ambiance.UNDERWORLD is a brilliant concept that was failed by its script; it is a beautiful piece of film-making that doesn't quite have the substance to fill its beautiful sets. Lakeshore have doomed this one to mediocrity- but it's worth a look if you stumble across it as you rummage in the bargain bin. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Should be a comic book,"For all I know, there could already be a comic book in the works for the vampire-werewolf fantasy, ""Underworld.""  I just got back from seeing it and I must say that this movie should stand up pretty well in the face of all the ridiculous (read: pointless, useless) ""Matrix; Crow; Blade"" comparisons. I've heard that this movie is based on some RPG game I have never heard of and if that's true, I don't really care; this movie could probably beat the hell out of it.""Underworld"" really has a unique feel to it.  The story doesn't stand up well under a whole lot of thought, but that doesn't really matter.  What should really capture some people, are the special effects and the sets. There are some pretty nifty werewolf transformation scenes that certainly deserve Oscar attention.  The sets, highly Victorian as they are, also should get some props.  This movie is going to be a comic book; I can tell. It certainly has the look, feel, and story of one, yet that still doesn't make it bad.Speaking of the story, though it isn't strong, it gets to you.  The thought that vampires and werewolves have been duking it out for thousands of years right under our noses is intriguing, even if it hasn't been fleshed out that well in the film.  Even still, it gets you thinking about everything that war means to them and us.As for the action scenes, they are certainly well shot and violent. Surprisingly, there isn't that much gore here either.  But what is really surprising is that the movie doesn't offer us pointless action scenes to fill in for lack of story; there's actually meaning behind it all.""Underworld"" is a pretty well-done fantasy that deserves to be immortalized in the comics.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Underworld finished under my expectations.,"Rating: ** out of ****As an introductory film to hopefully a larger, more epic and expansive series, Underworld fulfills its requirements adequately. There's enough action, blood, and tight latex outfits to satisfy a genre fan's thirst and the execution is decent enough that I look forward to the sequels, but there's the unmistakable sense of promise left unfulfilled.Set in an unnamed city, the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene, a ""Death Dealer,"" a vampire whose job is to hunt down the remaining Lycans, aka Werewolves. According to vampire history, most of the werewolves should have been wiped out in past wars, but a subway venture reveals there is still a formidable-sized population of werewolves. Against the wishes of her master, Kraven (Shane Brolly), Selene investigates further and discovers that the werewolves are particularly interested in a human named Michael (Scott Speedman).After an encounter with head werewolf Lucian (Michael Sheen), Michael is bitten but saved by Selene, who grows infatuated with this human. Why, is never made clear, other than the fact that he ""saves"" her life. As Selene pries deeper into the mystery surrounding Michael, she uncovers a conspiracy involving both vampires and werewolves that could tip the balance of the war.As most people have already said, by far the movie's most memorable image is the sight of Kate Beckinsale in tight latex. For those who find her a hot babe (like me), Underworld might just be worth watching for her alone. Hell, if she'd shown some nudity, I would have even bumped my rating up 1/2. Alas, she's still great eye-candy.The picture itself is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, there's lots of shootouts and fight scenes that are well-staged and filmed and reasonably exciting. The werewolf effects are excellent and the transformation scenes are some of the slickest, most convincing I've seen on-screen, certainly better than anything seen in The Howling or An American Werewolf in London. Beckinsale, in addition to being a delectable hottie, makes for a kick-ass, first-rate female action hero.But on the other hand, Underworld is a grim, joyless picture, accentuated by its deadly serious performances and occasionally laughably earnest dialogue. Much like the Blade films, a lot of what the characters have to say is hard to take seriously, the mythology hampered by the fact that it's being juxtaposed with CGI-infested action scenes (though, admittedly, any five minutes of Blade has a much worse problem with this than all of Underworld).Underworld is neither scary nor suspenseful. Selene never really gets herself into any combative situation she can't get herself out of, usually because most of the opponents she fights aren't nearly as skilled as her. Though there are plentiful werewolf effects, I think I would have preferred more scenes of Lycans skulking around in their hulking bodies rather than watching them in human form.Undoubtedly, Scott Speedman must be one of the worst examples of a romantic leading man I've seen. He and Beckinsale have no chemistry, and considering it's her affection for him that spurs her to ""betray"" her own kind, this is a pretty damning flaw. It's also during her scenes with Speedman that Beckinsale is at her least convincing; she won me over as a kick-ass vampiress, but I had a hard time believing she was in love with this bland nobody named Michael.Directed by first-timer Len Wiseman (who apparently stole Beckinsale's heart on-set, enough that she left Michael Sheen for him), Underworld is slickly-crafted and boasts a strong, pervasive atmosphere. Maybe with more passionate performances, more well-orchestrated thrills, and some bare skin from Kate, the sequel will be an unqualified success.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Matrix Re-Vamped,"Movie Review: UnderworldDirected By: Len WisemanWritten By: Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman and Danny McBrideStarring: Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly and Bill NighyAs soon as you have seen the first five minutes of Underworld, you realise that this is a film that owes The Matrix and Blade a huge debt.  While this should have been immediately obvious from the trailers and movie posters featuring Beckinsale in skin-tight PVC, twin pistols and a Trinity style haircut, it is also in the mise-en-sc√©ne and execution of the cinematography.  All out gun battles are frequent, and all that is missing is the bullet-time.  This raises the question: why have vampires and werewolves fighting, and then have them firing guns at each other?The fact that this is a fictional world (allegedly of its own devising, but I will come to that), is a plus in many ways, but it hits a trap that many fantasy/horror/sci-fi films fall into in.  The director and writers are obviously well at home with the world that they have created, but they rarely (if ever) take the time out to explain this world and its apparently complicated political situation to the audience.  This is a major flaw, and it is not until almost halfway through the movie that the audience has any idea what is actually going on.Apparently, the writer saw this movie as `Vampires and Werewolves do Romeo and Juliet'.  Let me state right now that this film bears little resemblance to the Shakespeare play, and that it is only the `Star-Crossed' lovers that remain.  A tarnished representation of one of the greatest love stories of our time, perhaps.  However, the romantic sideline seems crammed in somehow, as though the filmmakers realised that there needed to be some substance to pace out the next confusing gun-battle.  A major flaw of which is that the vampires and werewolves look virtually identical, so that it often hard to see who is shooting who.What is interesting is that the role-playing games company White Wolf Inc. attempted to sue the film for copyright infringement.  There certainly is a striking resemblance to Vampire: The Masquerade and Werewolf: The Apocalypse.  Don't worry, any knowledge you may have of the games' setting won't help you any, through the mysterious plotline.  That said, if they had just got the licence and made a Vampire: The Masquerade movie, the film would likely have been immeasurably superior.  That could have become/been a high class cult-movie.  Underworld, however, looks destined for the ¬£5.99 rack.Overall, Underworld is a flawed, if enjoyable, action-romp.  Probably best enjoyed when in a no-brainer mood.  Beckinsale is as lovely as ever, and the promise of her in a PVC suit is probably the major incentive for teenage boys to watch the film.  There are several nice action set-pieces throughout the film, but the overall effect is confusing and disjointed.STORY: 6/10 DIRECTION: 4/10 PERFORMANCE: 4/10 OVERALL: 5/10RECOMMENDED TO: Teenage Goths, people who play White Wolf RPGs and drunken twenty-somethings bored in Blockbuster.DON'T WATCH WITH: Mum, Werewolves or hardcore White Wolf gamers.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The standout for me was the elevator action sequence,"(2003) Underworld
SCIENCE FICTION ACTION HORRORCo-written and directed by Len Wiseman that possess a world with vampires clashing the world with werewolves. It also has has a love story that has a vampire, Selene (Kate Beckinsale) in love with a werewolf, Michael (Scott Speedman) via ""Romeo and Juliet"" scenario.Because I am an action guy, the only thing I liked about this film was the elevator sequence when it was falling straight down to Selene and she pulls out her gun that operates like a mini machine gun, where she shoots at the elevator coming straight down before she was poking holes on to the floor. Anyways, that was the only sequences that impressed me and the only thing I remembered over everything else that happened in the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tolerance - we have so much to learn,"Actually I would say that this is one of the best stories I've seen. Lycans vs. vampires. On the beginning we can tell who's ""good"" and who's ""bad"". But as the story develops we change our minds few times. Nothing is what it seems anymore. So, basically - two (or maybe even more in the second part of the ""Underworld""?) species learning to live next to each other on the same planet. Two different ""nations"" I would say. Does it ring a bell? Anyway - very good story, great soundtrack (both -instrumental and regular) and just dark, Gothic atmosphere. I would recommend it, but I have to warn - it's not a typical horror/gore story. If you liked The Crow then you will certainly like this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great concept and atmosphere spoiled by too much ""product""","First off, let me say that Len Wiseman really did his homework forthis film. Bringing in the real life (and still living) Corvinus familyand several other historical incidents of vampires and werewolvesadded authority to the film. Wiseman was a set designer, and hisattention to detail and atmosphere shows up well. The weirdmonochrome blue cast reminds me of the best black and whitecinematography from the 30s and 40s. Let's face it; Kate Beckinsale leaping, jumping  floating andslithering around in a glossy black latex corset is no small reasonto see this film either. Maybe the most intriguing aspect of all is thenovel idea that Vamps and Lycans have a genetic mutation tothank for their immortality rather than a supernatural cause. I really tried to like this film. It IS above average (10,000 timesbetter that the God-Awful Dracula 2000) but not as exceptional as itcould've been. Wiseman seems to be trying to make a John Woohorror flick. There's just too much gunplay and too little script. Theyoung male leads prove that Hollywood is taking full advantage ofgender role reversal by hiring lots of male ""metrosexual"" actorswho know a lot about ""Hair Product"" and very little about how todeliver a line onscreen....the lead male Lycan is perhaps anexception. After the umpteenth gunfight, I started yawning. The final gun-freebattle gets better when Beckinsale joins the fight and at leastdelivers a stirring ending.  This is a B movie with an A budget,elevated to higher status by superior sets and Kate Beckinsale. Ithas some pretty novel ideas, and could possibly develop into areally good series if Wiseman can focus a bit & Beckinsalereturns. It's worth a look if you're into Vampire flicks.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"As close to ""Vampire: The Masquerade"" movie we will probably ever come!","Explanation of the title: Yes, I'm aware this is far from the thing I mentioned, but ""Underworld"" is really the first movie to delve in to vampire politics, that's why I draw the comparison, so don't get triggered.
Review: I watched this movie as a kid and returning to it now, 10+ years later, I was expecting cringe and aged effects. Well, I am happy to say that, despite it's age, ""Underworld"" is still a great and very fun movie. Of course, it isn't a masterpiece, far from it. But it's what I think movie about vampires should be. My objections? Action could be better... A lot, lot better. If only someone who knew how to make good shooting scenes worked at the movie, we would have a gun fu epic, this way it's just average most of the time. Though I didn't watch the rest of the series, I know the quality sinks lower with every movie, so, if you need to watch one and be done with it, it would be this one, and not the prequel or sequels (and I doubt watching the prequel or sequels will change my mind). Al in all, it's a good blockbuster with decent acting, great main character and interesting story. Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride while it lasts, and don't ask too much questions :D 8/10! I recommend it!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No Romance YEAH!,From the previews they make it look like they are going to make a big deal of the romance between Selene and Michael.  It's just downplayed a large amount which is great.  When you go see a horror movie that is what you want to see.This film was full of action scenes and kept you wanting more.  I do wish they would of used more kinds of weapons.  The ones they did use had some interesting results however.I would definitely recommend this movie for lovers of vamps and werewolves alike.  I like the way they show the werewolves change.  Kind of a new faster way than the slow hair growing you might be used to seeing.All in all this is a film that should do well in the box office and may have set itself up nicely for a sequel if the studio so desires.  Catch the film as soon as it releases.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
* * * out of 4.,"Did you know that there was a secret war going on that humans pretty much are clueless to? Seems werwolves and vampires have been living anything, but a peaceful coexistence. Vampires and werewolves have been engaged in war for many centuries now, but when one vampire starts questioning why this has been going on for so long and why the werewolves are after an oridnary citizen, it turns the vampire community inside out and causes the raising of an ancient vampire leader.Borrows more then it's fair share from flicks like The Matrix, Blade, Resident Evil and countless other video games and movies, but it takes all of the elements it has stolen from other films and combines them skillfully. The film has top of the line sets, costumes, and really well excuted special effects that don't look nowhere near as cheap as the popular CGI. Plus it has an interesting Romeo & Juliet angel where one of the vampires ends up falling in love with a werewolf. Combine that with some daring casting that works for the most part and a script that tries not to be predictable and takes you on a route you didn't expect and I would say you have what will probably be the best horror film of the fall / winter 2003 season.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A different film from what I'm used to and I'm here for it,"This movie is a little bit different from what i usually watch because I literally do not know any of the cast here which isn't a bad thing because I like to see new performances by actors/ actresses I do not know and this was pretty neat.The colour pallet of this movie I don't really know how to explain it but it's very good the vibe from the dark blue and greenish black is a very good thing by the director to choose because it definitely set the mood of the film pretty well.Speaking of mood this is a vampire film and it has some very good transformation scenes ( werewolves included ) and the CGI here was pretty neat also.The story is not my favorite aspect but some scenes are pretty nice here and there and overall this film is very different from what I usually watch but it's cool because it's something new and never seen before , I will watch the second one sometime in the future , meanwhile this is a 7/10 film .

"""You're acting like a pack of rabid dogs. And that, gentlemen, simply will not do.""","FILM: 7.5/10.Underworld draws me back into its dark and brooding atmosphere on my recent rewatch. The movie's premise, which intertwines vampires and werewolves in an age-old feud, still holds a charm two decades after I first saw it.From the start, the film's stylish visuals and its gloomy, gothic setting impress. The dark and moody cinematography adds a sense of foreboding to every scene, making the supernatural world feel all the more real. The haunting score and hard rock soundtrack further complements the visuals, heightening the experience.Kate Beckinsale's portrayal of Selene, the vampire warrior protagonist, is undoubtedly a highlight of the film. Her icy demeanor and fierce combat skills create a compelling and memorable character. With her leather-clad attire and twin handguns, she exudes a sense of badassery that still resonates. Michael Sheen is particularly enjoyable too, whilst Bill Nighy road tests an over the top performance he'd put to better use in The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise a few years later.While the action sequences are undoubtedly thrilling, there are moments when I can't help but feel that the film relies too heavily on its stylized fights and CGI effects. The clearly Matrix-inspired, overly choreographed action scenes, and the somewhat dated computer-generated visuals might have impressed two decades ago, but feel somewhat less awe-inspiring now.The story itself is engaging, though it does feel somewhat convoluted at times. The complex web of alliances, betrayals, and ancient grudges keeps me invested, but I can't deny that there are moments when I find the writers overly complicating the intricacies of the vampire-werewolf lore in order to add an air of legitimacy to proceedings.One of the film's weaknesses lies in its character development. Although Selene is a standout, some of the supporting cast feels underutilized. Their depth and backstory is sacrificed to bring a generic love story to fruition between Selene and Michael.Overall, my rewatch of Underworld reminds me why I enjoyed it in the first place, but it also reveals some flaws that prevent it from reaching greatness. The film's dark and stylish aesthetics, along with Kate Beckinsale's compelling performance, make it a worthwhile watch for fans of the supernatural genre. However, the reliance on some substandard CGI and occasionally convoluted plot prevent it from achieving a higher rating in my book. Nevertheless, Underworld remains an entertaining and memorable experience to sink your fangs into.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 8/10.Upscaled 4K presentation, Detail level: Good, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Good, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 9/10.Dolby Atmos audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Good, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Stands the test of time,"It's hard to believe that Underworld turns 20 years old while writing this review. Why this vampire flick still holds upp in my opinion is that they tried to use as much practical effects as possible when filming the action. A big part of it is also the cinematography, set design and general atmosphere of the film. Many scenes are filmed in a cothic looking Budapest and the Matrix inspired costumes also help to make this early 2000's movie really stands the test of time. The acting is not great, except for Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy. But the movie doesn't take itself too seriously and it never gets boring. A great looking action horror if you ask me.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I have some other opinions but don't have the time or the energy to try and type them all out so this is a just a basic overview of what I thought.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cool Gothic,"Underworld is one of the pioneers of Modern Vampire Movies, it's a bit strange for me Vampires and Lycans Use Weapons. The plot that is presented may indeed be a bit predictable, but it still delivers something impressive.I as a Romance movie connoisseur really like this film, the romance that is presented does not seem forced but is indeed given in a suitable portion, the romance is something that is able to build this story well, so it doesn't seem flat and interesting to follow until the end.For 2003 CGI, I really couldn't expect much, because indeed for 2003, the CGI that was shown was really very good, unfortunately the war scene that wanted to look majestic actually looked very cheap, the acting of some soldiers looked very rude, especially the shooting skills of the two soldiers who need to be questioned about their abilities.Overall, that's all this film lacks for me. Apart from the bad scene, I think this film is close to perfect for the year, moreover, this action with a unique romance spice is guaranteed to be able to make the audience feel at home watching it until the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Decent if not Spectacular Horror Movie,"22 September 2003. I can't say that Underworld was spectacular. It did make use of the latest special effects, slow-mo action moves from other contemporary action films (notably Matrix). It did have a decent script and a reasonable, consistent storyline that was intelligent. Yet I didn't find the movie really breaking any new, innovative ground, except for the fusion of vampires and werewolves (an intriguing idea done well). The acting was decent, if not superlative. There seemed to be a lack of emotional depth to many of the lead characters.Interestingly, this horror movie didn't really spin the way most horror movies go and the Romeo and Juliet spin-off went a lot more American than the English version. I enjoyed the movie, but the action scenes seemed less than explosively dramatic and exciting than say for example Charlies' Angels. The horror wasn't as terrifying as for example 28 Days or The Ring.This blending or fusion of genres makes for a more modest accomplishment, a more cerebral effort towards horror that produces one small step for vampires and werewolves, a giant step for a future movie.

Have Guns replaced Fangs in this Underworld?,"I'm not an expert of Vampyr mythology, but I was always under the impression that Vampires had a physical, as well as mentaledgeover Lycans, so it was confusing (although visually appealing) to see a leather-clad Kate Beckinsale swirling in her black cape (a la Matrix) shooting from a pair of inexhaustable handguns at physically larger and more powerful werewolves.I did appreciate the backstory to the War between the Vamps and the Lycans, but I think Wiseman failed at the exposition. Too much unneccessary exposition of Corwin's character and his odd chemistry with Seline could have been done more effectively. Their initial kissing scene came so far from left field, I felt embarrassed for the actors.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Gritty & foreboding,"I wanted to 'love' this movie - instead I 'liked' it a lot (I would have given 3.5 stars if possible).  Underworld tells a story of a war between vampires and werewolves that goes on for centuries.   Each side it trying to wipe out the other.  With assets such as the beautiful and deadly vampire warrior Selene and a powerful lineage of elders, the vampires have dominated. until now as the werewolves have a new plan found in Michael, the newly bitten werewolf and his unique bloodline.First the positives - Underworld has a decent story line with some compelling twists to keep it moving along.  It has an awesome look and feel that manages to maintain the gritty, foreboding feeling displayed in the trailer. The CG was for the most part not overdone.   The music is good and well matched.  Plus. they left it wide open to a sequel.The negatives - There was no strong actors to deliver the strength and power that this film needed.  While the story was well crafted, it lacked the details to make it very interesting.  The werewolf transformations (CG) took place in the dark in an obvious attempt to hide any flaws.While I was a little disappointed, I certainly recommend this movie and I have great hopes for the sequel!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"a stylish, but not over the top, character-driven, vampire vs werewolf action flick with great performances and superb storytelling","I've seen this movie more time than I can count. As have I indulged in its many sequels, particularly the second and third (a prequel expounding on the narrative and folklore established in this one). But this one remains the star. At the time innovative so far as combining vampire and werewolf, in such a creative and dark way. The lore created for this movie is explained throughout, shown rather than told, avoiding an intro scene of dense exposition seen so often in movies like this. What makes it even better is the prevalence of practical effects over CGI, and the werewolf (excuse me, lycan - a genius move in the writing), transformations are so satisfying. The hybridization of the species was handled brilliantly, too. The subtle stylish shots and moves in the cinematography gave this movie some flair amod the dark, grimy, gritty atmosphere throughout, a vibe that nonetheless pulls you in. My only gripe really is some continuity and tech mistakes, such as Selene's pistols having infinite ammunition. One complaint I usually have with vampire movies is this cloying romantic element, but that's absent here. While there is still some ""sexual tension"" and a deeply rooted romantic theme as you discover by the end, it's so well portrayed and not overwhelming at all. Meanwhile characters are performed with such great evocation, especially Michael Sheen as Lucian. Kate Beckinsale as Selene is at this point iconic, as I would say Bill Nighy as Viktor is absolutely incredible, and Shane Brolly as Kraven shouldn't be overlooked or understated. Even the smaller characters had some draw to them, so unique personality. Be it Sorn, Kahn, or Raze. The action itself is well done but not without its stiffness sometimes. The movie often felt low-budget but I can't be sure. Nonetheless an amazing directorial debut by Len Wiseman. And a brilliant fashion of storytelling using effectively depicted flashbacks, especially now having such an elaboration of the lore available (a story cowritten by both Wiseman and Kevin Grevioux, who played Raze, and powerfully might I add).",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
action makes up for the poorly done script...,"I don't know why reviews were squashing this movie. Mabye because it was about vampires again! Perhaps because it was a perfect mixture of the Matrix and Blade II. Whatever it was, I don't care. I thought the movie was fun and quite enjoyable to watch. It had some good actors, a good plot, and a TON of ACTION.To me, a movie doesn't have to be all story. They basically got the story in about a total of twenty minutes so what to do about the other one hour and forty-one minutes left? ACTION! Why not amaze the audience with some horror, gore and fun? The warewolves changing were very new and different from the old changes. The effects were great and the actors worked well with it. Kate Beckinsale did a fine, not great job playing Selene. She wore the leather well and spoke the lines perfectly. The other actors did fine too but MY GOD; what was with Shane Brolly's (Kraven's) role! I think he just, well....sucked. He did a terrible job and I believe he could have been replaced. It would have made the movie better. One bad actor can screw up a whole movie. Besides that, the acting was great.In the reviews, they talked up how rediculous the romance was between Selene and Michael. Only one problem with that, there wasn't any! They shared one meaningless kiss and then they went back to the beautiful ACTION.So bottom line, if you don't like vampires, darkness, The Matrix, or ACTION-don't see this.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Love this twist on Vampires/Werewolves!,"I watched this movie years ago when I still had sci fi on cable as a teenager and absolutely loved it.

The main actress Selene is absolutely gorgeous and does a great job in the 4 movies shes in of the series.

I will say Bill Nighy is also just a fantastic actor and performs as the leader of the vampire coven quite well! Also loved him in the 3rd film.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Silly but smart.  And fun too,"Vampires and werewolves and Kate Beckinsale in skintight rubber. What more could you ask from a movie? Now nobody is going to confuse Underworld with any kind of work of great cinema. But for what it is it works. Yes, the whole thing is rather silly. At times it is very hard to take the movie seriously. So don't bother trying to take it seriously, just enjoy it. Silly vampire movie that it may be Underworld does have some brains to it. The vampire/werewolf back-story mythology is worked out very carefully. The movie's not just vampires and werewolves brainlessly slaughtering each other, there's actually a reason they're slaughtering each other. Much of the back-story is not revealed until well into the movie so you've had time to build your own ideas of what's really going on, who is good and bad, what is right and wrong. Then the movie springs some surprises on you and puts a whole new spin on things. And then the vampires and werewolves resume slaughtering one another.Beckinsale, lovingly photographed with as many butt shots as possible, is the glue that holds the movie together. There's some rather silly stuff she's forced to say and do. Some of the movie's dialogue is rather laughable. But Beckinsale makes it work. She brings an air of seriousness to the proceedings. But not too serious. A movie about a thousand-year war between vampires and werewolves can't be too serious. It needs to be fun. And this movie is. More or less. There are pieces that don't work. One acting performance, that of Shane Brolly as the vampire Kraven, is rather disastrous. The performance is off, the character is off. It's as if Brolly is acting in his own little movie. And his movie is much worse than everybody else's. But the rest of the cast performs admirably. Kate's great in her role of Selene, a vampire whose mission in life is to seek out and destroy Lycans. By Lycans I mean werewolves. The movie insists on calling werewolves Lycans because I guess it sounds cooler or something. Whatever. Michael Sheen makes for an excellent antagonist as the leader of the werewolves. Scott Speedman is appropriately flustered as a human caught up in the middle of all this nonsense. And Bill Nighy gets special credit for his performance as vampire elder Viktor who doesn't look too good when awakened from his long nap. Nighy deals admirably with one of all the all-time movie prosthetic/makeup jobs. The movie looks terrific with some dazzling visual effects, great sets and wonderful costumes. The story takes a little while to get going and has its ups and downs. But it eventually pays itself off pretty well. In the end there is really no ending at all, just a setup for a sequel. This type of thing I generally despise but here I'm actually looking forward to seeing Beckinsale shoehorn herself into that catsuit for some more vampire/werewolf shenanigans. Underworld is by no means a great movie. But its got enough fun and, especially for its genre, enough smarts to make it worthwhile. And it's good enough to make you want to jump back into this world again.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rule #1 - Hunt Them Down - Kill Them Off,"Favorite movie quote - ""We have a serious problem here.""When it comes to the likes of a Romeo & Juliet story presented in the genre of Fantasy/Horror, I must say that I did enjoy, for the most part, Underworld's diabolical, little tale of forbidden love.At times Underworld's vicious, blood-thirsty story of betrayal & revenge was definitely something of a gratifying adrenaline-rush where everyone (vampires and werewolves, alike) were getting royally clobbered, one and all.With its carefully-staged gun-battles literally taken (bullet-for-bullet) straight out of The Matrix, I found it somewhat unfortunate that Underworld's underworld of vampires & werewolves only came in one generic flavor - And, that was - The young & good-looking type.And besides Underworld being about 20 minutes too long for its own good, I also docked this picture some serious points due to there being way too much time spent amongst the vampires & werewolves fighting and feuding with each other.I mean, with all of the bitching, bickering and battling that went on amongst these modern-day monsters, I'm surprised that any of them had any time to feed.Underworld's budget was $22 million.

Not bad.,"""Underworld"" is not as bad as it's reputed to be.I'm a horror movie  fanatic who has seen literally hundreds of horror movies(check out my comments and be impressed)and I enjoyed it very immensely.A wonderful beauty Kate Beckinsale plays Selene,a vampire soldier in the centuries-old war between vampires and werewolves,also known as lycans.Beneath her trench coat Selene wears a black vinyl catsuit and she looks incredibly sexy in it.As the story opens,Selene informs us that vampires have all but wiped out werewolves.After an obligatory shoot-out in a subway station,Selene realizes that the lycans are trying to abduct a human doctor,Michael Corvin(Scott Speedman).The other vampires,especially her rival,Kraven(Shane Brolly),believe that the best solution is to kill Michael,but Selene wants to keep him alive to learn why werewolves need him.""Underworld"" is pretty stylish.It takes place in an unnamed European city that is always bathed in a steely blue light.The acting is decent and the photography is excellent.There is plenty of violence,but not enough gore for my liking.The lack of suspense is especially hard to forgive.Still the film is never dull,so fans of action/horror won't be disappointed.Give this one a chance.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Selene (Kate Beckinsale) a vampire death dealer hunts Lycans and is attracted to a human called Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who the other Lycans are looking for. It seems he is a descendant of the head of the werewolf family and the Lycans want to use Micheal to create a vampire- werewolf hybrid.This is a shallow stylish film but entertaining with enough action and at least a backstory which gives it some interest. Some hammy acting from the vampires who do not have a decent script to get their teeth into.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Psh this movie was good.,"So I am not much one for leaving my comments on movies for others to read, I think an individual will enjoy it differently based on there taste in films. But if you are into horror movies, and are actually into the story line more than gore.. I think you will like it. Its beautiful in a dark way and the story line is interesting enough to keep you into until the end of the film. The whole concept that classic horror ""creatures"" are fighting against one another is a great concept, but what they are fighting over is even better than one could imagine. Get ready for some beautiful effects. Quite frankly I can not wait to see the sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good looking- and good enough movie.,"The movie is wonderfully made and has a perfectly, moody dark atmosphere. The visual effects are convincing enough and there are some nicely shot action sequences. Still the movie is not as good as it could had been, especially when considering what its concept is.Problem with the movie is that it isn't really an entertaining one to watch. The movie could had really used some humor at times and the story and the movie in general, takes itself way too serious. It makes the movie a bit heavy and hard one to watch at times and because of this all the movie doesn't really have an high entertainment value. Another thing is that the story becomes unnecessary hard to follow at times, because of the very same reason. The movie is not halve as entertaining as it could had been. The concept of the movie; Werewolves versus vampires sounds good but the execution of it is done too seriously. It's done with style certainly but not with a sense for entertainment. The result is a good looking- but mostly empty movie that isn't really always constantly pleasant to watch.The movie also lacks some real likable characters. Seline is a cool chick but I don't have the feeling that we ever fully get to know and understand her. Also there is absolutely no chemistry between Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman, which makes parts of the movie weak at times.The acting is fair enough. The actors fit their roles well and that is what really counts. Bill Nighy is always great to watch in a movie and this one is no exception. He plays the best part of the movie, a sort of √ºber-vampire.It certainly is a watchable movie, especially to those who also liked the first two Blade movies. I'll probably also watch its sequel ""Underworld: Evolution"" but probably not earlier until when it arrives on DVD.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wicked!,"UnderworldStarring: Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Wentworth Miller, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly and Bill NighyRated R for Strong Violence/Gore and Some LanguageGenre: Action/Fantasy/Horror/ThrillerStar Rating: **** out of 5Underworld is a really cool movie and I think it's better than Van Helsing! I think the reason why I say Underworld is better than Van Helsing is because there were better fight scenes, the way the movie was done was better than Van Helsing. Underworld is a movie about this war between werewolves and vampires that have been sworn enemies for more than 100 years and a death dealer named Selene (Kate Beckinsale) has an assignment to take down the last of the Lycan. When she comes across Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who holds the key to end the war she must decide where her alligances will lie. This movie was awesome and the other cool thing about this movie is that a sequel is under way!BOTTOM LINE: COOL!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"As Expected: A fun, Stylized, Vampires vs Lycans Film","When going into this movie, I expected one thing and one thing only; Action. I wasn't disappointed. In a movie about a war between Vampires and Lycans, I want to see some great action scenes and Underworld delivers. But you get more than just good action; you get a great looking movie. I absolutely loved the dark dingy look throughout the entire movie. There isn't much color but that's the point. I think they also did a great job in the costume/makeup department. The Vampires look believable but not overdone and I love the Lycans. The acting was so-so and the story while not bad in my opinion was nothing to write home about. If you're looking for a stylized, fun, action movie, then this one is definitely worth a shot. O yea, and Kate Beckinsale is in it¬Ö. Need I say more?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dark but hollow,"Len Wiseman took the topic of vampires and werewolves into the neutral zone. Like a Japanese Manga artist he claims total ignorance of the Christian superstitions and history linked to it. That moves the film into the genre of pure action. It also helps that there is no real screenplay. Although the plot contains a nice turn where our our first impressions are betrayed, the story is quite simple. The acting is lousy but Kate Beckinsale looks gorgeous in her tight leather suit. There is a lot of shooting and - later on - fighting. The movie would be a total loss if it weren't for the visuals. In fact, the whole picture is just a long video clip. Its the artistic use of special effects and the creation of dark, impressive images - although bordering on kitsch - which lift the movie just above the average of this genre.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Monster Soap Opera,"Vampires vs. Werewolves is a basic premise with lots of potential, but despite an admirable attempt to create a thorough but easily digestible mythology, 'Underworld' takes itself so serious that it snuffs out any fun before it even begins (though the soapy house politics and intrigue did help glue it all together, however tentatively).Meandering around for a nearly interminable two hours, the story is bloated and moves at a snails pace. When there is action, it's of the stylized, post-'Matrix' variety, but without any of the latter's flare or drama.Like its star Kate Beckinsale, it's certainly nice to look at, but even her beauty isn't enough to put this 'Underworld' over the Top.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kate Beckinsale in leather,"When i tried to watch this movie the first time i didn't even get past the first fight scene. I thought it felt like such a clich√© i didn't even want to see the rest. But now i gave it a second chance. And well, not as bad as i expected the first time around, but i don't know if it's that good either.The style of this movie is sort of the classic ""bits and pieces"". Meaning that the director and script-writer has taken small pieces of movies they like and put it together into a movie of their own. Now and then i just felt like ""Oh, that's The Matrix"" and ""Oh, that's Blade"" and so forth. Not that there is anything wrong with that necessarily as long as you have something of your own to add to the mix.So, what worked? Well some of the action scenes were pretty good. The actors took the whole thing the way they should, the acting didn't become neither pompous nor silly like it so often does in vampire movies. And admittedly Bill Nighy is always a joy to watch, as is Kate Beckinsale in tight leather (although a different kind of joy completely). Also, as someone else mentioned in their review, the lack of comic relief was very positive. Nowadays it seems nobody can make an action or horror movie without pushing in stupid one-liners and quips. Here though the mood is kept throughout, which is refreshing. And what didn't work? Well, the whole story is a bit silly really. Vampires fighting Werevolves, and nobody noticing apparently since there is no police and seldom any regular people in the city where this whole thing is taken place. Also the fight scenes again, while some of them were well done, many of them lacked the real nerve. When the fighting is done between two different kinds of monsters i want to see fierce fighting, animal rage and carnage. Here we get some sort of martial arts Matrix style mixed with a little biting. Which really takes the edge of.To sum the whole thing up i found this movie to be less bad than i had anticipated. Certainly no masterpiece and absolutely not a classic, but still a decent entry into the worn genre of Vampire movies. Also any Vampire movie that excludes the whole eastern European accent thing more or less completely gets at least one extra point.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Underworld""- A wickedly entertaining and sleek exercise in style over substance.","For nearly fifteen years now, the ""Underworld"" franchise has been entertaining audiences with its relatively competent action and overly moody visuals. And that is most certainly to be commended, considering the original film was definitely the product of its time and might not quite hold up for modern audiences with its decidedly dated aesthetic. This is through and through an early 2000's cheese fest, with borderline insane Gothic overtones, melodramatic writing and a penchant for outlandish wire-filled stunt work... yet I have to say, it's a lot of fun. I remember being in High School when this first chapter hit screens, and it was a big hit with us. And even to this day, I still think it holds up rather nicely, if for no other reason than its just so excessive and so stylish, yet with just complex enough a story to keep you guessing, it doesn't lose its effect.Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene, a ""Death Dealer""- a sort-of vampire assassin who helps wage war in a seemingly never-ending battle against the Lycans- werewolves. However, when she finds herself mysteriously attracted to a human man named Michael (Scott Speedman) who is being sought after by her Lycan enemies, and as she starts to uncover hints of treachery and conspiracy within her vampire house, a chain of events will begin to unfold that will not only change the way she views the world, but may hold the key to changing the war in unimaginable ways...The success of the film really falls onto the shoulders of director/co-writer Len Wiseman and the fairly excellent casting that brings the sometimes stock characters to life. Wiseman is a really interesting filmmaker. I haven't necessarily been a fan of his, and sometimes his choices are just head-scratching... but I appreciate his efforts, and when it pays off (as it does here, or in other films like his amusing and thrilling ""Live Free or Die Hard""), it really pays off. His use of a deathly cold color-palate and overly-Gothic design sensibilities really brings you into the world of the war between vampires and Lycans. It helps to sort-of let us know that we're in a different ""world"" that exists alongside our own. He also just knows how to tell a darned-good action scene, and some of the gun-battles and martial-arts displays he gives us are still pretty darned awe- inspiring even to this day. Even if they can sometimes feel a little hokey, you'll never be bored by his use of action. It really helps to elevate what could otherwise have been a drab, lifeless affair.The cast is just great. Beckinsale might not be an Academy Award winning actress, but she knows how to kick some serious Lycan butt and look good doing it, and she's got just enough of a charm that we can buy the more tender moments of romance and pathos that the film occasionally gives her. There's a reason why Selene is still a popular character and people still enjoy these films. Speedman's role might be a bit under-developed, but he's fine in a supporting role as Selene's love interest, and a few twists later on give him some good concepts to sink his teeth into. Michael Sheen is absolutely fantastic in a supporting role as one of the Lycan leaders- an ancient figure with a definite chip on his shoulder. I'm more used to seeing Sheen in comedic roles, so it's a lot of fun seeing him as a brooding, violent figure. And Bill Nighy is just amazing as Viktor- a vampire elder who is awakened and plays a large part in the story. Nighy chews the scenery with such glee and is just a blast to watch. It's always a treat when he pops up, because no matter how far ""out there"" the role is, he goes for it completely.Unfortunately, the film does have some pretty big issues, most of which boil down to some fundamental problems with the writing and the execution of the material. And that's where it loses a few big points from me. The script by Danny McBride (no, not THAT Danny McBride), from a story he co-wrote with director Wiseman and co-star Kevin Grevioux has a lot of issues with the establishment and conveyance of characters and some themes. It took me a few sittings before I could really wrap my head around things, which is a bit of a problem in my opinion. It can move too quickly while doling out information a bit too haphazardly. I also can't help but smirk and shake my head at the pretentious nature of certain characters and scenes... maybe it's just me, but it always just feels silly when vampire and werewolf characters all have really prim-and-proper sounding names like ""Viktor"" or ""Lucian"" or ""Selene"" or ""Kraven"", all speak with prim-and-proper sounding accents and while all using a lot of five- dollar words. I also think that the film can be a bit contrived at times, like they tried to shoehorn in a bit too much plot to match the action.Still, at the end of the day, this is a Gothic action movie, and as a purely visceral exercise in excess and a display of style over substance... it's a ton of fun. You could definitely do a lot worse. Can it be silly? Absolutely. Can it be confusing? Definitely. But is it always entertaining and will it keep you glued to your chair? Yes, yes, yes! ""Underworld"" is a great time, and would definitely serve well to spice up a slow afternoon when you're stuck at home with nothing else to do. I'd even recommend the first few follow-ups that came out.I give ""Underworld"" an 8 out of 10 just for sheer style and fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Shows its audience a reasonably good time.,"Out of the blue, a hunky average-Joe hospital intern named Michael (Scott Speedman) is targeted by beings who turn out to be ""Lycans"", or werewolves. It turns out that there's been a war waging between Vampires and Lycans for centuries, and Michael's caught up in it because the Lycans have taken a keen interest in him. The Vampire who begins protecting Michael on a regular basis is the tough-as-nails Selene (a black leather clad, super sexy Kate Beckinsale). She also must deal with the traitorous Kraven (Shane Brolly) and Lycan head honcho Lucian (Michael Sheen).Admittedly, some of the gadgets here are cool. Each side has devised special bullets guaranteed to mess up opponents badly. Director Len Wiseman serves up a lot of fast and furious action, and the kind of rapid cutting common to so many modern films of this kind. Beckinsale looks exquisite while kicking ass, and Speedman is sure to get plenty of hearts fluttering himself. All of that said, it's hard to care very much about the characters for quite a while, until Wiseman starts giving the actors more dramatic moments. Even then, the film looks and feels drab, with characters struggling to keep their emotions in check. The heavy reliance on digital technology, unfortunately, turns too many of the effects into cartoons. (Not that this is surprising; ""Underworld"" was obviously done to have a comic book sort of approach.) The werewolves, in particular, look pretty bad. This is dark, rainy stuff with atmosphere to spare (this was filmed in Hungary), slick to a fault, but never very involving. Perhaps the most interesting aspect is the ""things are not as they seem"" plot twist, although some viewers may charge that they saw it coming well ahead of time.Beckinsale and Speedman are nicely supported by a talented bunch of actors. Sheen is charismatic, Bill Nighy has excellent screen presence as head Vampire Viktor, and Sophia Myles has plenty of sex appeal herself in the role of Erika. Brolly isn't so hot, however; his reaction to hearing some ""shocking"" news is priceless.Screenplay by actor Danny McBride, with story credit going to McBride, fellow actor Kevin Grevioux (both of them also have roles in the film), and director Wiseman.Followed by three more ""Underworld"" features.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No talent shoot-em-up.,"Obviously no one in the editing department cares that handguns do not have unlimited ammunition. During the first scene, the female lead fires about 50 rounds out of a handgun before unloading. I love it how characters simply drop clips on the ground everywhere, and their guns when they are out of ammo. It's like automatic machine pistols are ten bucks at Mall-Wart or something, and not several thousand dollars as they are in *our* world. This movie was just an excuse to play shoot-em-up.People watching this movie might become confused who the ""bad guys"" really are. I actually wanted the protagonists to lose, because I simply had no sympathy for them. Vampires seemed bent to the point of lunacy in their quest for killing werewolves. Why? I like the werewolves. What did they ever do? The movie also introduces the hilarious concept of a new breed of vampire-werewolf mix. It reminds me of children's toys that blended concepts in order to boost sales; look, it's a gun-robot-dinosaur-spaceship!The script must have been written by someone in marketing, because it just relies too much on concept and flash, without much content. Everything in the film is either a gun battle, or an excuse to show off vampire fashion, (long leather overcoats.) This movie has nothing on the Blade series, which developed a much better ""culture"" for the vampires. The vampire culture in Underworld seemed like Zoolander, where models strut around with an, ""I know I look hot,"" attitude.This movie seems like a copy of Alien vs. Predator or some kind of mixed genre flick from the 50's. Swamp Men versus Mummies or Zombies versus Spider People might have done just fine instead.By the way, why is it that vampires seem to have tons of money and live in lavish castles all the time? Where do they get their cash? The poor werewolves seem to be incapable of balancing a check book. They have to live in a sewer tunnel.If you're thinking about renting this one, don't bother. The following movies have much more monster talent going on in them: Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Blade, any Lord of the Rings film, An American Werewolf in London, and even Jurassic Park.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kate+Skintight Black Leather=Good Fun (with the Volume Turned Down),"UnderworldIf watching Kate Beckinsale run, jump, strut, pose and fly across the screen wearing a skin-tight black leather outfit sounds like a great way to spend two hours of your time--and it does to me, I tell you what--then ""Underworld"" is the best film ever made. That's because Kate's leather-clad form and pale, gorgeous face is about all the entertainment value there is in this incredibly derivative Goth-kid's wet dream. ""Buffy,"" ""Matrix,"" ""La Femme Nikita,"" Neil Gaiman, and Anne Rice are only a few of the sources blatently ""resourced"" for this over-budgeted hunk of junk.If you don't find the vision of Ms. Beckinsale's hide-wrapped hind quarters enough to interest you for two hours, however, all you have left is incredibly bad dialogue, overripe sets left over from other, better movies, and a bunch of lank-haired wannabe rockstar pretty boys glowering and acting all testy.Luckily, now that the movie has been released on home video, you can turn the sound down and at least not have to suffer the inane sub cartoon dialogue. In fact, ""Underworld"" would have worked much better as a silent film.Fortunately (or sadly, depending on how you look at it) I find Kate's patent leather packaged butt to be plenty entertaining all on its own, however, so I have to give the flick all thumbs up!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Vampires VS Werewolves, this is the match we've been waiting for!","K, to start off you have Kate Beckinsale as Selene a beautiful Vampire, who falls in love with a human.

I thought Kate did an amazing job in this movie, I've been a fan of hers for years. Also, the guy who plays Lucien, he's good too. For the fans who don't like a lot of gore like myself you'll be happy to know that unlike other vampire movies in the past, this one has gore, but very little of it. Also, the action scenes were great, awesome special effects and terrific acting make this movie a pretty good movie to see. I gave it a 7, because I personally really liked it, and I encourage you to see it for yourself.

Underworld A Decent Gothic Sci-Fi Action Adventure,"Underworld is a decent Gothic sci-fi action adventure from director Len Wiseman who does a good job in making this movie but there are some flaws that weigh it down. I'll get back to that later. Kate Beckinsale turns in a solid performance as the lead Selene a vampire Death Dealer in the middle of a war between her race and werewolves known as Lycans. She looks great in leather and is convincing as the character especially in the action/fight sequences. Scott Speedman is decent as Michael Corvin who eventually becomes a powerful vampire/werewolf hybrid because something to do with his blood. He gets a few fight sequences near the end that are impressive but for the most of the movie he's either being chased, running, or being held prisoner. Speedman however like Beckinsale is good as his character. Michael Sheen is terrific as Lucian the Lycan leader whose supposed to have been dead and is after Michael for unknown reasons until those motives are revealed later on in the film. Sheen's role may get cut short near the end but he does a great job of portraying someone who you're not sure is either the villain or a man simply driven by revenge who is willing to do whatever is necessary to defend his race. Well done. Bill Nighy is equally impressive as one of the vampire Lord's Viktor but he isn't given a lot of screen time and his showdown between both Michael and Selene near the end felt a bit rushed. He's also easily defeated but Nighy is effective in the role none the less. The rest of the cast including Shane Brolly, Sophia Myles, and a brief appearance by Wentworth Miller are okay in their roles but don't have much to do. The action/fight sequences are well executed but a slow pace in between made the movie fee a little long. The film seemed to be juggling a bit too many characters and it sort of lacked a central villain because there are quite a few of them in this one. If they had focused on just one instead of Nighy, Brolly, Sheen, and many more the movie would've been a little better. It did have a Gothic feel which seemed to fit with the tone of the film and made it a little different than some sci-fi action movies out there. The music seemed to match well with what was happening on the screen as well. So despite some flaws Underworld may not be the greatest movie ever made but it's certainly not the worst either. Overall Underworld has an intricate story, intense action, some suspense, cool special effects, and good performances by the cast who make this sci-fi movie worth watching at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Target audiences and horror fans will love it...,"This movie has had some bad press, so, as you can imagine, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying it and actually wondering what was going to happen next.Underworld, as a little too lengthy a prologue tells us, is set in a world where humans unknowingly share the planet with two other warring species ¬ñ the Vampires and the Lycans (Werewolves). The war has lasted for centuries and the Vampires are winning ¬ñ or so they think. The Lycans have got a few little genetically modified tricks up their furry sleeves and some moles in the Vampire camp (now it's not often you can string that kind of a sentence), and when a romance starts to develop between a Vampire and a prospective Lycan, all the old wounds are opened - and eagerly chewed at. Sorry.The plot is reasonably, but not too, complicated and has a few nice twists. The imagery is suitably dark and Crow-like (Brandon, not Russell) and being mostly filmed in Budapest the architecture is decidedly Anton Furst/Gotham City Gothic.The action too is derivative of many other films: there's plenty of John Woo double-fisted gunfire; Lots of Matrix leaping around in long coats and tight leather; American Werewolf transformation scenes (sometimes a little jerky), and a fair share of Blade-style bloodletting.And this is why I think it got the negative reviews it did. It is shamelessly derivative. Fortunately though the story and some good performances make up for this, and it's hard to see how else they could have told such a story without these style graphics, and after all, if something is proved to work well, then use it, and I think audiences have now come to expect it.Also enjoyable to watch is the usually light comedy actor Bill Nighy (Love Actually) who obviously felt it was time to (literally) get his teeth into something a bit meatier, as he revels in the role of the Vampire Lord Viktor.Target audiences and horror fans will love it, though there will be uproar when they see Vampires casting reflections in mirrors.

"Too much action, not enough horror","I suppose it's my own fault that I had such great expectations from this movie, I had hoped for a standard horror thriller, with innocent human victims preyed upon and devoured by vampires and werewolves in the course of the conflict. And indeed, that is how Underworld started out, but quickly this movie transformed itself into a routine, and not particularly exciting action flick. In my opinion, in horror movies the supernatural antagonists have to inflict their savagery on relatively defenseless victims, victims who ultimately conquer and kill these predators by some clever and unexpected ruse.In this movie, first of all, both vampires and werewolves are equally unsympathetic to humans since both use their formidable powers to prey upon their unaware,unsuspecting and usually defenseless victims. Secondly, both of these groups of supernatural creatures were equally powerful, having achieved what could be called a balance of power in terms of their pretty standard weaponry. Thirdly, and finally, both sides got so tied up with their fantastic martial arts, their pistols, machine guns, and magic bullets, and even their car chases, that I soon forgot that they were supposed to be supernatural creatures of the night at all and they simply turned into Matrix wannabes.I felt that the sets were suitably eerie, the costumes beautiful, the acting better than average, and the plot of the film, when it was finally made clear at the denouement, quite acceptable. In fact, I feel that had the script been tweaked just a little, making one side somewhat more unfairly devious and even a little more powerful, that as a viewer I might have enjoyed an effective horror film, rather than a run of the mill action thriller, with vampires and werewolves in place of van Damme or Stallone.I can still recall, and relish, the rather ancient horror thriller of Frankenstein meets the Wolfman as managing to effectively coordinate fear, horror, and a pretty good fight scene without sacrificing the basic intent of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Another vampire movie but  with some independent thought,"High budget, good acting and entertaining.It keeps you interested and tells a good story at the same time.Vampire movies are coming out daily but this one was written to actually be independent.The right amount of gore and special effects coupled with a interesting story make for a good 2 hour viewing experience.It has sex appeal without trying to just show skin and the story is just over the edge for those wanting realism.All in all even a critic shouldn't have problems owning it or spending the $5 to rent it.It will be interesting to see if the sequel will live of to the original, I don't see it but one can hope.Thanks for your time, good viewing",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Disappointed, not unusual for movies like this","Once again I find myself disappointed with a vampire movie, there was potential here but I think it was squandered and what was produced was mediocre at best. The plot was confusing for the most part, it prompted me more than once to say, ""OK, that's nice but why the hell does this matter""I am also disappointed by the serious lack of writing/directing/acting talent in this movie. The dialouge is not capturing or memorable, nothing stands out from this silly plotline flecking with gratuitous firefights. If making a good horror film is as simple as using a dark filter on your camera to mute the colors and dressing bad actors in black, this would be a hit.The lead actress did what she could with what was written for her, but there are failed attempts to establish depth in the character, these are writer's faults. However acting was not a talent requisite for ""Kraven"" or any of the ""Lycans."" The pathetic accents and horrid vocal patterns nearly made my ears bleed.

A nice mix of old and new styles,"In recent years there has been a boom of comic book and fantasy movies and to be honest, only a few of them was really worth my attention. On the other hand I must say that I like (good) vampire movies, so that's why I gave ""Underworld"" a try, even though I have to admit that I didn't expect too much about it.This movie is more than a vampire movie, because the creators have added another mythical creature to the story: the Werewolf. The Vampires and the Lycan (that's the name of the werewolves) are in a war that has been going on for centuries, but that has never been seen by humans. Until now, because the Lycans have found a human that can bond with vampire blood and Lycans blood at the same time and they want to use him as a secret weapon to exterminate the vampires. Selene, a beautiful vampire warrior, uncovers the plot that could prove fatal for her entire race and shadows Michael, the Lycan's supposed human target. She falls in love with him, but doesn't know that he was infected by the Lycans and therefor means a thread to her and the entire convent...What I liked most about this movie was its mix of old and new. This movie has a very Gothic setting (even though some parts of the city are modern) and the vampires still look like ancient aristocrats, but they use advanced weapons and even drive fancy sports cars. Normally I wouldn't really like the mix of those styles, but this time it did work pretty well.Of course this movie is full of action scenes, but there has also been enough attention for details like clothing and make-up and decors. The acting was OK and the story looked a bit as if it was influenced by ""The Matrix"", which isn't a bad thing. All in all this is a decent modern vampire movie that will be loved most by the fans, but that is certainly worth a watch, even when you don't like the genre all that much. I give this movie a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Horror Classic! - 10 (classic),"Ah yes, the sons of the Corbinus clan, one bitten by bat, one by wolf, one to walk the lonely coil of mortality it's a ridiculous legend. Nothing more.UNDERWORLD was a huge surprise for me. I had supposed that it would follow the paw prints of American Werewolf in Paris and would disappear into the forests of cinema shame, but not in the slightest. This movie was my introduction to a new kind of horror movie, one suited for the post-apocalyptic vigilante in all of us. No doubt it was influenced by movies like Matrix and Vertigo and will likewise influence future horror productions in the vain of Van Helsing, Blade 2, ad infinitum.Concept, concept, concept is the name of the game when you dabble with blood, and dabble it does. UNDERWORLD is a modern day story about the genetic war between werewolves and vampires. It doesn't get cooler than this. To the story add mixed blood lines, lots of bullets, and the slightest dash of history, and I believe you me have an instant classic on your bloodstained hands.Let's imagine, if you had to shoot a werewolf-changing scene, how would you do it?Suffice it to say, all of the monster scenes in UNDERWORLD are masterfully and meticulously done so as not to offend anyone. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you can stop reading this piddly review and head to the video store this afternoon before dusk to see what I mean.My last comment about UNDERWORLD will be a big hail to the UK, whose actors appear in cunning disguise throughout the movie like an underground model UN. Sure, there is a German guy who dies and bleeds all over the place midway through the film, but we never know whether he's a werewolf, a vampire, or what. If we want to pursue that controversial issue we have no choice but to buy a ticket to the sequel, or prequel, and see what happens when the full moon emerges.JY",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Stylish, too many references","Liked the movie because of its plot (and you also know that another Underworld is coming up). Scenery and customs are stylish, vampires are really convincing to me, especially Nighy is very good. He gives the movie a kind of ""reality"". But the downside of the movie is the many references to other movies. You can grab them when you see the movie: Matrix (customs, scenery, locations), Lord of the Rings (flashbacks), Hellraiser, The Howling, ... Unique to me are the elderly vampires and how they are conserved...At moments I loved the suspense, it never bored me, but afterwards I have to lower my vote ratings to 7. Maybe Underworld Two will be somewhat more special. But I'm afraid it will not reach this quality. Overall a good horrormovie, one of the best I've seen in years.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fall is here:  Die summer blockbuster die.,"Finally, good films grace screens again.  Happily, Underworld qualifies as a good film.First and foremost, this movie has the look.  It's dark.  It has tons of black leather.  Most importantly, it has Kate Beckinsale in the role of Selene, our protagonist.  Kate definitely fits the look of this film.Yes, the Matrix comparisons are justified.  The film definitely has a Matrix-esque quality about it.  There were even a couple of scenes that looked and sounded like they were cut right from The Matrix (the stairwell scene and the zoom through the security monitor).  But no, this isn't really a problem.Criticisms:  The love angle comes out of nowhere and, for that reason, doesn't seem believable.  There are a few scenes that drag a bit.  Mind you, not too badly.  This is no Hulk!On the whole I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  Lots of action, eye candy, and a plot that caught me off guard on more than one occasion.  Not worth full-price, but then nothing is worth that.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You must be Judged!,"This is a class A lycan vs vampire film. It has good special effects and a good story line and characters you love and hate.The main characters are Selene (Vampire Death Dealer ) and Micheal ( Half breed between the 2 species.Selene is like a daughter to the main Vampire leader VIKTOR. He's full of attitude and all others respect him. I was disappointed when they killed him off after his fight with Micheal and Selene.The storyline was okay in places but they should'nt of killed all the council members, so they could arrive at the mansion and judge Selene for awaking viktor and seeing Kraven judged for his alliance with Lucian ( Head of the Lycan Clan).I'm looking forward to the 2nd movie in the series, i've read thats its going to be a prequel, so Viktor will be in it, but really in my opinion they should have let him live.Great music and costumes and fight scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun but quite long,Came out 1 year after the not so based on the source material Resident Evil but make back the budget and make Milla Jovovich a household name in the action horror genre in 2003 Hollywood once again repeat the success with Underworld when they tackle some good old gothic monster like Vampire and they longtime rival Werewolf by give them gun in the modern world and this time the new femme fatale is Kate Beckinsale in the role of Selene a super badass vampire in tight bodysuit who also the reason why the series famous in the first place.People always say the first is the best but with Underworld it the other way around when there a pair amount of bloody action to be entertained but all the mumbo jumbo about past events that serve an important role to the plot bored me to death.I never watch the Resident Evil series or any other cheesy series for the story cause most of the time they all very dumb and forgettable so to see a movie that should be mindless fun like Underworld take itself way too seriously is just sad.The sequels later on is much more enjoyable when the runtime is short and the action is more over the top but that just my opinion,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An innovative, entertaining mixture of styles","I'll be completely honest - vampires in tight latex suits fighting werewolves is not my idea of Citizen Kane. But Wiseman's Underworld (2003) is such a pleasant surprise on every level. Sure, it is not the most original action/horror out there, but I believe it does innovative things in mixing old-school vampire flicks with new stylized Matrix effects. The novelty of this fresh mixture is so entertaining in this film and better yet, it is seen through a grey-bluish film noir tone, bathing Underworld in a dark atmosphere.The story is completely solid and while there is a lot to keep track of - twists, characters, names, history, it never strays from its template plot, which is the politics and action of the raging vampire-lycan war that Selene (Kate Beckinsale) fights. Onto Beckinsale then, she is absolutely abominably atrocious in her role. Her acting spectrum is frightening narrow, giving us one facial expression that she recycles for every emotion (and the emotions are sparse). Please.Stop.Acting.Aside from Beckinsale, nothing really needs to be said about the performances of the rest of the cast because it is not what is in focus in Underworld. It isn't character-driven - it's action and visually driven. The villains are all nuanced, colourful and charismatic and that is what matters (that, and Shane Brolly is sexy as hell). The ending may seem somewhat anti-climactic, but now we know why - Mr. Kate Beckinsale already had a sequel in mind, making the ending of this film only assured on his part, paving the way for 'Evolution (2005).That film happens be incredibly disappointing, but that's another story and Underworld is surprisingly good. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining but nothing remarkable,"Lets face it , whats is there not to like about Kate Beckinsale running around in a leather catsuit? OK it might not be everyone's things but Underworld . in its own right is a pretty enjoyable vampire / Werewolf action flick. The first in a sequence of films , that look extremely good and has so much extreme sound it bombards your eardrums. I'm a big fan of Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen and they are both good value for money as Lycan and Vampire respectively. It reminded me a little of the Blade films but maybe not quite a good. My advise would be to not watch the extended version as i did because 2 hours 10 minutes is a little too long to take.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Movie,"Besides for this being Len Wiseman's first film, it was terrific. Don't get me wrong Len Wiseman is a great man and his production team did an amazing job with the effects.If you need a better idea of what it took to make this movie, look at the special features because it brings to light a lot of little things, like the lycans' hair was was put into the costume one by one.I would recommend watching, if you haven't watched it already, the Undrated Extended Cut Edition of Underworld. Listen to the commentary by Len, Kate, and Scott if you haven't either because it tells a little more about the scenes and what was edited and what wasn't for what reasons.I seems this movie took a lot of work and in my opinion, i paid off big time. If you haven't watched this movie, i would strongly recommend watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Underworld (8/10),"Great fantasy/horror films are hard to come by and one of the great ones that comes to mind is Underworld. The introduction of Kate Beckinsale explaining the war between vampires and lycans (werewolves) was a tremendous start and hooks the viewer right off the bat. Len Wiseman really put his heart into this story, the craft is just exceptional. Kate Beckinsale was a great choice to play Seline, the lead vampire and main character. However, it was Bill Nighly that really flourished in the film playing the stern ruthless head vampire, Viktor. Great action sequences are prevalent throughout and even though it doesn't hold up today like it did in the early 2000's, it's still a great film. If you haven't seen Underworld you have really missed out on a great action, fantasy, horror flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Like watching The Matrix with vamps and werewolves,"While certainly not the best or the worst of its type, Underworld borrows a great deal from a number of other recent sci-fi and horror flicks -- costumes and action sequences from The Matrix, scenery and set design from Batman, and the not-so-original story pieced together from any number of romantically-influenced action/drama films (think Baz Luhrman's version of Romeo and Juliet after you substitute vampires and werewolves for most of the otherwise human cast).On the other hand, production qualities are very good, and the reasonably talented and mostly believable cast is not entirely unknown.  Besides, watching the very attractive Kate Beckinsale parade around in a series of leather and latex outfits is not a terrible way to spend an evening.Traditionalists may be offended that the writers have taken certain liberties with the usual vampire and werewolf ""rules"" (at least direct sunlight still fries the vamps), but I believe most supernatural monster fans (including myself) can just let these things slide, and enjoy the movie for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
GET BENT Hollywood! THE British DO IT BETTER MAN!,THIS FILM WAS GOOD! Not as good as the sequel! BUT GOOD! Some critics just don't know a good action/horror/fantasy/sci-fi kind of film even if it was punching him/her in the face really hard a number of times!!!Kate Beckinsale is awesome. Billy Nighy is great. The plot is original. It needed more depth and storyline but that was okay... it improved upon that with the awesome sequel Underworld: Evolution. I can't wait for the third one.. I really do hope it doesn't suck. If it sucks I'll throw out everything that I own which had something to do with Underworld out of disgrace for the franchise. I hope that doesn't happen. I really do hope it doesn't come to such a thing as that! HOPE!,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
8/10 - Good action/story mix,"I think this movie is worth watching it, especially if you are an action fan. After the trailer I wasn't too sure about its quality because this black/blue style seemed quite boring to me. But in fact it perfectly supported the atmosphere. The best feature of this movie is the balance between action and story. There are good action scenes (although the fights were a bit short) and the story has some interesting turns. Matrix Reloaded concentrated too much on dialogues and philosophical crap. On the other hand, ""Swat"" was a pure action movie and the sole purpose of the story line was to connect the action scenes. In my opinion, ""Underworld"" found an almost perfect balance between those extremes. I missed a bit some special abilities of the vampires, but this is only a minor complaint",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Boring,"I've just watched this film and found it dull, boring and dreary and thats with vamires and werewolfs fighting each other! Seriously, if you were turned into a vampire or a werewolf would you really like to spend the rest of eternity with either side? Other then running around with guns in pvc bodysuits what else is there? Both sides are miserable and dull to watch. And wheres the werewolf pvc clad babe? Actually were are the werewolf babes pvc clad or otherwise? Both sides seem to lack the things that make them vampire or werewolf, like vampires reflecting in mirrors and passing out from loss of blood from stab wounds. Werewolfs however are able to run around like spiders on walls and ceilings and manage in werewolf form not to look like wolfs in the slightest. And being a werewolf wouldn't you try taking on the vamps in the daytime? In my opinion i'd say this film was just another three oclock in the morning last minute idea ""hey lets put vampires against werewolfs, we'll make lots of cash from this"" decision. As for the plot... oh wait was there one? Something to do with a medic bitten by a werewolf who catches the eye of a vampire who tries to help? que? i'm not going to watch it a second time to fully understand whats going on. In my opinion just a matrix wannabe. By the way Bill Nighy should of made a better vampire.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
fantastic,"I wish this show had done better at the box office. I thought it was wonderfully creative, well directed and acted. Lighting, sounds, all of it, fantastic. I'm glad to hear there is another coming soon! The relationships between the main characters were emotionally charged. I love the idea of the two species being brought together. I cannot wait to see what happens with Marcus! As Lucian was seen injecting himself (with Michael's blood) just before he was shot full of liquid silver nitrate, I certainly hope that he continues on in the next film. I loved his character, very passionate! Kate was perfect for the role of Selene. I would love to see a knarly love scene between Selene and Michael as they are in the throws of passion, and their vampyre/lycan ""sides."" I'd like to see more feeding, as well, perhaps see how someone is ""turned"" and why it is so difficult.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"good movie, sticks to the point","An excellent action flick, this movie gets right to the point and stays there all the way thru, there is no cheesy love story, in fact my ""gripe"" about the movie is that there never is any real feel between the two characters who are supposed to be ""in love"". Any thread of emotion is lost in the non-stop action.This movie wouldn't win any awards, but it's fast paced, it's entertaining and it has a very pretty woman in tight fitting vinyl, you can't ask for much more in an action movie. All the effects are top notch with very few unbelievable scenes, and most of them are quite in keeping with the laws of physics (except a few trip-ups) which is quite pleasing.Perfect for a boring evening when there is nothing else to do, or when you get that vinyl craving.7.5 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than I expected,"Whenever I watch movies of this sort, I'm always afraid that I'm going to watch a special effects extravaganza that's all style and no substance.  I honestly feel that a great film can be made without flashy f/x, but as long as the whole feature is not merely a showcase for those f/x, I don't have a problem.  That was the case with ""Underworld.""  Along with the fast-paced action sequences is a well-written story that develops nicely throughout the course of the film.  It is an original spin on the age-old vampire tale.  As one of the co-writers pointed out in an interview, the film is based more on science than folklore.  Therefore, don't expect your usual wooden crosses and stakes through the heart.  The director's intention was to create an action film, only featuring vampires and werewolves (referred to as Lycans). Personally, I still think it falls into the horror genre, but it doesn't follow too many of the cliches of its genre.  The story is hard-to-follow at times, but that's part of what I liked.  I like when a movie challenges me to pay attention and use my brain, rather than insult my intelligence.  So those who are expecting wall-to-wall action, blood and gore might be disappointed.  I think the film's rich storyline is what made it a success. I was impressed to find out it was made for a little over 20 million.  As the director pointed out in the DVD commentary, the budget for this movie is half of what is costed to make the chase sequence in ""Matrix Reloaded.""  So I can't classify this as high-budget trash, because there wasn't even a high budget.  But it's not low-budget trash either.  It's funny how I just read a review complaining about the film's cheesy ""CGI effects.""  There was hardly any CGI!  Most of the effects are practical, which is refreshing in a day and age where directors seem to live and die by CGI (hey, it rhymes!).  Kate Beckinsale makes a great heroine, and brings a nice element of class to the film.  Plus, seeing her roam around in a tight rubber suit didn't cause any complaints on my part.  Boy, is she beautiful!  And for the ladies, there's Scott Speedman who brings a nice vulnerability to his role.  It's a lot more impressive than his flat performance in ""Dark Blue.""  I loved the whole look of the film.  It almost appears film-noirish.  If you want to see a horror movie that delivers and isn't full of cliches, you'll be in for a treat.

Underworld!,"Underworld is an action packed horror movie! I think Kate Beckinsale was great in the film! I really liked her look! Seeing a woman with black pants, black shirt, and a long black jacket that can handle guns and fight with ease is truly an amazing thing to watch! Bill Nighy played Viktor very well! He was fixed up neat with all kinds make up! Kevin Grevioux, who has been in many other films but most recognized in the 2001 version of the Planet of Apes was very good in Underworld! The music is very good in the film and matches its dark nature! The film has a very dark nature and I like the story where Vampires and Lycanthropes fight each other! The special effects look good especially the scene with the moon! Underworld is a decent horror film that takes the two legends of Vampires and Werewolves to a different stage.  If you like Kate Beckinsale, these two different factions of monsters, horror, and action then I recommend you see Underworld!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An original Vampire/Werewolf movie that does not dissapoint.,"Yes this movie is very unique, and there is no movie like it. It is set in a beautiful, dark and gothic world, with well detailed sets, and even though it takes certain elements from the Matrix, and Blade, it is unique in its own way. First off, the budget was only 30 million. After watching the film, you would think its more like 80 million. The costumes, sets, great stuntwork, wirework, its all here. I also was very impressed by the acting here, especially the beautiful Kate Beckinsale, I hope she is Hollywood's next 20 million dollar actress, she is so talented. I also would like to mention that there is no CGI !! very little Cgi is used in this film. I thought the werewolfs looked great, If your a fan of Aliens, and Pumpkinhead, then take a look at the werewolves in this film. The vampires in the movie appeared to be very weak, and do not follow their legend at all in that they do have reflections, and do grow older in appearance. But hey every vampire movie has its own mythology. I hope They make a sequel to this film, the end shows you that they might make one afterall. I think if they boost the budget a little, a new masterpeice will be born. *** 3 stars out of 4.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I thought it was quite a nice and intriguing flick. This movie basically talks about the war between Lycans (werewolf things) and vampires (blood-sucking horrors). A beautiful vampire (Beckinsale)meets a werewolf (Scott Speedman) who holds some kind of key to the end of the war and together, they battle the evil Lucian (Michael Sheen).

Wesley Snipes watch your back...,"A fun popcorn movie, by keeping your expectations in perspective, you can look forward to the sequel and purported prequel. The story line has great potential but the director seems content to revisit action sequences seen in the matrix, highlander, and blade, etc.  Kate Beckinsale's Selene gives Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity a run for her money in the black latex department and essentially saves the movie despite its somewhat abrupt ending. Great foley effects keep you in the middle of the action and the the blue grey tones maintain the 'underworld' environment that the characters thrive on.

Saw Premiere at Toronto International Film Festival,"I was looking forward to seeing this film from what I saw in the preview. After spending a long day seeing films I attended the midnight screening of Underworld.When the film ended the vibe I got from the theater was of utter disappointment.  The film was mainly a dialog based film with as little action that was all seen in the trailers of the film.  I sat their watching bad acting with plotlines and characters I didn't care for.  Now I'm a big fan of all types of films, and I really enjoy ""B"" rated films as well. This film doesn't fall into that category because it tried to take itself so seriously that you don't even care about whats going on.  The director went on stage to do a Question and Answer and I just wanted to say something negative, but thought it would be too rude.  Spending the rest of the week watching films, everybody talked about how they hated Underworld.  The main reason I'm writing this review is I just saw the director talking on SPACE CHANNEL saying how much everybody enjoyed the film at the TIFF and how they just signed a contract to make a sequel.Please don't waste your money to see this film.

Is that her nude in Uncovered or is it a body double? Only the cameraman knows for sure. But that is off topic. This is about Underworld. But, maybe it is on topic, since I would not have watched had I not wanted to see her. She was hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! All covered up and I couldn't take my eyes off her.What was the movie about?

Suprising Enjoyable,I liked this series as a little kid but I always had the impression that these movies weren't very good as my parents refused to rent the later movies saying that they sucked. While all of the technical aspects of the film are kinda just alright (unless your really into the goth aesthetic there isn't much here) I was very surprised at how much effort went into the story itself. It was genius or anything but the lore was just fleshed out enough to be intriguing and a few twists really helped out the plot a lot. Overall the movie isn't inspiring or anything but if you like vampires or werewolf or British black people then this movie is worth seeing at least once.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Vampires Versus Lycans,"Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a beautiful warrior, is entrenched in a war between the vampire and werewolf races. Although she is aligned with the vampires, she falls in love with Michael, a human who is sought by werewolves for unknown reasons.What so you get if you create a world of sleek vampires, make them angry at a world of werewolves, infuse some ""Matrix"" mojo, and add a blue-grey lens to the camera? You might think ""Twilight"" or ""True Blood"" or something else, and you'd be right. Add a butt-load of guns, and you would have ""Underworld"".Is this Kate Beckinsale's breakout role? I mean, I know she did some BBC films or something classy, but if you live in my bubble (the genre film bubble), this is what you most associate her with, sort of like Milla Jovovich in ""Resident Evil"".

The most awesome spectacular film in the series to be ever created!!!!,"Underworld (2003) is one of the most awesome excellent action horror films about Vampires and werewolves. It is the first entry in this fantasy-action franchise. It has Action, twists, romance and an awesome story tel. This is my second favorite film in the series. The first will be Underworld: Evolution (2006). There are two version of this film: Theatrical and the unrated version (Directors Cut) I prefer The unrated version that really makes this movie a hell of a lot better, story wise and action wise: P you learn so much stuff about everything, and you get a lot more action, plus you actually see in the end that Kraven is a coward, as you see him trying to find an exit everywhere.I was blown away by the action sequences and the overall story behind the warring factions. Lots of gratuitous violence and sexy ladies in black latex in leather doesn't hurt either. I love everything about this movie, the darkness, the action and the story. Plus Kate Beckinsale is not too bad to look at.Kate fits in this movie like a glove, she did an excellent job and She kicked ass! COMPLETE AWESOME mix of romance action and adventure!!!!!!! I LOVE it. I love all the twist and turns between the Vamps and the Werewolves. There hasn't been a story like this so it was nice to see something different. It was truly an awesome movie! One of my favorite vampire movies!!!! This is one of my all time favorite action vampire flicks. I love this genre and this story is fabulous. love the acting done by Beckinsale and Speedman, the history between werewolves and vampires is told very well!This is a great adaptation on the Gothic story of vampires with a great introduction to another fantasy race, the lycan. I love how the lycan have elements of werewolves with a close tie to the vampires. The action overall is intense from start to finish. What else can I say about Underworld that was already told? I love Kate Beckinsale as Seline (the Beautiful,sexy, tasty Kate Beckinsale)in her sweet & sexy supple, full-body-suit clad vampire Death Dealer. Scott Speedman as Michael Corvin a medical student who becomes a hybrid. Here is also Wentworth Miller as Adam Lockwood, a colleague of Michael's from Prison Break (2005) TV Series my awesome TV Show. Viktor: (Bill Nighy) he was made for this part, just an awesome performance by a great actor. Lucien (Michael Sheen) excellent performance by him, excellent character. Sophia Myles as Erika, Kraven's trusted ally and love interest portrayed perfectly she was like the only girl who was a vampire and noticed in this film, she acted her role as a real talent! Len Wiseman did a beautiful job writing a story and directing this film. He directed also Live Free or Die Hard (2007) my third best favorite Die Hard film. It is very imaginative and brilliant! The film is also violent, and somewhat bloody. But still entertains, it is fast paced film. I have a lot of funny with it.I love all the characters in here, the finale in the first Underworld is quite well done, in my opinion. The end of the film was brilliant, it did end with a cliffhanger but that makes you guessing more what will happened next. What will be in the sequel.In the Underworld, Vampires are a secret clan of modern aristocratic sophisticates whose mortal enemies are the Lycans (werewolves), a shrewd gang of street thugs who prowl the city's underbelly. No one knows the origin of their bitter blood feud, but the balance of power between them turns even bloodier when a beautiful young Vampire warrior and a newly-turned Lycan with a mysterious past fall in love. Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman star in this modern-day, action-packed tale of ruthless intrigue and forbidden passion ¬≠ all set against the dazzling backdrop of a timeless, Gothic metropolis.Underworld is a 2003 action horror film directed by Len Wiseman about the secret history of Vampires and Lycans (an abbreviated form of lycanthrope).Underworld (2003) and Underworld: Evolution (2006) are my favorite films I just love both of them to death!10/10 Grade: A Studio: Screen Gems, Lakeshore Entertainment Starring: Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly, Erwin Leder, Bill Nighy Director: Len Wiseman Producers: Tom Rosenberg, Gary Lucchesi, Richard Wright Screenplay: Danny McBride Story: Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman, Danny McBride Rated: R Running Time: 2 Hrs. 13 Mins.

An Enjoyable Action Film,"For many centuries the vampires and werewolves (lycans) have been at war. The powerful werewolf leader, Lucian (played by Michael Sheen), is believed to be dead and the vampires conclude that the war has been successfully won. Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a member of the vampire warrior caste known as ""Death Dealers"", suspects otherwise and just happens to observe lycans mysteriously following a human named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman). A gun battle between the lycans and the Death Dealers takes place with casualties sustained by both sides. It is at this time that the vampires discover that the lycans are using special radioactive bullets which can kill them. To even the odds the vampires make bullets containing silver nitrate which can also kill the lycans. Meanwhile, the vampire named Kraven (played by Shane Brolly), has a secret and is planning to betray his coven right before they can institute an important change of leadership ceremony. Anyway, having established the basic foundation of the film I would like to say that it had more depth than I thought it would. The director (Len Wiseman) did a splendid job setting the dark and dreary mood that was just right for this particular movie. Kate Beckinsale looked awesome and played her part very well. I also thought Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly and Bill Nighy (playing the vampire ""Viktor"") also turned in good performances. On the flip side though, I didn't especially care for the effort by Scott Speedman who seemed out of his league in comparison to others around him. The special effects were plentiful and if you like CGI then you will probably appreciate this film. In closing, this was an enjoyable action film and I recommend it to anybody who likes this type of movie in general or Kate Beckinsale in particular.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kate Beckinsole was Hot,"Enjoyed this horror film because it had two famous horror creatures fighting against each other and trying to out smart each other with weapons and wits. The Vampire Colony is being threatened by the Lycan gang of Werewolves and the Vampire's are being led by the red hot looking Kat Beckinsole (Selene) who is really a rebel among her group and breaks all the rules of her blood sucking family. Selene even gets interested in a werewolf and decides not to bite his neck but does a good job of french kissing him to death. There is plenty of bullets flying all around and Selene manages to upset quite a few big brothers and werewolves and puts a ring right through their very noses. Enjoyable film and very entertaining if you like this kind of picture, which is must better than the old Vampire Films.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
How do I dislike this movie?,"Let me count the ways -- 1. Lousy script with moments of chit-chat meant only to string together ludicrous action bits.2. Stupid dialogue that makes all the characters sound like 12 year old brats trying to sound butch.3. So much one-note acting I felt like I was watching a Philip Glass rendition of ""Dracula Meets the Wolfman"" with ""Waiting for Godot"" nothingness behind it.4. Uncool sets. SERIOUSLY uncool.5. Even uncooler costumes (which actually looked really uncomfortable).And I could go on and on about the clunky editing and second-rate music and nothing directing...but you get my drift. I wish I could find something nice to say about it...I mean, I like Kate Beckinsale, really I do...but better to put a stake in it and let it just wither away. Such a sad waste of resources.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Vampire history of ""Underworld""","The first immortals were Caine and Lilith, Caine was the frist Vampire, Lilith was the first Werewolf as per legend. Before they Separated Lilith and Caine had an unspecified number of Children together that carried the strains of Vampire and Werewolf. One of them was Alexander Corvinus, born during the Roman occupation of Hungary. He was made king of the Hungarians in the late 400's, and chose his seat as the city of Pest. Sometime later the city of Pest was attacked by an unknown vampire. His unique ancestry had the unforseen consequence of making Corvinus an Immortal. After the withdrawl of the Romans several vampires remained, as Lycans moved in from the countryside. Within a century open war started between the Lycans and Vampires, with the Lycans subjugated by 1200. In 1300 the Lycan Lucien was made, and entered into the service of the Vampire Viktor. In 1403 Lucien managed to impregnate the Vampire Daughter of Viktor. In accordance with the laws of the Coven, Viktor's Daughter was killed. Lucien then rebelled against Viktor and started a 600 year war. In the year 1463 the immortal Alexander Corvinus, now known as Matthias Corvinus returned to Hungary after living for centuries in Bohemia and Romania and was crowned King of Hungary. Over his lifetime Alexander Corvinus only prduced three Sons, one became a Lycan, another became Vampire, and a third, illegitimate son, Johann remained mortal. Alexander Corvinus entered slumber in 1490 and has not awakened to anyone's knowledge since then",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Better than I expected, but considering how low my expectations were...","Back when I first saw the trailers for this film, I immediately thought; ""Oh. Another cheap rip-off of The Matrix... and it seems like they stuck some Blade and The Crow in there, too, for good measure."" I was fairly surprised when I saw it, but it didn't really show me something that fascinated me, like The Matrix and its sequels did. The action in it is reasonably good, but several of the scenes were confusingly filmed; you couldn't really keep track of where the different characters are at any point, except for when they're on screen together. The action also almost only consists of shooting guns, which really doesn't get a lot of results in the film; I found it to be far more exciting in the rare situations where the Lycans were transformed and fighting the Vampires. The very last fight scene in the film was also great, very intense and unpredictable. The special effects in the film are very well-made, both the CGI and in general the creature effects look very good. The film somehow seemed to focus more on the plot than the action or the effects, which is a pretty big mistake with a film like this; first of all, it's a film made in a time where this sort of film is made to be bigger and better than the last, which mainly refers to action and/or special effects, second, the story isn't that great nor very original. I think they overrated how good the story is, not to mention all the unexplained new things they introduce to the concepts of Vampires and Lycans. I do think the story was fairly interesting, and it is somewhat original(I guess). I think one of the things that annoyed me the most was that a lot of the time, I wasn't entirely sure who were the Lycans and who were the Vampires, since they basically look the same, in their human form. The plot is OK, reasonably original, but the film makes a mistake in making it so plot driven instead of focusing on at least a little more action. The acting is mostly decent, no fantastic performances, but what can you expect from a movie like this. The characters are hard to comment on, since just about everyone apart from the two main characters either are jerks from the beginning, or turn out to be jerks somewhere in the film. The cinematography is nothing special, at times it's even very bad. I have to congratulate the crew on what a good job they did on the creature effects; just before writing this review, I found out that nearly no CGI effects were used at all. That's very impressive, considering how good the creatures look. Great job on that. All in all, the film does look like a rip-off, but only on the outside. On closer inspection, the film does have a few original thoughts in it. I recommend it to fans of dark, gothic films, containing some action and special effects, with a decent plot. Don't expect to see loads of great action sequences, or huge effect-filled scenes. Don't expect a great plot. Actually, about the action, if you've seen the trailer, maybe you shouldn't even bother seeing the film, because most of the good action sequences are shown there anyway. Only watch this if you *really* love this type of films. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Criticism ... but not of the film itself,"I must admit that I was prepared to see just one more vampire and/or werewolf film filled with wanton blood and gore.  Instead, I was left in both awe and circumspection.The filmgoer has become so used to the ""2-hour-format"" (give or take a few minutes) that films which don't please them within that format are panned. But, this film like others (ie., 1984's ""Dune"") appeared to be better suited to a 4-hour or longer format ... spread over 2 separate films, perhaps.  In short, attributing weaknesses of this film to acting or writing might be unfair.  To me, the weaknesses seem more attributed to editing or perhaps budget constraints put upon the production company.This film would have had all the earmarks of epic quality had it been filmed as an epic.  But epics are rarely crammed into a 2-hour timeslot with success.  The acting by largely unknown actors was riveting and allowed me to suspend disbelief entirely.  The camera work was breathtaking.  And the choreography of battle scenes was on par with or better than that found in ""The Matrix"" trilogy.I gave this film a 10-out-of-10 rating on effort alone, despite my reservations over the rushed nature of the storyline which detracted from a filmgoer's ability to appreciate it more fully.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A movie you can really sink your teeth into!,"Skin-tight PVC suits and long leather coats are back in fashion in this stylish, gory and action-packed vampire vs werewolf horror flick starring Kate Beckinsale, Bill Nighy and Scott Speedman.Perched upon the roof of a gothic-looking building in an unnamed city, Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire ""death dealer"" who hunts lycans (that's werewolves to you and me) in an age-old feud between the two species which has been raging for hundreds of years. The film moves quickly into top gear, and within minutes of being provided with this information from a rather helpful voiceover, the action immediately takes off in an extended sub-way shootout involving Beckinsale, werewolves and a hapless human called Michael in the form of Speedman.In between much muttering concerning covenants, covens and ""awakenings"", we slowly learn that Speedman is the descendant of some common ancestor between vampires and werewolves, and that his blood is the key to uniting the bloodline and ending the bitter feud between the two species. What follows is an endless series of gun battles and an orgy of mindless violence in some very dark places, as the two warring factions battle to gain control of Speedman and his precious blood. But as the body count begins to rise don't expect to see many wooden stakes and silver bullets in this modern day horror flick. We've moved on since the days of Hammer Horror stars Cushing and Lee, and bullets filled with liquid ultraviolet light and silver nitrate are conveniently provided by director Len Wiseman to dispatch the hordes of vampire and werewolf cannon fodder required for the many bloody action sequences. Well, it's more efficient or didn't you know that?What you probably did know, but which Wiseman forgot or just plain ignored, is that vampires cast no reflection, and yet there are several scenes where they clearly do so. Maybe it was a gaffe. Or maybe Wiseman just didn't care. Quite frankly you won't care either, as the near relentless action makes the 121 minute running time simply fly by, and is more than sufficient to compensate for this minor deviation from vampire lore, and the other obvious imperfections in the film.Plotwise, there's also a tepid, and entirely predictable romance between Speedman and Beckinsale, which seems strangely out of place amongst the unrelenting carnage and testosterone-charged atmosphere of the largely male supporting cast. However, given the uncharismatic performances of the two stars, mercifully this is not pursued. The non-stop action effectively puts paid to any real suspense, but there are sufficient twists and turns in the plot to maintain interest right up to the end, and the final good vs evil showdown between Speedman and the vampire leader, Viktor (Bill Nighy).Thankfully for a horror flick the special effects are well up to par, and the bone-crunching werewolf transformation sequences compare favourably to those seen in An American Werewolf in London. For added good measure we also get to see inside a body during the werewolf transformation - an interesting, yet revolting novelty, all the more so for the rather disgusting, stomach-churning noises which accompany this process.Beckinsale (perhaps best known for her work in Pearl Harbor) wears her skin-tight suit well enough, but on joining the ranks of the undead seems to have forgotten how to act, and gives a performance so wooden that you could make a dining table and chairs out of it and still have plenty of timber to spare. If she wants to make the Hollywood A list this is not the way to do it. Speedman is hugely disappointing and not at all convincing in a rather meaty role which gave him a great opportunity to really shine. He clearly lacks the screen presence to take the male lead, and on this performance seems destined to remain as a Hollywood also-ran for some time to come.On the plus side Shane Brolly hams it up nicely as the traitorous, vampire big-whig Kraven, while Beckinsale's former off-screen boyfriend Michael Sheen enthusiastically gives his all as Lucian, the wild-eyed, messianic leader of the werewolves. Nighy, looking like a shrivelled prune, rasps and wheezes his way through his lines but, given the weight of makeup he was obviously wearing, makes a decent job of playing the arch baddie in the film, and he clearly takes the acting honours from a largely undistinguished cast which has a strong Hollywood B list look and feel.Lacking the genuine horror in the vampire movie Near Dark, and with acting as wooden as it gets without sprouting roots, Underworld is nevertheless an entertaining horror flick and well worth a bag of popcorn and a bottle of your favourite fizzy to wash it down with. The teeth are nice, white and very sharp. The female vampires look pretty enough - just like Hollywood likes them, the action is unrelenting and gory, and the werewolf transformation sequences are far better than you might expect from a film with only a $20 million price tag. If this movie sounds like your kind of thing then there is even more good news - a satisfying climatic battle is followed by a closing sequence and narration from Beckinsale which strongly suggests a sequel is already on the drawing board. Silver nitrate suppliers everywhere must be rubbing their hands with glee at the thought of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Their war, invisible to the human eye, lasts for many centuries.

Lower your expectations... considerably,"Underworld is visually impressive: the dark brooding mood of Burton's ""Batman"", the detailed sets, and the very fetching Beckinsale make the movie appetizing to watch. Unfortunately, beyond the eye candy buffet, there is very little else to consider good about the flick.Some specific disappointments:    1. Beckinsale's character Serene is a ""death-dealer"" vampire whose task is to hunt down and kill the Lycans (werewolves). After watching a few shooting scenes, I sincerely felt Serene would have lasted only a couple of days on the job. She can't hit a thing, despite spraying hundreds of rounds at large targets only a few metres away. It's hard to buy into a hero who can hit marble busts in the shooting range, but misses three large bodies in a small hallway.2. The love story is weak at best, or maybe I'm inattentive. With a minimum of dialogue between the two, the relationship between Serene and Michael (Speedman) seems based on looks and looks alone, but apparently a strong and almost unshakable love bond has developed by the end of the movie. I don't mind surprise endings, but the depth of emotion here seemed an afterthought.3. Shane Brolly (who plays Kraven) is pretty brutal. I'm sure he's a nice guy, so I don't want to diss him personally, but every scene he's in is a major distraction from the film. His sneering, spitting delivery is utterly unchanged throughout the movie, to the point where you wonder if he is capable of any other emotion beyond rage or disgust.4. Goofy stuff that just seemed weird: Serene's idiotic driving everywhere and nowhere at breakneck speed (solely for product placement?), the Lycan's apparent refusal to actually use the deadly ammunition they've developed for the vampires, the inherent lack of logic of the war (why didn't the Lycans just kill all the vampires during the day?), and the avoidance of acknowledging that daylight is gone, etc.Maybe I'm being petty, but with a movie that's taking itself this seriously, and with the amount of effort that obviously went into making it look good, I expect some consistency and development to the overall story, too. With a little consideration, it could have been a much, much  better movie.Perhaps the sequel will redeem this one. 5.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Disappointing: Rent but don't Buy,"Vampires vs. Werewolves. What could be better for a fan of either or a fan of both? Unfortunately, this movie does not deliver in what could have been, and should have been, one of the coolest vampire/werewolf movies ever made.The whole movie seemed to meander, even in the action scenes. I think there wasn't enough time dedicated to the screenplay, though it seems like the storyline and backstory had been well thought out. This led to the feeling that a lot was implied but left out.Beckinsale looks great in her catsuit and cape, the sets were simple and stayed in the background, but the special effects left a lot to be desired. The werewolf transformations were terrible, and not much more advanced than those in ""American Werewolf in London."" I think they should have sped it up just a little bit more and that might have passed muster. I think it was silly that the professional vampire ""Death Dealers"" would stand around in the middle of a fight and wait a few seconds for their opponent to transform into a werewolf. It would have been better to have the transformation occur in the middle of combat, allowing the editor to cut a lot and break the special effect up into more believable bits.I recommend that if you are a vampire and/or werewolf fan, go ahead and rent this move, but please don't spend $20 on it, or you will regret it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Reverses the usual 'Hollywood' gender roles, but conforms to its genre in pretty much every other way.","'Underworld (2003)' reverses the usual 'Hollywood' gender roles in a relatively refreshing way, so it's a shame that it also conforms to the tropes of its genre in pretty much every other area, to the point that it's predictable essentially down to the letter and that some of its more extraneous plot elements feel as though they were included out of a false sense of necessity rather than out of a legitimate narrative need. Its tight, black leather aesthetic is very telling of the time in which it was made, a time when such faux 'gothic' stylings were considered 'outsider' and 'cool'. It permeates the entire piece to the point that it all feels fairly dated, though this 'sleek' style is so all-encompassing that it sort of becomes a signifier for the heightened reality of the flick itself - something that can be accepted almost as readily as its vampiric conceits - as opposed to a statement of its actual visual quality. There's enjoyment, albeit 'turn your brain off' and quite silly enjoyment, to be had during some of the action sequences and, even, some of the more high-strung melodrama. It's nothing groundbreaking, but I don't think it was ever trying to be. It's a decently enjoyable film when it's underway. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Hey, the Monsters are Coming!","Eletric, atmospheric and relentless action/terror movie in which two races of inhuman creatures, the Lycans (in fact, the old and well known werewolves monsters) and the Vampires fight against each other, in a perpetual battle for mutual extermination, in a cruel and violent war that have been rolling for many centuries. In this particular vision of the world - a vision that brings to mind some RPG's games - a vampire agent (played by the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale) falls in love with a human (Speedman) just to find out that he is a member of the Lycans tribe. In this point, the movie works out with the old theme of a impossible love story but never misses its bull eye: a good action movie. ""Underworld' is not a classic of the genre.

A few new notes to an old story,"The movie isn't bad, which is also to say it isn't great.  Somewhat better than the average offering in the sub-genre.  Maybe it's that it tries too much to blend the gritty-city sets of the Nicholson-Keaton Batman, with the sexy vampires of the Anne Rice trend, with all the cool gadgetry of the Blade series.  The story does add some nice twists to the usual bland perspectives on the beasties, and it certainly doesn't hurt to have Kate Beckinsale running around in patent leather, butt-hugging pants.  So it's down to goth/s&m vampires versus the lycans (simply because it is too much effort to say ""Lycanthropes"").  I sided with the Werewolves early on, and it was nice to see them lauded for technological inventiveness, even thought they managed to do their fair share of dumb things.  The casting had some shiners and a few stinkers.  The costumes and sets were great.  The script may have *ahem* bitten off too much for a standard movie length.  Worth seeing, but only once.

Worst cinematic experience in a very long time.,"I really think that this movie was made for young, self-centered people with no knowledge of the vampire lore. It made me furious to watch Selene as I saw her as a very narcissistic person who constantly was too aware of her own appearance. It made me feel like I was watching somebody up on the catwalk each time I saw her. The way she jumped, walked, shot with her guns and the way she looked from under her hair. I was so annoyed. Completely without any kind of character. It has been stated that she falls in love with Michael Corvin but that is something we have to deduce from the fact that she kisses him. I didn't see any affection, tenderness or soft spoken words between them. She is just too hollow.So much from the vampire lore was omitted that it felt really weird. What had become of their demonic nature, why didn't they drink blood and, as others have pointed out, how come that they cast a shadow? As we learn, they are still vulnerable to sun-light, but there isn't any during the whole film.Were we supposed to feel any sympathy for either side in the conflict? I didn't at all and basically I think that if you do not engage yourself in the protagonist then the movie has failed seriously. The only thing I was hoping for was, that everybody ended up killing each other.I don't think that I will spoil anything by saying, that there will be a show-down in the end. Let me just say that they should really, really have used a stand-in/stunt-man for poor old Viktor. So in order to make this film a good experience you really have to stop thinking and just drift with it - and this was simply impossible for me.regards SimonPs.

So bad it's spiffy!,"I'm kinda irked by the fact that I paid 10 bucks to see this movie (I'm a destitute undergrad in one of America's most expensive universities), but given that I've never laughed so hard in my life, I think I'll let that slide.Did no one see this movie after it was shot? As in, while it was being edited? The whole thing feels as if it was put together by a man both deaf and blind. The plot is seriously contrived, at times downright confusing, and the acting is deliciously bad. Antonio Banderas in ""Assassins"" bad. Vincent Perez in ""Queen of the Damned"" bad. Hayden Christenssen in anything-he's-ever-done bad. I certainly got Episode II flashbacks watching poor Kate Beckinsale going at it ala Natalie Portman. They should definitely start a support group.And speaking of Attack of the Clones, the artiste who penned Kate and Scott's romance in this movie makes George Lucas sound like Shakespeare (and that's *definitely* saying something). Scott's (or rather the screenwriter's) idea of a come-hither utterance to his beloved sounded like the kind of thing a child would say if it needed a diaper change. 'Course, it's kinda hard to tell who exactly is at fault here: the writer, or Scott Speedman, whose SAG card should be turned into confetti and subsequently burned.The movie does have its moments. The fight sequences were good, and the costumes, sets, and cinematography were hella tight. And this is definitely the kind of movie I would rent, or play a drinking game to (""take one shot if the actors start taking themselves waay too seriously,"" ""take two shots every time Euro-Trash-y villain comes on-screen"").All in all, I had a pretty good time.

Now, if they were to go old school with it and actually use make it might not be that bad.  This movie pits vampires versus the werewolves and sadly we hardly see any vampire type trademarks.  Sure they drink blood from wine glasses (these vamps are of higher class) and some bare their teeth, but there is only on vampire bite in the entire movie.  I truly expected a little more from this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"worth the rental cost, i'd watch it again",decent flick.  definitely entertaining and the plot was solid enough to hold my interest.  best part of the movie is how it looks.  when i saw the preview i thought it looked pretty stupid and corny but i was pleasently suprised.  all the actors fit the roles pretty well and overall it is worth giving at least a once over.  7.5/10,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great movie,"When this movie came out I was one of the first that had to see it, after that I have watched so many times.
Am a total addict when it comes to vampire movies like this one.
It has a great storyline, you can imagine yourself being there as the movie progresses.
My favourite characters are Lucian, Raze and Rigel.
Would have loved to have seen more of Rigel but sadly he was killed off pretty quickly (such a shame).
It has a more modern twist on the war between vampires and lycans (werewolves) with quite a few twists and plots I didn't expect.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Off to a weak start.,"I always enjoyed Underworld as a kid and revisited it many times.Re watching at the moment and I found this one, is still probably the weakest.The acting is quite ordinary and Speedman is poor. It feels very European which I liked, it was filmed in Hungary apparently.Their is zero chemistry between the cast and its all very formulaic but the story is alright, if you watch it with the others as a whole, it's less unliveable.Very dark and blue throughout and liked seeing some well known actors throughout. Worth a watch but not as a stand alone film....The 2000s was a cool era with leather and spandex tights, what a time to be alive.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Decent action film,"Underworld (2003, Dir. Len Wiseman)Hidden away from everyone not involved, a war rages on between a vampire and werewolf race.

Selene falls in love with him and vows to let him live, but when her new love is bitten by a werewolf, Selene must consider the ultimate sacrifice.Decent action film, which delivers a good quantity of horror and action. The story picks up straight away whilst giving the facts along the way.

Vampires take over the world by boring everyone to death.,"I usually love vampire flicks but I couldn't wait for this one to end. There was not one original moment in the entire film, the setting (everything is black and it's constantly pouring rain) is obviously supposed to be suitably gothic but is actually laughably cliched, and the costumes and special effects are straight out of ""The Matrix"".  The gaps in the plot made the story very hard to follow in the early stages, but this may have been a decision made in the cutting room to keep the audience from realising that they'd seen it all before.  At times it was so bad that it was actually funny and at the screening I went to, the supposedly dramatic climax had the entire audience laughing.

A Great Start to a Series that didn't Live Up to it's Potential,"Underworld is a violent, action-packed, vampire vs werewolf thriller... what's not to love? I've enjoyed watching this film multiple times over the years. Even this most recent time, though I saw some weak spots. But I was still entertained throughout.One of these weaknesses is the clich√© of bullets flying all around people and rarely hitting them. Am I supposed to believe that vampire warriors who have been hunting werewolves for centuries can't shoot better than that? But I'm being picky. Considering Underworld was released in 2003, it looks pretty dang cool.I believe Kate Beckinsale was my first favorite female action star, thanks to these Underworld movies. This movie's whole cast is great. They could keep making sequels to this movie, and I'd keep watching them, though unfortunately the first is the best and that will likely never change.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stylish and dark but has pacing issues,"I like the dark, gothic horror aesthetics. This movie looks very stylish and gritty. I really enjoyed the vampire and werewolf lore. Kate Beckinsale was great as the protagonist. She's off course very nice to look at and looks really cool with her black leather. I liked how they evolved their weaponry to fit modern times with guns and silver nitrate bullets but also keep some blades around. The fight scenes were enjoyable. I kinda miss the early 2000s over the top but yet entertaining fights. I especially liked Michael Sheen as Lucian. He is a great actor. His backstory and motivation were good but I wished we get to see more of him and maybe explore his story more. Where this movie falls short is in the pacing. After the opening action sequence, the movie kinda slows down and not much happens. A lot of it felt like a big exposition dump. I also didn't really buy the romance between Selene and Micheal, I felt like it happened too fast and they didn't have as much chemistry.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Gothic tale of the war between vampires and werewolves.,"Rather good and sleek action/horror hybrid in the same vein as a Blade, though not quite up to that movie. The action is good, and the scenery is good to as the city setting seems very other worldly, a Gothic mixture of old and new. The story, there has been an ages old feud between werewolves and vampires, the vampires apparently winning as they are slowly but surely wiping the wolves out. However, there seems to be a new target of the wolves, a young doctor whose blood the wolves want for reasons that are not immediately clear. So there ya have it, throw in a lot of gun fire and some latex and you have your movie. There are problems with the film though as there are a lot of double crosses and I am still not one hundred percent clear as to what made the doctor dude so important. Still, there is plenty of action to watch and lots of blood too. It was funny seeing how the werewolves were a bit rough and the vampires looked like aristocrats. It was a bit hard to pull for either side until the end when all the motivations were on the table too, as neither side seemed really to be making a target of humans. So all in all a good action/horror flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good story but some of the supporting actors did a poor job.,"I really enjoyed the story and the two lead characters were well done if you're just looking for a good ride rather than an Oscar winning performance. Unfortunately several of the supporting cast were very badly overacted. The lead vampire, Victor was truly awful as was the guy running the vampire house. The next movie had the same problem, new head vampire overdone. Pity, those parts grated on me so badly they affected my enjoyment of any scenes they were in.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Plain and SImple -- It Rocks,"I went to this film out of a liking for the ""Blade"" films and a desire to entertain myself with some black-leather eye-candy (AKA ""Beckinsale"") -- expecting VERY little.  With the starting graphics, annoying voice over and Kate Beckinsale's lack of grace as a vampire I was immediately concerned that I was in for a very poorly executed ""me too"" flick.  But by the time the initial 15 minutes got over with I found myself being pulled into a very captivating and beautiful world.  (In fact, the sound was off in the theater, making the dialog sound all hollow and distant, and I was so intrigued by the story I didn't want to go out to complain that I could hardly hear!) Not deep, but then again not nearly as pretentious as most other ""comic gothics"" lately, and that gives it a charm not at all present in other efforts, Clones, Matrices and Blades.  Definitely worth a view.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Underworld,"True, this isn't the most original of concepts and we have oft seen similar styles of treatment of these ancient rivalries, but Kate Beckinsale's lithe and deadly ""Selene"" and Michael Sheen's menacing ""Lucian"" are engaging enough in this tale of vampires v werewolves. Scott Speedman provides the eye candy (but very little else) as the hapless human ""Michael"" whom she rescues only to discover that he might prove a lot more important than either of them realise, and Bill Nighy is superbly over the top as the recently raised from his slumbers ""Viktor"" who really did fancy a (very) long lie in. Clad in leather and scurrying from place to place amidst the darkened environments the breadth of the city, the two must avoid capture and find a way to thwart ambitions that will re-enliven the timeless conflict between the two warring species. The combat scenes are heavily choreographed and do repeat themselves quite often and least said about Shane Brolly's weakly portrayed ""Kraven"" the better, but I did enjoy this.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the coolest and stylish films of the 2000s so far!,"As much as I love vampire and werewolf movies, I had my doubts about seeing UNDERWORLD upon its release in the Fall of 2003. It had a first time director, a writer whose only credit was an episode of ""The Outer Limits"", and Kate Beckinsale in the lead role, who hadn't exactly won me over with her performance in PEARL HARBOR. It certainly seemed like it could end up being a total stinker. To my surprise, I found myself loving UNDERWORLD when I got around to seeing it on DVD. I had been wrong about everything. Director Len Wiseman proved to be an excellent director, bringing a strong visual and kick-ass style to the picture that made it seem like a spin-off of BLADE. Danny McBride's screenplay is smart and extremely interesting. But what I was really wrong about was Kate Beckinsale. Wow! Here she proves not only is she sexy, she can actually act as well! Some of the other performances aren't up to par. Scott Speedman is okay, though didn't seem particularly right for the role he was playing while the less said about Shane Brolly's performance, the better. The other main flaw of the film is that it runs too long. What should have been a fast and exciting 90 to 100 minute seems padded and is dull in spaces. Thankfully, these flaws don't completely ruin UNDERWORLD. It remains one of the coolest and stylish films of the 2000s so far! Hopefully the upcoming sequel will be ever better. 8/10",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great ideas but too cheaply developed.. it looks B-style...,"Before watching the movie on DVD I just bought I was thinking it was the live action of the anime BLOOD. Well, the story is great overall BUT the way the movie is developed is kinda lame, really. There are tons of missing points, they didn't portray characters deeply enough. The first Blade movie had some glitches due to budget constraints as well BUT it gave a generally better feeling to viewers, UNDERWORLD is missing the point here and there, it seems that the director and the production get lost in something bigger than themselves, something that they can't manage properly. CGI effects are not top-notch, they look cheap many times.. and I wonder why it always happens to movies co-produced between many countries, if it was a US only production I bet it would have been much better overall.A sequel would be cool but the director has to be changed, the whole production has to be switched over to someone that can do horror movies better. Sony did a great job with Resident Evil and they should put that production in charge of any possible Underworld sequel.Underworld would be a top-notch movie if properly developed and putting right people on the project might give sequels very high-ratings. This one it's just and average movie with a very good script that hasn't been correctly portrayed on screen, unfortunately.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the Most Interesting Vampire Movies I've Seen,"When I went to the movie theater to go see Underworld, I was expecting it to be a major bomb. But actually, it wasn't. It was actually pretty intriguing and it held my attention during the whole movie. At parts it was a little bit confusing, and I had to ponder something. And also the acting was not really that great. Kate Beckinsale was good ... but that pretty much is about it. But the film was important to me because it's been a couple of months since I saw a movie at the movie theater that was kind of different from the rest. I wouldn't say Underworld is really a horror film at all, but I kind of action film with a little bit of Shakespearian drama going on during it too. It is pretty much a Romeo and Juliet story with a lot of gore and supernatural events. The story is about the never-ending feud between the family of Vampires and the family of Likens - or Werewolves (remind you of something? ... The Montagues and The Capulets.) A liken assassin or as she calls herself a 'death dealer' Selene (Beckinsale) falls in love with a human who has been bit by a liken, Michael (Scott Speedman - Dark Blue). By falling in love they both try to end the long-time feud and try to figure out how far it goes back and why it happened. I recommend the film for anyone looking for a different way to spend the evening. Grade: B- (reveiw retrieved from yahoo.com; written 10/13/03)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
In a word...wow...,"Forget the Matrix Reloaded...if you want a dark, leather trenchcoat clad movie, dripping with coolness from bloody fangs, then Underworld is your movie.  Far too many movies I've seen over the years have promising trailers, but fail to deliver.  This is why I was hoping that this movie would deliver, and I was pleased to find out that it most certainly did.Great performances all around and spectacular special effects (save for a few sub par CGI moments) really makes the story flow nicely.  Speaking of which, yes, this movie actually has a story!  As sad as that may sound about most Hollywood movies of recent times, this movie has a great, engaging story that is coherent as it is interesting.  Quite a change from the confusing plotlines of Matrix Reloaded and other films that have come out this year.  The plot is excellent, and is explained well throughout.  Any times where you may be scratching your head are cleared up usually a scene later, which I cannot say about other movies I have seen recently in the theater that opt to leave holes in the plot that remain unanswered.This movie is a combination of The Matrix, Blade and Romeo and Juliet.  You have two feuding families of vampires and werewolves, whose only purpose is to eradicate the other...and oh yeah, they wear cool, dark outfits and sport state of the art weaponry (I thought the werewolves' bullets that contained sunlight in them was by far the coolest).  You also have the talented and insanely hot Kate Beckinsale as the lead, kicking fierce butt.  Her performance was by far the best of all, and you can feel her character's torment throughout.  Save for one very bad actor, who sadly is a major character in the film, every other performance is excellent, and adds to the gothic darkness that is the setting of this movie.  And of course, the special effects (especially the werewolves) were among the best I've ever seen.The only thing I wanted more from this movie was a little more character development.  Though the actors do an incredible job of making their characters realistic as if popping out of the pages of a graphic novel, the script, unfortunately, did not supply enough background on many on the support characters...but, there is still enough background to give them depth, and to give a damn when one of them gets dispatched.  Also, almost every character does have a secret motive for his/her actions which adds to the story.  But, that is truly my only complaint with the movie, that there could have been a little more backstory to each character...otherwise, this has been the best movie of the year by far, in my opinion.  This is an exciting movie with great performances, dark, gothic set pieces, non-stop action and one of the best stories I have seen in a movie in a long time.  I highly recommend Underworld...it truly does come close to giving the original Matrix a run for its money.  9/10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great movie you might have missed,"Like many people, I missed ""Underworld"" in theaters and hadn't heard of it until I saw it on HBO one night. While I do tend to enjoy a good vampire movie more than the average person, this impressed me with its story (well crafted and interesting), its action (on par with other action movies in 2003) and its cast -- especially Selene (Beckinsale) and Viktor (Nighy)Overall, the movie takes a new look at classic werewolf/ vampire tales and weaves the legends of both creatures together. It's a film I would recommend to anyone interested in watching a fast-paced action movie that has a lot more intelligence than say a ""XXX"" or other canned action flick. That said, you do need to have at least a passing interest in the supernatural in order to really enjoy the movie fully.And for those of you who have seen the film, the best news is that a sequel, already well set-up by the movie's ending, is already in the works",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Action-packed battle...,"1st watched 2/5/2006, 6 out of 10(Dir-Len Wiseman): Action-packed battle from beginning to end in this initial showing of the feud between vampires & lycans(the werewolfs). Not as good as the following, but plenty to keep your interest. Despite the comic book fantasy storyline and loads of action, the director(Len Wiseman) does a good job of pulling you in by keeping your interest in the characters involved. Beckinsale & Speedman are very believable in their portrayals of the death-dealer Vampiress and the confused human in the middle of this battle. Another thing I liked about this movie is that by the end, you're not sure who are the good guys and who are the bad guys, although at the beginning the Lycans appear to be the bad folk. All in all, this is a unique twist on the horror/action genre that is well done technically and flows well with maybe a little too much gun fighting when you figure that these creatures should have more to battle with because of what they are. But definitely a tad better than the normal action movie and a nice idea that should be able to be built on in later movies, TV shows etc..",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Certain to be a contender for The Razzies,"What do you get when you ripoff every set and costume Design From The Matrix, The Crow, Dark City and Batman, Then woefully miscast a pretty, quaint UK actress best known for her work in period pieces and throw in every cliche, plot twist and device from every vampire film since Near Dark??  You Get Underworld, an easy contender for worst film of the year. Lot's of things blow up, werewolves morph before our eyes, and it all happens in a dark washed out world straight out of a Fritz Lang wet dream. But the thing is boring, nothing of any real interest happens, and the chemistry between anyone in the film is virtually non existent.

What Crap,"I was itching to see this movie during its hype. Werewolves, vampires, butt-kickery, stuff blowing up maybe. Yes I would like to be included.Then it started and, wow, was it ever crap. The cool thing about Vampires and Werewolves is that they are supernatural creatures with preternatural abilities. They have claws and teeth and they're very strong and move very fast, no? So it makes sense that they use those abilities to shoot at each other how? (Interesting Aside: Taking a page from the You-Can't-Fire-Me-I-Quit School of Combat it seems the werewolves in this movie turn into huge wolfmen so that they'll make a larger target for vampire bullets.)Underworld fails to deliver anything worth your time except maybe looking pretty slick. The shoot outs are uninspired and poorly conceived. The fight scene at the end of the film when the filmmakers at long last whip out with some decent action, was too little too late. The Romeo & Juliet plot arch is slapped on and so trite it will make you wince. You will be required to sit through long scenes which establish How Vampires Work, because you've been bad and the filmmakers mean to punish you.After seeing this movie - this is not an exaggeration, I honestly did this - I called everyone I knew and advised them not to see it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
For fans only.,"I'm not a huge fan of the vampires and werewolves universes. Though, every once in a while, I can enjoy a vampire or werewolf vs. human picture, particularly when there's a siege situation. Not being a fan of the myths, it's easy for me to identify with the fellows in trouble. If the approach to these legendary themes is easy or mockingly I can let myself go without major tribulations. UNDERWORLD takes itself too serious for its own good.My main problem with this movie is that it is a story about vampires and werewolves, nothing more, a battle between both clans. There's nothing here for people who don't love vampires and werewolves. Although the special effects are pretty impressive and Len Wiseman's direction is technically flawless, it came a point in the movie where I couldn't identify with any character, thus the movie became boring and extremely overlong. The action sequences weren't enough to lift up the movie because I just couldn't care about the story. Therefore, the special effects and fight sequences had a void, meaningless effect in me. The same is true for the nice, dark cinematography and the rich, gothic set design.Maybe it's just me, since I can even recognize this movie had a good premise: a legendary battle between vampires and werewolves. But if it weren't for the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale, in non-sexy mode here, probably I wouldn't have paid half the attention I did to this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Moose Hole - Review of Underworld,"`But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.  Rise up, beautiful sun, and make the jealous moon invisible.'One of the most popular of Shakespeare's plays, Romeo and Juliet, has been transformed into many different feature films; some good (the 1968 version) and some bad (the 1996 version starring Leonardo DiCaprio). But the main point is that this enduring tale of two star-crossed lovers (which, in reality, Shakespeare ripped off) has been able to stand the test of time, be passed on to future generations and has been embraced as much as it has ever been. Now a more different (really different) version has emerged with werewolves and vampires taking the place of the feuding families the Montagues and the Capulets. But Screen Gem's gothic take on the famous tale is much more loosely based then previous versions. How loosely based? At press time there was already talk of a sequel. William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave right now.Underworld is loosely based on Romeo and Juliet with werewolves and vampires, two feuding clans, battling for supremacy. Selene, a vampire, is a `Death Dealer', an armed assassin who hunts down the Lycans, also known as werewolves. For centuries the war between the vampires and the Lycans has been raging on outside of the knowledge of the human race but that may all change with new rumblings in the underworld. Selene soon becomes infatuated with a human named Michael, who becomes the focus of a secret plot by the Lycans to resurrect their dying species. Why is this such a big deal? The integration of these two rivaling species is strictly forbidden but such an event could end the war. Why would anyone not want this? Selene believes that there are secrets within both clans that push the classic theme of appearance vs. reality. The story of Underworld is intriguing to say the least but gets too caught up in itself to make truly any sense. There are many surprising twists and turns in the plot but so many that the feature becomes bogged down and just plain confusing by the end of its two hour run. And talk about being `loosely' based! The filmmakers claim that Underworld is based on Romeo and Juliet with two members of feuding clans coming together in blissful love but outside of that, the similarities end pretty quickly. And even that similarity isn't well based with any romantic interests between the two main characters being pretty flat and disconnected.The cast is full of wonderful actors and actresses but few famous faces to bring in even a built in audience. Kate Beckinsale, who saw her star power rise dramatically after her role in the 2001 hit Pearl Harbor, is obviously the main focus of the feature and does a wonderful job with her time in the spotlight or lack of light. Beckinsale gives an uber-sexy performance as Selene that may give another leather clad actress, Carrie-Ann Moss, a run for her money in that area. The only problem with her character is that little detail is given to her character's past and even when those details are available, they aren't explored in flashback sequences, which would have relieved some confusion in the plot. Scott Speedman, best known for performance on the late Felicity series on the WB television network, does a best a performance as he can give but as important as his character is to the plot of the film, he really isn't given anything to show off his true acting chops. Bill Nighy, who plays the ancient vampire leader Viktor, gives an entertaining performance that was still quite interesting despite the fact that he doesn't appear till relatively late in the film. The only upsetting fact of the character is the way he dies, which seemed like a slap in the face to the fine performer who worked so hard to set up an engaging character only to be kicked down so quickly.Overall, Underworld is an insult to the famous play on which it is based, no matter how loosely it is. Poor William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave! The idea seemed to an interesting one, so what went wrong? A lot of things. Despite having a decent two hour time length, Underworld becomes too bloated by the midway point that by the end, it just gives up and rolls downhill. The plot has too many twists and turns to get a clear understanding of what is going on and ends with more questions then answers. How did the vampires and werewolves start out? How were the werewolves able to evolve so that they could change at random? Why is it the werewolves and vampires seem to have this all out war against each other going on for centuries without the knowledge the human race? Some of those answers may be present in the feature but the main focus becomes so confusing that anything else is pushed out of your mind to even ponder. And even though this is a horror/monster film, Screen Gem could have taken the blood factor down a notch or two as there were too many unnecessary squeamish moments for some to take especially after gobbling down a full bucket of popcorn. The action sequences are well done, though the filmmakers seem to borrow too many elements from The Matrix series to make them even slightly original. So despite an excellent performance by Kate Beckinsale and well choreographed action sequences, Underworld comes off as being too long, grim and confusing to recommend above superior fall fare like Once Upon a Time in Mexico.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C+)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Liked it..even though it was funny,"The story is true to classic vampire concepts of covens/elders/bloodlines. The plot is interesting but the script is unintentionally funny sometimes (like when characters EXPLICITLY explain the whole story again in case someone left for popcorn). The romance was out of place and awkward, so its good it wasn't overstressed.Selene's corset and spandax is very reminiscent of the Matrix theme but has a cool vampire edge to it. The UV bullets were pretty creative. Overall good entertainment...wouldn't mind seeing a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I'm a fan of movies so even when i'm disappointed in a film i still appreciate the efforts made to bring the movie out.Underworld to me was refreshing even if the effects were nice, the story classical, far fetched coincidenses and the plot predictable. In fact i've read several fantasy novels that were all about the same. it's just that a good entertaining movie was made about it with lots of noir (noir as in dark/black).

A victim of over-editing,"It took me a long time to see this movie, and when I did, I enjoyed it. However, much of the plot was lost in the action sequences. However, unlike many others of its genre, I felt the action scenes were not overly done. I loved the costumes, and thought they fit the dark, surreal atmosphere well. The sets were fantastic with the dark and gloominess needed for the vampire/werewolf storyline. The filming worked really well, almost keeping a feeling unreality about every shot.But I have to admit there were a lot of things I didn't quite understand or wanted more of. While the sequel answered many of those questions, I still felt something was missing. It was. I bought the unrated director's cut...and it is *WAY* better than the original. The missing scenes do a lot to fill in holes, especially Erika's motives. It's sad though that we had to wait for a 2-disc edition to fill those holes. But ""Underworld,"" like many other films, looks like it fell victim to over-editing, losing many valuable plot points and character motivations along the way.If you haven't seen the director's cut or if you haven't seen ""Underworld"" at all, I would recommend just skipping the original version, and going right to the director's cut.

You could hardly see the teaths. I hope that the vampires in both the sequel n¬¥ the prequel will be more like vampires.Cause the lycons were succsesfull in there appearance and looks. The ""Blade-feeling"" was there,with the leather n¬¥stuff.But i didn¬¥t mind that. I liked the movie and i would like to see more of them vampires/lycons in other movies.

Underworld,"Best vampire/werewolf movie of all time beating out Lost Boys, Near Dark, John Carpenters movies, nothing compared to this movie when it comes to vamp flicks. The movie only has one thirty minute sequence in which there is little action every other fifteen to twenty minutes is an outstanding fight scene, the movie takes several corners and twists that just makes you keep wondering how this all happened. There is a biological twist to it that I rather enjoyed as opposed to the ""god"" look at it where vampires exist just cause they do. It tells the story of Selene the death dealer that we learn is still human in some sorts and tries to hang on to what she believes in as well as what she is told to believe in. Excellent movie for anyone, the gore, violence, language, and sex (if you buy the extended version) are well under control and not overdone in any way. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Vapid Crap,"While I am not a huge fan of vampire movies, I do enjoy a good one. Unfortunately, this is not a good one. I was intrigued by the trailer and this was on my short list even though it received a one star review in USA TODAY. It is filmed in the typical modern vampire style (ie, slow motion action scenes, grimy, greasy set decoration, and ""blue light""}. Kate Beckinsale, who I like as an actress, is given no memorable lines in an incomprehensible script. The action scenes are blase, the werewolves are generic and the whole thing looks like a bad mid-nineties music video. I can't reveal the ending, although I want to, to save you your nine dollars, because I walked out early. It is outrageous that this is currently rated at 7 stars. See it to see if you agree with me.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing relevant during the time of the pandemic,"This kept popping up as a recommendation so I watched it.I'm not super keen on graphic violence, and there is a lot of it here. But I stuck with it and it's quite good. The main story is not super original (or maybe it was at the time?), but it is interesting and has flashes of class war as well as a pretty incredibly reveal about 3/4 of the way through that certainly took me by surprise.The costumes (especially Ms. Beckinsale's) are really wonderful.It's worth watching. The acting is good. The effects for the time were good and still hold up reasonably well. It's visually stunning. The story is compelling.AND THERE'S A VIRUS ANGLE. I just had to say this.I do get annoyed with the subtitles. Most of you won't care, but I do, and maybe 20% are missing. Why? Why does this happen and why does no one care? It's really sad.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Occasionally clumsy, but a good source of fun-disgusting fun","Memorable make-up, Sensational Cinematography, Cool Costumes, and with both Werewolves and Vampires, you get two for the price of one. Now that is a pretty good deal. Underworld is not a bad directoral debut for make-up effects whiz Len Wiseman, yet the result is still missing something. The only factor that is not A+ material is the storytelling.The war between Vamps and Werewolves is one that has lasted a thousand years, Set in what looks like Central Eastern Europe, this Gothic story is about Celine, a young vampire and a skilled wolf killer. She is respected by her clan, until she breaks the laws when she partners up with Dr. Michael Corvin He has been bitten by a wolf and Celine has become aware that he might be at the centre of a conspiracy between the vamps and the wolves.The one flaw of Underworld is that it has a clumsy way of setting up conflict. Even the first scene which involves a long shoot out in the subway station is not terribly riveting because we have no idea of what is going on until long after it ends. It serves as merely eye candy, but action of epic scale should should never proceed exposition.Kate Beckinsale seems to be what the studio has used to sell the film, but in fact it is the art department, make-up effects crew, and the camera crew who make the picture come to life. Underworld is a slick flick. I guess that is all it intends to be, and if that is all you want, than you have come to the right place.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More guns less blood,"Underworld is a captivating blend of Gothic aesthetic, supernatural lore, and high-octane action that delivers a thrilling cinematic experience. Directed by Len Wiseman, this dark fantasy film transports audiences into a shadowy, atmospheric world where centuries-old rivalries between vampires and werewolves (referred to as Lycans) rage on in secrecy. With its unique visual style, compelling characters, and gripping narrative, Underworld carves a memorable niche in the realm of supernatural action films.The film centers on Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a fiercely independent vampire ""Death Dealer"" whose purpose is to hunt and eliminate Lycans. Beckinsale shines in this role, bringing a perfect balance of icy determination and emotional depth to the character. Clad in her iconic black leather trench coat, Selene is not just a skilled warrior but a complex individual who questions the history and motives of her own kind. Beckinsale's commanding performance anchors the film and makes Selene one of the most iconic characters in modern Gothic cinema.The story takes a fascinating turn when Selene becomes intrigued by Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), a human seemingly targeted by the Lycans. Their dynamic forms the heart of the narrative, as Selene's growing connection with Michael challenges her loyalty to the vampire clan and unveils shocking truths about the origins of the vampire-Lycan war. Speedman's portrayal of Michael brings a relatable, grounded energy to the otherwise fantastical story, making him an effective counterpart to Selene's cold, calculating demeanor.One of Underworld's greatest strengths is its meticulous world-building. The film weaves an intricate mythology, detailing the centuries-old feud between vampires and Lycans, complete with betrayals, ancient covenants, and power struggles. This lore is presented seamlessly, never feeling like exposition but rather an organic part of the unfolding mystery. The screenplay, co-written by Wiseman, Danny McBride, and Kevin Grevioux, carefully balances action with intrigue, keeping viewers invested in both the characters and the overarching narrative.Visually, Underworld is a feast for fans of Gothic and industrial aesthetics. Wiseman's direction emphasizes the film's dark, brooding tone through atmospheric cinematography and meticulously designed sets. The perpetual nighttime setting, illuminated by moonlight and urban neon glows, enhances the film's otherworldly vibe. From sprawling underground lairs to rain-slicked cityscapes, every frame is steeped in moody elegance. The costume design, particularly for the vampires, reinforces this Gothic sensibility, combining sleek modernity with an air of timeless sophistication.The action sequences are another standout feature. Whether it's Selene unleashing her dual pistols in high-stakes shootouts or Lycans transforming mid-battle, the choreography is both stylish and exhilarating. The film employs a mix of practical effects and CGI, and while the technology of the time occasionally shows its limitations, the creativity behind the action set pieces remains impressive. A highlight is the climactic confrontation, which delivers a satisfying payoff to the film's simmering tension.The supporting cast also deserves praise. Bill Nighy is captivating as Viktor, the regal yet menacing vampire elder whose awakening adds layers of complexity to the story. Michael Sheen, as the charismatic and tortured Lycan leader Lucian, imbues his character with a surprising degree of sympathy, challenging the simplistic notion of good versus evil. Their performances elevate the film, adding depth to the narrative and emphasizing the moral ambiguity of the conflict.The film introduces audiences to a secret war between vampires and Lycans (werewolves), a concept ripe with potential for drama and intrigue. However, the execution leaves much to be desired. The story follows Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a vampire ""Death Dealer"" dedicated to eradicating Lycans. When she discovers a conspiracy involving a human, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), she begins to unravel long-hidden secrets about the origins of the conflict. While this premise sounds compelling, the plot quickly becomes bogged down by unnecessary complexity and excessive exposition.Rather than allowing the story to unfold naturally, the screenplay overwhelms viewers with information, often delivered through clunky dialogue. Key plot points are buried under layers of backstory and lore, which, while intricate, often feel more like an attempt to add depth than a cohesive narrative element. The result is a film that feels overly complicated without offering a satisfying emotional payoff.One of the biggest shortcomings of Underworld is its lack of compelling characters. Selene, despite her striking appearance and impressive combat skills, is a one-dimensional protagonist. Beckinsale does her best with the material, but the character's cold demeanor and limited development make it difficult to truly connect with her. Selene's motivations, beyond her vendetta against Lycans, are thinly sketched, leaving her arc feeling hollow.Similarly, Michael Corvin, the human caught in the crossfire, lacks any significant personality or agency. Scott Speedman's performance is serviceable but uninspired, and Michael serves more as a plot device than a fully realized character. Their romantic subplot, meant to add emotional stakes to the story, feels forced and devoid of chemistry, further undermining the narrative.The supporting cast, while featuring talented actors, is given little to work with. Bill Nighy's Viktor and Michael Sheen's Lucian hint at deeper, more complex characters, but their potential is squandered by a script that prioritizes action over nuanced storytelling. Lucian, in particular, is positioned as a tragic antihero but is not given enough screen time or backstory to make his plight resonate.Visually, Underworld leans heavily on its Gothic aesthetic, which, while striking at first, quickly becomes monotonous. The film's perpetual nighttime setting and muted color palette, dominated by blues and grays, create a bleak and oppressive atmosphere that lacks variation. While this might suit the tone of the story, it also makes the film feel visually repetitive and uninspired.The action sequences, a major selling point of the film, are hit-or-miss. While some set pieces showcase inventive choreography and stylish gunplay, others are weighed down by overly choreographed stunts and uninspired CGI. The werewolf transformations, a key aspect of the Lycans' mythology, are particularly underwhelming. The visual effects, though ambitious for the time, lack the polish needed to fully immerse viewers in the supernatural world.The film's pacing also suffers due to its uneven balance between action and exposition. Lengthy dialogue-heavy scenes grind the momentum to a halt, while the action sequences, though frequent, often feel disconnected from the broader narrative. This disjointed structure makes the film feel both rushed and overly long, struggling to find a satisfying rhythm.Perhaps the most significant flaw of Underworld is its failure to deliver meaningful stakes or emotional resonance. Despite the high body count and dramatic revelations, the film lacks a sense of urgency or consequence. The characters' conflicts and relationships, meant to anchor the story, feel superficial and underdeveloped, leaving viewers detached from the events unfolding on screen.In conclusion, while Underworld has flashes of potential, it ultimately fails to rise above its flaws. The film's stylish visuals and intriguing premise are undermined by a convoluted plot, shallow characters, and a lack of emotional depth. For fans of Gothic aesthetics and supernatural action, Underworld may hold some appeal, but for others, it serves as a reminder that style alone cannot compensate for substance.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Interesting religio-philosophical allegory.,"The Underworld Quadrilogy is an interesting row of films. The plot and the stories with sequels and prequels aren't all that bad, even though highly illogical.The writers could, though, have scored a few pointers in studying fairy-tales somewhat closer. What really makes this series of films interesting is the religio-philosophical and allegorical idea that lies behind.Now, I will not go deeper into this realm in this review, lest I open the door to a Dantean inferno that I am not willing to enter, nor let others enter into. Thus I will just leave it to others there.Maybe others are willing to pilpul the matter further, and deeper - and end up with some kind of final halakha at some later date in the future. As a final conclusion to this review, I will give the complete series of films an evaluation of 7. And add that most of that seven comes from a combination of good dramatization and equally good special effects.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the Best Action Thrillers in Years...,"Vampire and Werewolf movies have been seen constantly throughout the years, from classics like ""Dracula"" and ""The Wolf Man"" to the awful ""Van Helsing"", the terrible ""Cursed"", and the truly rancid ""Dracula 2000"". Underworld provides a new, updated, edgier, and sexier approach to such long-running genres. The film combines incredible special effects (done with little money), stylishly Gothic sets and costume designs (full of black and dark blues¬Ögotta love it), and a stellar cast of actors that include Kate Beckisnale, Scott Speedman, and Bill Nighy. The film starts with vampire and ""death dealer"", Selene (Kate Beckinsale), telling us of the long running war between Vampire and Lycan and its unknown origins to how it all began. The vampire empire is controlled by three elders, two of which stay asleep while one remains above to rule, thus alternating every century. The current elder awake is Amelia (Zita G√∂r√∂g), while powerful and feared leaders like Viktor (Bill Nighy) and Marcus (later played by Tony Curran) reside in protected covens. These covens are run by the greedy and untrustworthy Kraven (Shane Brolly).The Coven is shaken when the Lycan begin hunting a certain human by the name of Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), for an unknown scientific purpose. It is shaken further when Selene believes that the thought-to-be-dead Lycan leader, Lucian (Michael Sheen) may very well be alive, and in league with Kraven. After rescuing Michael from both sides, Selene sacrifices her good name in the Coven to uncover the conspiracy. Selene awakens her father-figure elder, Viktor in order to bring justice to the treacherous Kraven. Unfortunately, at first, Viktor would not be able to look past her insubordination and disregard for the laws that he so heavily believed in. From there, the truth of the conspiracy unfolds, involving the creation of a hybrid, the betrayal of a colleague, and the descendant to the father of all immortals¬ÖAlexander Corvinus (later played by Derek Jacobi).While many would say this film looks like ""The Matrix"" and plays out like a typical horror film, they obviously haven't sat through the entire film. This movie not only provides action, blood, gore, sex appeal, and solid entertainment, but it also balances all of that with a firm storyline. A storyline that sets up an epic tale of lies, deception, and deadly blood feuds (forgive the pun). The visuals are also paralleled with a myriad of fantastic performances. Kate Beckinsale owns the character of Selene. She is sexy, violent, tender when she needs to be, and an overall bada$$. Speedman was perfect as the human caught up in a supernatural conspiracy that can cost him his life, or make him a God. Finally, there is, of course, my favorite performance of Bill Nighy as Viktor. Nighy is an underrated genius of an actor, and, although he is in only in a small percentage of the 2 hour film, he steals the show. While he fathers Selene and lays down the law in the Vampire world, you can't help but like him (especially when he grabs the enormous Lycan character of Raze by the neck, only to kill him easily), but the revelation of his true character only adds to Nighy's brilliant, suave, and menacing performance. Shane Brolly, Michael Sheen, and Erwin Leder played their roles out to perfection as well (although I think Shane Brolly could lighten up on his facial expressions). This film is epic, exciting, and overall just a damn good movie. After you see this you will be dying to see the sequel, which I also highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Style over substance,"This movie is all dressed up with no place to go, with sexy vampires  and rugged-looking werewolves, but no soul at all.The main point of the story, as I understand it, is that Vampire Selene falls in love with Werewolf Michael; she is so much in love with him, in fact, that she turns on her own kind in favor of him. I've watched this movie about 5 times now (I have the DVD; just the regular one, not the ""extended"" one), and I still don't get the feeling that their connection is really that strong. So he saves her from a car wreck; so what? Vampires, especially ""Death-Dealers"" like Selene, have been brought up to despise werewolves and disdain humans.The werewolves and their lives also bother me; why is this pack (apparently) 100% male? Why don't we see any females in their group? Are all werewolves made, not born? It's one of those nagging inconsistencies that really irritates me.The movie has great production values, good tunes and nifty special effects, especially the werewolf transformations. The regular DVD has more than enough special features to satisfy most movie buffs, and the extended version is chock-full of even more goodies. Alas, this slickly produced action/romance/horror flick ultimately rings hollow. My rating: 6/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Have you seen a hotter vamp than Kate Beckinsale?,"This movie was so cool. When I first rented it, I only watched it because my friends said it was totally awesome. I watched it and I realized that they are right! Kate Beckinsale ignites the screen as Selene, a Death Dealer who hunts the werewolves with ruthless efficiency. Clad in black leather and toting some kick-ass guns, she plays the part beautifully. Then she meets Michael, played by Scott Speedman, a med student working in Budapest, who is bitten by a lycan (werewolf) and soon realizes that Michael is connected somehow to the lycans. Selene now realizes that the leader of the lycan hordes, Lucian, who was supposedly murdered by Kraven, a vampire in love with Selene, is still alive, she awakens a Master Vampire, Viktor, to stop the Lycans from becoming all-powerful and destroying the Vampires.

"Great plot, weak directing","All i can comment on is that the directing of this film was horrible. Yes, they did a good job making it look dark as well as re-imagining the werewolves. But it is just so unrealistic and copies so many other movies. It is basically Blade, turned into a women and instead of humans Vs. Vampires, its Lycans Vs. Vampires. The problems i see in this are the little things, like Kate emptying 100+ bullets into the floor and than falling through, when each of those guns probably has 15-20 bullets max. But, it's a movie, so thats OK, people don't reload anyone. Another thing that got annoying was how untouchable Kates character was compared to all others. 5 people jump in before her, all get shot, she jumps in not touched, than the next 5 after her all get shot. But other than that type of stuff the acting wasn't all that bad and the action was pretty good. This was a lot better than the sequel i feel",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Trinity, I mean Lara Croft, I mean female Blade...er....whatever, reads her lines as if from a teleprompter, not that it makes much of a difference, the dialog is so hackneyed that you'll groan with every sentence.  The story sounded interesting when I first heard about it, but leave it up to Hollywood to just turn the whole thing into a Matrix rip-off.  The special effects mainly consisted of the main characters falling from great heights only to land on their feet.  This was done five or six times throughout the movie.  In my twenty-two years of movie watching this has been the first time I have ever come close to walking out on a movie in the theater.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
*****,"For centuries, the vampires and lycans (werewolves) have been at war, unknown to humans. No-one knows how this war started, only that the lycans made the first move. Though the war is far from over, the vampires seem to be gaining the upper hand, and some have decided to sleep for centuries on end. While the aristocratic vampires inhabit a gothic mansion, the lycans are forced to live in the sewers. Special vampire warriors called the death dealers, assigned to take the lycans out, one-by-one, prowl the streets at night. One of these death dealers, Selene (Kate Beckinsale) discovers a lycan plot to kidnap a young human medical student, Michael (Scott Speedman), and decides to take action. When she gets no help from the coven leader, Kraven (Shane Brolly), who seems to be more interested in Selene than disposing of the lycans, she awakens Viktor (Bill Nighy), the most powerful vampire ever to walk the earth, and sets about protecting Michael herself. But soon she finds herself falling in love with Michael, and risks everything protecting him, even betraying her own kind, and also finds out the true reason behind the Lycan's interest in Michael, a plan which could tip the war in the favour of the lycans.When the trailer for Underworld was first shown, it seemed like a bad rip-off of The Matrix, but I am pleased to say that this is far from the truth. Though it borrows a few elements from The Matrix, it still sets its own standard. The special effects are amazing. I wasn't so sure about watching another werewolf (sorry, lycan) film after seeing the wolf effects in Dog Soldiers, thinking that they couldn't get any better, but I'm glad that I gave Underworld a chance. The lycan transformation scenes are simply brilliant, especially Michael's change at the end, and the Vampire effects were stunning. One performance stood out more than the rest, and it wasn't Beckinsale's or Speedman's. It was Bil Nighy's. He was perfect as the vampire elder Viktor, making him seem real, and not another dracula rip-off. Another graet performance was that of Michael Sheen, who plays the lycan leader Lucian. Though I am not a big fan of the genre, Underworld impressed me, and I can't wait for the sequel.***** out of *****",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Slick, undemanding fun.","A comic-book style monster flick designed to appeal to goths, teens, teen-goths, and middle-aged men (my demographic!) who like hot young women in figure-hugging rubber outfits, Underworld squeezes sexy Kate Beckinsale into a shiny black costume, equips her with some serious firepower (a pair of hand cannons almost as big as she is) and sends her out hunting werewolves. The result is a slick piece of mainstream horror that, despite lacking any really effective scares or a genuine sense of excitement, still offers enough fun to make it worth a watch.Beckinsale plays Selene, a beautiful vampire warrior embroiled in a centuries-long conflict against a race of werewolves known as 'lycans'. Driven by a desire for revenge against the creatures that she believes slaughtered her family, Selene has dedicated her life to destroying the lycan, but after rescuing a human from an attack by her hairy foes, the sexy bloodsucker discovers that all is not as it appears to be between the two races...Director Len Wiseman's cast are all ridiculously attractive and impossibly cool, sporting the the latest in Gothic chic; the blue-tinted, rain-drenched cinematography is far more impressive than the rather forgettable plot; and nobody does anything without looking great whilst doing it. However, although Underworld is undoubtedly a case of style over content, it still manages to be pretty entertaining.The script, by Wiseman and Kevin Grevioux, writes its own rules and includes such inventive gimmicks as ultraviolet and silver-nitrate bullets (for use against vampire and lycan respectively); there are some very impressive CGI werewolf transformations; the wonderful Bill Nighy gives a terrific performance as head vampire Viktor; and lots of noisy shootouts and fights (during which Selene never seems to be in any real danger) mean that things rarely get dull.Films like Underworld won't change the face of horror cinema, but at least they're enjoyable for the duration.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
vampires vs. werewolves - nice idea but poorly put into action,"Really, I couldn¬¥t think of any appropriate synopsis, cause i don¬¥t know where to start - taking the chance to sound blunt: this movie is one of the worst I¬¥ve seen this year ! People must be blind, ignorant or their minds blurred by all the vampire series on TV that they give this movie a 6.4 - I¬¥m honest, I gave it a ""3"" (nice try but ...) Most movies are judged within the first 10 mins. So the director thought: ""Well, I¬¥ll put some guys into those black latex suits, give them some cool sunglasses (although it looks unbelievably close to matrix - never mind, nobody will notice and btw. black is cool!) and let them shoot around in the tunnels of a subway station. Hey that¬¥s groovy !"" If u think this sounds ok, u should c the result ! Most of the scene I was trying to figure out if the director has seen this stuff or did he went to the toilet at that time ? Did he intend to test our endurance, how much bad stuff we can take without leaving ... I don¬¥t know. Waving around the camera, wasting 10 mags of ammo within one minute doesn¬¥t make a shooting scene cool - just ridiculous. Now u could say: ""Hey they are vampires ! What the heck do vampires wear but latex suits and black coats ?"" I don¬¥t know - BUT THEY DON`T LOOK LIKE THE CAST OF MATRIX ! So this movie doesn¬¥t only TRY to copy the style of other successful movies - it fails miserably. I understand that movie makers try to profit by ""matrix effects"" but here u can c why u shouldn¬¥t try to place those effect by force - it entirely ruins your work.

And this is a vampire movie with even a few twists up its sleeve, and how often does that happen? This movie requires, however, letting go the typical ideas carved in stone by the likes of Bram Stoker's Dracula or Blade, which was itself a kind of reaction against the anti-Christian figure of the vampire (crucifixes do not work etc.).

"Rather disappointing effort for the genre, not without a fair amount of merit though.","I've seen Underworld twice now, and I'e enjoyed it twice. It's got some great action bits, memorable characters, and it moves along at a great clip, what's the problem you ask? well I just feel it wasn't as good as it could have been. I've always loved the idea of Vampires Vs Werewolves and this movie was just brimming with it, I just felt disappointed by it all. The finale is a memorable one, with a great showdown between Viktor|Nighy| and Selene|Beckinsale|. The gore level is pretty decent, with some nice effects, and not an abundant amount of CGI like I expected.Performances. Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous to look at, and makes for a great anti heroine. She's got the right amount of emotions, the kick ass attitude, and the proper attire to look right. Scott Speedman is decent as Michael, but not as refined as he is in the sequel. Michael Sheen is intense as Lucian, I dug him. Shane Brolly played a great, yet intense weasel. Bill Nighy stole a lot of the scenes he was in, with his frighteningly intimidating performance. His scenes with Beckinsale were endearing.Bottom line. Underworld is a decent way to pass the time, but It's not as good as it should have been.

Pathetic Pseudo-Mythology,"Another simplistic example of modern film dumbing down the supernatural into a special-effects-laden emptiness of worth.This is a supernatural version of your typical status-quo rivalry.All vampires are prissy spoiled brats; all werewolves are poor homeless sewer-dwellers.FORGET WHATEVER ARCANE METAPHORS EITHER OF THESE SUPERNATURAL CREATURES ACTUALLY SYMBOLIZED; just boil it down to your most basic class-struggle metaphor.

How magical.Far from the mystical, mysterious cloak of legend, this movie reduces vampires and werewolves to the easy frivolity of rich versus poor.The ""mythology"" of either is simplified for film purpose. Snobby vampires who apparently shop at Hot Topic and drink the equivalent of bottled water - they live in a security-laden modern palace and get blood from (how lame) hospital blood banks.The wolves - well, you can't like them because they're not fashionable- (and the movie really doesn't care to develop them) - they have no appeal either (assuming we're supposed to like the spoiled-brat vampires, or the personality-free ""heroine"").Wow, that Kate Beckinsale sure can jump off buildings! Over and over again. And then some more.You really get a sense that someone liked ""the Matrix"" a bit too much, copied the style, pitched it, but no one (surprise) wanted to produce it. So, LAST MINUTE, they decided, ""Okay, how about if the bad guys are werewolves! and the good guys are vampires!...please!!!""And someone, as dumb as you, actually bought it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Boring and nothing new,"Having watched all sorts of monster, scifi, fantasy films and so on I see that Underworld brings nothing new. Human looking vampires,so what? CG created werewolves, so what? Dracula 2000 (and not even the brief and useless appearance of actress Jeri Ryan helped) Blade II and III has soured long ago this genre. It just didn't resonate after numerous takes on the vampire and werewolf material. Van Helsing also is included. Served no purpose other than to be purposeless. Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust I would rate above it for it has scenes that these others would not imagine about like the massive manta like creatures flying and Vampire Hunter D upon his steed flying up and hopping over these massive aerial creatures! Underworld is, for me personally, a film I dismiss after viewing it once.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Conceptually advanced, lacking some other primary colors...","6/10Great plot?  Nah.  Great dialogue?  Don't call the Pulitzer prize committee. Neat concept?  Sure thing.You've got to know what you're getting when you go to the movies, and it was pretty obvious from the get-go that this movie was made with certain limitations.  I didn't expect greatness and i didn't get it.  I got an ever-so-slightly edgy, alternate perspective on the modern mythology of vampires and werewolves.  That's it.  That's all that I expected.There has been a lot of talk about the lack of character development and other things of this nature in this movie.  Er, so?  You're watching a vampire/werewolf face-off.  What, did you expect, ""Shakespeare in Love""-style dialogue?  Yeah, they could have done quite a few things better, and I'm really disappointed that they squandered a neat set of concepts with some freshman faux-paus.  But, such is the life of this type of production and budget.I stick to the 6/10, taking into consideration the genre.Wilds",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"For fans of Gun Fu actioneering & Gothic setpiecing, but a massive disappointment for vampyrism/lycanthropy lore purists","If you like your cinematography dark and Gothic like an Alex Proyas(sp?) film ala The Crow/Dark City, Underworld will most likely enthrall and hypnotize you with its gorgeous direction of photography, crafted set pieces and location shots. However, lore and mythology purists/for hards will be sorely disappointed as Underworld's creative screenplay leaves a hell of a lot to be desired when it comes to the established historicity revolving around vampyrism and lycanthropic legends: Neither species behaves or functions within their common frameworks in the Underworld cinematic universe, but instead follow their own physical laws/principles that are largely alien to established norms. Daylight doesn't exist here, regenerative powers are nonexistent or skewed or swapped entirely, lycans were actually slaves and day wardens of slumbering vampires (in spite of a total seeming lack of sunlight in the world), and everyone moves like spider-man caught in wire fu rendering of crouching tiger hidden dragon.Fans of slow motion Gun play and black leather gothism will have no problems enjoying Underworld. It's an easy to follow story with enough originality to separate it from other genre Mainstays and the actors do a great job bringing their respective species to life on screen. But this is no Blade trilogy, or the likes of The Howling or Silver Bullet or American Werewolf--mythos purists will probably cry outright at the complete disconnect from the troves of established vampyric/lycanthropic lore in the literary and cinematic spheres (although the future Underworld sequels remedy some of these more glaring faults), and watching alongside one of your nerdy purists friends will most likely result in a ruined viewing experience when they bake nonstop at all the inconsistencies they'll recognize after failing to suspend their disbelief when you warm then at the film's start that this ain't their typical vampyr/lycan flick.I think underworld deserves to be seen alongside the Blade trilogy so if you're fans of everyone's favorite marvel daywalking katana weilding demigod, you'll definitely acclimate to Serene and her Gothic romps though the lands of perpetual nightfall.Excellent midnight blood romp for any Gothic action fan of Blade/The Crow/Dark City. Just don't expect the film to do your deep understanding of mythos and lore any kind of respectably satisfactory justice.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best,"I have seen almost all the Vampire movies that have ever been made, and Underworld blows all the others away. Absolutely the best Vampire movie ever made. Kate Beckinsale's performance as Selene is outstanding. She makes you feel what you are seeing is real. The chemistry between she and Scott Speedman was awesome. It had several of the best action sequences that I have seen in any film in a long time. And this did not come off as cheesy at any point in my opinion, which is a HUGE accomplishment. Most Vampire films you end up going oh PLEASE! And you feel like your back watching one of those really awful B horror flix. NOT so here, this one was a winner from start to finish. I can't wait for the sequel!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bloody Brilliant,"Underworld was an awesome movie.I saw it for the second time earlier this evening (22/9/03).The style it is filmed in is similar to other movies, but I will say it is not a recycled product. It has very good characters (the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale) and a very interesting storyline.The way the plot goes, is similar to the first matrix movie. Not in story, but in style it does.In the Matrix and Underworld, the first half of the movie is a little confusing. As well in both movies, the second half explains what is needed, and then proceeds to take several interesting plot twists.I found this movie to be exceptionally good, the best movie so far in 2003.I am guessing Matrix 3 and Lord of The Rings 3 could be better, however, this is a very interesting movie that I am recommending to basically everyone I know.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Underworld ROCKS!!!!,"Being a huge Kate Beckinsale & Scott Speedman fan...I seriously enjoyed Underworld because it has alot of action and excitement in it. But there is more to it than action and excitement...personally I thought it was a love story.I mean to say the whole reason behind the vampire vs werewolf war is all because Sonia (Victor's daugther) and Lucian fell in love with each other...since werewolves were the servants and lower class to the vampires...it is forbidden for servants to get intimate with the masters & mistresses. And to make matters worst Sonia was carrying Lucian's child which made Victor really ticked off and he wouldn't allow her to have a half breed (half werewolf)...I guess in a sense victor was prejudice gainst the werewolves cause he had his daughter burnt alive by the sunlight as poor Lucian watched...chained down to the floor like some dog...man my heart went out to him...So, I do not blame him for wanting revenge on Victor for killing his lover and unborn childSo, that is why I think behind all the action and excitement lies a beautiful but very sad love story but also there is another story goin on there...story of betrayal of trust...Victor lead Selene to believe that a pack of werewolves brutally murdered her family when in truth it was him who was behind it...I mean damn...that is really evil right there...I guess it is obvious that the only character that I truly hate out of the movie was Victor cuz man...he is evil!!!!But seriously...this movie is a damn good movie!!!! I mean if you have not seen it...you have got to go and see it as it is a MUST SEE!!! I know it look alot like the Matrix and all that but trust me...is nothing like the Matrix or any other vampire/werewolf movie out there for this is one of the best vampire/werewolf movies I have ever seen in my life!!!And Kate Beckinsale as a warrior vampress...omg!!!! She totally rocks as a vampress!!!! Seriously!!! I hope she does more vampire roles in the future and I also hope you guys make a sequel to Underworld cause this movie truly does ROCKS!!!I cannot wait till it come on DVD cause I will be one of the first to pre order or buy my copy of it on DVD!!!!! Great job on the movie!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Creme-filled spongecake.,"Did you know there has been a war going on for hundreds of years?  And it all started because the upper class and lower class dared to fall in love and have an abomination for a baby?  Master vs. Servant!  Father vs. Daughter!  Oh, the drama! How can they fit all this into one movie!  Easy, Underworld leaves out any sense of character development and relies on convoluted and cliched story lines.  But there is plenty of fun action to distract you from remembering you don't give a lick about the leading characters (what was Kate Beckinsale thinking?).  It's like eating Twinkie.  Oh sure, it was fun to eat, but once it's gone you wonder why you ever indulged.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bela Lugosi's Dead,"Now don't get me wrong -- an epic battle between vampires and werewolves has a lot of potential for a cool movie.  After all, werewolves are big, hairy monsters with claws, and vampires are effeminate pale-skinned people who wear stylish clothes and have a thirst for blood.Unfortunately, when the vampires can't fly and cast visible reflections, and the werewolves' only superhuman ability involves running at highway speeds, one has to wonder -- what kind of vampires and werewolves ARE these?But the movie quickly answers this question by reducing all the significance of the two creatures to molecular biology.  Oh, you thought vampires were really the undead?  Pfft.At least the audience can empathise with the pain and suffering of the war-wounded by means of the painfully wooden acting, and the suffering caused by exposure to yet another Romeo and Juliet ""forbidden love"" story ripoff.Bela Lugosi's dead... and so are cool monster movies.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A formula comic book action flick best seen stoned,"If you like Kate Beckinsale, then you will like this. She is hot! But aside from that, this film is best seen stoned. The story started with a new twist on the overdone vampire thing but then failed to deliver anything really original.The action is unoriginal and lifted straight from other movies in this genre. The acting is mediocre, par at best but put some blame for this on the poor script. I also found the soundtrack not to be memorable.Kudos' for the uber cool work by production designers, lighting and cinematographers. The direction is a competent and it is well cut to maintain a good tempo. Overall a very stylish effort at this genre.I personally enjoyed the film, but then again that's mostly because I think Kate's hot. I would also recommend Van Helsing to anyone who liked this.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly Good ...,"The writing team of a stuntman, a gargantuan actor and a prop assistant probably doesn't seem like a group who could lovingly craft a Gothic mini-masterpiece about vampire and werewolves, and actually get it made. But they did.That team was Danny McBride, Kevin Grevioux and director Len Wiseman. They pitched the story as ""Romeo and Juliet, for vampires and werewolves"", which is interesting as the romance angle of the story is barely even existence except for a few moments here and there. What it really is would be more like ""the Matrix with vampire and werewolves"", although they're probably sick of hearing that by now. But to be honest, they don't even try to hide the similarities. It opens with a shoot-out in a subway station, almost identical in visual style to the Matrix, and for no apparent reason it even has those weird electronic sound effects. Is this movie set inside a virtual reality as well? But by copying the Matrix, it does make itself an undeniably cool action movie. Probably the best thing about it is the design of the creatures and the locations it's shot at. The look of the movie is dark, Gothic and brilliant. The vampires are portrayed as a decadent, sensual race living in the lap of luxury, while the Lycans are brutal, animalistic and live in squalor -- and you don't see a single female werewolf.The script certainly has it's short-comings but on the whole is fairly well-structured and intricate, with the politics and mythology of the universe coming through loud and clear (even if it is a rip-off of White Wolf's role playing games). It's all very well executed, and you can tell they had a lot of fun making it. Kate Beckinsale does give a great performance, constantly conveying emotion with the slightest of facial expressions. Michael Sheen is also notable as the lycanthropic leader, and Scott Speedman and Bill Nighy both fill their roles competently.""Underworld"" wisely markets itself as an action movie rather than a horror movie. It's fun, entertaining and cool, but not a whole lot more than that. If you're in the mood for an ass-kicking, leather-clad bullet-fest, this may be the one for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Dark, dark, dark!","It's the oldest war of them all. No, not Democrats versus Republicans, or politicians versus the truth. It's vampires versus werewolves (or Lycans, if you prefer), Evil versus evil. Or good evil versus bad evil.Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a beautiful vampire warrior who comes across a human named Michael (Scott Speedman), who's been marked by the werewolves. Why Michael? Are the Lycans planning to use him in their endless battle with the vampires? Will Michael fall for the lovely, the talented Selene? Will Selene get to kick some werewolf butt? Yes, like sand through the hourglass of time in a bottle, these are the burning questions that are thankfully answered within the first twenty minutes or so.The film is very similar to The Crow in style (and in a nod to the earlier film, Speedman's character is named Michael Corvin; the lead character in The Crow: City of Angels was named Ashe Corven); it's dark, noirish dark, foreboding dark, bad-guy dark, you name it. See, there's dark, and then there's dark dark. This is the latter. Now, the original Crow movie was wildly stylish, and Underworld carries that torch a little bit further. Not only does style triumph over substance, it body slams it to death and then dances on its grave. In other words, don't look too closely at the plot, which doesn't always hold up to close scrutiny. But that's not likely, since the film's so dark (did I mention that).As with most comic-book-atmosphere tales, this one is full of Pretty People. Even vampires and werewolves gotta look good, you know, what with the extra grooming and tooth filing and all. At any rate, there's nary an Ugly Person in sight. Even the despicable ones are Pretty People.As Selene, Kate Beckinsale is very good, appropriately slinky and pliant. Beckinsale's not known for taking on tough roles such as this - you usually see her in upper-crust films such as Emma and Cold Comfort Farm. But she acquits herself very well, so much so that there's a sequel planned for 2005.Her primary foil is Shane Brolly as Kraven, the leader of the vampires. Brolly snarls a lot, showing off what have to be more than the usual 32 teeth in the process. Brolly didn't have much in the way of facial expressions here, just you're basic ""I'm mad!"" and ""I'm madder!"" looks.Underworld is agreeably well done, with a believable romance between Speedman and Beckinsale shunted to the background. This is about werewolves versus vampires, with men in the background, clueless as always, so the romance played out well on a subtle level.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cool concept and stylish directing salvage a weak screenplay,"Anyone with a love or soft spot for creature-driven sci-fi/fantasy can appreciate what the writing trio led by Len Wiseman attempted to do when they conceived ""Underworld."" Creating a world where vampires and werewolves (Lycans) live amongst humans and are engaged in a secret thousand-year-old war is at the least interesting and respectable for fans of the like and so conceptually, ""Underworld"" at least has something to work with. Putting their vision on the big screen? Not as easy. The film is riddled with bad dialogue, bad acting and scenes that seem to lack any kind of contextual clues--not to mention bullets, lots of bullets.""Underworld"" stars Kate Beckinsale as a ""death dealer,"" named Selene--you know, that troubled, martial arts-savvy vampire charged with the responsibility to perpetuate the violence between vampires and lycans by killing lycans and never questions it until, of course, the film is about twenty minutes in. The rich history the writers have concocted makes it a bit more interesting, but it would be nicer to see it than have characters waste time telling us about it through dialogue with other characters. Selene begins to question these things when she catches on to a vampire/lycan conspiracy hundreds of years in the making and tries to uncover the mystery and how a human being hunted by lycans named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) is tied to it all.The film foremost but least obviously dodges the obstacle of explaining how vampires and lycans can wage their war without humans knowing. It gives no time (assumed the future, but who knows) or place explanation. In fact, daylight never happens in the film, it's all about the vampires and lycans. There is also nothing done to really get the viewer to grasp the conflict. You start to pick sides in your head as to who is right or wrong, but you never once feel the conflict through any of the characters and Selene seems to be a very odd and unmotivated heroine. All you get is one scene highly reminiscent of ""Silence of the Lambs"" of her telling her story to Michael and at that point it's too late for it to make a serious impact on the movie.The acting is mostly bland, but that could be more due to a horrible script. The script wouldn't have been half as bad if it spent less time explaining. Bill Nighy is the exception to the poor acting as vampire lord Viktor who Selene awakens in a desperate attempt to figure out what's going on. Nighy brings some actual character to his role and some serious evil. His performance was no doubt that which landed him his role as Davy Jones in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films.The directing and art direction does offer this film a visual saving grace. Wiseman does some really cool transitions and some strange, but cool-looking action sequences. The film does seem to not-so-obviously cover its budget constraints in this manner, however, in that the best visual effects are in short snippets. Also, either they were steering away from anything that was going to garner an R-rating or they simply didn't have the money to show most of the violence, something that would have made the film feel a bit more real. Lycans go to maul people and Wiseman cuts away, leaving you doubting if the person actually got mauled.Basically, if I weren't a sucker for films with a mythology placed in a futuristic sci-fi setting with similar art direction, this film would have been horrendous. Viewers with a genuine interest in story like that and sci-fi action sequences are sure to at least get a bit of entertainment out of ""Underworld,"" but that's about all this film has to offer.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Len Wiseman's direction was surprisingly good and (in general) the writing leaves nothing to be desired.The story did seem to flounder a little towards the end.

Underworld is the female equivalent of 'Blade'.,"Whether you view that as pleasant or hideous is up to you, I for one believe it to be a refreshing change despite being released during the height of the 'Blade' franchise. The vampiric Death Dealer Selene is in the midst of an eternal war, Lycans against vampires. Convinced that these werewolves murdered her family, she's hellbent on destroying the Lycans to save her covenant. It's a complicated family tree with deathly descendants and plenty of double-crossing, which does make for an interesting story. McBride's screenplay turns traditional monsters into a gritty gang war whilst embedding genetics along the way. It feels fresh, even when watching it today, just a shame that McBride's script is littered with thin characterisation and plagued with bland dialogue. Several scenes where I became disengaged just because of how tedious the story was told. Takes itself far too seriously with all the mumbo jumbo about the Corvin bloodline, lycans, vampi...yawwwn...see what I mean? What Underworld does do well is world building. The bleak underground environment and stormy weathering creates a gothic atmosphere that would suit the accompaniment of an Evanescence soundtrack (hold onto that thought...). The production and visual designs were a dark delight and certainly assisted in enhancing the world it was portraying. Acting was functional, aside from Nighy and Sheen who gave great performances, everyone else just walked around in the darkness shooting at each other. Beckinsale definitely catapulted herself into stardom though, and clearly liked wearing leather attire ever since. The minimal use of CGI was appreciated and the final act was excitingly directed by Wiseman. It is plagued with generic sound effects, y'know the ones you could find in any horror or gothic video game, which does infuriate me slightly as it just urges me to play 'Devil May Cry' again. However, Underworld is a thinly written promising start at blending action and horror together. The question is can it maintain this level of interest? Well, you'll see...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

She's The Black Knight -- He's the Damsel In Distress,"Let me start off with the negative. It's not hard to see why UNDERWORLD only did so-so business at the box office. Fans of traditional horror were really offended by the idea of vampires and werewolves spraying each other with machine pistols like LA gangs of the Eighties. The lighting of the film was so murky and blue that it was impossible to see anything, and the attractive cast looked much uglier than necessary. And the fight scenes were just not good enough for an action adventure audience to stay interested in such a long, involved story.But the love story between vampire warrior Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and gentle human Michael (Scott Speedman) was much more satisfying and rewarding than most screen romances. This has nothing to do with the supernatural elements, but rather with the way gender roles are reversed in a very provocative and sophisticated way. Kate Beckinsale is quite literally the only attractive young actress working today who could have made this character work. Selene is like a classic gunslinger, or like the Black Knight of fairy tales. She has no time for love. She's so angry she doesn't even realize how hard she's trying to fight off her attraction to the gentle, demure Michael. In every sense things are turned around here -- the woman is strong and brave but not able to express her feelings, while the man is gentle and supportive but unable to protect himself from the cruel underworld.Each encounter between the two is elegantly underplayed, but deeply erotic. Note the scene where strong, silent Selene takes confused, frightened Michael to a ""safe house"" to hide for a while. She wants to leave him there while she hunts for the people trying to kill him -- but he says, ""I want to come with you!"" Notice how she uses this moment to steal her first kiss while at the same time clinking chains onto his wrists so that he will stay put while she goes out to fight. It's just what the mysterious black knight would do to protect his damsel in distress. On the other hand, Beckinsale's acting is so rich that you can wonder whether Selene is really stronger than helpless Michael or perhaps more frightened than he is of actually falling in love.The story goes on too long, there are too many characters, and the heavenly love story does not get all the screen time it deserves. But the attraction between these two is truly intriguing and electrifying.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable,"First of all, I didn't expect this to be a frightening movie, and it wasn't. I basically went to see the movie for its stylish lead character, and for the most part, I was pleased. Selene looked good, had cool poses, some basass moves, I just wanted more. I wasn't too fond of the story, but it was good enough to keep me interested. Obviously this movie borrows from the Matrix with its styling, but I didn't mind. Hell, it's a sweet style to borrow from, and it was well done. I would definitely go see a sequel just for some mindless and stylish action.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Michael Sheen's Lucian steals this show,"The most fascinating aspect of 2003's Underworld is how thoroughly the main plot gets overshadowed by one stunning supporting performance and a back story we see only in flashbacks. It's a movie not without its flaws but one that should be commended for spending equal time on character development and back story as it does in crafting its strangely gun fire heavy action sequences....Len Wiseman (director) and Danny McBride's (writer) film is seen through the eyes of Selene (Kate Beckinsale) a vampire who rejects the persistent attentions of the head of her vampire coven Kraven and the Anne Rice-esquire decadence that surrounds her.

So many fangs I didn't know where to look.,"Ah, vampires and werewolves (aka Lycans). Here we go yet again... Or so it would seem. This movie takes the general idea that randomly seems to hang in the air about these creatures and turns it into the closest thing to reality. The plot is fantastic and gives a great structure for the actual movie. Unfortunately, the script is not so hot. Although most of the time it builds suspense, sometimes it is charged with passion and at others provokes strong emotions from the audience, there are several occasions where it flags a little to say the least and you get a little distracted by something else, such as searching for the already half-empty vodka bottle. There are some lines and, (I hate to say it), mainly during Kate Beckinsale's monologues where you just think 'Get to the point already'. Otherwise, the movie keeps up a great, energetic pace most of the way through.Other than her monologues which leave much to be desired, Beckinsale's performance leaves you blown away and it perfectly complemented by Scott Speedman's. (Um.... Does anyone else think he has a weird kinda squeaky voice?) Sophia Myles was at her usual average standard and Shane Brolly was fantastic as the wonderfully evil, Selene-obsessed Kraven.I was however, disappointed at the ending which was, for want of a better word, to put it simply :lame. Really, really lame. I know that its practically the law that every single movie MUST have an ending that allows for a sequel but come on... A little originality please! Overall, mainly due to an almost brilliant script writer and stunning costumes, I gave this movie 9 out of 10 but I don't advise it if your not a vampire movie connoisseur.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Good FX, but lacks suspension of disbelief","Underworld is a movie that probably should be dubbed a Matrix wannabe.  The look and feel of the two movies are very similar, however where Underworld differs is that the Matrix has a very complex story underneath the action. Underworld is filmed in a gray tone which lends a creepy air to the environment, however, seeing vampires and werewolves battle it out with futuristic machine guns and other high tech weaponry makes the story seem a bit odd and distinctly unbelievable.  The plotline and story are very poorly defined until nearly the end of the film and only then does some redemption come for the whole film.  For the first ninety minutes of the film we are left watching basically one futuristic gun battle after another with little snippets of conversation pertaining to the ongoing thousand year war, There is hardly any attention spent giving the audience any indication of why these two species of legendary creatures are at war in the first place.  The revelations of the roots of the war at the climax of the film feel out of place and seem to not really explain why the war would rage for as long as it has.  You also are left switching sides as to who are the ""good guys"" and who are the ""bad guys"" in the film which I think was intentionally done by the creators of the film to keep the audience off balance.  This only intensifies the confusion of the audience as to why this war is so important to these creatures and why it is taking place in the first place, and why for that matter are we as the audience witnessing it at all.The special effects and creature creations for the movie are really exciting to watch, however there is so much human type of violence in the movie that it seems extremely hard to believe that aside from pointy teeth the vampires have throughout the movie that these creatures are really vampires and werewolves.  Overall, there were alot of opportunities wasted in making this a really good horror flick, opportunities that could have elevated this movie from the modiocre, run of the mill shoot em ups it is right now. Hopefully the producers see some of the negative comments like this and make a better film for the sequel, as this one is only so so.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic film well worth watching.,"I loved this film, it has a great plot focusing on the battle between vampires and Lycans (warewolves) for power. I loved the historic background of both the Lycans and Vampires and i found this added to dark nature of the film. Kate Beckinsale was a fantastic choice for the lead role her performance alone makes the film worth watching, an amazing British actress with a huge amount of sex appeal. The special effects, stunts and fight scenes for this film were of a good standard. The only bad thing i have to say about underworld is that the lead male character could have been better however Katee Beckinsale and Bill Nighy more than makes up for his shortcomings. Overall i would say underworld is one of the best films featuring Vampires that i have seen. An amazing action film. Iam looking forward to the sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
alright but disappointing,"i watched this movie because I've always loved vampires, werewolves, etc for as long as i can remember so when i heard it was vampires and werewolves in a modern day world fighting it out i thought that it would be totally awesome.the bullets that each species used against each other were cool ideas but what i didn't like about the movie was they pretty much only ever used guns. and i was like, ""these guys are supposed to be extremely fast and strong, was the up and close fighting?"" sad to not really see any of that.but i gotta say the main disappointment was how unconvincing the werewolves, sorry lycans, actually looked. i laughed a little at how bad looking they were.other than that the acting wasn't too bad and i especially liked the performance by Bill Nighy, i thought he was cool. the movie was definitely entertaining though.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An incoherent montage of other movies,"I'll be straight: There's nothing good about this movie; it's like a montage of reenactments of scenes from other movies. Take the Prague settings from Blade 2, the costumes and ""bullet time"" effects from The Matrix, and mix in some atrocious acting and dialogue that can only aspire to comic book quality, and edit into oblivion.Nothing exciting, nothing remotely scary (except for Shane Brolly's acting attempt). The audience laughed throughout. Blech.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Close to Perfection,"I've seen a few movies featuring werewolves and vampires up through the years. None of them actually appealed to me, as they seemed more like a bad excuse for displaying excessive violence and/or were more or less of an erotic manner. With these prejudices I was quite hesitant to watch the movie and skipped the opportunity several times... Until I now decided to give it a chance.And I was AMAZED! The main part of any movie should be the story being told. Many movies draws your attention by use of the main character's bulging attributes (i.e. Lara Croft) or state of the art digital special effects. In this movie the story IS the centre of attention. Special effects are awesome, but not exaggerated. Kate is beautiful, but modest. The story is generally true to the idea I myself have of werewolves and vampires, but a bit twisted and modernized which makes it even more interesting. And the musical score is vowen nicely into the movie, not standing out but rather adding the appropriate atmosphere to the experience of watching the movie.This is not a movie for those whose interests in movies generally focuses on ""eye-candy"". But if you find werewolves and vampires fascinating, and you like a good story, then this is the movie for you.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dracula vs. the Wolf Man by committee,"In the opening moments of this film we get a voice over narration by Selene played by Kate Beckinsale.  It's a nice looking well photographed scene, and it grabs are attention.  Unfortunately, in this opening monologue, we also get a lot of vague mumble jumbo attempting to explain who Selene is, what she's doing and why.  By the time the narration is finished we don't have anymore of a clue as to what's going on then we did as we entered the theater.  And that as just about how it goes for the entire length of Underworld.Don't fret though, eventually you'll discover through a certain amount of diligence that this is the story about the Vampires and the Lycans, or werewolves if you will.  Think Dracula vs. the Wolf Man by committee and you pretty much have the picture.  We also know that the Vampires have spent years trying to do in the Lycans and have been quite successful at it.  It seems that Selene discovers the Lycans are after a certain human named Michael Corvin(Scott Speedman).  They need to mix his blood with theirs for reasons that are never quite clear.  It also turns out that after tracking down Michael on her own, Selene finds herself attracted to him.  We know this only because of the way the plot develops, not because of any kind of emotional response offered by Selene.  Of course she is a vampire and chances are she isn't supposed to have any romantic notions, but if she doesn't have any emotions....well, I don't want to convolute an already polluted film any more than it is.There's also a lot of other stories told to us during Underworld.  There are more monologues in this film explaining background and motives than any film in recent memory.  My best advice to you is if you watch this film, be prepared to draw a chart as these many explanations are rattled off because you'll sure need one.  There's a story about why and how Selene became a vampire, there's a story about why Michael is being hunted by the Lycans, there's a story about why two vampire leaders sleep for years and only one is awakened at a time, there's a story about why bullets are taken out of the Lycans and put back in.  After a while I felt like I should go to the book store and buy the Cliff Notes.  There are so many stories and so many explanations, and most of them are so convoluted and long winded that it's impossible to follow this film without being overcome by long periods of boredom.A lot of what is on the screen looks good.  The battle scenes between the Lycans and the Vampires are all well done and interesting to look at.  The sets are adequately foreboding and photographed in the kind of prevalent bluish haze that seems to have overtaken the film world in the last few years.  We do look at the battle and attack scenes in a passive kind of way because Underworld has complicated it's plot and background to an extent that we really don't care about who the good guys are or the bad guys are or whatever.  We are never given a chance to be drawn into this story and none of the performances here help.  I don't care if this is a film about the supernatural, there is not one performance in this film that is more than one note.  Beckinsale certainly looks OK in her leather outfit, and she performs the action scenes well enough, but does nothing at any point to make us care about her or help draw us into her story.  Speedman's human character of Michael is no better.  We don't feel any sympathy, fear, or anything about him because after two hours you won't know him as a person any better than you did when he makes his first appearance.If you take the time to watch Underworld, you might appreciate the action scenes, the dark settings, and several scenes of modern day werewolves and vampires battling it out.

Gothic Soap Opera,"""Underworld"" posits the notion that vampires and lycans (werewolves) have a long, lurid history together.  It's a soap of backstabbing (and graphic frontstabbing for that matter) and hidden agendas revolving around a human who clashes their histories violently asunder.The movie is a lot of style but not much substance.  Dark and rainy nights, bounteous leather painted in greys and blood red.  I found it to be middling.  The only thing that sticks in my mind about it is how almost all the characters in it are non-human.  The special man I alluded to before doesn't remain human for long.  Can't say that about too many film especially those using live actors.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Underworld delivers,"Underworld had just the right mix of fantasy, mystique, romance, and action. I like Kate Beckinsale better in this role than any she's done to date. Her heroine is both strong and vulnerable at the same time. Scott Speedman was a new face for me but I think that he was a perfect fit for this part. He has an animal-like look and quality to him that really sales him in this role. I felt that he and Kate have a real on screen connection and chemistry that can't be denied. They were totally believable as a couple falling in-love against the odds. Having the this classic conflict existing between vampires and werewolves gave this movie just the right twist as well. Honestly, I think that with the realities of the world today, Underworld was just what the doctor ordered in terms of escapism. What a nice break from the ""real world"". I hope that there is a sequel in the works for Underworld.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Your incompetence is becoming most taxing¬Ö""","Kate Beckinsale in Underworld is a clear inspiration taken from recent vampire/goth/sci fi movies, particularly the Blade and Matrix series, and the audience will surely be making comparisons, even subconsciously. She embodies the sleek, ass-kicking skills of Trinity from The Matrix but her vampire element reminds me more of the surprisingly effective performance that Parker Posey gave in Blade 3.You see, Beckinsale is Selene, a vampire who has devoted her existence to destroying ""lycans,"" the werewolves who have sleeked up their image for the 21st century by removing the 'thrope' from the end of their title. It seems that the vampires and the lycans have been involved in a raging war with each other for well over 1,000 years, which prompted me to wonder what the average kill rate is for a vampire or lycan soldier. Either they breed really really fast or they're just not very good warriors.At any rate, Selene stumbles across a conspiracy involving the leader of the lycans, Lucian, and the leader of the vampires, Kraven, to combine the blood of the two species and create a new breed of nightwalker that would be more powerful than both. Vampires and werewolves are incompatible even at the cellular level (even their blood fights when combined), but Selene still fears that Kraven's and Lucian's plot would endanger the vampires, so she awakens their dark lord from a mummified hibernation a full century ahead of schedule.The intricacies of the plot, however, are noticeably more complex than the material can sustain. There are three rulers of the vampires, and at any given time there is one awake and ruling and two in hibernation. Selene's waking of Viktor 100 years early is a sacred violation that hasn't been broken in 1,400 years. She needs to find get conclusive proof of this dark conspiracy or even Viktor would be powerless to save her from a most vicious punishment.I missed the part, by the way, where they explained why Viktor couldn't be put back to sleep after having woken up, but no matter. He's awake now and his gradual transformation from a mummy into a cadaverous vampire leader is one of the more interesting make-up effects in the movie.The special effects, by the way, are the thing that will make or break the movie. It's dark and dreary from beginning to end, which is not unexpected in a film about a war between werewolves and vampires, but the darkness gets a little repetitive long before the end of the movie.Upon wakening, Viktor finds himself in the middle of a situation in which this vampire woman has broken a 1,000 year old tradition to report to him a virtually impossible conspiracy, even while she is falling in love with a lycan-infected human named Michael, which is strictly forbidden (it's forbidden because he's a lycan, by the way, not because his name is Michael).Scott Speedman is given remarkably little to do in the entire film, although the transformation of his character provides for what is by far the film's best battle scene. The soundtrack is loud and violent, like much of the rest of the movie, and while it manages to avoid adding much to the vampire or werewolf genres despite having combined them together so well, there are some interesting ways that the movie brings the story into the 21st century. Not only do these ancient creatures now have cell-phones, but high-powered handguns that fire liquid-silver and phosphorescent bullets. They have, it seems, ""harnessed sunlight as a weapon.""With these kinds of things going on, you might expect a better movie, but it's fast and brutal and stylish and ends with the promise of a sequel in which everything that we have come to learn from this movie will be completely changed. And for something that could so easily have been written off as a Blade or Matrix rip-off at the time of its release, that's a pretty successful outcome.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of the best Vampire- Werewolf movie ever made,"I'd like this movie because it was so very concise, precise. The detail given was awesome. The movie slightly complicated but each time I viewed the movie more detail was brought to my attention this is what made it spectacular. The action sequences, the plot was on target. What can i say but simply spectacular!!!People may not like the movie because of many reasons, one it contains were wolves and vampires, not many people like a dark setting. Also, if it has been viewed in a hasty manner it'll never be appreciated. Kate was good since much depth hasn't been given to her yet the character Selene comes into life as cold deadly death dealer. The plots and counter plots were great when we start to realize that it was Lucius(Micheal Sheen) who happens to be the typical good guy. It brings out the selfishness and insecurity of beings whether they be Vampire or Were wolves. Physically they appeared to be stronger and mightier than us but emotionally they r as fragile as we are. Thats what made it spectacular....",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good beginning but gets bad,"Underworld has some style and action at the beginning, it starts out looking like something that might work but then gets bad.

I don't care how ""good"" the good guy is, you CANNOT take out a whole room full of men with automatic weapons with a pistol....it's not POSSIBLE.

"just an awful, awful movie","this is probably one of the ten worst movies i've ever seen. terrible acting, laughable special effects, and a squandered story-line which had the potential to be cool. the fact that an undead vampiress can drown sums up the complete stupidity of this movie. last time i checked vampires don't breath. anyway, avoid this one like a vampire avoids sunlight (oh yeah, sunshine bullets, how incredibly lame is that?). the look of the film is a total matrix rip-off, but the storyline and characters in ""underworld"" made me long for the the second and third matrix movies (which is an accomplishment only a shamefully bad movie could pull off). a 1 out of ten, and that's being very generous.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's just allright for me,"Underworld is one of those movies you want to see but dread mainly due to the cover on the box.  It shows Kate Beckinsale all decked out like Trinity ready to leap through the air with the help of wires and special effects. The movie's problems are not that it steals from the Matrix, but are more basic.  The plot had the chance to really lure us in with an almost Romeo and Juliet type romance, but sadly it doesn't get enough attention. Selene is so rigid, you expect her to snap in two every time she walks.  Michael Cravin comes across as a na√Øve child who will believe anything and sympathizes immediately with any sort of sob story.  An attempt at an end reel plot twist falls flat on its face because instead of the twist anchoring our emotional hopes on one side or another, it introduces yet another side and makes us dislike two characters we already mistrust even more.  The one actor who's the saving grace in this film is Michael Sheen who plays the part of Lucian, the big dog of the werewolves.  His eyes convince me that he is not doubt a were-something and if I saw him coming after me, I would wet myself and then run.  We are given five whole minutes to understand why Selene fights the werewolves (brought about in the clich√©d why are you fighting them dialogue) with such a passion and in those same five minutes realize her love for Corvin.  Of course Selene wasting six werewolves single handedly immediately follows that.  The movie has little emotional attachment from its audience.  It's entertaining and the vampires and werewolves are very modern.  The vampires take on more of an Anne Rice-like portrayal sitting around drinking blood that looks like wine in an extravagant old house.  They dress pretty and could pass as fashion models for Old Navy commercials if they weren't dressed in black all the time and got a little more sun.  The werewolves are fast and agile but they don't look quite right to me, most of them look like blue chow-chows, not werewolves.  The whole look and feel of the movie is of course very gothic, as we wouldn't expect anything else.  My biggest pet peeve in the movie is that we are supposed to believe that Selene is a killing machine yet whenever she fires a gun it flails in her hand as though it was a salmon out of water.  I don't know how she manages to hit anything at all and I wonder if it's too much to ask Hollywood to train actors to look like they know what they are doing when they use firearms.  Not a bad movie, rent it sometime if they are out of what you really want.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"after 2 strong acts, ""Underworld"" derails","Well, what's good about ""Underworld""?  The direction is solid, the cinematography is excellent, and the sets and costumes are well-conceived. This is basically glossy pulp that doesn't pretend to be more than it really is; filled with visual flourishes (borrowed from ""The Matrix,"" a movie I hated), it doesn't make too many worthy demands of the viewer to keep up with the story (a war between vampires and werewolves, and the possible cross-breeding of the two), which is fine by me.  The acting meets the standards of the genre, and the dialogue--as silly as it sometimes is--is kept to exposition and exclamation.  The CGI transformation effects are wisely excuted partly in shadow or darkness, making them somewhat effective. However, after the first two exceptionally strong acts (where I was fully prepared to dub this film the most fun I'd had since seeing ""Ghosts of Mars"" in the theater), ""Underworld"" devolves into a final sequence in which the film's credibility is worn thin, as vampires and werewolves run down corridors firing weapons in every direction, so much so that I found myself forgetting what their actual objective was.  Basically, the movie could've been 90 minutes and a cult masterpiece, but at two full hours, it's simply overextends its welcome.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Vamps vs. Lycans:  Pass the popcorn, man!!","Who doesn't love a good fight between 2 immortal enemies?!?! Underworld delivers all the bites & slashes you can handle.

It is very hard to watch this film without watching Beckinsale kick Lycan butt & look good doing it!For centuries, Vampyres & Lycans(Werewolves) have waged a bloody war for control of the night. Beckinsale stars as Selena, a vampire Deathdealer who uncovers a secret plot to rip apart the vampire nation & unleash a legendary monster to tip the balance of power between Vamps & Lycans. Selena soon discovers that current vamp leader Kraven has made a pact with the Lycan leader Lucian to overthrow sleeping vamp king Viktor & call a truce to the bloodshed. In the middle of all this is Michael Corvinas, med student & ancestor to the Corvinas bloodline which will give rise to a new creature both Vampyre & Lycan.

This is a brilliant film,Underworld: This is a film about a war between vampires and Lycans werewolves. Starring Kate Beckinsale as Selene the vampire and Scott Speedman as Michael the Human. The back cover says. For centuries two races have evolved hidden deeply within human culture the aristocratic sophisticated vampires and the brutal feral lycans (wewewolves).

After I saw it I bought it.Made in 2003 three years before the next one (Underworld Evolution) there is a game of this it is called Underworld the eternal war its pretty good you get a huge infantry and you get to be the commander and you even get to be on the Lycan side as well as the vampires.By G.A.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The action scenes are quite well done and are entertaining to watch with pretty good special effects to make them more effective.Overall a good action movie, but not much more than that, there's one or two cheap shocks but if you want scares don't look here.Definitely worth a look if you have a spare couple of hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Beckinsdale frowned the entire movie, trying to act tough all the time. Why do these pretty young women try to act like men? She is not likable in here, nor is anyone else. It would have been nice to have someone to root for!There also is - no surprise - too much violence and bloodshed. It's not ""Van Helsing"" in that regard (overdone action) but it isn't far removed.

good dumb fun,"A no-brainer, but a FUN no-brainer, so that's all right.I think I saw this movie three times in the cinema within the week of its release, and every time I watched it I came away thinking that, despite the fact that it had obviously sucked in places, I had still seen a good film.So what made it such a mixed bag of emotions for me? If you look at it one way, you have a well-paced modern action film that pays some very obvious tribute to American comic books, Japanese Anime, and The Matrix. If looked at in the other way, however, you find you have a sloppy Matrix clone that's just recycling stunts and tricks from older, better films. Part of the problem is that the supporting evidence for each argument can easily be applied to the opposition as well.In the end, I say that the best thing to do with this film is to just sit back and enjoy the ride. Give in to your shallow values and just admire all those gorgeous vampires. When it gets right down to it, there is nothing wrong with admiring Kate Beckinsale's body at all, and that alone is almost enough to carry this movie off.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent (Vampire VS Wolf-men) movie!,"I'm quite strict when grading and criticizing a film. In this last years,vampire and wolf-men movies have been a disappointment and each time they were getting worst. I didn't want to see Underworld but I saw it. I've never seen something so amazing and original. Kate Beckinsale it's a very promising actress as we can see in this movie. She is the best thing on the film.The scenes in which they fight and action parts was what most dislike as well as the way in which the vampires act. Underworld , in some way, remembers to ""Matrix"" in that ways in which they fight. As well we remember of ""Blade"" when seeing Underworld. Matrix + Blade=Underworld. This formula isn't good because although it does remember in some parts of the film to this two, it's very original and doesn't have anything to do with ""Matrix"" and ""Blade"".",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you liked blade, you'll love this!","This movie is a good take on the old original story of werewolves & vampires.  Werewolves were the daytime protectors of the vampires.  But something happened that caused them to become mortal enemies & started a 1000-year war.  There isn't a lot of direct character development, but that would have slowed the movie down.  It's much like the 1st Matrix, enough action at the beginning to get you interested, then they tell the story so you have an understanding of what's going on, then they get back to the action.  The character development is subtler, in that you discover the inner workings of Selena as she does.  In this type of story it works.  You can't go into this movie expecting Terms of Endearment or Casablanca.  It is what it is, an action/horror flick.  It does the action very well; the horror part is more shock value then actual horror, like most so-called horror movies these days.  The acting is decent.  Nobody really stands out as far as the acting, good or bad, which I like, because it keeps 1 character from dominating the film.  All the characters I thought blended well into the story.  So you care more about what's going on, then who is doing what.  I give it a 10 out of 10.  Because it is very good in its genre, it's the best sci-fi/action movie since Matrix.  I recommend it to any action movie buff.  I if you liked Blade, you'll love this!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Promising stuff from leftfield!,"For those of us who have long watched and loved vampire movies, from the sublime to the ridiculous, now we have Underworld.  It seems to have been shot entirely in Hungary, or otherwise eastern european location, giving it a lovely, gothic look, as well as a neutral setting. (My only gripe here would be the product placement for Bacardi! How does that fit in with this crazy flick?)A convoluted plot posing vampires against werewolves in an eternal battle between races of immortals greets us here.  The action is fairly well staged, and the VFX, while maybe a little cheaper than what some of us are used to, nevertheless gives the movie a style and look that many more expensive pictures miss out on.  The acting is a little ropey sometimes, as is the slightly bonkers script, but overall the movie works - and Beckinsale holds things together when it seems all is lost.If you like Blade, Buffy and The Matrix, then this is a fine way to spend the evening.

However, the movie was not flawless.  There were certain points in the plot that reminded me of Blade, which is not a bad thing.

All sound and fury and not much else,"Sometimes I think that Underworld would have made a better music video than a film. Evenescance could have wailed out a 90 minute goth number that could have just been laid in instead of audio, and it wouldn't hurt the film's narrative one bit. Indeed, you could just pop in your ear buds and and listen to whatever while you're watching it, and still pretty much know what's going on. This one is all visual flair and slick, posturing special effects that thunder along with little regard for logic, story or character development. That's not necessarily such a bad thing, as long as you know what you're going into and aren't expecting a dense, heady Bram Stoker outing. It concerns a nocturnal, bullet ridden war between vampires and lycans, known to us as werewolves. Kate Beckinsale is Selene, a front runner for the vamps, slashing and shooting her way through various stunts, shootouts and combat scenes in a swanky leather outfit. At a crucial time during the war, she falls in love with an injured lycan (Scott Speedman) and feels conflicted. As far as plot goes that's pretty much all she wrote. You're left to absorb a deafening opera of supernatural action that doesn't let up until the end. The characters tirelessly fight for a full fifteen minutes at the beginning of the movie before a single line of dialogue is even uttered. In a movie so heavily populated by sound, fury and style and so bereft of any actual weight, you better make damn sure the visual and stylistic elements deliver so you have something to keep people in their seatsThis one makes good work of that category, it's visual aesthetic a dark Poe-esque palette, the creatures and violence memorably crafted. The vampires are sullen, nihilistic brooders who sit around in cathedral esque night clubs drinking blood from flute glasses. The werewolves are virile, primal beasts, all sinew, scruff and set - demolishing physicality. It's cool stuff, if you don't examine the 'plot' too carefully and just sit back for the dreary, frenetic, super charged ride that sometimes doesn't even know itself where it's going.

A heckuva good flick,"Maybe I'm getting jaded in my middle age but I don't quite get as wrapped up in flicks as I used to.Not so with UNDERWORLD.  This is a very engaging flick.  Sure, it's evocative of Matrix and its clones but you know what?  Here's a case where a second-generation flick is BETTER than the ones that inspired it!Maybe the secret of UNDERWORLD's success is that it is NOT a Hollywood flick?  The team of Brit, German, and Hungarian filmmakers have succeeded in making a big budget, FX-heavy flick that does not have the oppressive obnoxiousness of flicks like The Matrix or the incredibly awful Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (the REAL Worst IMDB flick of all time!).Hidden away in Hungary, the filmmakers were free to make an interesting flick and not have to deal with studio execs and focus groups.I agree there is not a lot of overt character development.  But what there is is subtle and nicely done.  Michael, for example, is shown as a caring person even during the subway shootout.  This IS the guy who will bring an end to the persecution of the downtrodden werewolves, despite being drawn unwilling into their conflict.  Selene is withdrawn, literally dead inside because of her centuries-old grief for her family.  Had she been wisecracking or even smiling, THAT would have been out of character. Victor is a truly scary depiction of a noble yet ruthless superbeing. Hopefully directors, writers, and stars of more tradition comic book flicks to come will take note, learn, and finally give a real performance rather than just do a Nicholson ham job.One note about Selene's bodysuit--  it's 35 years since Diana Rigg set the model.

What starts from there, is a thoroughly enjoyable dark, mythical, action-adventure film, till the very end.There is a sufficiently engaging plot. The writers have kept it simple. The vampires, in their story, do not possess any powers that gives then any edge over their rivals. That makes the fight and the struggle almost human. The action sequences are choreographed well. They look stylish and thrilling.We are given doses of history and flashbacks, intelligently cut not to drag on and ensuring that the story stays in present.Underworld is not an edge-of-the-seat film but definitely a very neat thriller. Very enjoyable !",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best vampire movie ever made,"I don't understand the negative comments on this movie either. It holds my interest from the very beginning to the very end. It sets itself up for a sequel at the time when Markus awakens. It's sad to think if this movie was so poorly received, there might never be a sequel.Kate is gorgeous and sexy, and when she hops off the top of the building in the opening moments watch for that cute little twitch she gives as she strides away.Viktor is both loving of Selene (Kate) and terrifying. His eyes say it all.The Vampires in the mansion are all beautiful people, dressed to the hilt. The women are just stunning.And Erika is as interesting to watch as Kate.Kraven (Brollen) plays his part very well, and the look on his face when Kate palms him hard in the nose. Yeah!The story answers a question I've wondered about since watching Wolfman and Dracula black and white movies when I was a kid. Where did they originate? Underworld is based on the premise that they're from a common ancestor. That makes sense to me, seeing as how we're dealing with imaginary creatures anyway. Makes more sense than Superman flying because he can jump so well (that was what the comic book answer was.)In many ways, I like this movie every bit as much as the Vampire Chronicles.deltadoc",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Vampire drama over vampire action,"Take typical vampires as aristocrats and make their enemy a very neglected movie monster, the werewolves, set them in modern time and that is underworld.  A good movie for those who like the dark atmosphere of films like blade and matrix.  At first, I thought the trailer gave too much of the film away in terms of discovering the plot.  After seeing it, I was wrong. Underworld has a deep storyline if one pays attention to historical information presented by the characters and leaves a lot of possibilities for graphic novels and decent off shoot movies or sequels.  If you ignore the plot and just watch the action, Underworld doesn't rise above in that area but it doesn't fall off the ladder.  For vampires vs. werewolves, the powers each are known to have and have in the film aren't used often. The war could very well be between two races of human beings and the same footage could be used.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Underworld, a movie with potential, but no direction","As I watched ""Underworld"" I found myself thinking that this movie had one of the greatest plots I could imagine. What could be better than a secret war between vampires and werewolves? The plot is perfect, but the movie did not do the best it could for the plot. It's completely unbelievable that humans would have no knowledge of a battle that has been going on for hundreds of years. Even though this is an action adventure movie, the element of believability still needs to be there in order to make viewers feel connected to the characters and the movie. In my opinion this is the type of movie that a sequel is absolutely necessary, and I hope the people in charge take advantage of this great plot to make a more believable story. If they are able to, ""Underworld"" may become one of the greatest movies in the past years.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I liked it because...,"... nobody's character was black and white. People who you figure early on are dicks end up having a noble streak and the ones you think are good have skeletons in the closet and a serious chip on their shoulders. This made the movie consistently surprising (at least compared to the usual cut-and-dried action movies out there).The movie's been out for almost 10 years now but I only just saw it for the first time (I'm now dating a woman who is into the series and I want to watch the 4th movie with her soon so I'm catching up!)Definitely worth a watch if you like action movies with flawed, three-dimensional characters and no particular morality lesson.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Kate as a ""Hero"" once again . . .","In a world where the preferred police car is a Mercedes-Benz and a blood war has been ongoing between vampires and werewolves for centuries, Kate Beckinsale is as easy on the eyes as she was in Whit Stillman's LAST DAYS OF DISCO or Kenneth Branaugh's take on Shakespeare's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, although she wears considerably more black leather in UNDERWORLD. (Now *there's* an idea - a production of MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING with a leather-clad Hero . . . hmmm).More style over substance - similar to EQUILIBRIUM in that respect, although that film had a little more plot and possibly fewer bullets - although it's hard to tell when you get up in the thousands.A few plot twists along the way but mostly special effects and *sigh* Kate.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Horror flick? Nope way more action,When I saw the movie for the first time. I was told it was a horror flick and that there were some freaky parts. I watched the entire movie and not once did horror come to mind. This is an action flick that just happens to deal with vampires and werewolves. There is not one part of this movie that made me think it was anything but a action movie. If it was a horror there should of been some parts where I was scared and I am easily frightened. This movie isn't even that suspenseful. I really needed to get that out. I keep seeing people say this is a horror flick and it is really annoying me.Other than that i really enjoyed this film. I loved the storyline. Please just no one say this is horror.,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the best Action-Horror films ever made !,"Underworld put's a whole new spin on the vampire/Lycan story line and takes us to a world the likes we've never seen before. Underworld stars Kate Beckinsale as Selene, a beautiful and ruthless vampire assassin(Know as death dealer's)) she has hated the Lycans for as long as she has lived, know Selene and the other death dealers have hunted the lycans to the brink of extinction. Or so they believe. Underworld is a sleek and stylish horror thriller that is sure to captivate and amaze, it doesn't matter how many times you seen it. Kate Beckinsale does an amazing job in the movie you can't stop watching. Underworld blends a sort of Gothic, graphic novel feel to it. It's like the film ""Sin City"", except a little less sinful. This film uses a style that didn't become overly popular until such movies as ""Sin City"" or ""The Dark Knight"" but stands on it's own two feet with the dark and mysterious theme to it. Very few horror films can ever follow this style; or even live up to the style of this film, because it's so unique and different that you can't do anything but love it even those who say they hated it secretly own a copy of this film and don;t want anyone to know. That's what it is, it's a film that you don't tell anyone you've seen and if you have you say you hate it when you secretly love it. This is a guilty pleasure film, and a excellent one at that. Underworld may be forgot in 20 year or so, but those who went to see it and bothered to buy it will always remember it for what it was.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Interesting and Worth Watching,"I was skeptical about this movie from the time the previews came out. I never saw it in theaters or rented it on my own, rather I watched it with a friend at their urging. The word I would have to use is surprised.Underworld is fun, intriguing and catches you with all of the side characters involved. Kate Beckinsale may get top billing but it is the rest of the cast who carries the film from beginning to end. The movie boasts a great number of well thought out characters, giving it more depth than you average Vampire Hunter/Killer movies.There is enough action, back story and suspense to keep you guessing. Is it the best movie you will ever see? No, but you won't be mad after watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Vampires,Werewolves,and a sexy Kate Beckinsale","'Underworld' has everything that horror and action fans should want: violence, action, a good cast, vampires, werewolves, real-looking stunts, and a good storyline.The only thing that this movie lacks is sex.I don't have a problem with there only being one passionate kiss in the movie, but some people wish that there was more ""action"", if you know what I mean.The sequel manage to take care of that problem.If there's one person we should thank for his/her performance in this movie, it should be Kate Beckinsale. Thank God that she took the part of Selene.Without her,the movie probably wouldn't be as good as I am describing how good it really is.I really want to see the third film.It looks really cool.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent movie,"I love this movie. Any time a movie can take a traditional genre or sub-genre and put a new spin on it without falling into the same old cliches of movies past definitely gets the nod from me.It seems that so many vampire and werewolf movies for the last several decades is just cut from the same old cloth of the orginal movies and books that started the whole horror sub-genre of undead creatures (the exception being An American Werewolf in London).The storyline is fantastic, although it might be a bit confusing in the beginning (as a friend of mine said as we were watching it). Just stick with it and it'll all make sense. Think of it as not only a horror movie, but a mystery as well.In my opinion, this movie is a must-see.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It shouldn't  be good, but it is.","Let's face it, this movie has a stupid premise. Vampires and werewolves fighting? Okay... What this movie teaches us, it seems, is that if the writing is good, the story is good, the plot twists are good and the characters are good, it's okay if the premise is a little stupid.Underworld surprised me, and that doesn't generally happen. The non-spiritual take on vampires and werewolves was a real treat, and Michael's flashbacks remind me of nothing so much as Niel Gaiman at his best, but I'd have to say that the most appealing part was the almost skeletal way they played the romance: The hero and heroine have only known each other for two days and... act like they've only known each other for two days? Brilliant! It made what was there so much more resonant and believable and highlighted the paranoia of certain other characters.The biology referenced in this film was close to accurate, although not perfect. For Hollywood, it was Mensa.There was one thing that I found particularly jarring, though: ""Lycan,"" sounds too much like ""lichen"" for the name to be particularly intimidating. That and the ending was a little bit too ""Hulk smash!""Word of advice: I've seen the regular cut and the extended cut, and I have to recommend the former. Many of the ""extra"" scenes were good, but they just didn't fit into the whole.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"And then the war continued, and we got the biggest ball of original crap to ever come out of Hollywood.","This movie, all I can say is that it is awful to the very root. The concept and premise of this movie was just horrible. They tried to make something revolutionary like the Matrix but just with Vampires and Werewolves. I don't know why, but I really hate this movie, I like vampires and Werewolves (which they call Lycans in the movie) but this movie is just ridiculous. I failed to see what was so beautiful and amazing about this movie. It was stupid. I hated the plot, though it sounded a bit original and kind of promising, It wasn't. I haven't seen the sequel yet, I don't plan on it, so I have to say this is the only movie I will dare give a one to because I hated it to the core.Sorry if this sounds more like a rant, but I just do not care for this movie.

Stylish Flick,"Not THE best movie ever, but this is a clever movie that kept my attention throughout. I watch it whenever it comes on TV because it is a movie you can enjoy over and over. Whether for Kate or the werewolf vs vampire battles, this is simply good stuff. The characters are believable, they behave in ways that we would in their situation, and the acting is good as well. If you do not enjoy this movie, it is because it is a genre that you do not enjoy. Period. Summary of the story is that you have a guy who is destined to become a werewolf (lychan is what they are called in the movie) and for some reason Kate's character takes a liking to him. She doesn't know if it's love or like, but she is fond of him and wants to protect him and find out the secrets that the werewolves are hiding. Sit back and enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
GOOD,"As soon as I saw the preview to this film I wrote it off as a silly Matrix rip-off trying to attack a subject that is so tired (vampires/werewolves). I really never had any intention of seeing Underworld until my girlfriend, who saw it in theaters, repeatedly suggested I watch it. After watching the DVD just now I must say that I enjoyed it a lot. I was completely into the story, which is surprisingly rich and engaging. One would have to be a bit na√Øve not to admit that Underworld does indeed borrow from a variety of action films, most notably The Matrix. It should be obvious to any free-thinking person that none of the ideas present in Underworld are original, but what this film does well is take ideas that were established in the past and build on them more. This is by no means a carbon copy of any of the films from which it borrows from. Slow motion gun battles didn't originate with.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Excellent Story With Plenty Of Action,"A fun story about the war between vampires and werewolves with excellent special effects and some brutal violence.The look of the film is interesting, and the practical effects are great. Selene, played by Kate Beckinsale, learns that werewolves are following Michael, a human, and tries to find out why, along the way she learns some disturbing things about her past.Selene is a wonderfully written character and shows how characters can be imagined, and in this case female characters so that everyone is rooting for them.Kate Beckinsale is excellent in the role of Selena, a true example of perfect casting. The special effects are excellent, and practical effects played a special role here, which when done well always look better and more realistic than CGI.What is good to note is that this is an R rating film, in which the violence looks exactly as it should be on film, brutal and bloody. This gives the film intensity and tension and makes it better.Apart from Selena and Michael, there are other interesting characters in the film. It stands out especially here Bill Nighy, who plays Viktor, the leader of the vampire clan. Bill Nighy perfectly embodied Viktor, a sinister and powerful character, and the way he played him is especially interesting. The frantic head movements, the sounds he makes when he's annoyed, his whole personality and movements, Bill Nighy really did a great job.This is a real example of how this type of film should be made.Definitely a film that is worth watching and that gets better with each new viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Juicy red...and tasty,"This movie is, as we say in Puerto Rico, ""brutal""! (pronounced brootaal) It's simply one of the best movies made regarding transylvanian characters. Like in the Matrix, a combination of themes and stuff previously experienced in other movies is successfully combined, but with the unique European style.Most action movies from Europe tend to be very fast, not much development for characters and some slow motion; this is different. Like in Brotherhood of the Wolves, the inner feelings of the characters are more displayed and developed; their past an integral part of the story. The action is very stylish with exotic guns, exotic cars, high fashion in black, good special fx, and very detailed slo-mo takes; very, very nice.What makes Underworld truly different from the others, is what made The Matrix different, a detailed structured story with good foundation and motivation. This is not let's kill everyone because they're bad, there is a very specific and logical reason for what's happening, and the story makes you interested on it. The movie is not that much Matrix, it's more Shakespeare meets Blade. The drama is deep, controversy and intrigue is everywhere, and the twists are surprising, as they should be. This could only come from Europe, I just wish they would use more expensive film or higher resolution cameras, most of the movie is kind of grainy and we're already accustomed to the sharpness and solidness that 21st century movies should go for; but that's a minor glitch.As far as vampires and werewolves go, the movie is super. A deeper kind of creature story with attractive styling, but enough blood as to not let you forget...these are monsters of the night, they feed on humans.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
great concept- see the trailer instead,"Not bad for a female Blade movie. plot is not as light as it appears and has some interesting premises (eg. the fighting cousins concept, slaves vs masters). Lotsa guns, action sequences well done but few in number (hence the trailer is the best part about it) and the movie has an overachieving low budget feel (a la Equilibrium) rather than the cinematic opulance of Matrix for example. Beckinsale combines fragility with a lethal attitute, not a bad action heroine start. The love interest guy was very dull, didn't portray an MD type convincingly, and Kraven was a whining muskrat of a vampire, so much so that I was laughing at all his line deliveries by the end. The vampires were very effete creatures and it was a wonder how they could ever lord it over their lower class brethren, especially with the day disadvantage (the only classical vampire weakness brought up in the movie). Overall, the movie is pretty cool and as flashy as the fake silvery 'silver nitrate' the vampires used...don't know if it's cool enough to be pre-wired for a sequel though.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Worthless plot, dialogue that could fit on a single page","Okay, i only saw this movie because i was the last man standing at a LAN party, and had nothing to do. I didn't expect much of the movie, but this was even worse than i expected! The plot is worthless, simply a conflict between vampires and werewolfs (given a new, fancy name, but same thing), based on the usual stuff; a couple of lies and a tragic love story. Well, both sides are just convinced that the other species are goin' down, because, well, they don't really know, because it is forbidden for them to check up on past events! What a load of crap, reveals a really weak storywriter!! For me it looked like they tried to hide the weak storyline by having as little dialogue as possible, to make the story a little more mysterious, and many of the conversations is about 2-4 lines, attended by some really weak, not-very-convincing acting. I could probably keep on, the stunts are bad too, you can actually see clearly that the characters aren't hitting each other, they jump very unrealistically etc. Well, that was all for now, avoid the movie at all costs, not worth your time and/or money.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

FilmCreature Reviews 'Underworld',"'Underworld' is a film totally misunderstood by critics nationwide. This is not the kind of movie you take seriously. You will not weep or be shaken with emotion. Instead, with the right mindset (and surrounded by friends each with a bowl of popcorn) you might just have a fun time watching it.Kate Beckinsale does some great work here. This is no Academy Award-winning (or even Saturn Award-winning) character play, but Selene is such a sleek, lethal vamp that we can't help but just love her to death. Bill Nighy does great things with his vamp as well; Viktor is one of those great villains that Satan would flee from (yes, I just quoted Ebert). Scott Speedman is effective but not amazing. As for Shane Brolly...just try to ignore him. And finally, the lovely Sophia Myles. I actually liked her character quite a lot; her conniving, quietly lustful vampire Erika is great, but I would have liked to have seen more of her scheming ways.'Underworld' is obvious campy, but it's not boring, which is the number one thing it has going for it. Boring camp is tragic and awful at the same time, but 'Underworld', fortunately, has some nice performances and great effects, and the Gothic environments conjure up memories of 'Dark City' and 'The Matrix' in which no place is safe. Not even for a super-powered vampire princess.3/4",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A load of...,"The horror and action genres have become so overloaded with clich√©s that to some extent, they now must resort to great lengths in order to seem mildly unique, leave alone inventive. Underworld attempts to become unique by pitting two overused creatures of myth and legend against one another. Unfortunately, the writer/director is a first-timer, as are both of the writers where feature films are concerned. Sometimes, one can disguise the fact with flashes of brilliance or inventiveness. Nobody would suspect that RoboCop was Edward Neumeier's first sold screenplay, for example. Unfortunately, Underworld wastes no time in showing that Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman, and Danny McBride have about as much writing talent between them as Edward Neumeier's nose hairs displayed in RoboCop. Indeed, a comparison is fair between RoboCop and Underworld because both try to reinvent a stale genre. Underworld fails where RoboCop succeeded because it has no idea when to break the rules, or how. The fact that it dates itself without stopping for breath does not help.Underworld concerns itself with the seemingly endless battle between the aristocratic vampires and the savage, ornery werewolves. In another attempt to distinguish itself, the word Lycan is used in place of werewolf, despite the fact that Lycanthrophy is generally used to refer to morphing into a number of animals these days. And that highlights one of the most major problems with the film. The makers have a poor attitude, having the nerve to claim that audiences were indifferent to the film because they did not ""get"" things like the use of the word Lycan. This attitude has apparently not changed in the sequel, where the screenplay progressively reverts to werewolf. The problem here is that this telegraphs both the kind of audience the makers were aiming for, in addition to their contempt for the audience. From the editing to the hideous photography, Underworld announces itself as an R film trying to pander to a PG-13 audience. As a result, it winds up in no man's land, trying to appeal to everyone and pleasing no one.Failing to help matters is that the characters have all the extra dimensions of puddles, and the actors are unable to combat the effect. Bill Nighy looks especially uncomfortable trying to deliver his atrocious dialogue, which is heavily burdened with trying to set up the rules instead of putting them into effect. Which only serves to highlight the film's most fatal flaw. In its attempt to make something the audience have never seen without the expertise to make it make sense, Underworld gets bogged down in exposition to such an extent that the middle section could be used to prove Einstein's theory of relativity. In Einstein's most simple explanation of the theory, when one spends an hour with a beautiful woman like Kate Beckinsale, it seems like a mere second, but when one spends a second with their hand on a hot stove, it seems like an hour. The second act of Underworld, in which Selene attempts to secure Michael against those seeking to use him to their ends and expose the truth about Viktor, is like having a wart burned out with liquid nitrogen. The middle of Underworld literally makes one feel as if time is slowing down in order to amplify one's discomfort.Apparently, the makers of the film felt the boredom was insufficient, because they have delivered an extended cut that replaces eleven minutes of existing footage while adding another twelve. While I cannot comment on the extended cut of the film, I can say that it would take a lot more than replacing eleven minutes to address the film's most stunning problem. In contrast to the recent sequel, in which Selene and Michael managed to show enough character to make viewers care about their plight, the entire cast here might as well be dolls with human mouths blue-screened over theirs. One knows even less about them when the film is over compared to when it began. Viktor suffers the worst from this terrible storytelling, with his character having no other purpose to betray his own kind and be an insufferable so-and-so. Matter of fact, the only characters who do not warrant a good punch in the face throughout their screen time are Selene and Michael, which is just as well when you consider that they are the characters upon which the entire film hangs. Even George Lucas was able to give characters like Anakin Skywalker a second dimension during his prequel trilogy, if only barely.As I said in my comments about Underworld: Evolution, the sequel is a bit of an improvement. But when you have a lead-in like this, even the third Matrix episode constitutes an improvement. By comparison, the two recent X-Men films directed by Bryan Singer take a first act that generates tear-inducing sympathy for the most important characters from an educated audience, and adds a second act that has the audience cheering on the mutants as they wage war, regardless of their actual goodness or whatever. By comparison, Underworld is a sleeping pill followed by a dash of coffee. Due to differences in the way my neurochemistry works, neither have a discernible effect upon me, and I would not be overly generous in the description of the effect they have on others. And thus, the failure of Underworld is summarised: in spite of trying to pass for adult-oriented entertainment, it barely has enough to excite the teen audience the studio had in mind. In fact, I feel I am insulting teenagers with that sentence.I gave Underworld a two out of ten. It is too good to be bad enough to be good. Thus, it winds up firmly stuck in no man's land. I have heard it jokingly called Underpants by detractors, and I say if the shoe fits, then wear it.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Cool,"This vampire and werewolf monster mashup takes itself too seriously for how silly it becomes. The performances are all over the place and the lore is overcomplicated. However, I do have a soft spot for it. Len Wiseman has a strong eye and a strong sense of action mechanics, so even if the script isn't up to the task, there's still a fair amount to enjoy. Oh, and Bill Nighy demonstrates that he's the best by acting the crap out of a silly costume and monster makeup.There's been a war between vampires and werewolves (ugh...lycans) for six hundred years ever since the lycan Lucian (Michael Sheen) was killed by Kraven (Shane Brolly). The fight continues into modern day vaguely Eastern European city where everyone speaks English all the time (Budapest, apparently). There Kate Beckinsale's Seline is a Death Dealer, a vampire on the lookout for lycans to kill in their war that seems to be winding down. Until one night when she tracks a pair of lycans who are following Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman).The opening of the film is rather cool, and something I can get into. There's a voiceover from Beckinsale that explains everything (all of which we get later again, which tells me that this was added in post-production as a reaction to test screenings), but other than that it's a blue-cool series of action beats as our introduction to the world. Vampires facing off against werewolves with guns and biting. Since the film isn't really asking for emotional involvement from the audience, instead it's a window into the new world that we're about to wade into. See? There's some intelligence to this film. Not a whole lot, but some, and that's why I can't actually dislike it.The human is some kind of genetic key to the lycans who will be able to absorb the viruses from both vampires and lycans to create some kind of new race (an abomination, once vampire labels the idea) and bring justice to the vampires who subjugated them for centuries before trying to exterminate them. In the middle of this fray is Sheen as Lucian who does his best with the limited material he has. For all the issues this movie has, there are a handful of seriously talented actors at play, and Sheen is the first evidence of that. He imbues Lucian with a surprising amount of depth that the role doesn't deserve, but Sheen is a classy guy and a quality actor, and he pulls it off.The other end of this is Kraven's Shane Brolly. This guy is awful. Like, I have no idea how he got through a single audition. He's not just free from the burden of charisma, he's actively bad. Every single line delivery is cringeworthy. And he's, of course, written terribly. I mean, the guy's name is Kraven, the actor's hamming it up horribly, and the dialogue is all terrible. Yes, he's going to end up being a bad guy. Might as well have just hung a neon sign around his neck announcing it, it's that subtle. He has designs on Seline, but we all know that the story of his bravery to kill Lucian 600 years ago is going to be wrong even before we figure out who Lucian is.Where the movie also struggles is all the intrigue. There's something akin to a palace coup going on, and none of it is particularly interesting or well-explained. There are three elder vampires of a sort. Two are in hibernation, and one leads. How or why this entire system came about is completely unexplained or makes a whole lot of sense, but one rules for a hundred years, goes into hibernation, and another takes their place. At the moment, the vampires are ruled by Amelia with Marcus due to come up. Seline was turned into a vampire by Viktor, though, the third ruler due to rule after Marcus. There's real potential here for the relationship between Viktor and Seline, but he ends up introduced too late, I think. Seline, in a desperate bid to get help, awakens Viktor at about the halfway point.It feels like the emotional core of the film should have been the father/daughter relationship between Viktor and Seline. Instead, there are emotional threads going in every direction, from Kraven wanting Seline as his bride, to Seline and Michael falling for each other, to Lucian reflecting on the murder of his vampire wife which started the whole war, to even another female vampire's desires for Kraven (must be the wooden acting). There needed to be a culling of these side characters and subplots at the script stage, bringing Viktor to the beginning, and probably just axing the whole hibernation of the elders thing.Of course, the point is the action, and I like it. As I wrote before, Wiseman has a strong eye for action, and he provides fun views into the action beats that keep it all from feeling dull or incomprehensible. He varies it up as lycans change from their human form to their werewolf form to modify the fight, even giving Bill Nighy the kind of moment that sells his strength and awesomeness as he single handedly strangles a werewolf with relative ease. The action bits are where this film is at its best.Oh, and Kate Beckinsale looks really good. It helps that she's actually a perfectly fine actress and can deliver her dialogue with a modicum of conviction, which makes her scenes with Kraven kind of hilarious since Brolly is just the worst. Have I said that Brolly is hilariously bad? Because he's hilariously bad.So, this is a script that needed some work before the film went into production. As it stands, the movie's fine. I haven't seen it in years, and I ended up enjoying it more than I had expected. It's not great. It's not even really good, but it's a decent way to spend 2 hours.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a nice shocker,"for one reason or another, this movie was given mediocre reviews before it even came out. fans and critics alike were comparing it to ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""The Matrix,"" and various other dark and/or romance movies. i went in thinking the same because 2 of the lead stars, Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman, made their names known in such movies. but i am here to tell you that some people should not count their chickens before they hatch--this movie was GREAT! Len Wisemen knew what it was he wanted and he delivered. what made this movie so superb was that everything made to make this movie(music, lighting, wardrobe)seemed like it was made FOR this movie. and of course, the cast(along with the makeup crew) added the finishing touches. i won't go into the plot of the movie, but i will tell you that the previews were a bit misleading, in a good way. there is no way any of the previews could possibly show a viewer what this movie has to offer. it's not gothic, it's not romantic, and it's not gory, but it is still a great movie. i will not compare it to any other movie because there is nothing to which i can compare it. just go to this movie to see a good movie, not Oscar winning performances or gratuitous violence. for action, originality, and an overall well made movie, go see Underworld.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great visual treat, showing traditional film techniques at their best","Underworld is a film that unfairly draws comparisons with other films; the matrix, blade etc... In my view it harks back to the good old days of story telling, using CGI techniques only when completely necessary. It is very stylistic from the start, brooding, dark ... but not too dark, I can't be doing with films that make it so dark you can't see what's going on. The heroine (Kate Beckinsale) is a vampire warrior, caught in a battle between the decadent world of the vampires and the rough and ready world of the werewolves. The stereotypes of the vampires and Lycans (werewolves) are a little galling and I'm sure neither would have any trouble identifying each other. The Lycans all look like Sabretooth in X-men and the Vamps, Lestat in Interview with a vampire.The plot is good and I feel directorially, for a debut, it was outstanding. Should I hear of any other films by Len Wiseman I would definitely watch them. Without giving too much away, the plot follows Selene, the heroine, and a human that holds the key to the futures of both Vampires and Lycans. It neither acknowledges nor discredits any other films that might be drawn into the genre, treading its own path in an entertaining enough way. It draws the viewer to make assumptions that will later be challenged as the well weighted plot unveils.Lucian (The leader of the Lycans) plays the obligatory English baddie (Well Welsh actually) and does it very well. He oozes a charisma I wasn't expecting to find, and to be honest didn't find in any of the other cast members. Kate Beckinsale (Although absolutely stunning) doesn't make you believe she is a vampire warrior.The special effects are good. Traditional methods, such as wire working and makeup are done to great effect. Stunts are effortless and add to the films overall ambiance.Overall this is an entertaining, well put together film which's draws the open minded viewer in and engages them in the dark world of god damn shit sucking vampires. (I had to get a lost boys quote in). I cannot finish without mentioning the PVC suit Kate wears.......hmmmmm",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Wonderful movie. Cool,slick,sexy and alittle romantic","Underworld is a wonderful movie. It is cool,slick and sexy. Alittle romantic too. I was hoping for more with the love story but what they did with it was appropriate and awesome.Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman did wonderful work and have sizzling chemistry. The action scenes were cool. The plot was good, as were the characters. The history and back stories were very cool and you really felt for the characters of Selene,Michael and Lucian.I enjoyed this movie. I liked it better than Blade or Matrix but that's just my taste.

I am stunned at the raves on this board for this dog!,"It is a sad comment when the best I can say about a movie is that it had incredible sound design.  Otherwise, this movie is a dog and don't let anyone else fool you.  Not an ounce of humor in what Beckinsdale said in an interview was supposed to be ""camp.""  I couldn't help but wonder why even in a hospital scene with just humans no one could turn on a d**n light!  I had a flicker of hope when long asleep vampire leader Viktor is resurrected, but my hopes were soon dashed by tooo many car commercials that seem to appear out of nowhere as our main character screeches around town.  Stay home and rent Blade 1 or 2 - and that is a scary thought!  Even ""The Keep"" was better as a bad movie!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not Bram Stoker's Dracula, but hella cool in its own right","I think this movie will be hated on namely because it trounces this summer's big budget action movies in every department for only a tenth of what it cost to make the major releases.  I paid $19.50 for me and my girl to see this film and it was not at all disappointing.In fact, it rocked.  And hard!If you've seen a preview, then you already know the film looks good.  It is very stylish and heavy on the atmospherics.  There was a surprising and action packed story with characters one grows to like.  The creators do a very good job of conveying the realm these creatures dwell in and the war between the covens of vampyres and the dens of werewolves.You'll read a lot of reviews screaming ""derivative! derivative!"" and then mentioning names like the Matrix and Blade.  Don't believe the hype.  The Matrix by no means whatsoever originated leather clad badasses.  By the same token, Blade did not originate sword wielding immortals nor the nonmagical, nonmystic take on vampyres.  UNDERWORLD does a great job of respecting known vampyre/wolven lore and adds to it and paving the road to an intriguing future.  There's no doubt a second installment is forthcoming.  There must be, as it would be too great a waste of such a terrific setup.Bottom line is that UNDERWORLD does deliver on the action and never falls prey to cheese.  It follows its own rules and doesn't fall into the horrific trap of ""letting the hero/ine just because s/he is the hero/ine."" Everything makes sense and comes together and you'll have great time getting there.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
UselessWorld (dvd),"This movie had got all to be a hit: A Hollywood icon (Beckinsale), mythic fantasy characters (vampire & werewolf), and appropriate locations (Romania)....However, the result is a disaster:I watched the DVD with the director's comments, and even though i was surely tired by other reasons, I confess that i slept in front of this.Why ? What i have seen was just senseless gunfights ""√† la ""Matrix"". Then, the actualization of the mythology of those fantasy figures is sometimes ""too much"": the werewolves have to be to be more ""CAT"" like! Atlast, the atmosphere is killed by the colorization of the screen. Everything, every one is tinged from blue.... Ah Technicolor.....As there is a sequel scheduled in 2006, I know already one movie i won't see.In conclusion, Prefer ""Van Helsing"" for a hit with the same ingredients: Beckinsale, Romania & vampires....",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Easily the best pure vampire movie I have seen,"Before I went into see this movie, I was a little.. concerned, simply because of a couple of reviews I had seen. The trailers seemed like a dream because of the style and the content which I found really appealing. Come on, werewolves, vampires in a dark gothic setting battling it out.. if done well it could be a masterpiece.It is a masterpiece I can tell you now - never does it bore, but the story does captivate you, continues to twist and in the end it would be very odd if you were not satisfied on the storyside. The cinematography is again superb, giving you classic slightly grey view of everything and even openly shows some cliched gothic backdrops to indicate that it is very much the world that you would have thought of.The acting is more than adequate for something like this but the visual effects are great as well - it is not the Matrix and only shows the 'slow down' scene twice in the entire movie, yet the action is always interesting as you follow it all on screen.At the end of the day, I felt I was there, in a world where vampires and lycans existed and where at each others throats for their own reasons. And if this movie managed to achieve that, and had me coming out of the movie going 'wow that was superb.. Ill be watching that again, I want the DVD and I hope desperately for a sequel' you know you have something special.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A rattling good yarn...,"Strong performances, a taut storyline and well-handled direction make this an excellent action film. Beckinsale shines as Selene, and Nighy's turn as Viktor has me halfway convinced that he actually IS a creature of the night. The effects are thorough without being intrusive, and there's no sense of ""CGI overload"". Scott Speedman handles the role of Michael well, conveying the character's disorientation and confusion excellently, as well as bringing real presence to the d√©nouement. I'm going to mention Beckinsale again, because she's simply fabulous; coolly distant one minute, furiously impassioned the next, she brings a welcome range and depth to a role that could so easily have been botched (sorry Alba, there's only one Dark Angel, and she drives a Maserati... *grin*). A film that doesn't pretend to be anything other than excellent entertainment, and it doesn't have to. Thoroughly enjoyable throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than i expected,"There is a great war between Vampires and Lycans (Werewolf). Selene (A cool Beckinsale, is one of the werewolves who is fighting to avenge her family's death. However she uncovers a plan where the werewolves are looking for a human (Scott Speedman), and its up to her to protect herself and Speedman as both the Werewolves and Vampires search for them. To be honest i expected this film to suck. I mean the tone is similar to Blade, the fight scenes are out of the Matrix, and its got just about everything from every Vampire, Werewolf and Goth film out there. However, Underworld is a pleasant surprise as it tries to at least give put some thought on familiar trodden territory. The storyline is pretty well throughout, even though with the amount of subplots and backstory it does get confusing at times. Beckinsale is excellent as Selene as she seems very capable when it comes to the action scenes, and she wont let fellow Vampires stop her from doing the right thing. She is always focused on acheiving her goal without anyone stopping her. Scott Speedman is perfectly cast as the confused human (Michael) who gets bitten by a Lycan and is protected by Selene from the Lycans who are out to search for him. The action scenes are excellent. From the Vampires using an arsenal of gun s to the camera changing to Werewolves viewpoint (Which is inspired by Sam Raimi), there are some of the best scenes in terms of action you will probably see all year. The only thing i don't like is the sometimes confusing plot and the exposition, but that could be because i expected the film to have a thin storyline when i walked into the cinema. However a few scenes don't work very well which have very little aside from a few characters talking about certain plot points for a few minutes. However this is only a minor quibble and it shouldn't distract from the entertaining film too much. Even though this film hasn't got the budget or hype that other blockbusters films do, it deserves to do as successful as them. Who knows this may even evolve into a cult classic.8/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad In Every Respect,"The movie delivers nothing at all plain and simple. The characters are truly poorly written, the acting is horrid, the action is barely there, the music sounds like some horrible KMFDM rip off. Lets start off with the characters, wow vampires being euro trash......groundbreaking, werewolves being brutish.......who would of thought? i mean seriously here people the characters in this film were ALL one dimensional, the dialog was wretched and contrived. Now moving on to the acting, this is gonna be rough, there is 1 good actor in the film: Bill Nighy, everyone else is absolutely dreadful, Beckinsale chews scenery like nobody i have ever seen before, though thats nothing new for her, the chemistry between her and speedman is ice cold, not to mention there is no reason for either of them to like each other, they don't warm up to each other or have a change of heart, the dialog is so stilted that it generally feels like these two people have no desire for the project, its obviously just a paycheck for both of them. The Action......well there wasn't much at all so whats to say really, just very boring run of the mill action scenes WHEN they do occur,which isn't often. The music keeps in theme with the vampires being eurotrash, its all synthetic, pulsing garbage to try and inspire angst into the pathetic little goth losers who seem to be in love with this movie, its KMFDM without the point.Plain and simple folks, this movie is horrid, the sequel is worse, avoid it at ALL costs",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It had twists I wasn't expecting and a story that kept me intrigued. The acting was well done. I thought Kate Beckinsdale was beautiful and kick-a** at the same time.

A GREAT horror film,"Vampires vs. werewolves. Sexy vampire woman (Kate Beckinsale) saves a muscular good-looking human (Scott Speedman) who is being chased by the werewolves. But why?There's a LOT more going on there but I'll let you find out for yourself. Basically this movie is VERY loud, full of ferocious gun fights (don't ask me why the wolves and vampires fight it out with guns--it just works and Beckinsale looks GREAT firing off a gun in each hand), washed out color, dark atmospheric sets, tons of fog, loud music on the soundtrack, plenty of blood, a very deep plot (for a horror film), some scary looking werewolves that can run along the walls and ceilings (!!!) and all done at a breathless pace. The damned movie only stops occasionally for the plot and then zips ahead full speed.The acting doesn't really matter--this movie is all about violence and visuals. That being said, Beckinsale (and the other vampires) look great in leather and I LOVE the long leather coats they wear when going to battle. Speedman is bad but, seriously, the poor guy has NOTHING to work with! The only other notable is Shane Brolly who basically sneers his way through his role...but it works.Next to ""House of 1000 Corpses"" this is one of the best horror films released this year. It looks like a masterpiece compared to crap like ""Cabin Fever"" and ""Cold Creek Manor"". Also there's a thankful lack of humor and camp in this film. It takes everything dead serious and plows ahead. I sat there totally engrossed during the entire film and grinning like an idiot because it was so GOOD! Basically a must-see for all horror fans.Also there's a set-up for a sequel...let's hope that DOESN'T happen. No horror film has ever had a good sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I really enjoy watching movies about vampires and this one just had a lot of action and love. When Michael becomes a vampire and werewolf he is totally hot and I would love to meet both him and Kate. Of course I don't think what Viktor did was right, he liked to Selene. The wolves didn't kill her family he did.

Lame is a Four Letter Word,"We have a hot female vampire in tight black leather. We have the cranky goth-wannabe male vampire who obviously has the hots for her, unrequited. We have ages-long war with another immortal species. We have forbidden love. We have a ""cool"" term for something that has a common and universal name, i.e., ""Lycan""(thrope) for ""werewolf"" -- and the common name has to be used anyway, to explain what ""Lycan"" means. Lots of black, lots of flowing long coats, lots of oooh, isn't this just the most romantic? Well, it's not. There's nothing innovative about the script, the characters, or even the visuals. This movie is intended to appeal to teenaged boys, with Kate Beckinsale stalking dour-faced about in tight shiny black stuff (cameras in National Geographic documentaries don't close up so much on the hindquarters of their prey); and to teenaged goth girls, with the pale-faced loser vampires moping about like the world's on their shoulders. As has been mentioned before, this movie was released between Matrix instalments, and it shows, very painfully.The one saving grace in this movie is Bill Nighy, as Victor. There are very few men who could put on that much makeup and still deliver lines with such delightful, cutting viciousness.I want my two hours back.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"solid comic-genre movie, great casting and direction","I thought this movie was really great.  If it wasn't under the shadow of the continuing Matrix trilogy I think it would have done a lot better in the box office.  This was definitely more of a comic/graphic novel movie along the lines of the Crow than a horror/fantasy movie.  I can see how die-hard goths and horror folks would have problems with it, but I think the detail, acting, sets, etc. all make it a really solid movie.  Kate B. is a great heroine, strong and still feminine. More science-based than myth-based, I like the deal that vamps and lycans have viral blood diseases and aren't of magic/mystic origin.My only complaint is that the action is really gun-heavy.  I would have liked to see more of the natural talents of the vampires used (if any). Lycans seem really strong and go through a dramatic physical transformation, but aside from a few hints of enhanced strength, vampires seem only to have fangs and blue eyes when angry.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cool Mod Vamp Flick,"Ugh, aren't you sick of these vampire flicks where they're all magical and violate the laws of physics? I was too and not expecting much when I saw this movie but it rocked!Selene the vamp is a death dealer killing Lycans (guess Len Wiseman doesn't know his Latin very well) she tracks two and finds they're following a human. She saves him but he gets bitten. Why doesn't she kill him when she finds out he's becoming a wolfie? Because it's Scott Speedman and you would never kill him.It's dark but not archaic and artfully done. Another thing I love, it's the first action flick with a female lead I've ever seen where she doesn't wear stiletto heels, a push up bra, doesn't have to show her, um, wits, and play dumb. She just kicks butt and doesn't apologize for it.If you like imaginative action and want some entertainment for a few hours dig this movie!

Entertainment which does not entertain,"Visually unattractive, Underworld looks like it has been shot as black and white through a blue filter, causing a dull look. Sets are ugly. Kate Beckinsale in leather? Yawn. There is lot of action and posing, but no style, fun or atmosphere. And that's the point of the vampire/werewolf movies, right? Be entertaining? Of course Kate get to do lot of action scenes, and after all, every run-of-the-mill action movie features such heroines so the Hollywood actresses can say: ""It is really surprising to see a film like this - with a strong woman!"" But her character does not seem a vampire at all. Sorry, but vampires should be a bit more vampiric. And better dressers. She just run around in her Matrix-inspired wardrobe shooting and killing werewolves like a female reject from John Woo movie. Believe me, I did not expected to see some pretentious artsy crap.

At least it knew what it wanted to be and do and done it. The characters were well thought out and the actor's portraying them done really well.But the problem I found was that the film was to long. Do we really need this much drama in all the in between times? By in between times, I mean the sometimes dragged out drama in between all the action scenes.

Underworld Was GRRRRRRREAT!!!,"I saw this film on DVD first, came over it by accident while i was bored at my grandmothers. But my god when i finished that film i just had to watch it again, and again, and again.It was pure genius, and this kind of a film coming from Len Wiseman where this was his first real directing job, i mean wow he can direct. I loved the whole story the Hybrid theory as it was, the fact that no one has ever really thought 'What if you crossed a Werewolf sorry lycan with a Vampyre'.And you can relate to every person, Lycan or Vampyre. You have Raze a big brute of a Lycan but who solemnly pledges his allegiance to Lucian and Lucian the leader small in size but that doesn't stop him from casting his long shadow over his many minions. Then you have Selene, unbelievably beautiful yet dangerous, and Viktor the most powerful Vampyre by far, his stance alone can scare anyone or anything into cowering.OK so Speedman kinda sucked, but the simple fact that Beckinsale and Knighy where absolutely awesome just completely overpowers your urge to rein hate on Speedman. And the special effects weren't half bad either, there were a few bits where you could see the transition to CGI or suited guys. And the gun fight at the start, when i first watched it i was kinda to enthralled and of course loved it, and i love every scene to this day, but my god that subway scene shows that Lycans and Vampyres cant aim at all.But again all the bad points were completely washed away by the good. This is a great film and easily re watchable material.

"Cool movie, great visuals.","I won't waste time summarizing the events of the movie.  Let's just say that in the packed theatre I was in, the audience was enraptured for the entire length of the film.The vampires were represented well, particularly Selene (Beckinsale) in her death dealer outfit.  Whatever the designer was going for, she came up with a costume that looked good, but at the same time looked absolutely functional for Selene's particular line of work (Killing Lycans.)Character development could have been a little stronger, but was still good, considering how many secondary characters were used besides Speedman and Beckinsale.I give this movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nothing original.,"I hoped this would be a really cool movie. It showed some potential. I kind of figured it wouldn't quite cut it though. It was entertaining enough to keep me awake for two hours but the plot is somewhat muddled and confusing. The movie spends most of it's time presenting stylish shots of vampires shooting werewolves and likewise. Things go boom a lot and there are some serious cliches, some guy's head gets sliced with a sword and then after he stands there for a few minutes the top of his head slides off. How many times have I seen THAT this year? The action sequences are also very confusing. The vampires and werewolves all wear similar drab grey clothing and combined with the drab grey filming and poor editing the end result is an insane jigsaw puzzle of who's killing who. Most of the time it is impossible to tell what's going on. There are huge editing/screenplay issues. Someone is credited as Michael's Girlfriend in the end credits. If you are paying close attention you will see that she is one of the bystanders killed during the first ultra stylish vampire vs werewolf action sequence. She must have been really special to him too, since he doesn't seem to care AT ALL that she's dead. He doesn't even mention her at anytime through the rest of the film.But to sum it up, what you've got here is a whole bunch of soap opera actors playing unconvincing vampires and werewolves and a fairly bland screenplay with a lot of shooting and cliche dialogue. It was very clear to me after watching this that the filmakers' intention was simply to cash in on the goth/vampire subculture and not actually to produce a good movie. Then they figured they would throw in some cool Matrix moves. Why not? Everyone else is doing it.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Out of the way traditional mythology!!,"Out of the way traditional mythology!! Here comes the all-new, all-different mythology!Remember when Vampires were solitary undead creatures that fed on the blood of the living? They were scared by symbols of religious power, hurt by garlic and sunlight, cast no reflections, could mentally dominate someone weaker than them, change their form into a bat and the only way to kill them was to put a stake through their hearts.Well, those are the ""old"" style, stuffy vampires (*rolleyes*). The ""new"" age vampires are sleek and sexy and like to hold partys in elaborate mansions. If holy artifacts or garlic bother them, there is no mention of this and there is no no-reflection problem. They like to wear tight, black clothing, roam around the urban sprawl at nighttime and use guns. A lot.Remember when Werewolves were solitary creatures with tortured souls that were *cursed* with lycanthropy? The full moon made them turn into murderous, half-wolf creature fated to kill until someone was able to put them out of their misery.Well, those were the ""old"" style, stuffy werewolves. The ""new"" age werewolves live in packs under the city and can change their form at will. It is not so much as a ""curse"" of lycanthropy, but a way to get super-hero powers of supernatural strength, agility and invulnerability. Also, they like to use guns. A lot.It's a sad fact that what the modern world continues to call ""vampires"" and ""werewolves"" and almost completely different creatures from their originals.Anyway, how was the movie otherwise? It was okay. As others have mentioned, it was an action style Vampire/Werewolf version of Romeo & Juliet. As I mentioned, since the original ideas of Vampires and Werewolves are long gone, you just have to assume that the creatures in this movie are doing what they are supposed to be. The feel of the movie is more like watching someone playing a video and you missed the first part. The person playing know what is going on and accept what is happening, but what is being presented to you is missing explanation.One of the jokes about action movies is that the main character can go single-handedly against a bunch of enemies, with bullets whizzing everywhere, and walk away unscathed, while the enemies are all dead. Well, this movie goes overboard on this. In one scene, the main character, Selena is confronted by 5 machine-gun weilding enemies. She is crouched down at the far end of a room and fires her pistols, straight-armed at the enemies that are using the doorway as cover. Meanwhile, 5 of them unload machine guns into the room she is in. The result? 5 dead enemies, while she walks away unscathed. Why are these Lycans so scary?Despite having Vampire and Werewolves (traditional ""horror"" creatures), this is in no way a horror movie. It is an action movie. I cant even say that this movie has nice combat scenes, because whenever Selena was confronted by an enemy, there was no suspense, no assumption that she may get hurt. It was like she invulnerable (or what gamers would call ""being in God mode""). *Yawn*I thought that the Vampires were a bunch of prissy, lad-de-da, gothic party goers and really, really wanted them to die. Even though the Lycans were ""supposed"" to be the bad guys, I felt pity for them because they seemed downtrodden and had little hope, where the Vampires lived the life of luxury (this is explained in the movie, though).I also, couldnt help but notice the underlying social undertones: The brutish, animalistic Werewolves were all male, yet the sleek, sexy, charismatic vampires were males OR females, withthe lead character being a female. Of course, it was the Lycans plan to bring them all together in a form of harmony and joining and it was the Lycans that were enslaved by the Vampires.Overall, I give the movie a 5 out of 10. The story was rather blase for the 1st two-thirds, but picked up once you found the ""true"" story. The action scenes were pointless, especially the ones involving the main character.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No bullet time!!!!,"My god, an action film without bullet time?!?! Could this be? Filmakers not copying the matrix fight scenes? WOW. When I saw the trailer I was expecting another run of the mill matrix copy, but imagine my surprise when there was not a bullet trail in sight! Although they do wear leather trenchcoats and catsuits etc, which is a bit matrixy, the film itself is in fact quite original. They try to stick to a storyline but they also weave the action into it very well, creating a nice cinematic experience. The idea of modern day vampires, which although is not new, is very cool and it is in my opinion much better than the age old rubbish vampires that were killed by wooden sticks, and were scared of two pieces of wood stuck together in a cross shape.A very nice part of the film is the fact that kate beckinsale is in it, therefore making the film much better :D heehee...But seriously, I think this film is very good, bu for those of you expecting a bloodbath, you're going to be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"the best movie i have went and seen since ""lotr: the two towers""","this was the best movie that i have seen since the ""two towers."" And i have seen some good movies this year.  I didn't take my eyes off the screen for a second the entire movie.  Even though it was dark and gothic looking, it was a very beautiful movie, and the director did a grat job. Kate Beckinsale is hot.  Sooo hot.  She was really hot as a vamipire, and she even looks 10 times better normally.  This was not a scary movie, but the lichens were visually terrifying.

Leather,"It's funny how one or two bad performances can drag the whole thing down. Kraven (Shane Brolly) didn't even fit in with the rest of the strong performances - strong given it is a special effects soup that defies the rules of both vampire and Werewolf ""accepted lore"" for no real effect.  Even if you buy the bio-engineering medical technology portion, there is no possibility in any tradition that I am familiar with that the dead can get pregnant.  Maybe I'm a purist, but that bothered me.  And the instant healing is getting a little crazy - The whole highlander x-men thing is getting out of hand.  I think the point has always been that Vampires and Werewolves can eventually recover from anything if they don't lose the will to live.  But instant healing is a little too far out there even for me. Beckinsale is easy on the eyes, but I had hoped for a little more range of emotion.  Sheen and Speedman do remarkably well with what they had to work with and Nighy is wonderfully over the top as the king of the hill should be.  My last gripe is that not enough was made of the vampiric speed.  If they are not going to be shape shifters (as some are and some aren't depending on the movie) then the speed has got to be there.  They started to touch on it with the ""super being cross breed"" in the final show down with Viktor but then they just glossed it over.  Plot point deductions drag this down for a high eight in my way of thinking to a low five.  That being said I might watch it again and see if I feel the same.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fresh new creative twist on the genre,"I was pleasantly surprised by Underworld. It definitely has some parallel's to Matrix along with similarities with the classic vampire and werewolf movies, yet it incorporates a fresh new formula on the genre. I thoroughly enjoyed the depth and history to the story, and it goes to show that this is not a cookie cutter film. The style and cinematography is reminiscent of Matrix, yet the brooding ambience and dreary gothic locales reminded me of something out of The Crow or Bladerunner, yet it still retains enough original creativity to make it something new and fresh instead of a facsimile of other films. People looking for another ""Blade"" movie will be disappointed as this film has much more depth and complexity. I loved the movie, and have seen it twice over the weekend so far. I'm ready for Underworld 2!I rate it 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful execution more than compensates for derivativeness,"'Underworld' is follows a trend of female action-hero movies, borrowing heavily from the Matrix, Blade and X-Men. What I particularly liked about this one, apart from Kate Beckinsale's fine performance (which shows that female action heroes can still be feminine), is the detailed attention given to the trappings of plot, scenery and costume. Beckinsale does most of the stunts herself, whether in tight black PVC and leather (with or without the de rigueur long black coat) or in high fashion Gothic ballgown outfits. In this world of an age-old battle between vampires and werewolves, Underworld makes up by means of great settings, scenes, respect for legend and openness to metaphor, whatever it lacks in originality, and the two species that are portrayed can easily represent any number of political or religious conflicts, though they are perhaps best explained by a clue in the website's historical 'timeline' which documents cases from Gilles de Reis right up to modern ones of schizophrenia.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
love it,"A truly great and under appreciated movie. Wonderfully woven tale of love, very Romeo and Juliet with great action sequences and I really enjoyed the genetic component of the vampires and lycans existence. I also thought the actors cast in the film could not have been more perfect for the roles. They bring you into the characters and suspend disbelief. Another high point of this feature is the lack of cgi. Terrific throw back to monster making really brought the werewolves out and gave their movements balance and substance. While I love this film I understand that the content might not intrigue everyone. However, it well worth the money for a rental at the very least.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bah,"I think the director took a few too many cues from The Matrix despite lacking the ability to hold such a big story together, and obviously lacking some of the effects budget - the Lycans were cool looking but the fight scenes weren't that great - since when would vampires fight like Marines? Not a bad movie. Just not good either, which is unfortunate because it had potential.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best of all vampire movies,"I know there's people who doesn't understand what the story was really about..and they unrated the movie because they didn't think it was good..but in my opinion: THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER..Kate Beckinsale did a great job in this movie as the werewolf slayer Selene. She has been added to one of my favorite actress since. I always liked vampire and werewolf movies, but this is the most fantastic i ever seen. With this great dark picture and the great soundtrack. This genre of rock music relates perfect to this thriller. It makes the whole movie really Gothic and i like that.Selene who has hunted werewolves for many hundred years is now ready to make her mission bigger when she meets the future-hybrid Michael Corvin. Michael is protected by her, but he doesn't know that its time for his life to protect her from future danger.I love all of the characters and especially this fascinated story about the fights between werewolves and vampires and which side who will survive the war. I don't think anyone could play better as these actors here. And they could have been won more awards for their incredible job at this movie. My favorite scenes was when Mickael turned into the hybrid at the end and when Selene finally killed Victor, when he tried to kill Michael. The werewolves was perfectly created like the vampires..Rating 10/10;)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Gripping, dark, medieval, unique birth of a new creature","This film has it all. Good story line, action, great special effects, and a good cast. It really scares you, and the adrenaline rush is real. It's gripping, dark, medieval. There are no good guys; each character is more evil than the next. The creation of a new super creature makes this a classic in the tradition of Dracula. The film has the promise of sequels. I wasn't bored for a second, and the story line was solid, contrary to what I had heard from the intellectually challenged. This film has great sound effects, too. The werewolves are the best they can be, and one attack made the audience cringe in their seats. This film sets the standard for werewolf films from now on. A classic. 10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Greatest movie ever,"Okay, that's a lie, but not much of a lie.This movie being rated 6.4, that's a lie.  Calling this movie anything less than great, that's also what you'd get if you were telling a lie. However, the opposite of this, the truth, that's what I'm talking about.If you like movies, you like Underworld.  If you like talking trash about every movie you see, you hate Underworld.  It's simple.  This movie is a brilliant work on many different levels.  First off, the writing.  What most people notice.  Dialogue, all that stuff.  It's not forced, it isn't pretentious, it isn't a let down at all.  The only downside as far as that field is the fact that several important plot points are delivered by a guy with a nearly unintelligible accent.Now, the plot.  The plot is nice.  There's actually a very well delivered twist that I didn't catch onto until immediately before it happened, and I'm the guy that ruined Fight Club for himself be figuring out that Jack was Tyler.  Still a great movie.I digress.  Onto the directing.  The style was eerily reminiscent of Fincher, his work previously mentioned.  Several shots seemed lifted straight from a Fincher work, while others paid great homage to the Wachowski brothers, but that was no surprise.  The surprise was the influence garnered from old Hong Kong action flicks.  Great gunplay.Other crap, they used animatronics instead of CGI, which is always a plus. Blah blah blah, watch the damned movie and like it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great movie!!!,"This is probably the best Vampire movie of all time, for me at least. Sure it's not your typical Vampires are bad guys, get your garlic, holy water, and sharpen your stakes type deal, this film is fresh, and unique. It is a refreshing new and unique look to the Vampire world. I recommend this film to anyone who is either a Vampyre or a Lycan (Werewolf) fan. The two sides duke it out battle after battle, and it has an original, and somewhat realistic origin of how Vampires and Werewolves came to be.The two best things about this movie, besides the action, is the Storyline, and the special effects, which are done traditionally, no fake looking CGI here.

Could have been better.....,"I don't think I have ever seen a movie that starts off with a bang within five minutes so fast. ""Underworld"" does not explain much from the start; I wouldn't have known half of what was going on if I hadn't read about it first. Explanitory things means everything. Second thing, this movie didn't really make you want to root for either side, Lycans OR vampires. The lycans are just egomanic psychos and the vampires are all arrogant traitors. Too bad they didn't all kill each other. On the other hand, the graphics were nice, interesting and vivid (although they didn't have to make so many 5-story window jumping scenes....). Selene(Beckinsale) made a very sexy, slinky vamp. What can I say? I love females who fight. They make the battle more interesting. I think this movie would have been a LOT better if they had explained things along the way. And the ending needed some help as well. Overall, it was ""OK"". Not something I would pay to see again though.B-",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie is wonderful,"When I first saw the commercials, at the beginning of Bad Boyz 2, I said to myself this is a Blade clone. Then, all august, I saw commercials and somehow I, myself, wanted to see it. After going to the website, reading what members had written here and watching the making of it really inspired me to go see this movie. All I can say it is a wonderful movie. In the end it makes you think and you make alot of connections with what Lykan really means (Hound of Hell).",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not real imaginative or good,"Essentially this is a Romeo and Juliette story with vampires and werewolves (imaginatively rechristened ""death dealers"" and ""lycans"")and they use guns instead of swords. The vampires are still dressed like leather bar hookers and the werewolves, excuse me, ""lycans"", look like homeless derelicts on steroids - ""urban feral"" if you will.For some reason, vampire clans always seem to lounge about in palatial, Gothic mansions and sip wine or blood or what the hell ever, and just generally do their best to impersonate French nobility with their idle chic. These vampires are no different, despite the fact that there is a rabid army of computer generated dog-men out there wanting to tear them to ribbons. One vampire, played by Kate Beckinsale, (I'm tempted to call her ""The Littlest Death Dealer"") sees that an eternal life of posing awkwardly on baroque furniture is going to get them all killed for good and does her best to warn the predictably disinterested elder of her clan that something bad is about to happen.One, two, skip a few, there's some twists and turns, people get betrayed, love is found, blah, blah, blah.All in all, the whole thing is uninspired. The art direction is stereotypical. You've seen the Gothic mansions, the gooey sewers, so forth and so on before and better in other movies. The acting is not horrible, but how good does it have to be when all the actors do is howl or bare their fake looking fangs? The action scenes - typical MTV, quick edit, see nothing sequences. The wire work is laughably bad and should really be accompanied by a badly synched dub-track. The direction is a pitiful mess. While Len Wiseman may have been trying to capture the dark, Gothic feel of the Underworld, I think he probably should have listened to his cinematographer when the gentleman said, ""We're gonna need more lights."" Of course, maybe Len was hoping that if we didn't see anything, we wouldn't realize just how bad it is.I give it 2 out of 10, because the ten year old inside of me keeps chanting, ""But vampire fighting werewolves is COOL!"" Maybe, but this movie isn't.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Much to enjoy and I look forward to a sequel,"Up front I should say that I really enjoyed this film. It had many flaws, some cinematographic, some heresies (if that can be the right word in the circumstances) visited on the traditional `lore' of vampires and werewolves and some very dodgy physics to boot (bullets filled with liquid light - hmm???), but I think it's worth remembering what movies are meant to be about, i.e. entertainment. This was very entertaining. Sometimes I when I go to the cinema I want thought-provoking, sometimes moving, sometimes intellectual stimulation, but sometimes also just fun. It's rare to get a single movie which combines all of these and I guess scoring well in three out of four categories tends to lead to a classic. Underworld was undeniably light on the first three, but made up for this by being heavy on the fourth. Yes, it was a bit silly sometimes, no it won't make my all-time movie top 20, but it was worth seeing and I'd watch it again.Criticism here (and elsewhere) seems to be focussed on the following: -1. The acting was wooden2. The plot was incomprehensible3. It was just a rip off of The Matrix / Blade / Insert random vampire movie here4. There was no regular vampire stuff - turning into bats, lack of reflection, crucifixes, wooden stakes etc.5. It was not very scary for a horror movie6. There was no sexual chemistry between the leadsHere's my take on these: -1. The acting was woodenMaybe it's just me, but when was the last time that that an action movie had oscar-winning acting as its main prerequisite? Write down a list of the great action films and a second list of the great actors - how many of the second appeared in the first (yes I know there will be some cross-over, but hopefully you get my point)? Personally, while the acting was not sensational, I didn't feel that it detracted too much from the overall experience. As for trashing the actors, I think that maybe the script was more to blame. It's difficult to make a silk purse out of a sows ear (I exaggerate somewhat here), but I thought that Ms Beckinsale did her best. I found her character credible and even moderately complex at times. Perhaps this sounds like a get out, but maybe vampires express emotion in different ways to humans. I found the slow development of these emotion in Selene interesting. Speedman was rather wooden, but then his character was meant to be rather carried along in the torrent around him and maybe a degree of stupefaction on his behalf was consistent with this (OK I'm probably being too kind). Brolly, Sheen and Nighy acted solidly enough for my tastes, allowing for the perhaps unavoidable hamming associated with the genre.2. The plot was incomprehensibleI have seen three professional critics say this - I can only assume that they must have been distracted by something during the film. I thought that everything hung together pretty well - loose ends were generally cleared up in the next scene, or the scene after. Not sure what was so difficult to follow.3. It was just a rip off of The Matrix / Blade / Insert random vampire movie hereWell it was about vampires and the protagonists did wear rather a lot of black leather and / or PVC, much of which was skin-tight. Aside from this, I don't think it was any more derivative than any of the films it was meant to be plagiarising. Because a film has some elements of some other work doesn't mean that it has no creative merit of its own. Humans have been around rather a long time and it would be pretty difficult to pick any wholly innovative film (or book, or painting) - I suspect in fact that such a thing has never existed. Seeing a woman in skin-tight black shiny garb and assuming that they must be Carrie-Anne Moss seems rather superficial to say the least. I thought that Underworld was a lot more interesting and innovative that The Matrix Reloaded if it comes to that.4. There was no regular vampire stuff - turning into bats, lack of reflection, crucifixes, wooden stakes etc.So it was a new take on the myth - keeping and accentuating bits and dropping others. Seems like a fresh approach to me. Not sure that vampires are some immutable part of our culture that are off-limits to all reinterpretation. To me, these modern vampires and werewolves were actually rather interesting - more superhuman than suprahuman, more like us than say Christopher Lee in a cloak and tuxedo. Perhaps the director didn't have the budget to suppress reflections, or didn't realise that vampires aren't meant to appear in mirrors. More likely he didn't think that this device would add very much or further the plot - I tend to agree with him. I think the mirror stuff comes from an age where mirrors themselves were see as either rather high-tech or even magical - maybe the lack of reflections in them characterises the humans of the time rather than those around today.5. It was not very scary for a horror movieNo it wasn't, but then I don't think it was meant to be a horror movie. Think of it as Aliens rather than Alien. The earlier film was a work of suspense and a great film (IMO). The sequel was more of a shoot-em-up with less of the interesting ideas of the first film and less of the suspense - it was a good film rather than a great one. In short Alien was (at least in part) a horror film, Aliens was an action film and so is Underworld.6. There was no sexual chemistry between the leadsMaybe not - but I'm not sure that this was the main point. Rather I think the issue was more to do with Selene's dawning realisation that the world (and it's inhabitants) were not as she had always assumed them to be. Michael was only part of this - maybe even just a metaphor for it. Anyway I thought that there was enough sexual chemistry between Selene and the camera to make up for what might have been missing between Beckinsale and Speedman.Finally - judged as an action film, I thought Underworld it did an good job. It looked great (as did Ms Beckinsale), it hung together and the director didn't lift his foot from the pedal for very long at any point. The SFXs were good without being ends in themselves or distracting from the narrative. I enjoyed the mix of old and new with the vampires and werewolves and found Selene's torn loyalties and heightened emotional state central rather than a distraction. I thought that Selene herself was a credible, interesting, rather different and reasonably well-acted (script-allowing) creation, whom I hope to see more of in the rather telegraphed sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Awesome Thrill Ride of a Movie,"This was an awesome film to watch. Firstly, the Gothic style of the architecture and dark lighting gives the film a magnificent look throughout. The shots are epic and the look of the werewolves is terrifying. Some criticize the 'over-acting' but in general it's still pretty good. As a fan of classic horror and monster films, it was great to see the amount of mythology that went into the screenplay. Kate Beckinsale was pretty awesome in her role and was a great anti-hero. There are great characters here, which are why I enjoy it so much, like Lucian played by Michael Sheen. My favorite of them all is Viktor. He had an incredible presence only Bill Nighy could give off. Some characters are left poorly developed, especially Raze (Kevin Grevioux). He could've used more screen time and the character of Michael Corvin was a decent character but he doesn't really stand out until he becomes the hybrid.But the pacing is fantastic and the score by Paul Haslinger really surprised me. The action hits hard and the setting just completes the film. The near climax portion of the plot might lose a few but it's just a fun movie to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awesome movie,"I'm a little late on this one but I have to do it. When Underworld came out in theaters back in '03, I never went to see it. I thought it was a gay vampire thing. Well one night I was watching starz movie channel and suddenly I was immersed in a world of vampires and lycans. It was way sweet. I'm like who is this hot chick whoopin azz and hey cool its Michael sheen, hey that guy is a werewolf..I mean lycan (hope this doesn't qualify as spoiling). I still didn't think much of it, I was too young to appreciate it. Now being about 3 years older I know now what I was missing. I am totally hooked into the Underworld Culture. To me it was dead until a recent revival at the beginning of the week, my deepest regret is not seeing the movies at the theater :(. Its probably because I didn't wanna go by myself and none of my friends were really into that kinda thing, and neither was I at one time. I mean I am seriously disappointed because I have been asking and none of my friends have seen this movie and only 2 of them have seen the sequel. But hopefully this will change, I am wandering aren't I? I seriously cannot stop watching this movie and the interesting and powerful sequel. I have been watching them every night for the past week. Overall this film is awesome and I highly recommend it. There is really no comparison for me, I have honestly found my very favorite movie of all time. The Underworld Franchise has made me reconsider my life and now I have finally decided what I will study in college and what I want to do as a career.

Has a great concept but poor execution,"To be fair, there're some great ideas here but how it's done is clumsy. It's very style over substance. The characters aren't really interesting as we know little about them to care for them or their motives, the story and setting's easy to follow and the action's cool but again, it's hard to get invested when you don't really care about the characters who all seem the same. Many of them are brooding or hollow.While I thought it was ok, I feel like it could've used a few rewrites to flesh out the characters and their motives. The romance between the two just comes out of nowhere. There's very little buildup leading to it. First she saves him then falls in love with him on the fly? It's hard to get invested given how fast it happened. Hopefully, the sequels flesh out the characters more (though that's wishful thinking).If you like vampires and werewolves, I'd say check this one out. Otherwise, find another movie to sink your teeth into.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It is entertainment,"As a fan of the genre, I have to say that Underworld is on of the best vampire movies that I have seen in a long time.  There actually is a multi-layered plot that unfolds as the movie progresses. I look forward to the sequels that are currently on the drawing board for this film due to the room left in the story by the writers. The violence and action are not over-done or full of gore.  The look of the movie is simple and clean while at the same time remaining dark. The film focuses more on the scientific rather than the fantastical elements of vampires. If you are wanting to see a film that is excellent example of the genre and highly entertaining, then I would gladly recommend Underworld.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It shows that if you can't see eye to eye and learn to coexist . There can be consequences , of catastrophic results. And that you can either fight your demons head on , or let them destroy you.

Great power,"This movie is much like Blade, but much better. Okay, there are some clich√©s - buckets of rain, the dark blue lightning, but I hardly noticed; during the movie it didn't matter too much. This is action worth the money; not a complex plot, but an impressive performance with marvelous stunts and effects.One little disappointment: The final battle between Vampires and Lycans could have been a bit more of a macabre dance - I would have liked to have seen more blood. But with that said this is still action very much worth the watch.An exiting plot, not a dull moment, I was on the edge of my seat for almost two hours! The last time I saw Kate Beckinsale was in Pearl Harbour, she didn't impress me then, but Kate proved that she is a brave heroine in Underworld!

pretty.....but not beautiful.,"I wanted to like this film the minute I heard it was in production. A story set in the present, smack-dab in the middle of a war between vampires and werewolves. OK, what's not to like about that idea? Well, nothing really. Underworld delivers a huge slice of supernatural warfare with amazing style ¬ñ from guns that use ultraviolet bullets, to of course, Kate Beckinsale dealing death with two huge guns whilst slinking about in a black leather cat suit. So admittedly, the movie looks amazing. But that's really about itDuring the latest skirmish, Seline (Kate Beckinsale), one of the vampire coven's elite Deathdealers discovers that the Lycans are trying to capture a human (Scott Speedman). Seline sets out to find him before the Lycans do, and discover their purpose.To be fair, this movie has many good points. It looks amazing, the sets are ipeccably atmospheric and the action scenes are short enough to keep your attention. There are also some good performances here. Kate Beckinsale, if you can get past her constant frowning is very watchable as Seline, although she does adopt a rather annoying monolithic pout as soon as she gets a gun in her hand. (She's almost like 'The Matrix's' Trinity. Except with longer hair, bigger guns and¬Öwell, fangs.) Bill Nighy does quite a menacing turn as the vampire coven's Elder, Viktor. He's almost fatherlike in some ways, and his scenes with his vampire daughter Seline are reminiscent of a Father rebuking a wayward child. But other times he's sinister as hell. Shane Brolly's Kraven, although slick and sophisticated, begins to grate on the nerves. (By the end, his whining and foot stamping make one want to administer a few swift kicks to his face) Disappointingly, Lucien and Michael seem to fade into the background a bit, despite being central to the movie's plot.The whole movie though, is as slick as it gets; kind of an ultra-modern film noir. The exterior shots are made up of imposing buildings, moody back streets and perpetual downpour (Not a good advertisement for Hungary where the movie was filmed, eh?) and the whole movie is stylishly faded and muted. For a vampire vs. werewolf film though, the gore factor was (sadly) rather understated, and although the battle scenes are quite good, the whole pace seems to stagger about a bit, almost as if there's too much story to try and cram into the time available. The story is a good idea, but by the end I'd lost interest; mainly because the movie looks good, but there isn't that much else to it. Which is a shame as the plot could make for an amazing movie. But alas, it seems to rely too heavily on it's looks and it's main star¬Öafter all, gorgeous as Kate Beckinsale is, there's only so long one can wear a leather catsuit without looking silly.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great Movie,I was anxiously awaiting this film to come to the movie theater. I thought the director did a wonderful job presenting the movie without a lot of gore normally seen in these types of movies. The overall plot was well thought out and adds a twist to the normal Vampire or Werewolf movie. Just as an all around movie I thought it was A+.

Don't need a summary... watch the film,"I think this is a really cool action movie, although it is supposed to be an epic tale that ""could be the best vampire film ever"". This I don't believe, but as I said, a really nice action film. And of course, beh√•llningen (what keeps it on top) is the wonderfully sexy Kate Beckinsale. The story is somewhat krystad (Swedish again). This means that sometimes, no matter how hard the actors try, the lines and story just isn't cool, or they are too pretentious. But that doesn't really matter when ms. Beckinsale fires of her automatic handguns =) This may not be an excellent movie, but since it features Kate Beckionsale, I have to give it a ten.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Crap!,"This is the least intriguing movie I've seen all year, and the worst since THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, which at least was fun for a couple of minutes. UNDERWORLD is no fun at all.It's an unrelentingly bleak, gory, underlit, undernourished, and over-directed vampire/werewolf film with not so much as a shred of irony or wit. So, you might think, there's nothing wrong with that.Well, think again. There is no exposition to the story, which is fine because there is no story. There is no introduction to the characters, which is fine because there are no characters - just pretty puppets for the teenage crowd. The piece has no rhythm, which is fine because there is no plot. UNDERWORLD is a non-entity which draws blanks in *every* respect except gore and f/x.And it's ridiculously prudish, too. Gushes of blood all over the place, but the minute there is no much as the *hint* of nudity, a well-placed pile of books placed before the actress ""protects"" our innocent children from seeing nipples. I love the Americans - their bigotry in such affairs is unrivaled anywhere in the world. :)So, don't watch this unholy mess.

Remarkably Excellent.,"Forget the fact that it doesn't adhere to the Vampire and Werewolf legends. Who cares, really.. They could have evolved from then on. And for whoever said that it was disgusting that Vamps and Lycans could run only as fast as normal humans, must be insane not to have seen the scene where Lucian ran as fast as the car, then jumped atop it.This is an excellent movie, and if those complainers out there just forgot that it had anything to do with traditional Vamps and werewolves, then they'd seriously enjoy this. Now, I was not a horror fan, in fact, I have always been quite intimidated by the blood, gore, and that kind of stuff in horror movies.. Well, this one is definitely a horror, but I wasn't the least bit scared through-out the entire, bloody thing. Being a mere recently-turned-13-12-year-old, the video store owner was a bit apprehensive of renting me an R-rated movie, so I don't know about younger audiences and such.Great acting. It blew me away how well Kate Beckinsale, Michael Sheen, and all of them, in fact acted.. The only actor I lament being used, is Speedman. It's either him who's annoying, or his character. I think they could have cast Michael better, 'cause I see absolutely no way that anyone like Selene could ever fall in love with him.. And the romance is quite non-existant, I find.. All it is really, is Selene sort of kissing him, mainly to cuff him to that chair.And I absolutely love the setting, the long coats, and the double-pistol shoot-out with Selene... Totally awesome. There is little about it that really resembles The Matrix, I find, another great movie. Maybe the leather, and the action-sequence style, but other than that, I can't wait for the sequel, and the 3rd to come out!10/10 No regrets.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Excellent story, Lead cannot act.","The fact is that a movie is the sum total of the story and the acting. Some people disagree and include the effects in that sum. That's their choice.The reality is that no matter how good a story is, if the acting is bad beyond a certain point, nothing can save it.And - I have to say - that is true for this movie; at least as regards the lead part ""Selene"" aka Kate Beckinsale.Don't get me wrong, ""Michael"" and ""Lucian"" (played by Michael sheen) give outstanding performances. But despite their heroic efforts, they simply cannot undo the damage that having a terrible actress as lead has done.Casting for this went terribly wrong in that someone in their infinite wisdom, confused ""pretty and dumb"" with ""pretty dumb"", when in fact neither would have worked.So we have a scarecrow in a rubber suit, a single facial expression and no discernible talent. Fantastic.I guess I will have to wait 10 years for the ""reboot"" at which point I sincerely hope they find someone that can act. The funny thing is that - even 10 years on - I would still want sheen as Lucian because he is just an exceptional performer!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Different from other Vampire Movies which is excellent,"I watched Kate Beckinsale in Serendipity and i loved as much as acting as her Beauty.Later came out Van Helsing and i was wondering how will she managed that kind of a role-wild princess with a sword: and after i saw it i realized that she can play any role in any style of the movie. I'm i bit freak when it comes with a vampire movies (love old classic ones with Cristopher Lee as Dracula)-but as far as it goes-the movie has to have a good acting and good music to make it work. Well Underworld has it all. It has a great story (wich is very rear in the vampire movies). And Kate looks hot in it. Underworld is not a typical vampire movie we all now about: its different from other movies beacose it takes place in modern times, where are guns present in the battle. What surprise me is the style of the movie and the actors.They are drinking blood from glasses in ""civil"" way and they have modern cars like ""porche"" and all that. The movie is so fun too watch beacose there use real masks when it comes to werewolfs and not any computer effect-especially fighting sequence looks so real. I don't wanna go in the subject of music-all i wanna say is that the sound is brilliant and it goes very nicely with the movie.If you love horror vampire movies then you have to see this one- its worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

There is very little language with only three uses of the F-word and one of the S-word.This is a a fairly long movie with a lot of detail and a lot of long conversations, this is the only reason I only gave this movie a nine instead of a ten.Iwould definitely recommend this movie to anyone, and I have yet to see the sequel, I am waiting for it on DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I Love This Movie,I found the plot and action very interesting. I have purchased this movie and it is one of the few that I can stand to watch multiple times. I really hope there is a sequel. I will be disappointed if there is not. This is an action packed story about Vampires versus Werewolves. But there is also an appropriate love story that still kept my wife interested as well. It was full of Matrix like excitement as well of Makeup special effects that I have not seen before. The concept originally Good versus Evil but the Vampires were deceived into thinking they were finishing a war started by the Lycans.But the Lycans did not start the war. They only want it finished. If you have not seen it it is well worth the rental and I recommend a purchase. You will not be disappointed.Jeff,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Slow uncoordinated and useless script,"During the whole movie the actors weren't aware that other actors were acting with them. The script is lost, the actors speaking like 4 year olds and mostly gibberish. Since when do you tell the enemy your plans? Explaining your insecurities to your adversary doesn't mean the movie becomes interesting. It seemed the writers and producers wanted to show how stupid the actors are and they succeeded, throughout this lame over excited sexually drive mess...Even if there was a storyline, who could possible follow it. Most of the script is over simplistic double talk. The script and the lines have no point other then some people running around in skin tight leather/plastic suits. Groovy looking yes but after awhile, boring. So the movie continues through the formula like so many others to it's conclusion, finally.

Wow,"There are some movies which have eye-widening or before-their-time special effects. There are some movies with beautifully crafted music, costumes & sets. There are some movies with actors worth watching purely for their acting ability. There are some movies with genuinely interesting story lines.There are few movies or TV series which have all four in such perfect balance they could be watched over and over and you would not easily tire of them. The Matrix is one such movie. Lord Of The Rings is three. The Passion Of The Christ is one. Babylon 5 and the UK edition of Queer As Folk provide the TV offering. Underworld is also quite justifiably in this list.The special effects are brilliant, but they're not the purpose of the movie - they exist to carry the plot, rather than the other way round, and they are nowhere pushed further than they need be. The CG animation of the Lycans changing, and the Lycan body-suits, are brilliant.The sets and costumes are a well-balanced and sometimes imaginative blend of classic Vampire Goth and Matrix-style Cybergoth (which is probably why the film got so many Matrix comparisons - other than the set and costume design, which is inevitable with the genre, the underground station shootout is the only similarity - and unlike the Matrix, the sequence HAS to take place in an underground station for various reasons). Kraven's suit and the Death Dealer uniforms were especially good.I found only one actor whose performance I was disappointed with - and he was only on screen for ten seconds, and the contribution was so minimal his part could theoretically have been eliminated entirely. Beckinsale's performance was exemplary, especially given the number of lines she had, but for acting I'd say the best were Shane Brolly's Kraven and Bill Nighy's Viktor - two of the most scheming, manipulative and yet distinctly different characters you could imagine.The story line was the real gem though. Double-dealing on top of skulduggery laid over some pretty advanced genetics, all mixed with a heavy dose of romance, a dash of genocide, and stirred well by some of the best twists I've seen in a while, then set in an epic scale of events. Yet it still managed to be driven by the characters' personalities as much as the situation!Anyone who doesn't mind needles, body parts, blood and some pretty nasty ways of killing people will enjoy the film. And if you're worried about nudity, don't - the furthest extent is a few Lycans in wolf-mode, a dehydrated elderly Vampire, the delectable Scott Speedman (unfortunately obscured under a load of latex and body-paint), and a couple of bloodied male torsos.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Derivative stuff without too much of specific interest but does enough to tick the boxes for the teenage male target audience,"When their feared and ruthless leader Lucian is killed, the Lycan clan is scattered. The Vampires claim victory in the war but set out to hunt the remaining Lycans to the point of extinction. Selene is one of a group of vampire warriors grouped together for just this task. They stalk and kill Lycan but, when a simple trail into a subway station turns into a massive gun battle, Selene uncovers evidence of a possible pack living underground but, more worryingly, finds the Lycan were in the subway station to try and capture a specific human. Meanwhile Lucian is not as dead as rumoured and instead plots his next action in the war as Selene tries to figure out what the Lycans want with human Michael.The trivia entry on the IMDb page for this film states that it was sued for copyright infringement just before release. It also states that a sequel and prequel were greenlit on Canadian ticket sales alone. Both these things I can easily believe because at times the film is so derivative that many different people could have attempted to sue, plus it ticks so many boxes for what the teenage market wanted that the studios were bound to come back for more as long as it sold. Of course moaning that an action blockbuster is derivative is a bit like moaning that fire burns ¬ñ it comes with the territory. The pitch about Romeo/Juliet is nonsense as the story contains very little of this and what there is is weak. The overall story is good enough to hold the action together though, even if it is nothing that clever or interesting.Current Die Hard 4 director Wiseman directs well enough, capturing the Gothic feel of it while also providing all the cool things that the target audience would be looking for. So we have lots of tight PVC (particularly around the bum of Beckinsale) and lots of action to get them in. The action is alright but it does feel like the Wachowski brothers could have also been reaching for their lawyers ¬ñ particularly looking at the opening subway shoot out, which screams Matrix from every frame. The cast are reasonable good and benefit from some strange but effective casting choices. Beckinsale is in great shape and does the whole ""sexy, dark martial arts babe"" thing really well. Shame more wasn't asked of her in terms of character but it is what it is. Speedman is too bland to really write too much about so I won't. Sheen is at a disadvantage with me because the last few times I have seen him he has been playing Tony Blair to the point where I find it hard to separate them. He is quite good but it is hard not to be distracted by him playing a leader involved in an endless war ¬ñ particularly one who continues to be leader no matter what happens to his clan. Nighy was a good choice and is effective in his role ¬ñ mostly because he really fits the look. Fellow Belfast (""I'm outta here"") lad Brolly is poor. The rest of the cast features notable turns from Myles, Prison Break's Miller and Grevioux (one of the writers) with a voice so deep that I felt his lines before I heard them.Overall then a typical teenage-boy-targeted summer blockbuster. Monsters, sexy martial arts girls in tight clothes and lots of bullets = box office returns and the promise of more. If you are in target audience and just looking for this then this will deliver just what you expect it to. Just don't expect the story or characters to be anything that good or for anything about it to be different or better than what you would see in lots of other films all aiming for the same audience.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Blade Vs. Matrix, great movie but small mistakes...","Underworld is one of those movies that combines legends (like freddy Vs. Jason). There are the wearwolves and vampires who have been fighting eachother for over a 1000 years. The wearwolves are almost fully murdered out but they're still standing... when the blood of one human (michael) seems to be essential in the battle, selene wants to know what is going on while she starts digging in the history of the vampires and why this war started. This is a great movie, vampires in long leather jackets with a certain type of ""elegance"", wearwolves that turn in to beasts that would turn the hulk into a whimp, and most of all: action/shooting scenes that you love to see without the overdose of gore. I think the name horror/thriller is a little bit exagerated because there's no real ""scare"" factor, just a lot of (good) action. The only things that bothered me in this movie were the little mistakes. The vampire-myth says that vampires have no shadow or reflection whilst in the movie, selene is looking in the mirror... The entire movie there are guns, guns and more guns, with specific bullets to kill the other species ect... but at one fight between a vampire and a wearwolf, the vampire suddenly takes 2 whips. A spectacular scene but why didn't he just shoot the wearwolf?

"Underworld tries to add dynamism to the plot by including an interesting twist at the end of the second act - but, is too late to save the film","Even before other franchises that portrayed vampires and werewolves in the cinema, ""Underworld"" appears, which promised to show the conflict between vampires and werewolves that occurs hidden from humans. The production appears as a faithful product of its time, that is, the beginning of the 2000s, inheriting strong characteristics of successes from previous years, trying to emulate an epic grandeur or to bring a believable and different narrative, in which it fails miserably. There is no way to watch Underworld and not see the strong influences of Matrix in the work. The Wachowski franchise had its last chapter released the same year as Len Wiseman's first feature film as a director. That said, despite having numerous practically identical elements, the vampire and werewolf film manages to guarantee its visual identity, but it cannot hide its evident problems, ranging from the script to the direction itself.The work is clearly based on the interpretation games of the publisher White Wolf - Vampire: The Mask, Werewolf: The Apocalypse -, which in turn sought inspiration in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and horror literature. In production, the usual idea of the lone vampire or werewolf is abandoned in favor of the proposal of secret societies existing in the underworld (hence the original title) of large cities. Overall, Underworld is kind of a mix of Terminator, Blade 2 and Romeo and Juliet, if that is possible. The only problem is that he fails to recover the feeling of urgency and threat of the first, the energetic rhythm and good action sequences of the second, let alone the drama of the novel seen in the third. The result is that the film ends up looking like many others, but never manages to stand out.Lycans (werewolves) and vampires live scattered and not solitary, as they are usually portrayed. These same races live in constant conflict, although lycans are outnumbered by being hunted by vampires. One of those hunters is Selene (Kate Beckinsale), who kills them in revenge for what they supposedly did to her family. Although the war ended many years ago, the battles continued. The vampire Selene decides to investigate her immortal enemies and learns that they are looking for a human doctor, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) to experiment, so she also suspects that Kraven (Shane Brolly), the current commander of the vampire coven, is planning a conspiracy with Lucian (Michael Sheen), leader of the lycans, against Viktor (Bill Nighy) the real Coven commander who is in hibernation.
At first, the premise 'vampires' vs werewolves' seems quite interesting, but soon McBride's weak script gives evidence that he will not be able to explore the idea intelligently. The way vampires are portrayed, except for their occasional hissing, brings a mixture of the modern vision worked by Anne Rice in conjunction with the work of Bram Stoker - we see the past and the future of these fantastic beings converging to the same point and the use of technology mixed with the old forms of architecture is placed in the film in an organic way, translating to the image the ancestry of such creatures and, at the same time, their evolution over the years. However, the screenwriter also decides to ignore several classic attributes of the creatures, which mischaracterizes the characters: we can even understand why werewolves can now transform when they feel like it (otherwise, the story could only take place on full moon nights), but there is no reason why vampires can see their reflections in mirrors or why they should stop fearing crucifixes. Besides, what kind of vampire is this that doesn't even drink human blood? In addition to that the sun at no time is an element that must be taken into account or the fact that vampires have some need to feed. Even at a certain point, Selene passes out from having lost a lot of blood, and sometime later she wakes up, without the slightest need to suck the blood of a victim, something so common in vampire films. Even though the cloned blood argument is still presented, this example proves to be, in the end, just another limiting factor, something that ends the savagery of vampires.On the other hand, while the design of lycans draws attention by the use of practical effects, which distances the work of the vast majority of films that appeal to CGI, the ways in which they move ends up making the feature film extremely dated. This, of course, could have been solved by more careful work by the director, who did not need to have exposed this side of the film so much to the viewer, the use of darkness, shadows and cut at the right time would solve many of the work's problems. The special effects, mainly the werewolves' conception, were created and supervised by the Frenchman Patrick Tatopoulos, a well-known professional in the area, having important works in the creation of monsters for TV series and popular horror and science fiction films from the 90s as Dracula. by Bram Stoker, Stargate, Independence Day, Godzilla and many others. Later he would assume the direction of Angels of the Night 3: The Rebellion, in 2009. But in relation to the war between the species: what is the use of establishing a conflict between two fantastic creatures if they limit themselves to using firearms in their battles? (The bullets are 'stuffed' with infrared and silver rays). In addition, the supposed romance between Selene and Michael sounds false, as if it were a mere obligation imposed by the story.
Underworld takes on the old narrative of the chosen one, the first of the influences left by Matrix. In fact, it is even funny when we stop to think and see that the work's argument is practically the same as the Wachowski film. See: Michael is a normal human who discovers an entire new reality about the world he lives in the moment he becomes the target of a persecution by unknown figures. In the process he is saved by a mysterious woman, with whom he ends up falling in love and with the stage of the projection we discover that he is special in some way, being able to end this great conflict. It is clear that the difference between the two franchises is in the detail, but just because we can apply this same description to two films released in less than five years, we can already identify the lack of originality of the text about the creatures of the film. night.Fortunately, the way this universe is presented gives a revitalization in the work. Len Wiseman (also a newcomer), even placing his story in the 21st century, gives an almost Victorian look to his images. The constant smokes, the almost exclusive presence of buildings from the late 1800s, along with the darkness in the film create this strong visual language. We are talking about a story that takes place, from beginning to end, during the night and could not be otherwise, considering the creatures addressed. Wiseman's main concern concerns the style of production, not its content - which can be attributed, in part, to the fact that the subject started his career as an assistant art director. Both exterior and interior footage used locations in the city of Budapest, capital of Hungary, in eastern Europe, where producers found the ideal architectural features for what was imagined in Underworld, not to mention the existence of a naturally gloomy climate in Hungary, involving ancestral stories of vampires and werewolves. Thus, the scenes and scene objects seen in Underworld are impressive, deserving to be highlighted, but not all technical elements are equal in quality to their art direction: the visual effects, for example, are incredibly irregular, oscillating between the satisfactory (some of the transformations of the werewolves) and the mediocre (as in the sequences in which the creatures walk through the walls).Likewise, the photography of the experienced Tony Pierce-Roberts is unfortunate: in his attempt to give the film a Gothic tone, he practically transformed Underworld into a monochromatic and visually tiring experience. In addition to technical irregularities, what we see is a weak and poorly developed story. Although he tries to give energy to the action scenes, Wiseman fails to limit himself to copying practically all the most beaten features of the genre, such as slow motion cameras, steel wire stunts and even blows that split characters in half (see Resident Evil, Blade 2). The Gothic-fetishist look a la Matrix is its highlight, as Kate Beckinsale (Van Helsing) running and shooting in tight clothes is always something to be seen. Those who don't like girls, have Scott Speedman (TV series Felicity) as compensation.Another major slip of the film is its long duration. With simply disposable moments and exaggeratedly long action sequences, the projection duration could have been shortened by at least twenty minutes. The result that we see ends up getting tired of its repetition, damaging scenes that would certainly have more impact through a more concise editing work.Predictable and monotonous, Underworld still tries to add dynamism to the plot by including an interesting twist at the end of the second act - but, 15 minutes from the end, the strategy is too late to save the film. The result, directed by newcomer Len Wiseman, pleases the audience for which the film is intended and is unlikely to captivate another type of cinema fan. Underworld is a feature film that ends up pleasing those who do not expect a sensational story of vampires and werewolves. With evident successes in its visual side, the film sins for its script that is not out of the ordinary and for its weak direction and editing, which show too much and make the whole experience quite tiring.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining action fare...,"Vampires and werewolves in a Romero and Juliet style story? When you think about it, Underworld really should have been great; but despite being disappointing on the whole, special effects guru turned director Len Wiseman has still managed to turn out a good film. In fact, he's done quite well; as when you consider that Underworld is a story of a century old war, a love story, a Matrix-style actioner and sees the creation of a 'new' monster, it could have been a hell of a lot messier than it is. It's clear that Wiseman thinks this movie is better than it is, as it constantly takes itself too seriously and the frequent attempts at storytelling try to hard to create a story around the vampires and werewolves; but on the other hand, the mythology is well done and I'd rather Underworld be too serious than a complete joke. The plot, as mentioned, follows a war between vampires and werewolves. It's been going on for ages, but there's been a new development in the form of Michael; a 'carrier' who could become the link between the two warring sides.Visually, the film looks great. It can be said that it looks a lot like a music video, but the slick dark visuals bode very well with the action set pieces, and music video or not; at least the style suits the film. The star of the show is very much Kate Beckinsale. I like her anyway, but she looks far hotter in this movie than in any others I've seen her in previously or since. The movie makes the best of having this fine lady wearing a tight cat suit and long leather coat, and although it does this so much that a lack of other ideas becomes obvious; I really aren't complaining. The rest of the cast is mostly made up long haired, ""European"" men, with only Bill Nighy standing out among them in his role as a vampire elder. The action set pieces are way over the top, yet always entertaining, and since vampires and werewolves don't really exist...they can be forgiven for going overboard. The special effects are pretty good too, considering they're CGI. They're almost always shown in darkness...but I prefer dark and good, to clear and rubbish. On the whole, this really isn't great. The romance is hardly touched on, there's better action in The Matrix and it's a little messy; but I really enjoyed it, Kate Beckinsale is awesome and it's entertaining on the whole.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Light on gore, good character development, consistent story","Putting aside all of the rhetoric about realism, Matrix rip-offs, and vampire/werewolf lore consistency, this movie stands as a rare gem because it is both intriguing and consistent unto itself.The film is light on gore (only two moderate scenes) with heavy action sequences using submachine pistols and rifles.  Don't expect to see vampires and werewolves ripping apart humans (thank goodness...)!  Both species are more concerned in killing each other, and humans are just collateral damage.This film (thankfully) generates its own refreshing ambience and lore concerning the origins and lives of vampyres and werewolves (a.k.a lycanthropes).  For example, vampires live under a code preventing the consumption of human blood, with livestock blood being the acceptable entree.  Thus, the reason why we (that's you and I) don't see or read about people dying from bite marks on their necks.The acting was quite acceptable, with the exception of one of the main characters (Michael Corvin) who either had a bad script, or just can't act. I actually don't like gore/horror movies at all and had no plans to see this one until I read a review which described the film as more of an action/intrigue flick rather than a lunch tosser.  What a pleasant surprise it was to be able to view this movie 4 times and still be learning interesting details about the storyline.If you liked the ambience of the Matrix, and are tired of the same old boring vampire/werewolf storyline, then this movie should be high on your list.  Otherwise, if you're seeking a gore/blood splatter flick then look elsewhere.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Approximately two hours of misery, gloom, and mayhem, that's about it","Wow, for quite a while, I was actually expecting to like this movie! I don't recall even knowing about it upon its release in 2003, but was aware of its 2006 sequel, ""Underworld: Evolution"", while it was playing in theatres. I didn't bother going to see it, since I hadn't seen the original, but planned to eventually watch them both when I got around to it. Well, it took a while, but I've finally seen this first film of the two, and while I was expecting to like it enough to watch the sequel, it certainly didn't work out that way. I was very disappointed, and as a result, I saw no point in watching the sequel!A war between Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) has been going on for centuries, and one of the vampire warriors stuck in this war is Selene. She is a death dealer, who tracks down Lycans to assassinate. After a battle against a group of Lycans in a subway station, it appears that her Lycan rivals were after a human named Michael Corvin, and following humans is not something they usually do! Unfortunately, Selene cannot get her concern across to vampire ruler Kraven, so she investigates the matter on her own, trying to find out what these werewolves want with Michael. The reason why this particular human is wanted by them is a big part of their plot to gain power over the vampires, something they haven't had for hundreds of years. Also, Lucian, the Lycan leader who was long thought to be dead, has returned!I would say the film opens with a decent narration from Kate Beckinsale as Selene, but it goes from there to a tedious battle sequence (the subway station one, in this case). Unfortunately, that certainly isn't the only tedious battle sequence in the entire film. Some of the acting is pretty weak as well, such as Shane Brolly as Kraven, and the haunted music/sounds hardly ever seem to stop. Like I mentioned above, there really isn't much in the movie other than misery, gloom, and mayhem. I certainly wasn't expecting a really upbeat film, and have been impressed by dark action flicks before, but it all gets so repetitive here, it just keeps going and going, which gets pretty tiresome, maybe even depressing! Nothing really progresses! I didn't really care for any of the characters, either, and ended up not caring about what happened to them or how the story went. Worse still, in addition to all these problems, all the gloom and mayhem is seemingly endless! It seems like it will go on for all eternity, and as I watched, I really wondered when it was going to end, and didn't see any possible way it COULD end!I think I was way too confident that I would like ""Underworld"", even though I wasn't expecting an absolute classic. With that confidence, I rented this action/horror flick and its sequel together, but sadly, that copy of ""Underworld: Evolution"" had to go back to the video store unwatched. At approximately two hours, does this film seem longer than it really is? Well, if you ask me, absolutely! To me, it seemed more like three or four hours! If the film was around, I don't know, half an hour/45 minutes shorter than it is, I would probably rate it 5/10, but since the flaws in the film continue for so long, never stopping until it's over, I think even an average rating would be a tad too generous! Even with all its big-budget special effects, there's something unprofessional and immature about this film, filled with modern clich√©s. So, sadly, the interesting idea of vampires vs. werewolves had so much potential that wasn't reached!",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A movie that will excite and thrill!!!!,"Lemme say this movie is awesome, I'm not a big fan of vampires but this was it. The gun-fu, blood and guts going everywhere was a thing of beauty. From the very start of the film to the very end we are introduced to one of the very best actresses in the film industry, Mrs Beckinsale, she was sexy asf, that leather was designed well to go with the whole atmosphere, just sublime. Vampires and werewolves and Mrs Beckinsale ooooh my!! Yes where do I sign up!!?

Nicely Done Gothic Action,"I am a die hard horror fan so when I first saw the trailer for this I was ecstatic. Even though I love the finished product I am a little disappointed by the lack of horror in the film. The main character is a vampire and for most of the film I forgot that. Anyway other than that the film was excellent. Kate Bekinsale is solid as the beautiful yet deadly Selene and Scott Speedman is believable as Michael, there is a great supporting cast as well with the likes of Bill Nighy, Michael Sheen, and Sophia Myles. The action is very stylized, there are gunfights galore, and for those that like atmosphere this film screams Goth. Overall I say that it is definitely worth watching also check out the sequel Evolutions.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better Than What You Might Expect,"I was really hyped for this movies release, and I have to admit after seeing the rating on imdb I got worried that it would be a crappy movie. I was happily suprised as it was one of the best movies I have seen this year. It had plenty of awesome action scenes, an awesome soundtrack, and thats just for starters. I found out afterwards that theres going to be a sequel and prequel, I can't wait. The acting was kinda cliched but I didn't mind, I didn't go to see some drama, I went to be entertained, and it did just that. I was into this movie from start to finish, and I liked how theres history given between the two species. Underworld is not for everyone, but I loved it.Overall 10/10, just an awesome movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Vampires vs. Werewolves - unique? No, you've seen it all before!","Actually the premise of UNDERWORLD is pretty nice: Vampires and Werewolves having a war. That's cool. From seeing the trailer I expected to see that too.Though this film is mostly made with an extreme amount of clich√©s, one put after the other. There are so many things in this movie that you've seen before that, after a while, you start to believe that you've seen the actual film earlier.The movie is predictible, boring and actually not interesting at all.The story behind this is good. Very good actually. And the sets are nice, even though when the art-director said ""Make it look gothic"", someone must have thought he said ""Make everything looks as gothic as you can, even the computers and cell-phones!"" It's so goth that it's silly.Some of the actors and actresses have their moments. But working with a screenplay like this can't be easy. The director and the writer are clearly not movie-material people. They can't direct and they can't write. It shows clearly in the very uninspired direction, making the movie feel very flat.Where some of the film is very sloppy edited, leaving us with questions, some parts of the film is so too explanationary that it feels like they're telling a story for 3-year olds.If this story had been given a better treatment from a talented writer and then that script had been given to a real director, then this film might have been really good.Now, it's painfully ridiculus. Boring, boring, boring and stupid. But hey, you can laugh at it!Don't spend any money on this mess. You've seen it all before anyway.3 out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Outmatrixes THE MATRIX,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, the first thing that ran through my mind: ""THE MATRIX with fangs"".  Leather trenchcoats, large-caliber automaticfirearms, wirework fight scenes.   I received a pass for an advance screening and went, not expecting too much.  I must say, after seeing the movie, I waspleasantly surprised.  UNDERWORLD was everything that THE MATRIXWISHES it could have been.    The movie basically continues a feud that wasshown in the movie THE HOWLING VI:  THE FREAKS:  vampires andwerewolves do not get along.  They have been warring for over a millennium. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a vampire known as a ""death dealer"", sheespecially trained to kill lycans:  Werewolves.  The leader of the lycans, Lucian (Michael Sheen), has been killed. Or so we are led to believe.   It turns out that not only is he alive, but he is tracking a young man (Scott Speedman) who is a descendant of a man who is supposed to have the blood of both lycans andvampires flowing through him.  Selene  is also trying to get to Michael(Speedman) before Lucian.  As fate would have it, Michael is being hunted ataround the same time that  Viktor (Bill Nighy), the leader of the vampires, is going to be resurrected.    This isn't sitting too well with Kraven (Shane Brolly), the current leader.  He'd just as soon kill Michael as try to find out the plans that Lucian have for him.The fight scenes are pretty impressive as is the unique ammo that each side uses to exploit the other's weaknesses such as bullets that emit ultraviolet rays inside of a vampire's body and others that are loaded with silver nitrate to get into a lycan's bloodstream quicker.    I repeat, I was expecting a weak MATRIX clone and  instead found a movie that, I think, sets the  bar high for THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS to top.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Gothic, Dark, Action pack, and cool","I just saw this movie most recently.I wouldn't of been interested in seeing it back 3 years ago but I gotta admit it's cool than it appears to be.Underworld is taken place in the fictional dark modern world. Where Vampires and Werewolves exist. For Centuries they've been fighting each other in their own war.They're both different in a way of fighting, weaponry, and hideouts.The Vampires resemble Gothic people and live at a large mansion. They have security, and underground basements for training and plotting their next move against the Werewolves.The werewolves are rough less and tough mercenary like beings. Their hideout is in run down areas next to the alley ways and subway system. They have laboratories and weapons developments to find easier ways in defeating the Vampires.The werewolves are after a guy who is suppose to be the key in stopping this little war or something like that. And by doing that the guy they seek must bite him to become a werewolf like them. When that happens the Vampires won't be able to bite him cause it would kill him instantly.Will the Werewolves succeed their goal? Don't count on it when a Vampire named Selena will set things right.If you like Dark, violent and Gothic like movies you might like this one. I can tell that the Goths admire this movie. Plus Selena is one cool Vampire chick.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"wants to be great, settles for mediocre","With its leather-wearing heroine and eternal, blue-filtered night, it's obvious that Underwold is desperate to be cool. Sadly, desperate and cool never go together. Cool movies are those where the director wants to say something in an interesting way, and is enamored of a certain slick style. It's not that cool movies aren't consciously cool, but that they are interested in more than *just* being cool. In the Matrix, the directors were desperate to be profound and say something about the human condition, whereas Tarentino's films are informed by his desire to keep himself amused.But Underworld is just an empty vehicle for slick posturing. It's not just that the movie has nothing profound to say (The Matrix only wanted to be profound, it didn't actually succeed), it's that the movie has nothing to say at all. It exists entirely as a vehicle for the lovely and talented Kate Beckinsale to posture and snarl some forgettable dialog. Even the film's somewhat interesting revelation in the last quarter feels not like a result of deep conviction but simply like something clever the script could toss in.While the movie is weak in almost everything, it has a workmanlike competence that keeps it watchable. You never connect with the characters, you are never enthralled by the story and the fight scenes aren't especially good, but nothing is really bad enough to stop watching, and the movie is a perfectly acceptable way to kill a couple of hours.But what it is not is cool.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Seen It, Bought It, Loved It","I don't know why someone would say not to bother wasting your money on this movie. I am a horror movie fan, a fan of vampire movies and all that go along with that genre. I seen Underworld here at the Toronto Film Festival back in September 2003 and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD so I could add it to my collection. This Vampire/Werewolf film is unique as it doesn't use the typical setting of Los Angeles for everything. Seems so many of these types of flicks always have to deal with Los Angeles. Fianlly this time the scenery is more along the lines of what this type of film should look like. Gothic. And instead of everyone walking around in regular everyday clothes like people of L.A. the characters are dressed in black PVC and leather. Hey maybe it is me but I think if this flick had been done with the setting of the TV series Angel, it would have been pathetic. I like Angel but too many movies with Vampires will seem to show them as regular people and that has been done too much. Kate Beckinsale is great as the lead, she speaks with her natural British accent instead of the fake American one we have been so used to her using in films. This whole movie has the right feel and setting, and it shows the vampires in a luxury life like they do live in when we read back about them. Werewolfs are underground, more of the ""lower class"" looking. The rules are followed so well for a flick about both fan favs and it works like a charm. Sure someone mentions about the American accents, big deal, I guess in the Czech Republic (where this was filmed) there are no Americans over there? Just like there are no Czechs in America? I believe that true fans of Vamps and Werewolves will be impressed with this flick. Also I think Vampires and Werewolves were not created or set in America like so many characters and movies ""Have"" to be. I mean come on, Fredy, Jason, Micheal Myers, Pinhead and Leatherface all are popular horror characters that seem to originate in America.Come on people put aside your usual criticizing,  this is not a boring Tom Hanks ""true story"" film, it is make believe, about two types of fan fav characters that are popular in todays times as well as say 50 years ago. No different than withcraft.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A nice surprise,"I guess the best way for me to sum up my feelings about UNDERWORLD is to say it was much more entertaining and intelligent than I expected.Despite it's Matrix-like tones, I figured I'd give the movie a shot.  Well, my wife wanted to see it, so who was I to deny her. :)Plus, I thought the whole supernatural gang-war concept pretty interesting.Where the movie worked the most for me was presenting a story that didn't allow the effects to define the story...well, like the Matrix Reloaded unfortunately did to stupefyingly boring results.The story had me attentive throughout and I found myself actually caring about the characters, even ones that on the surface seemed like baddies.The biggest barometer for me is whether I'd be willing to see a sequel, Underworld 2 would have me in the seats.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Story with a potential, marred by poor directing and acting","ah yes... yet another vampire/werewolf movie. Most of those are of poor quality, ridiculous and copy off each other with great candor. This one is different in one respect... it didn't copy off other vampire movies, it copied off The Matrix. And a lot.The director seems to be an avid admirer of the The Matrix and seemed to have included a lot of its design motifs into this movie. Including a lot of actor body language, weapon usage, wardrobe, setting and even the general color scheme. It's basically The Matrix with vampires instead of machines... with one problem, it's not even a fraction as good.The story itself is well documented so repeating it won't help much, but what will help is to prepare you to a somewhat low budget production (or seemingly so) with poor acting (yes, even by wonderful Kate) and uncomfortable clich√©s. The story has potential (vampires vs. werewolves) but it's hard to shake off the feeling you're watching an episode of some low-budget vampire series. The dialogs are mostly predictable and shallow, and it seems the focus of this movie is on a disappointing 'cool factor' rather than absorbing the viewer into the story.I'd recommend this movie to hardcore (and young) vampire/werewolves fans, but they'll watch it anyway... if you're not automatically taken by that theme, stay away. The biggest contribution this movie has given me was a craving to watch The Matrix again.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Compelling, Gripping","Its been awhile since the latest installment of a vampire/werewolf movie has been attempted at the box office.  This one is surely one of the finest I have seen.The movie centers around the ongoing war between vampire and lycans (werewolves) and persistent power struggle to terminate the members of the opposite bloodline.  Much unlike the user who reviewed this on the front page, I feel the storyline is very solid.  The main character is played by Kate Beckinsale, who does a very stoic and realistic portrayal of a vampire named Celine who fights to avenge the brutual slaying of her family by the lycans when she was young.This movie is filled with action and there are VERY FEW moments when something isn't going on.  The mood set by the movie makes the war and its participants very believeable characters if you are able to let your mind free and try to imagine what it would feel like dealing with feelings that have lasted for thousands of years.This movie is not about bloodsucking and killing of humans (although some humans do die, although more of a result of being caught up in the war) and lycans are more than just being that howl at the moon during a full moon. The storyline is very solid and even contains a few twists which go along with the plot very well.One of the only flaws of this movie is that most characters are not developed to their potential, then again this movie is not about getting to know a character;s personality and background, etc..   There are a few characters that you dont really know what their role is, but overall this is an excellent movie.For the type of movie this is, Underworld met and exceeded expectations. The writing is very solid and the special effects are very good.  Beckinsale adds a no-nonsense female role that plays the part well and really gives Carrie Ann Moss a run for her money in leather.If you can stomach the blood and have an open mind, you should be able to appreciate this movie for what it is-- A top-notch look into the UNDERWORLD!!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Overly stylized Under developed,"The entire concept of vampires and werewolves (lycans, yeah whatever) in a long suffering feud was a great idea. Even the idea of one of the races trying to make a hybrid of the two was intriguing. But instead of developing the characters, making them likable, or even interesting, everything is coated in shadows, everyone looks like a perfect goth caricature, and no one shows genuine emotion. Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous, even appropriately sullen, but she isn't given much to work with dialog-wise while Scott Speedman is boring and unconvincing and it's sad to see the initially great-sounding plot ultimately take a backseat to tired over stylization and done-to-death action sequences.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awesome Movie!,"I thought that this movie was excellent. Now, I only saw it a few weeks ago when I rented it, and I liked it so much that I went out and bought it.To start, I thought that the actors were perfect for the movie. They (Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman) worked extremely well together. Considering that this was mainly an action movie, I must say that all of the action sequences were very well done. The fights were well choreographed and quite realistic. Also, the creature effects were great, and definitely not overdone like they were in Van Helsing. The special effects were top notch, and the movie crew got everything right.Normally, with a movie that has vampire's and werewolves, it is lame (and the whole story had been done before). With Underworld, the director put a new twist on all of the aspects of vampires vs. werewolves.Now that the sequel had already been in theaters, I can only wait for it to come out on DVD, and I am certain that i will buy it.If you like this genre, watch Underworld, and you will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A horror movie with bite,"It's been too long since a good horror movie has come out.  Underworld isn't the greatest, but it does a fine job of creating a dark world full of mystery and action.  At time the plot threads are a little tangled, but I think that adds to the overall immersion in the vampire/werewolf world.My two main gripes were the werewolves when they ran on the walls and ceilings.  Supernatural or not, it looked stupid.  And the final scene death scene of Victor, specifically the delayed action decapitation is a total copy of the Kurgan's death in Highlander.Oh one last gripe.  Michael's super powerful were-vamp transformation was also a big let down.  My imagination had some combination of Giger's alien integrated with bat and human features.Overall though, the best classic horror genre flick since Brotherhood of the Wolf and Gingersnaps.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
better than expected.,"This movie ended up being quite a bit better than I expected it to be. An 8 might be a little high, but I was in the mood for this type of movie when I watched it and it didn't disappoint. A very good plot with lots of twists and unique ideas. One thing I didn't like, however, was the major lack of vampires being vampires. You assumed the vampires were powerful, but they really didn't show you. Theycould also have played up the erotic and sensual aspects more. I would've been happy with more fangs and less guns. The overuse of blazing guns made mostof the movie seem a bit too Matrix-wannabe. Whereas with most movies likethese, the plot is usually what lacks, with this one it was the strength.

The good and the bad of underworld,"Yes this movie had some faults but overall I Thought it was good I liked how for once we had a woman main vampire that kicked butt also i liked how different this movie was from other vampire movies (you know like seeing them feasting on humans)I also like the whole idea of a thing(hybrid) stronger than a lycan and a vampire put together.Another really cool thing was the winding road it took from viktor being this saint to becoming the bad guy.And I loved how you got to know lucian and what he was about from his memories. But a big problem in this movie was the ""romance"" between Selene and Michael they said it was supposed to be like a Romeo and Juliet trapped in this chaotic setting  but really i saw that they showed very little attraction toward each other (fine example of this was the ending where you see Selene and Michael she looks back at him and just walks off you know they could have maybe hugged to show that they were going to survive this war or even a nod would have worked  but no Selene looks back at Michael with a look that shows little or no emotion and just walks away and Michael just stands there with no expression on his face and follows Selene)  so they kissed I am sorry but you can just put a kiss in a movie and say there is a romance in it but still i thought they would have played out the romance a little more than they did and i thought they could have explains things a lot better in the movie like who's blood could be used to make someone a hybrid PS trust me i am not trying to tick anyone off here I enjoyed the movie I am just showing it's faults",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie rocks!,"Although the contrast is a bit too dark, I have to say that this was a great production and commend the people who put such hard work into the making of it. The fight scenes were terrific. The theme was a bit hard to follow, but all in all, the theme was awesome. Kraven's actions lead me to hate him as a character and Lucian's overall personality draws me more towards him. That is the reason that I'd prefer the lycans over the vampires. I like the whole idea of ultra-violet ammunition and the silver nitrate bullets developed for the movie. I'm sure that it was hard work coming up with those types of weaponry just for use in the movie. This movie was great, as is the sequel, and I must say that the only reason I rate it a 9 is because of the dark contrast and the repetitive music.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Gothic battle between vampires and werewolves,"I really enjoyed this movie a lot, and it is fun to watch. The story is really creative with an all-out war between vampires and werewolves fighting against each other. I also like the vampire and werewolf mythology that serves as the film's backstory, which is creative and interesting to hear. The actual plot is a vampire who notices the werewolves hunting down a particular man. It's interesting to learn why they need this guy and the backstory of current characters. I also love the gothic atmosphere of the movie with its design and lighting that looks beautiful to look at. There's also a couple of twists that are mixed bags that are either unexpected and pretty predictable. And the movie has a suspenseful climax to it.The action scenes are pretty fun with the vampires and werewolves fighting against each other. Most of the action is just the characters shooting at each others which gets pretty tedious. But there are actual fighting between them. And it is a suspenseful movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Underperforming,"Had to sit through this recently, if I'd been on my own I'd off switched off after 10 minutes, it's just simply dreadfull.Full of style and shadows (the Matrix has a lot to answer for) it is just so dull, Beckinsale is dreadfully wooden,but then with such a poor script what can one do?What struck me about this film was just how lacking it was in soul, I sad there thinking, 'I don't care, I want to be doing or watching something else'Needless to say the end credits were a relief",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The matrix?,"I'm late in seeing this one...I liked the movie, but had it not been a virtual clone of The Matrix, I would have liked it more.The dark noir atmosphere, the high-pitched strings, the music, Victor surviving off of tubes connected throughout his body, the gun battles & kung-fu fighting, tight leather suits, the silver liquid injection...Come on...Like I said, I liked it, but...I hear there is a sequel in the works? ...Underworld: Re-Loaded Revolution?",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's not so bad,"I have to admit, I'm a bit of a fan of this movie. Sure, it is similar to a lot of other movies, but I'm a vamp fan and it's a heck of a lot better than Van Helsing, Hellboy or any other recent monster flick you care to mention. It has a plot, unlike a lot of other recent movies, and the special effects are not overboard. Just enough to get the job done. The movie also takes itself seriously and not a lot is tongue in cheek, unlike the afore-mentioned movies or Blade 2. In short, it's the closest thing to an original movie since the first Matrix. Take a chance, don't allow the lowish rating to fool you. You'll enjoy it!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fangs, Firearms & Fiends","Great movie! When I saw the trailer, I was thinking graphic novel come to life. While I have always enjoyed a good comic book, this film is way beyond any of that. Gothic grim at it's best! These were very hard people - undead people - who had been fighting a war for centuries, and were so preoccupied with killing each other that the living were actually the only winners here. The story also had a few subplots that worked well. Don't believe everything you see! The cast was brilliant and very believable. Visually, it was well thought out. Enjoy. 8 outta 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Underworld had an amazing blend of vampires and werewolves.,"I have never seen a movie, except for maybe Blade, that used the vampire world so creativley. Not to mention that the werewolf side of the story was incredible. There were a few loop holes but not enough to p*** you off, and I thought the ending was different. See it! It makes you wonder whether you would be a vampire or werewolf, I would be a vampire undoubtably.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
pretty decent flick,"Considering the onslaught on vampire films we have had in the last couple of years, this one actually came out pretty good.Kate Beckinsale delivers two punches in this one.  She looks great in her slinky black leather get-up, and actually does a fairly convincing acting job.  Scott Speedman is as hunky as he can be, and even looked good after he turned greyish-blue.  The plot ran along as it should, with well timed twists and turns, and the story itself was fresh and interesting.  Different from your typical vampire fare, especially since more vampires got their throats bitten then anyone else.  It did get pretty violent in some spots, but it wasn't so gory that I felt like I was going to loose the popcorn I consumed while I was watching it.Overall, I liked it.Rank: 8",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You either love it or you don't,"This is one of those movies where you really enjoy it or you don't. I didn't enjoy it.I have always been a vampire movie fan, so I thought I would like this a lot. Was it just me, or did these ""vampires"" show no signs of being a vampire at all? What happened to the classic symptom of not having a reflection? At least the werewolfs looked and acted like werewolfs.The acting was terrible. Kate Beckinsale seemed bored the whole time. Scott Speedman was incredibly bland. He didn't seem to mind becoming a werewolf at all. He just had a ""WTF"" look on his face the whole time. I can't point out a single person who had at least decent acting skills in the movie.The special effects were the only thing that made this movie watchable to me. Without them, I would have downright hated this movie.Like I said, you will either like this movie or you won't. If you really like vampire movies, however, you might be a little disappointed.2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It creates a feeling of being one piece in a larger story,"""Underworld"" creates a feeling of being one piece in a larger story, as if there's a lot more in the past, and probably a lot more in the future, that has yet to be told. I liked all elements of the movie, from the story and casting to the special effects. I did feel that the werewolves were a bit short-changed on screen time, but not to an irritating degree. Someone compared this movie to ""Blade""; aside from the fact that both movies feature vampires in black leather, there's not much similarity between the two. ""Underworld"" has much more backstory and an altogether stronger plot.There's definitely a feeling that a lot more can be done with these characters in the future. Hopefully, ""Underworld"" will spawn a television series or a sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's about time!,"I have watched a lot of vampire movies, and the sad thing is that most of them are pretty bad. There hasn't been a decent vampire movie since Blade (1998), and I am not of fan of mixing genre themes (i.e. vampires, werewolves, etc.), so I was skeptical about Underworld.However, I was very surprised and elated when Underworld far exceeded my expectations and turned out to be one of the best vampire movies to date. It integrates the werewolf theme in a sensible way with the war between the vampires and ""lycans"" as the main plot of the movie. The depiction of the vampires is very well done, and director Len Wiseman actually gets the vampire bite scene right. So many directors manage to mess up ""the bite"" making it look cheesy and fake--and this alone can ruin a vampire movie. Kudos to Wiseman for recognizing the importance of doing it right.I've noticed a few complaints about Underworld being a Matrix imitation, but I think anyone who says this doesn't understand film direction. Wiseman has done an excellent job of borrowing the best elements from the classics, such as, the gothic atmosphere of The Matrix and the bullet time effect that has since become the standard for fight sequences. Wiseman also pays homage to classics such as An American Werewolf in London (1981) and the vampire film tradition in general. And the movie is true to the literary folklore of the vampire and werewolf mythology.Finally, Kate Beckinsale as the vampire warrior Selene is TOTALLY HOT!!! She alone makes the movie worth seeing.Whether you are a fan of vampires, werewolves or both, I highly recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Finally a good World of Darkness Movie,"This movie finally brings together the most feared World of Darkness Creatures. The war between werewolfes and vampires. The movie has it's strange sites, but all in all it's great Entertainment.AstroGnom",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well I Liked It...,"Perhaps my expectations were too low going in, or maybe some of these ""critics"" are expecting too much from a 1st-time director and a Vampire v. Werewolves (how serious can that possibly BE taken?) movie.  It was fun, kept moving, with sharp effects and a coherent story line.  And Kate in form-fitting leather was the real kicker that made it worth $9.  As a 30-year-old male I suspect this movie was made for my demographic, and as for my opinion, I liked it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nice action and shooting,"Of course you don't go see a movie like this, for the intelligent script.

22 years later,"Still one of the best Lycanthropy genre to be made...I'm only dropping this review to pay my respects. Considering when it was made and the limited VFX possibilities at the time, it still beats other Werewolf movies made afterwards.Still waiting on a werewolf movie that will make this look like a joke. As a huge fan of the lycanthropy genre, I am constantly rooting for the success of the genre.Great cast, lovable characters, amazing plot, entertaining universe, spot on cinematography, entertaining action scenes, I could keep going.For a wear-a-wolf costume, it really is very impressive.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why the big ratings?,"I watched it again after several years, and I'd forgotten what kind of garbage this was. The so-called vampires who appear to be more like yuppie goths with fancy clothes seem to have absolutely no powers compared to the lycan. The Lycans tear them apart at will with almost no resistance. The only thing the so-called vampires can do is shoot 100 bullets per minute without hitting the target at even 10 feet. Kate Beckinsale did not get a good expression here.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"OK, but nothing too special","""Underworld"" isn't going to change either creatures' mythologies, but it's still pretty decent.**SPOILERS**Fighting a war for eons, vampire Selene, (Kate Beckinsale) takes an interest in human Michael Corvin, (Scott Speedman) which her werewolf adversaries do as well. Unable to figure out why leader Kravin, (Shane Brolly) doesn't follow up on the confrontation, she rescues him from a further attack by werewolf leader Lucian, (Michael Sheen) and tries to understand his importance. While they spend the next few days making various plans for a return for their elder, Viktor, (Bill Nighy) Lucian prepares an all-out war, and with Michael as the key, the vampires race to stop him.The Good News: There are some really nice things in here. The fact that it mixes so many different areas and ideas into it that it appears to be pretty clever. To be plunked down in the middle of a centuries long war between the two sides is nicely played out, and the few encounters between the sides are pretty much the main reason to see this. From the opening shootout that really goes where it doesn't expect it to go all the way to a slaughter among a train and the drag-down conclusion, there's a lot of action scenes in here. The assault at the apartment is really interesting, with some really innovative ideas and a really fun appeal. One of the main fascinating sequences is the car chase. Starting on a really interesting notion and continuing on inside the car, it's a fun watch with some really interesting and drives off enough of the action film chase scene clich√©s to get some excitement at the end. The ending is really great about it, and that features some more great parts about the chase. The slaughter on the train is really fun to see, as the overall action and high gore make it a really great scene. That also helps it out when it shows it, as there is some pretty good gore scenes in here. From being impaled with razor-bladed throwing discs, gunshots, scratched open across the face, part of the face sliced off and a very brutal bite on the shoulder, this isn't a gore-fest but it didn't have to be and has just enough for it to be decent enough and appeal to ones who'll really enjoy it. The werewolf design isn't all that terrible either, with a large imposing body, long powerful limbs with vicious claws, and a smaller proportionate head than usual, but it still somehow works for the design. Nowhere near the upper echelon of designs, but it works and that's what matters. The fact that they're actually live and not CGI is a huge plus, as they look more real and have a bigger degree of realism than other types. The all-important transformation comes back into play here, and the fact that they are also done in real time makes it all the better. It's not that terrible, and can feature some good moments when it has to.The Bad News: There are several problems with the film, with the biggest one being that it's just a long bore-fest at times. Apart from a couple of scenes, there's no real action here and consists of long conversation scenes that just wear on and on. This is mostly present in the middle of the movie, which has only one action scene to break things up, and after it's over, there's a long period of discussion going on. Considering that the two sides are supposedly at war with each other, why so much time is spent on talking is rather curious, and would've been far better had this been a really all-out war. That aspect of the story isn't all that well built-up either, and rather than showing the two sides really going at each other with an intense hatred, the confrontations aren't that heated until the end and the ones that happen in between are really lackluster when compared to how a war is supposed to be. The CGI is also a factor, since it always looks so obvious and most of the time can be very noticeable. It's mostly used for what should've been big action scenes, and it really detracts from what's going on. The over-glossy look to the film is one of it's biggest distraction, and it can be a detriment since, out of nowhere, there's this incredibly stylish shot that does nothing really for the film. Instead of being of importance to the film, it's just there because it can be done. There's really no value for them being there. One of the greatest damaging factors is that, since it plays like an action film, there's very little actual horror to it. With no scares or an aura of mystery surrounding everything, it really loses on the horror aspects. These elements really hurt the film.The Final Verdict: There's enough here to like, but there's also a lot to really get irritated about it. If you can get around the negative parts and accept that it's a long, drawn-out action film with monsters as the two sides, it should provide some entertainment value. It's worth a watch, but it's not as great as what's been said about it.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
well executed film,"Lately I haven't seen many good movies out there but this film restored my faith in Hollywood supernatural/sci-fi gender. From the beginning you can appreciate how well thought out the story is. I didn't think Kate Beckinsale could pull off the strong warrior type role, but she surprised me how she could have the sweetest face and still be a strong warrior (Trinity definitely is not alone in the warrior female domain).The movie is combined with several elements that I love in movies (interesting story, well executed action scenes, excellent characters and actors who play them, etc.)I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did (watch out for a sequel).",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
better than expected,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie, but was looking for some entertainment while I waited for the electricity to be turned on at home after Hurricane Isabel. Some critics tore into the story, but I found the story to be WAY better than the first Blade movie. Some of the fight scenes were cool (the one with the whips, at least at first), but most were disappointing (too short, too much guns or fangs). The creature effects too, seemed a few years behind the times. (They also kept the creature effects budget low with lots of darkness.) I would have liked to have known more about Lucian and Kraven and their whole thing, and more flashbacks with Selene's story and Viktor would have helped give that more life, too. I thought Kate was great. However, it was tiring to see her in the same rubber suit scene after scene after scene. Now, for Scott Speedman, he was a surprise. I knew he looked familiar, but it wasn't until I was able to look him up that I realized, ""Holy crap, that's the guy from Felicity????!"" He looks SO much better with the long hair (he looks good with close-shaved hair as well), and he's bulked up a bit in this movie. Overall, quite the hottie. His role wasn't fleshed out very much (they never explained any of his personal life), but he did OK with it. I enjoyed this movie and would like to see more of these characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
