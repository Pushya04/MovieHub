The series ends on a very strong note.,"The conclusion to the series hits some of the strongest emotional beats, mainly due to our long-standing connection with the characters, and provides some grand visual treats in the form of extended magical battles. While 'Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)' may be the biggest in scale and it is entertaining, it does feel lacking in depth - since some things are left oddly unexplained - and instead comes across as an extended third act for its duration. It actually plays out like one long climax, with little of the build-up required to further invest the audience, but at least it's well paced and doesn't hang about. A strong note on which to end a phenomenal series. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An Exhilarating and Beautiful Conclusion to a Magnificent Saga.,"I saw this at a preview screening in London.Deathly Hallows part 2 ends this incredibly well produced saga with tremendous grace and a beautifully orchestrated climax that I am sure will satisfy both lovers of the books and films.If you have read the books as I have you will be glad to know major key moments are intact. Much is missing but I won't dwell on that, no point, its how well this movie plays out and for me it rolls wonderfully between excitement, thrills and emotional drama towards a satisfactory (though a slightly rushed) conclusion.There are at least 2 sequences so powerful that I defy anyone not to at least stifle a tear or choke a little. One of those sequence is an exquisitely executed flashback that is pivotal to the whole story.I have to say, that despite the woes we book readers have when elements (big chunks of it too) are omitted from the movies, much credit still has to go to Steve Kloves for adapting the books for the big screen, cleverly weaving, changing and even adding new big elements to give a kinetic flow to the narrative and here it all comes together superbly.David Yates assured direction has nurtured our young actors in the last 4 films to blossom into even more adept actors who convey their characters with natural tones without overacting. Daniel Radcliffe had to carry this movie more than any other and has done so brilliantly complemented with great support from his two companions, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.Pretty much all the characters we have met in all the movies have made an appearance in this finale but one actor stands out, Alan Rickman. His portrayal of Professor Snape has always been a joy to watch (if a little novel) but here his scenes will leave a dramatic engraving in my memory. Here he elevates his portrayal of one of the most complex character in young adult literature to an unforgettable piercingly emotional one.Another actor who really shines in the few scenes that he has, is Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom who we see gradually transforming over the past films from the clumsy bullied boy to a brave warrior in this final film. Many other British thespians of the series also have their few moments to shine especially Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagal who was a delight to watch as she takes charge of the defence of Hogwarth School.As for the spectacle of the battle and showdowns, while not at the scale of Lord of the Rings, I honestly cant think how it could have been done better as the film makers have intertwined heart stopping action with dramatic progressions in the narrative. Its actually more visceral and dynamic than the rather smaller scale battle of the brilliant novels (not to take anything away from Rowling's writing).Do I have any gripes? Yes I do. Although I applaud Steve Kloves for a difficult screenplay adaption...I think he could still have done better at explaining some odd anomalies that only readers of the book will understand. This might annoy you if you haven't read the books. But its a small gripe because what we get is delightful.What an amazing achievement to faithfully bring Rowling's epic saga to the big screen with the same cast and largely the same crew, maintaining the brilliant quality right to the end.Oh my god, its only just sinking in, this was the end....but what a great great end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
End of an era... End of our childhoods... End of Harry Potter,"What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.Go see this movie!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
My childhood..,"At the start of J.K. Rowling, thank you for this wonderful series of books forever. I can tell you this current state of my childhood and my future. Sign up everywhere it has always been a part of Harry Potter's name. I'd say the most important series of my life. I owe my childhood such wonderful pass to the books and movies of this series. In this series, even though I know better than the series it has always been a special place for me in this series and it will always continue. This movie is definitely the best in the series. And the players is the most mature film. You feel throughout the film until the end of the final air and this is an amazing thing for fans like me. Book series as well as certainly never did. However, in each film it was pretty cool. And with incredible finale made this film. Harry certainly kept the best for last. Put all the music from the beginning to the end of the movie you are very successful and internal chills. You feel deeply cool is really going on. When the film ended up being a very big gap within you. Of course, you are a part of this world...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Endgame of 2011,One of the best series I've ever seen with an amazing conclusion..

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II gets everything right to send off Harry on a cinematic high,"I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they're all so great and magical. But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film.The cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.We all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don't like past Harry Potter films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"""It all ends"" well","This movie could not do any better, it ended the Harry Potter series with a bang. It is a good balance from the first part of The Deathly Hallows. The first part was more of a drama, while part two was action packed left and right. This may be my favorite movie of the series, though all of them are equally amazing. I have read the books, and there are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit perfectly well with the story, even if it isn't the original plot. Even for those who haven't read the books (why wouldn't you?!), it is equally enjoyable. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will be loved for years and years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Epic End,Even though I consider myself to be a huge HP fan I never thought I would actually give a movie from this series straight 10 out of 10. Just saw the movie today and the word epic is almost an understatement. This movie really lives up to the promises that have been made. Further more it is (in my opinion at least) the movie that stays most loyal to the book. I did miss some scenes from the book yet nothing relevant was left out. I don't want to give out any spoilers 'cause I don't want to ruin it for you but if you have read the book it will be very easy to follow and if not - well I think it still makes sense most of the time. I highly recommend you to watch it whether you're a fan or not. 10/10,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Better Ending,"Endings are usually the problems of most movie series. They usually end up being mediocre & unsatisfying or they are made to cash in people. The great thing about Harry Potter movies, the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It's more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.Deathly Hallows part 1 is just the first and the half of the second act of the story. Deathly Hallows part 2 begins straight forward to its continuation of the last Harry Potter film. And of course, if you haven't seen Deathly Hallows Part 1 or any of the Harry Potter movies, you'll be confused to death. Obvious isn't it? It's pretty clever to make the whole Deathly Hallows story like a slow burn. It started from silent thrills, plans, and escapes to big and loud battles.The series doesn't only end with big and loud action. It also gives us some nostalgia from the old Harry Potter films. And we still get to see more of the characters. The movie itself is pretty exciting. It's a good choice to let David Yates direct the rest of the Potter films because he made this series darker and bolder. Aside from that the film still has its compelling moments like the Prince's Tale scene.No need to tell about the performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and the rest of the cast because they are obviously good to their characters but there is one actor here is worth mention and that is Alan Rickman. We already knew him as Snape but there is one scene where we see more of his character and his performance was excellent. The filmmaking, the special effects is obviously good. The music score really made the battle scenes epic and perfect for a final film.For me it's really hard to write a review about Harry Potter. Is it because I never read the books or I'm not really a huge fan but in my opinion Harry Potter is a successful series. If I rank all the movie conclusions, this could be number three because nothing beats Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Either you're a fan or not, you'll love this series. And yes, this is another remarkable movie series.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A 2021 opinion of someone who has not read the novel and watched the series at two different decades of his age,"In the beginning, I want to thank the author j.k. Rowling, even tho I didn't read her books but I saw it in this magnificent series of films
I didn't read it because English is not my native language and at that time I didn't learn it yet,so I didn't think the translated version will be as great as the original.But now after what I have seen in the series twice, I am considering reading it After I improved my English over the years.About the series, I saw it when I was younger nearly 10 and it was great but now when I saw it a second time while am 19 I understand it and appreciate it more it becomes greater, I wished I saw it in theater Yet None of its value has been lost by watching it on the tv.At third. As for the characters, there were great performances from all of them, but I loved the most harry and Hermione and comes second snape, Sirius, Hagrid, 2001's dumbledore, luna, Wesley.It's by far The largest number of great characters I've seen in one movie series.In the end. About this last part of the series, it created a perfect ending Any fan would seek for, I won't spoil by talking about details but I've experienced every emotion I have on it.It was really a masterpiece by all what it means.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Brilliant!,"I predict this will be the movie of the year.I was thoroughly immersed in this movie from start to finish and when leaving the cinema (twice in the last 24hours) I could only hear the endless chatter of comments like ""That was great"" and ""Brilliant way to end the series"".Though, in my opinion, some key factors were missing or needed more exploration I think you'll find it's easy to clue on whether you've read the novels or not. Some previously main characters were lucky to slip in a line or two whilst some of the more minor characters sneaked their way up to the top.The film was brilliantly directed. Music, lighting, script; everything was flawless. Some scenes had my skin crawling and heart racing for absolutely no reason other then the fact that it was utterly eerie, it was hard not to grip the armrests in anticipation.Dramatic musical build up mixed perfectly with lingering silences in all the right places. Spots that would usually host a soft violin were left with the honest and real quiet so that you could wrap your head around everything.My emotions were chewed up and spit out over and over, I didn't know whether to grieve, cheer, laugh or scream and neither did the audience I was with.By the end I couldn't even think of the fact that it was the end of an era, I couldn't even grasp everything that had happened which is why I'll be going to see it for the third time within this next week.You wont regret paying for the full experience with this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

A Brilliant ending to a great great franchise.,"I quite luckily got the chance to see this at an early screening on July 7th.First impressions of the film? Brilliant.Director David Yates, who also directed the 5th, 6th and 7th films is back to direct the final. This pleases me because these 3 films are my personal favourites out of the 7 that have come out so far so I think it's fair to say that I was expecting big things from this. I'm very pleased to say that he's pulled it off ending the series in a fast paced, well written final act.The film (in case you're wondering) picks up straight after where Part 1 ended, Voldemort (Ralph Finnes) has the most powerful wand in his possession and he's finally ready to succeed in what he tried to do over 15 years ago. He finally has the power to kill Harry Potter. I won't go into much more detail in what happens as most people will have read the book and I don't want to drop spoilers! Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) need to seek out and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. This is the only way that will give them a chance of stopping He Who Must Not Be Named.Their final journey takes them to places we may not have seen recently or remembered, places such as Gringotts Bank in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Along the way they encounter a variety of creatures, both friend and foe from dragons to spiders, death eaters to old friends and of course, the Dark Lord himself. Will Voldemort Succeed? Or will good trump evil? For those who haven't read the book this is your chance to find out.What I especially love about this film and Part 1 is the direction in which they've taken, adding more cheesy lines and (for example in Part 1) that dance sequence. I feel that these small touches bring the films closer to our hearts and help us to connect with the film a lot more. Sure they leave out a lot of information that the books provide but that's the same with all film adaptations! They've got the main story down and where they've deviated from the book it has been for the best. Not everything written down on paper will translate into visually appealing footage.Part 1 to me also felt unfinished (well it was only half the book I suppose!), I mean in the way that it was long and never seemed to climax. Sure at the end of Part 1 Voldemort gets the want he so badly seeks for and leaves then the films ends on a giant cliffhanger. Part 2 definitely adds the rest of that epicness that so many other films have towards the end. It's full of action! I definitely believe that both Part 1 and 2 are best viewed with a short as possible gap in between them. Otherwise it's like watching the first disc from one of the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings and not watching the second disc for another 6 months!This paragraph is about the visuals and 3D. Skip to the final paragraph for final thoughts.Visually the film is stunning from an effects point of view. From the trailer alone you can see that this film has quite a lot of action in it, crumbling buildings, hundreds of spells and lots of fire. Everything looks great, from the wand duals to the dragons it all is fantastic. Also this time around it is being showed in 3D and is the first (and (probably) last!) potter film to be shown in this way. Now I was very sceptical about this, especially since they announced that the films (originally both parts) would be converted from 2D to 3D instead of being natively filmed in 3D. I believe that what they should have done was what they did with Part 1, scrap the 3D. I'm going to say that it's not great, at times it's pretty good, but never great. For the most part it's okay. I'm going to compare it with the last blockbuster film to come out in 3D, Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The 3D effect is not even close to looking as good as what that film (shot in 3D) had. So I'm going to tell you now, 2D is the best dimension to watch this film in. Having said that if you still want to (or have to) see it in 3D by all means do, the 3D doesn't take away anything from the film, but it doesn't add much.I will end by saying that I definitely recommend this film for everyone, especially Potter fans. The ending that many thought could easily be done wrongly has been done right. Then when you think of Part 1 and 2 as the same film I believe that they are easily the best Potter films. This truly is a fitting ending for the boy who lived.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A breathtaking finale to an amazing series,"Moments after I saw the very first trailer for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I was crawling with goosebumps and plagued with anxiety. After almost a decade, the franchise was coming to an end. I had already read the book, knew the plotting, and remembered the fates of all the characters, but the trailer left me in a near unfathomable state -- the end was coming, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.Picking up practically the exact moment where the first half of the left off, the film begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) still on the trail for the elusive Horcruxes that make up Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul. Rather quickly, it becomes apparent that the group will need to travel back to Hogwarts, and it is there that the final battle to determine the fate of the wizarding community, and the world at large, begins.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a fitting finale for one of the best and most consistent series of the past decade. It is a simply wondrous spectacle that extends and concludes the story wonderfully. While the story and effects are just as great as always, it is the final battle we have all been waiting for that delivers in spades. It is everything you imagined it would be and more. Splitting the films may still be a debatable decision, but the film is able to stand on its own much the same way the previous part did. It is that good, and that gripping. It may be the shortest Harry Potter film, but it is also the only one that feels like it knows exactly where it wants to navigate itself to with each new scene.Grint, Watson and especially Radcliffe are simply stunning in their performances. They have grown up with these characters, and have gotten progressively stronger as actors with each new film. But here, they have totally immersed themselves into their roles, and the results are nothing short of magical. They are exactly how you remember them written in the book, and move from sadness, to courageous, to fearful, and more, with such passion and conviction that you forget they are simply acting. Their styles are that strong, and help provide the emotional crux the film leans on and never from.Even with their varying screen times, the supporting cast is impeccable as always. Alan Rickman is spectacular and simply devastating as the devious Professor Snape. Maggie Smith finally gets some real time to shine as Professor McGonagall, as does Julie Walters as Molly Weasley (who gets the greatest line in the film). Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham Carter, George Harris, Tom Felton, Michael Gambon and Matthew Lewis also perfect their characters, and help deliver awesome performances all around.But the supporting screen time is dominated by Fiennes as Voldemort. When Harry and his friends are not the focal point, Fiennes simply owns everyone. His performance always ranked amongst the best of the series, and he does not let the finale slow him down. He is horrifically evil in his interpretation, and frequently compares to his absolutely and terrifyingly brilliant performance as Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. The fear that courses through the characters' veins at the very sight or mention of his name, courses equally through the audience. Even when he is being darkly hilarious, Fiennes is downright petrifying. He is the stuff that nightmares are made of. His work is just that close to perfect in the role that it gives an almost genuine authenticity that should not come so effortlessly.But like all Harry Potter films however, the cohesive product is not without its faults.My main gripe with the film come out of the sheer fact that because it was split off into two parts, it allowed some of the more useless and careless sections of prose to make it into the film. Much like the extended and excruciatingly long camping trip from the first half, the second half gets dragged down by the addition of standout moments from the book that felt awful the first time you read them, and come off even worse on the screen. I know they are pandering to the audience, and adding just as much as they possibly could to make the film feel complete, but there was a reason so much was cut out of the other books when they made the leap to the big screen. This is the shortest of the saga by a long shot, and the chaotic pace makes it feel like it could have been even shorter had they chopped more out.My other gripe is the 3D. The filmmakers said they did not have the right amount of time to convert the first half properly, so they just scrapped the plans. The movie looked amazing anyway, and I found myself puzzled at what exactly would have been three-dimensional about it about the second part. Save for a scene early on involving a rather badly rendered dragon, there is not much else that takes advantage of the added 3D. The majority of the film just looks and acts normal, never exploring the format, and never giving the audience a reason to care or change their minds on the quickly dying trend.In what feels like a blink of the eye, the Harry Potter film series is over. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has arrived, and with it, an incredible end to the franchise. It stumbles in some places because of the inane and disappointing prose of the book, but the filmmakers have stayed true to their book and film fans, and delivered a tremendously worthy finale. It is one of the strongest films of the year, and one of the best film finales ever conceived.8.5/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint have been awesome from start to finish. These are the best memories that I can keep on forever. This is a lifetime movie. It brings adventure, travel, humor, sports, and a spectacular epic soundtrack and storyline throughout this whole process of filmmaking. There's also a sense of generosity and above all love. So, I'd highly recommend watching the movie saga.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
They finally got it right!,"While never an avid Harry Potter fan, I have watched all eight Harry Potter films on the big screen over the past decade. It's been a long, bumpy ride, with some films stronger than others - mainly the first few (in my own honest opinion). After a while, however, it all felt like the biggest cinematic tease ever. I mean, we've been told about Voldermort ever since the beginning, and we've known all along that the saga will end with this big, epic fight between good and evil... err, I mean Harry vs. Voldermort. However, that never came (except for a few teases here and there), and when the producers decided to postpone the inedible and split the last film into two, it became ever so frustrating.Thanks god, then, that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 came along to right all the wrongs the previous films have made and to give us the proper closure we've all been waiting for. Finally, after all this time, we get to see the main protagonist for more than a glance. We get resolutions to plot lines that began in parts 6 & 7, Hogwarts makes an awesome comeback for one, final stand between forces between both sides, and there are even some twists and turns that echo all the way back to parts 1 & 2.So yes, THIS is the Harry Potter we've all been waiting for all along: edgy, dark, more mature and complex than ever before, with solid performances from all involved (especially Ralph Fiennes, who gets some space to play with his character, and that guy that plays Neville Longbottom, who grew up to become quite a man from that mousy little kid he once was). But more so - and unlike any of the other films in the series – HP7b stands as an independent piece (alongside its 2010 counterpart), and doesn't leave the viewer unsatisfied. Here, we get a proper ending, we know this is the Harry Potter to end all 800 or so films that came before, and it seems that the producers knew this and gave it all they could. I only wish they've done this more often during the previous films, instead of saving the best for last.All in all, this is THE best Harry Potter I've seen from all the eight, and a truly exciting roller coaster of a film, filled with top notch storytelling alongside impressive special effects (even the 3D felt appropriate and relevant). I gave it a very solid 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Maybe someone wants to read a different story,"When the first episode of this serie reached the big screen, I was 20 and couldn't care less. I was wondering the reason why so many people went literally crazy about Harry Potter in all those years. It took me about 20 years to find out the reason why. Now, I feel kinda ashamed about any prejudice that I brought.
I thought they were childish, they had nothing to teach, they were just movies made to fill in the cinemas without a real good content. I was wrong.
I watched all Harry Potter's movies during the last week. I'm 40 now but while watching those movies, I got captured by their atmosphere, sympathinzing with their characters, breathing the same air, dreaming of being there lending an hand... My mind went back in time when I was child and shared the same problem with some of characters. Those movies can teach a lot of things, important things: the value of the friendship, love, sacrifice, compassion... They are something I would make my sons watch.
The last episode leaves the audience with a sense of fulfillment, yet a sense of void. It's end. Period.
David Yates made an extraordinary job as director: the movie slows down when it has to but the action is very fast paced. Acting is impressive, as well. You can tell, movie after movie, how much mature the youngest ones became. The use of CGI is well balanced as it doesn't ruin the movie by being too much invasive. Soundtrack and photograph are simply perfect... The choice of filming is such beatyful places in Great Britain, once again, helps the sense of wonder.

An emotional roller-coaster and the perfect end to constantly better series,"For many fans (and let me get this out now: I am one of them), this is  much more than just another film in the franchise: it's the it's the  end of an era, or simply the end of a journey which lasted for over 10  years (14 if you count the first book, back in 1997).

There will not be any other Harry Potter, no matter what. The film  clearly knows all that and consciously plays to it, tapping into our  deepest-self, reminding us about this journey we've taken and how we've  grown up with it.   The previously-unknown David Yates has slowly been able to find his own  voice with the latest 4 of the 8 instalments, by combining the sense of  magic the first 2 films had, the darker tone introduced to us by Afonso  Cuaron (with the third episode) but also that more grown-up approach to  the story, which has been brewing and growing with each chapter (and  book of course), but he also had the courage to actually hack to pieces  the overly-written source and actually make a better film (clearly  after book 3, no editor would dare to tell JK Rowling to cut anything  out). In this last ""Deathly Hallow"", he was able to basically stretch  the final battle over the course of the whole film, making it seem  greater and more epic than it's ever been in the book (In the end, box  office aside, it really did pay off to split the movie in two parts).  Considering the incredible amount of expectations which a film like  this can carry and, consequently, the almost impossible task of  bringing everything to a close, HP 7.2 does a really good job! Yes, of  course there will be some disappointed people, but I think the  disappointment will come from the fact that secretly each of us would  like this story to go on forever and, no matter what, you can never  please everyone. Considering what a massive commercial machine Warner  Bros is we must be so thankful for the way the franchise has been  handled. Producer David Heyman is obviously a man of heart, who cares  for his fans and set out to make the best films he could ever make,  playing on the strengths of its (let's be honest) not-so-perfect source  and in the end making it an even better product. In the end this film  must be judged with that same heart and not so much with the brain,  taking in consideration the series as well as this ending.  And you know what? My heart can't stop saying ""I just loved the  journey, thank you so much for it",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Exciting finale that improves on the book's climax,"So the Potter machine is finally at it's end, with the decision to split the final book into two films proving a financial masterstroke. Ten years on from the first, the films have had a number of different directors, used practically every fine British actor there is that's still alive, and have ranged vastly in quality. They have also become extremely dark, with the 'love will triumph over evil' moral and the never-truly-threatening bad guys of the early two films being replaced with murdered house elves, tortured children, mass murder, and main characters being mercilessly killed in the blink of an eye. Author J.K. Rowling wanted the fans to grow up with Harry and mature with the books, and on many levels it works very well.Part 1 left us with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) having to bury one of his trusted friends, and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Feinnes), along with his Death Eaters, are closing in on Hogwarts. Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have still got some horcruxes (pieces of Voldemort's soul, for those you haven't watched it) left to find, and arrive at Hogsmeade to find a way into Hogwarts, which is being run by the evil (?) Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). They find a way in thanks to Dumbledore's brother Aberforth (Ciaran Hinds), and are quick to take control of the school. But with Voldemort approaching, teachers and pupils alike must join forces in a climactic battle, while Harry scours the school for the horcruxes.While Part 1 seemed to be stretched out and become rather slow in the middle section, Part 2 is action-packed. I'm not ashamed to say that I am a fan of the books, yet I was disappointed with the last one. After so long reading, the finale was anti-climatic and wasn't as dramatic or revelatory as I was expecting it to be. This is the main reason why Part 2 works so well. It extends the final showdown, making it rough, exciting and worthy of watching seven previous films, as Harry and Voldemort cross wands and fists. A slight disappointment though is the Battle of Hogwarts, which was a great section of the book. Giants, werewolves and stone men alike clash with the wizard and Death Eaters as Hogwarts is reduced to rubble. The build-up to it is great, but then the action shifts away to Harry, and his search for the horcruxes is less interesting than the battle happening around him.It is as big a climax as you could hope for though, with every penny of the massive budget visible on screen. The special effects are virtually flawless, but the majority of the huge cast are give little or nothing to do. The likes of Emma Thompson, Jim Broadbent, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Gary Oldman, John Hurt, Julie Walters and David Thewlis, who are the pinnacle of British talent, are given little more than a few lines. I know, these were major players in previous films, but with this kind of talent reduced to little more than cameos, it makes it upsetting that we're stuck with Daniel Radcliffe for the duration (likeable as he is). Ralph Fiennes though, who only appears briefly in the previous films, is given a lot more to chew on, and revels in it.A fitting climax to a memorable series of films. Although never achieving anywhere near greatness, Harry Potter notched up some decent films (forgetting the first two), especially Alfonso Cuaron's third instalment, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It will be interesting to see where the three leads go from this, as none of them are the most gifted of actors, and it's a wonder if they'll ever manage to shake off the phenomenon that is Harry Potter.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Should have done much better, an insult to Rowling and the fans!","There are an awful lot of reviews talking about how this film is 'the best yet' and how it 'ticks all the boxes' or is 'a must for fans'. It is none of these!7 years ago I walked out of watching the 3rd film cursing and swearing out loud about how poor the conversion of book to film had been done. Scenes dropped and changed for 'time considerations' whilst others were invented and thrust in- all creating plot holes that did not exist in the novel.This time I walked out praying that I live long enough to see someone take the books and redo the ENTIRE series properly, using the obvious failures done in the films to date as a road map for improvement.**SPOILERS**It is, unfortunately, near impossible to give a proper review of this film without including at least some spoilers. Whilst one can make generic statements such as 'divergence from source material is too great', 'plot holes cause a lack of integrity' and 'over editing leads to a lack of connection to the characters' none of it means too much without going into at least a little detail.Simple things such as not showing the death of Fred, despite having gone into George's injury so well in part 1, or the massively powerful and indestructible Elder Wand being snapped in half with little to no effort whatsoever are good examples. Bellatrix's wand was more durable for god's sake!Meanwhile, having just spent an entire previous film searching for Horcruxes they suddenly jump from finding one in the form of a cup based on logical deduction to guessing where the next one is on what appears to be a whim. For the sake of taking 90 seconds of screen time to mention that the ring was Slytherin's and the goblet was Hufflepuff's, and it would seem logical for Voldemort's ego to have a desire to stamp his dark magic on a legendary item for each of the 4 founders- therefore Ravenclaw would be a good place to look next- instead Yate's goes and has the characters make a crazy leap of logic for which they need to endanger their lives with no apparent reason behind it whatsoever. This is storytelling of the lowest calibre!These things aren't just failures to adapt the book correctly when to do so would have been better than making alteration, they are basic failures of storytelling that any student on a film or writing course would have lost marks on if it were an assignment. These plot holes, discontinuities, omissions and alienations are in such great number that if it were an assignment it would, in fact, have been lucky to scrape through with a D as a result!No doubt we will see the score of this film drop over time as more and more people- particularly on 2nd watching, or seeing it for the first time on an average size TV or ten years from now when special effects technology has moved on- find the imagery far less awe inspiring than the films flaws. At that point the realisation will kick in that this is actually a very poor rendition of the source material that almost any hack director could have put out just as well if not better with the budget and cast/crew available to hand.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"The winner is the quality of beliefs, not their quality kolichestvo.Pobezhdaet convictions, not their quantity.","Frankly it's sad, and at the same time happy. I simply do not belong to those who have always responded with a special enthusiasm for any of the movie franchise about a young wizard. However, I am glad that we always had to consciously approach the fact of its existence. Much has happened over the years. For some of us have been ups and downs in relation to the part of Harry Potter, for someone not. We are alone. Such stories - only a sign of how this loneliness we are trying to escape. When there is that it is able to unite us, and the same eyes we are able to watch the same story. Harry and his friends always reminded very much of themselves, because of two things - simplicity and good nature. Also, like any other person, we grow, mature, and it all happens under the influence of other factors. We observe and listen, exactly the same as the one when a little boy, in the course of years became a man. He had fears, and there were mysteries. He sought to solve them, and overcome all sorts of difficulties. He was tough, and friends were always glad to help. Is this not a reflection of our life in certain stages of her? Istoriya3D finally reached the tipping point that, when there was absolutely no childhood, and adulthood appeared views of the surrounding events. No more compromises, and as it turned out, it had to Yates to clear better film3D Potteriana.Finals begin at the same place and finished last. Harry continues to search and destroy krestrazhem, revealing a truth long after the other. Each of the stories of how wonderful flower blooms on the quality of its on-screen incarnation, and this against the background of the war, that this time reached the very heart of the School of Wizardry - Hogwarts. So we have not seen it, and now never see. For many viewers Hogwarts was a kind of contact point values, which were always presented in the form of friendship and nastoyatelstva. And no more delays, no unnecessary chatter. Only Harry, only fidelity, and pursuing all the destruction. You can refer yourself to whichever of the categories of viewers, but the fact remains a fact for all - ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is the perfect combination of language and the magic of cinema, so perfect a form of which is sought or one year.Yates throws us into an even more oppressive and heavy atmosphere with all the consequent seriousness from the first seconds. Conversation with Kryukohvatom each evokes the idea of ​​just how significant was the approach to creating images of goblins, only gaining full speed as soon as we find ourselves in a bank vault. Excellent work on the sound makes itself felt, balancing between the absolute silence, drama and suspense.Yet in one part of the franchise was not represented in such a grand magic number, as here. If someone had thought of her lack of a rare and often repeated occurrence, there is an argument not able to find a way for his being. Scenes from the attack on the school and a further battle in its territory amazing imagination, especially by the scope with which this material came to the creators. Protection of Hogwarts gorgeous scenes extras are told by their size, and many characters appear in a surprisingly strong and significant way.The entire color stunning British school of acting punches for most of the scenes, making us even more insight to treat them. Finally, the record screen time was Ralph Fiennes, whose ""you know who"" the destruction of each of the next Horcrux is even more direct correspondence notions of darkness and gloom. Neville takes off from their shoulders image of a modest and humble guy, and gives your episodes live energy of goodness and faith. Home trio strongly demonstrates a complete renunciation of those pranks that are brought before us in various amounts for previous years. Romantic issues are themselves short, direct and confident answers. This is not the children we once knew. Now it's two guys, behind which the power and courage, and a real woman, able to charm anyone looking right at it man. However, I think, a hero of the imagery comes to Severus. It is starting to deploy its history, it's not just Harry. It is not just the bar, which surely holds Yates first hour and a half. It is much more than that.Severus makes history more than ever to penetrate the gap and in the emotional space in which Alan Rickman is calling us. Beginning to emerge as answers to many protracted and complex issues. What happens immediately taking shape full epics, which is so easily dissolved, knowing how long we were going to this. And the last conversation with Harry Dambusom only emphasizes the last time that a tipping point, when the whole world that was built many years around one person starts to go away from under his feet. Saying goodbye to them, leaving alone with the problem itself throughout his life that he so carefully prepared.In the finals can be found inconsistencies with the book, but their role does not affect the plot by a radical way, and all the changes made by Yeats, were personally approved by Rowling. Staged ending only emphasizes the importance and drama of the whole junction, causing the heroes to face any one time with each other.

*The Triumph of Light: A Spellbinding Conclusion*,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is not just a film; it is a breathtaking crescendo that brings an extraordinary saga to a triumphant yet bittersweet finale. In this explosive conclusion, director David Yates has woven together a tapestry of emotion, action, and resolution, proving once again that the magic of storytelling transcends generations.As the final chapter unfolds, we are thrust directly into the heart of the Battle of Hogwarts, a vivid and relentless confrontation between good and evil. The stakes have never been higher, with the fate of the wizarding world hanging in the balance. The cinematography is astonishing, capturing the chaotic beauty of the battle as spells light up the night sky and the fate of beloved characters is decided amidst pandemonium. Every frame is two parts artistry and one part adrenaline, expertly drawing viewers into the whirlwind of emotions that accompany the fight against Voldemort.Central to this narrative are the unwavering themes of love, sacrifice, and redemption. As Harry, Hermione, and Ron forge ahead, they embody the essence of friendship-facing their fears and standing resolute against darkness. Daniel Radcliffe delivers a heart-wrenching performance, encapsulating Harry's burden with an elegance that resonates deeply. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint shine, revealing their characters' growth and the indomitable spirit forged in adversity. Their camaraderie encapsulates the very heart of the series, reminding the audience that true strength lies in unity.The exploration of Lord Voldemort, portrayed with chilling ferocity by Ralph Fiennes, is mesmerizing. His relentless pursuit of power and disregard for life juxtaposed with the bravery of our heroes serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of tyranny. The film's emotional depth is further enhanced by poignant character arcs, including the redemptive journey of Severus Snape, brought to life in a haunting performance by Alan Rickman. The revelations about loyalty and love add layers to the intricately woven narrative.One of the most unique aspects of the film is its ability to balance epic action sequences with reflective moments. Whether it's Harry visiting the ghostly remnants of his past or witnessing the sacrifices of beloved secondary characters like Fred Weasley and canonically diverse figures such as the brave members of Dumbledore's Army, every scene contributes to a rich tapestry of storytelling. The result is a film that engages both the heart and mind, urging viewers to contemplate the complexities of morality and heroism.The climactic sequence, filled with iconic one-liners and heart-stopping action, is a masterclass in filmmaking. The emotional farewell as Harry faces Voldemort is not merely a battle; it's the culmination of a decade-long journey, the embodiment of faith, hope, and love triumphing over despair. The final moments resonate with poignancy, as audiences bear witness to the end of an era, reminding us that though the saga concludes, the magic it instilled in hearts around the world continues.""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is an unparalleled cinematic experience that elevates fantasy into art. It is a stunning journey that encapsulates the essence of what it means to be truly human-resilient in the face of darkness and unyieldingly loyal to those we love. This film not only offers closure but also leaves an indelible spell on those who have followed Harry's journey, making it a quintessential piece of cinema that will be cherished for generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Not all that magical.,"The magic is over. The spells, charms and adventures that enchanted the world for over a decade have all come to an end. And as one might naively expect, the cherry on the cake ought to eclipse everything else we have witnessed so far. Does the eighth instalment in this seven part series live up to its staunch expectations? Well, maybe. Maybe not.Giving away the plot would be a grave injustice to the movie, the weight of which I refuse to carry upon my shoulders. Maybe it all ends well. Maybe Voldemort is revealed to be Harry's long lost father. Or maybe the Director goes completely bonkers, trashes the book and decides to introduce bad bunny rabbits who like eating pig foetuses for breakfast. Instead, it is the intricacies of the film that need to be talked about – some well appreciated and some deservingly ripped apart.The first thing that strikes you as you enter the theatre laden with popcorn, Coke and other movie viewing paraphernalia is the darkness. The movie seems to have been shot in a perpetual absence of light, and though this might seem appropriate for the tense, evil atmosphere, there are parts when it gets onto your nerves and you feel like hurling your 3-D glasses into your neighbour's face and watching the movie in blurred, yet bright two dimensions, which is a better bet than viewing silhouettes of god-knows-what. But, let's not begrudge the movie for that.The acting department is an area that I bear no complaints against; not major ones anyway. Daniel Radcliffe dons the clothes of Harry Potter with ease. He has grown with the viewers, with the story, but hasn't outgrown his role – something that is further highlighted in the movie. From the puny, eleven year-old a decade earlier, he has transformed into a heroic man with stubble and all. Emma Watson follows suit with her portrayal of the know-it-all Hermione Granger. Rupert Grint acts about as well as a dead horse; and a grumpy one at that, but thankfully the director has kept him much in the dark. Ralph Fiennes is impeccable as the Dark Lord and manages to instil fear in you even through the screen. But the real torchbearer is Alan Rickman as Severus Snape. Dark; cold and deadly, he bring life to character unlike anyone else in the film. However, the other characters that have been given screen time – the Weasleys, Hagrid, Lupin, Professor Flitwick – to name a few, seems rather forced because they have a very pettifogging role to play despite the fact that they are some of the most important and well-characterized people in the series. On the contrary, these along with others turn the movie into a reunion of sorts in which the viewer is reminded of what each character previously meant to him. Touching? Yes. Commendable? No.The movie certainly isn't an epitome of perfection and has its own flaws. Though it successfully transcends the paper-to-screen barrier, something that its predecessors have miserably failed at, it does so rather painstakingly. There are times when the movies ceases to serve its purpose and pretends to be an ode to its own past, and though these moments will fill you with a fuzzy warmth, it doesn't aid the progress of the film. Also, the film lacks goose bumps-raising moments which ones would expect from an epic of this reputation, which is further worsened by a weak soundtrack. When a person is dying, ones tends to expect a lamenting dirge in the background, but here all ones hears are the victim's nauseating gasps and groans. As a result of which even scenes where beloved characters are slain give rise to ennui than to sympathy.The battle of Hogwarts is a farrago of red lights, green lights, giants, gargoyles, people running around and chaos in general, in which even the cameraman seems to have a hard time following Harry. It lacks sentimentality and adrenaline-filled moments which the book brought along with it.On the whole, the movie might serve as an entertainer for some, but hardly so for aficionados who have stuck with this saga from its inception onto the reel. A lot is missing, a lot is undone and you are left pitying Voldemort for being unable to get a nose-job. To think that something that began with a man killing a boy's parents would snowball into something this awe-inspiring is an achievement in itself and reason enough to watch the movie. The realization that it all ends once and for all does make for a befitting conclusion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

A very satisfying conclusion to an epic series...,"HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS Part 2 moves forward where it left off with Dobby's death toward a stunning conclusion with the final violent confrontation between Harry and Lord Voldemort. The richly crafted characters bring a lot of warmth and humor between all of the tense situations, which makes the whole project such a delight to watch.However satisfying the conclusion is, winding up the tale nineteen years later with a grown-up Potter and friends seeing their children off to Hogwart, I found some discomfort in the decision to play many key scenes in almost complete darkness. I repeat here what I said in my review of Part 1: ""Many of the 'dark' scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt."" Still, I think the contrast between light and dark was ""off"" once again in the DVD transfer and too many scenes are underlit and obscured by bad lighting techniques.Having said that, the performances are all first-rate, with all of the British thespians doing fantastic jobs in both leading and pivotal roles. But the standout among all the players is Alan Rickman as ""Snape."" His character is revealed to be much more than the one-dimensional man he seemed to be in earlier chapters. He speaks every word with great authority. And, of course, the other standout is Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, hissing his lines in a threatening manner accompanied everywhere by a slithering snake. Seeing him get his comeuppance is one of the major satisfactions in the whole story.An almost unrecognizable Ciaran Hinds turns up as Aberforth Dumbledore, one of the many ""surprises"" among the supporting players. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint do their usual ensemble playing with finesse, embodying their characters more completely than ever.Alexandre Desplat's background score is stirring whether it's being forceful or gentle and is a pleasure to listen to under the closing credits.Summing up: A very satisfying conclusion to an epic series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

All the knots tied from the first part are opened and what can the viewer want more. Direct encounter between Harry and Voldemort at the end and Harry throwing the Elder wand at the end gives a true meaning as Harry does not run for the quest of power.

An Positive end to a Memorable Franchise,"It has been a long time coming, but the Harry Potter series has come to an end, and on a positive note to boot. I was lucky enough to catch it at a midnight screening, where the atmosphere and anticipation was unbelievably high, as you would expect! Having read all seven books (albeit some time ago) and regardless of me knowing what should be happening while I watched the movie, there were many unexpected moments to savor. Aside from a couple of minor nuances, I left the cinema very pleased that the franchise was given such a wonderful end.This movie is just about everything a fan of the series could want. A plot that manages to incorporate all major events from the book along with an ever-present haunting tone throughout. Virtually every major and minor character from the novel gets some form of appearance as well. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Voldermort's (Ralph Fiennes) battle was a little short for my liking, however its intensity made up for a lack of length. In terms of rounding off an adventure, this movie did a solid job.The movie's intro is short and sweet, throwing you directly into the end of where the first left you, which is great. Pacing is, for the most part, cleverly done. The movie's action sequences are balanced nicely with some more reflective moments. This is where Snape (Alan Rickman) shines. His screen time was actually much less than what I was anticipating, but he makes excellent use of what time he has. You can't help but feel some form of empathy for Rickman's character as his story unfolds. It almost steals the show.Tone and lighting were done to perfection. We've come a long way from the cheery and very colorful opening films to the gritty and dark ones in the past few years. The darkness continues increasing to an exciting crescendo in this movie. There is again a ridiculously limited color palette to the scenes, but it's appropriate. They've become evident since the third film, The Prisoner of Azkaban. Some don't and won't like it, but it all feels worthwhile now for the climax in this final chapter.The film is by far not perfect though. The movie felt a tad broken up and rushed in several parts, particularly in some battle scenes towards the conclusion of the film. Sometimes we would be thrown from one place to the next unnecessarily. Some will like the chaotic pacing in these parts, but for me it gave an impression of easiness to the lead trio's task of destroying horcruxes (which the books show it was anything but). It's almost as if they were simple side tasks before the final confrontation, instead of crucial and necessary steps they should have been.The biggest criticism of the film must lie in its ignorance of any character that happens to not be named Harry Potter. Because of this, many relationships between other characters don't feel developed enough. Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are constantly distanced from Harry. When you compare the book to the film you almost feel that anything outside of Harry was tacked onto the story line here. The concept of 'good' vs. 'evil' seems to be lost and substituted with 'Harry' vs. 'Voldermort.' People would argue that that's how it should be, but that doesn't do justice to the other characters present. There was nothing more painful though than seeing some people swept aside like they never existed.But, for almost everyone, the intense build-up to the final encounter between Voldermort and Harry will make up for that. Ralph Fiennes as Voldermort is as menacing as ever playing the pale-skinned antagonist. Notable appearances that deserve a mention include Helena Bonham Carter (as Bellatrix Lestrange) and John Hurt (as Ollivander) with amusing and pensive roles respectively.The attention to visual details is also amazing. Hogwarts, where majority of the film's setting takes place, changes dramatically as the film goes on. You almost feel trapped within the school with the other characters as the darkness draws nearer. The school, ironically, never felt so alive during this movie. Sound and music were as sharp as any of the previous movies, and contributed to this wonderful mood.In the end, the film rounds off well. Although I despised it in the book, the final scene, and in particular the final shot of the film, brought a smile to my face. A superb ending to a franchise that's been magical in more ways than one.7.5/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Hogwarts Kids Are True To Their School,"Watching Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, Part 2 put me in mind of the old Beach Boys song about Be True To Your School. What these kids go through for the Alma Mater is definitely above and beyond for most of us, but all in a day's work for young wizards.At the end of Part 1, there's been a hostile takeover at Hogwarts Academy with perennial villain Alan Rickman the new headmaster. Michael Gambon has been killed and Daniel Radcliffe as protagonist Harry Potter along with two trusty sidekicks Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are in exile and seeking a way for an academic counterrevolution. That they succeed can be told to you by any of the millions of readers of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, but with a lot of interesting plot twists in which young Radcliffe learns a lot about himself and the very definite purpose he's been put on earth for.Though with the huge readership worldwide that the Harry Potter books enjoy, the only real criticism I can level at this or at most of the other films is that you really have to be immersed in Potter lore to know exactly what's going on. And that's bad if you missed a couple of the films when they were out as I did and still haven't made them up as yet.J.K. Rowling ended her series and this should end the series with public acclaim intact and fan base satisfied. For myself even with some problems following it every now and then I enjoyed this and the other films of the series.

Send the series off in style,"When something great comes to a end you can't help, but feel a certain level of sadness. The new millennium has given birth to two of the greatest franchise ( Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings) that cinema has seen since the original Star Wars.Its very rare to witness not only one film masterpiece, but two is just extraordinary. The Harry Potter films contain the best story telling, action, human connection to the audience and bring out the most emotion of the characters I have ever seen in a franchise. Its amazing to see the transition that the Harry Potter films have taken from innocence kid friendly movies, to when our generation matured, so did the films. They became more dark and more developed with intensity of story and character building. This film is fulfilling, sad and satisfying. The factor that has kept these movies looking amazing is the cinematography and effect that have stayed constant through the film through the years. The film has those two elements and more working for it which makes it the best film in the Potter franchise. This franchise has kept it's flame burning strong for 10 years and director David Yates sends this Wizard series away in the best fashion it could achieve. This movie has to be the best out of the 8 films and combined everything that someone would be looking for in a Harry Potter film and also displays everything that fans of the series have been looking for and that the amount of action.I thought that Transformers Dark of the Moon delivered the most action of the summer and I was wrong. Harry Potter gives the audience the most action that a film can contain combined with the highest level of emotion I have ever seen.Deathly Hollows Part 2 contains the most heart, pure emotion and extreme action I have ever seen in cinema since the original Star Wars. The pacing of this film does not let the audience catch their breath when witnessing this masterpiece. Their is so much to see and so much to take in that if you blink you will miss out something great. This movie delivers everything that someone from critics and fans would be looking for in a close out film. All credit in my opinion goes to the director, David Yates, for bringing this kid friendly movie up to speed with the maturity level that the books brought over the course of their time. Yates and all director of the franchise did the best job transforming the JK Rowling book series into box office hits that has been accepted warmly by fans and critic. But by far David Yates has done the best job of pulling emotions out of his cast, making them relateable to the audience and creating a certain tone for the viewer to witness and grasps the gravity that is going on in the closing journey of Harry Potter. He has done the best job of well rounding his movies that they are not only entertaining, but also makes the audience yearn for more Harry Potter films. I also give a lot of credit to the main cast members from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Ralph Fiennes. They all have done a great job of shaping the memories of the famous novel character into visual ones that have made an imprint into the viewers mind and they have done the best jobs that young to old actors can do with this sort of property. They are all equally nice to watch and bring so much passion to the film that the audience cant help, but notice dedication to the movies.It's not only the main characters that show the greatest acting and hear, but also the secondary actors bring a lot to the film and all pleasant to watching. This movie franchise is made it's mark in the world of cinema as one of the greatest series that have ever been viewed and this film wraps the franchise up in the best way possible. This is possibly the best film of the year and of the past 10 years. All good things do come to a end sooner or later and it has been a heck of a journey, and I?M)m glad I was able to experience it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

A Spectacular Rendering Of The Source Material,"The ending of J.K. Rowling's ""Deathly Hallows"" novel is a wonderful way to bring to close such an epic series of this order. In this film, director David Yates manages to translate all of those same emotions to the big screen to really re-create the magic of Rowling's pen into visual form.For a basic plot summary, ""Deathly Hallows 2"" produces the endgame of Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) plan to rule the wizarding world. While Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermoine (Emma Watson) close in on the last Horcruxes, the students and teachers of Hogwarts must defend their territory in the face of constant Death Eater assault. As the final battle for the school rages, Harry (as is his destiny, made even clearer by a pensieve trip into the memories of Severus Snape (Alan Rickman)), must face Voldemort alone to decide their fate.Like ""Deathly Hallows 1"", this movie is allowed enough time to focus on the details of the story without it feeling rushed or excising parts altogether. In Rowling's ""Potter Endgame"", pretty much every page has some sort of meaning, and this film is able to explore those events/emotions with the care they deserve.It also helps that ""DH 2"" showcases some of the best acting of the entire series. The lead trio have perfected their roles by this point, and the auxiliary cast is now so large and deep that every interaction seems like a true happening.Overall, this big-screen finale to the Harry Potter franchise is exactly what you would want in a based-on-the-novel scenario: it stays true to the source material while at the same time translating it into visual drama instead of imagined or ""thought"" drama.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A fitting finish to the Harry Potter series,"Although I am bothered by some of the changes they made from the book, this film is a fitting finish to the Harry Potter series. It packs a powerful dramatic punch and shows how far our characters have come from the original movie. I'm sad to see the series go, but it was a great ride.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Perfectly watchable, utterly forgettable","Deathly Hallows was easily my least favorite of all the Potter books, representing Rowling's annoyingly grim, rather sadistic side, and at first I wasn't planning to watch the movie at all. I didn't watch Deathly Hallows Part 1, which got middling reviews, but since the sequel got better reviews I thought, why not take a look.Like all the Potter films, the story has been reduced to a bare bones presentation that would be virtually incomprehensible to anyone who has not read the books. While I considered that a flaw in the early movies, for me it's somewhat of a strength in the later ones, because the agonizing deaths of deeply loved characters that infest the final few books are, in the films, nothing but unfortunate events set amidst the special effects. Even the best of the movies barely touched me emotionally, and in a book series that seemed bent on breaking my heart, I appreciated the movies' shallowness.But having said that, the emotional disconnect of the last film is still a bit too much. True, I wasn't sad when characters died, because the movie did nothing to make me care about them, and barely even paused at their passing, but for the same reason, I wasn't especially happy when the characters succeeded. I really didn't care what was happening at all.I saw the movie four or five days ago, and I already barely remember it. The only thing I remember is thinking that Harry breaks an awful lot of innocent eggs to make that omelet, making him a rather dodgy hero. Perhaps that is true in the book as well, but in the book I cared more about the principals than the extras. I cannot say that of this version.Good special effects though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Endgame of the previous decade.,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 isn't just a great fantasy film, but it's also a great film as it understands how to wrap up a once-in-a-lifetime franchise. The acting of the main three stars has improved so much that you really can't get enough of them. Snape probably gets the most amount of depth in this film, which makes the whole viewing experience of the franchise completely different. Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort is fantastic as Voldemort as he really goes above and beyond to kill Harry Potter and survive on his own. One of the best parts of the movie is the Courtyard Apocalypse scene as, accompanied by incredible music, it shows the trio going through Hogwarts and facing almost every possible emotion that you could think of. This movie has some of the most satisfying moments in the franchise you wish had happened sooner. Prepare to be feel all kinds of emotions hit you in this epic conclusion to the amazing franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Yazad Daruwala,"Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Assimilated to Hollywood standards,"If you like overambitious special effect based event cinema with 3D animations and a lot of epic sounds, you will surely adore this movie and think that it is a perfect ending to the series and final highlight for the whole family. Anybody that tends to look a little bit beyond commercial Hollywood cinema and prefers something more profound and intellectual might get a rather negative surprise after so many overrated positive reviews from the fan boys on this site.This movie has so many negative points that I don't know where to begin. First of all, I might chose the characters and the acting. I remember reading the last three hundred pages of the final novel was an emotional and touching thing and I wasn't able to put the book aside. I had tears in my eyes when some of the characters were struggling in their battles, losing all hope and ultimately even dying in some cases. In the movie, this all seems so secondary that it's a dishonour to the actors and a decade of more or less touching attempts to recreate the magic of the novels. Many tragic fates, last breaths and deadly conclusions are just side notes to fill a whole in between two overwhelming battle scenes with many artificially flavoured special effects. That's what I call a shame and a lack of subtlety from the production team and especially the director. Everything is concentrated on Harry Potter that there is almost no place for the other actors to shine. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger play no important role and even the main character's girlfriend Ginny Weasley has only a few insignificant passages. It seems as if this was a movie about the one and only Harry Potter and the other characters only had cameo appearances for the memories of old glory and older movies with much more equilibrium, depth and magic. The only characters that were able to shine next to Harry Potter were Neville Longbottom and Severus Snape. Even Lord Voldemort had a ridiculous and childish megalomaniac attitude while Albus Dumbledore seemed surprisingly arrogant to me.Another annoying aspect were the reoccurring cheap attempts on childish puns. Each time there was a dramatic or dark scene, any of the characters said something stupid or ridiculous. Well, many people laughed in the cinemas but it was more a hesitating chain reaction and nothing funny or appropriated to the situation. We don't need any simplistic jokes in the darkest and most gripping parts of the Harry Potter universe just to satisfy the youngest generations and avoid harsher critics from angry parents who may complain that their seven year old daughters had nightmares after watching this movie. The Harry Potter novels had evolved alongside the age of its characters and they had become more mature, dark and serious. This last movie breaks this progression down and tries to return to some light entertainment for the whole family.Many things in the movie were truly predictable and not because I had read the novel. The speech of Neville Longbottom for example was filled with so much kitsch that I rather had to laugh out and shake my head than to feel touched by it. The comments by Albus Dumbledore were predictable and as unclear and imprecise as always but this time with a quite arrogant and bored touch in it. The annoying paranoid curses of Lord Voldemort against his enemies and especially Harry Potter were repeated to much and limited the character to a rather one-dimensional, clueless and predictable personality. The characterizations of the different personalities were underlined and stretched in a stereotypical way but not lifted on a higher level as the novel did.Another important point was the lack of depth in the movie. Only the scenes around Severus Snape were great but still far away from the novel's quality. We don't get to know more about the main villain and his horcruxes. What about the background story of Albus Dumbledore? What about the details surrounding Teddy Lupin? What happened with Percy Weasley and his decisions? What about the deeper and matured romantic relationships between Harry and Ginny or Ron and Hermione? What about the new connection between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy? If you decide to cut the last novel into two movies, please do it properly at least.Don't get me wrong, the whole thing is entertaining and a funny popcorn cinema ride but it lacks of depth and something truly outstanding. The movie doesn't have this little glimpse of magic and subtle emotion that the novel had. Where Peter Jackson almost equalled the original ""Lord of the Rings"" novels, David Yates is far away from only getting near to it. The biggest surprise of the movie was that at the end of this superficial commercial entertainment, there wasn't written ""directed by James Cameron"" in the credits. This movie is comparable to his last works like ""Sanctum"" or ""Avatar"". The last ""Transformers"" and ""Narnia"" movies are also horribly close to this last Harry Potter movie. I am honestly shocked that a British novel has been transformed into a copy of Hollywood's actual standards. The movie doesn't have the British soul of the novels. I honestly preferred the earliest movies of the series. The whole thing got stretched and over-hyped too much. One should have made one single final movie about three hours, cut out the boring lack of events in the first part and the overwhelming special effects and childish jokes of the second one to fusion the whole thing into a more equilibrated and human mixture with a few additional background scenes. That would have made less money and got less popularity but would have been closer to the novel in order to honour a legendary piece of art in a significant way. The unsatisfying final result may not be the actors' or fans' fault but the studio's and director's mistake.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The magic ends,"So after ten years the Harry Potter film series is brought to a climax with this eighth film.All the tension builds to a close in this film with the fate of the wizarding world being solved in a bum-numbing two and a half hours.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint give their beloved characters one final run out and as ever play them to perfection. Radcliffe in particular does very well and holds the film together at times. Credit should also be given to Alan Rickman who gives a fantastic performance as Snape whose true colours finally get revealed in this film.Yes there are parts of the original book that were missed out and yes nothing can replicate the imagery that fans have in their heads when reading the book but by and large the director David Yates has constructed a fitting end to the saga and there can be no doubt that these films will long live on in the memory.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A very memorable finale'.,"Two years ago, i finally sat down and watched all the Potter films. I will admit, they were well put together and pretty entertaining. However, i didn't see why people hold it up like it's the greatest story of all time. So i took their advice and read all the books. Is there a difference? Not really. Sure the movies miss some minor details and leave out a few characters. But the overall essence of the story is captured very well in the movies. But still, i didn't feel this overwhelming sense of joy that everyone else seems to be experiencing. Never the less, they are pretty entertaining to watch.Even though i thought Part 1 of this was a complete bore fest, i knew what was later to come in this entry. And the movie does exactly what i expected it to do.......hit the ground running. Most of these Potter films give constant build up towards a giant climactic battle of sorts. Whereas this one constantly moves forward with it's action and never let's up.The special effects and 3D display are absolutely amazing. Everyone already knows that the 'Battle of Hogwarts' is what everyone was waiting for, and let me tell you, it looked pretty damn impressive. But here in lies my only problem with the film. The 'Battle for Hogwarts' was kind of weak.......allow me to explain.After reading the books and watching all the movies, one would expect that this would be an end all be all battle. In a way, it is.......however, they constantly direct your attention away from this, and focus more on Harry finding these horcruxes. In fact, they focus on that more than the actual battle. Yes, i understand that this IS important......but, i want to see this ultimate good vs evil fight take place, minus the constant cut to's.I would go into one more thing i didn't like, but for those of you who know nothing of the story, i wouldn't want to ruin it for you. But other than that, the film is pretty damn entertaining.Bottom Line, would i say that it's my favorite Potter film? No, but it does give an amazing sense of closure to the series. I wasn't emotional.....to tell you the truth, i don't see how i could be since the story didn't really MOVE me. But the entire theater was blubbering throughout the entire third act. So i guess it really hit home with the die-hards. Never the less, WB did an amazing job with this series. They didn't slip up like most, and they gave the audience exactly what they wanted. Job well done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Of course the final sequence at the train station is very moving since it pulls you 10 years backwards when you got into those three funny fellows.

Brilliant conclusion to the series!,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 is the final and eighth chapter of the worldwide phenomenon of the HARRY POTTER film series.With a lot of big special effects, acting, story, direction, an impressive musical score, battles and an emotional ending, this film does not disappoint at all. The film does feel very light-hearted, even though it is dark in a few areas throughout.The plot follows the last half of the book and the book was translated well for this film and credit is given to Steve Kloves. The direction is amazing and David Yates also gets a lot of credit and I thought this film should have won an Academy Award for Best Picture, but did not.The music by Alexandre Desplat is really amazing and it does have themes from the other films, composed by John Williams and Nicholas Hooper and it is a spectacular musical score. The special effects are incredible and amazing this time around and the production design is really cool.The special effects and battle sequences are just a joy to watch and no wonder that this film was released in IMAX 3D and I thought it was enjoyable to see the final fight between Voldemort and Harry. I think the main thing that was in the trailer that should have been kept in is when Voldemort chokes Harry and asks him, ""Why do you live?"" and Harry responds, ""Because I have something worth living for?"".The ending is set 19 years later and it is just sad as the ending to THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING, which was also good to. It is just fantastic and I hope the new Harry Potter films are better and amazing.Overall, this film is a great conclusion to the eight film franchise. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Very true to the book!! Excellent Finale!!,"It was a very fitting finale for a saga that has endeared us to these three kids turned young adults. We literally watched the troika grow in front of our eyes, sharing their trials and tribulations, their joys and sorrows, their success and failure in equal measure. We now see them carry out the grand responsibilities entrusted on them and bring them to its logical conclusion. They suffer great losses while achieving it but they did manage to rid the wizarding world of its greatest scourge and in turn save us muggles (he-who-must-not-be-named had threatened to rid the world of muggles) as well.Shot at great locales and powered by tour de force performances by our young thespians, aided by outstanding CGI effects the saga ends leaving an empty hollow in our chests. Whilst enjoying the cinematic journey in the theatre I was also overpowered by the sense of loss brought on by the realization that we wont be watching another one of these in the theatre again. I don't have any more to add as most of us know the books and so as a result knew what we were about to see. I had only one problem with this movie. There were some famous faces only seen in one or two scenes (Emma Thompson for instance). I wish they were given more screen time. All in all a great movie. Please go and watch it.

3D version not very exiting,"I've watched the movie in a 3D version. During the movie I noticed that quite often you see a sort of Schiller like theater setting in layers appearing on the screen. First layer is sharp, other layers are often not sharp. In photography terms we call this the depth of field. I actually haven't given 3D a lot of thought since it came available, but seeing The Deathly Hallows I realized that when you watch a 3d movie, you want a high level of dept of field. In that case most layers will be sharp giving you a good 3D experience of the movie like looking through a window. Lot's of detail become visible. As the Deathly Hallows don't often use a high DOF, I can't recommend the 3D version as an extra feature to the movie experience, often it's rather annoying to watch this version compared to the 2D movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Wizard ending,"Knowing in advance both how the story goes (and with J K Rowling on board as a co- producer, that it wasn't going to be changed much) and naturally how it ends, it was incumbent on Peter Yates to nonetheless deliver the big finish to Harry's adventures and in particular his final showdown with Voldemort. I wasn't disappointed and in the end had only minor quibbles about the resolution.The dark atmosphere from Part 1 is continued with the action mostly played out in scenes of brooding darkness and to the background of weighty soundtrack music. There is noticeably less of Hermione and Ron, which is only right given the necessary one-on-one fight with Voldemort at the conclusion. While that duel, with shades of Holmes and Moriarty, was always going to be the climax here, I enjoyed the build-up to it, with the escape from Gringotts, Snape's revelatory Pensieve memories, Harry's supernatural interviews with Rowena Ravenclaw (and Dumbledore), plus of course the blowing-up of Hogwarts all contributing to the excitement and anticipation.Rowling herself has stated that from the first, she had a clear vision of Harry and Voldemort's final reckoning with both of them circling each other in a blasted landscape and this was exactly what was delivered. I did however feel confused if not cheated as to how the Elder wand reverted to Harry, when all along Voldemort had made such a strong claim for it, but still the Evil Lord's demise was spectacularly satisfying when it came.My only other carps were the pointless inclusion of the 19-years-on epilogue, which added nothing and detracted from the high point achieved with the death of Voldemort (I know it's in the book, but it told us nothing important - as if we didn't know they were all going to live happily ever), the abbreviated round-up afforded different characters from previous episodes, especially Hagrid, the Weasley parents and Jim Broadbent's character, plus it can't be denied that the three main characters by now seem too a little old for their parts (although it's not their fault that the time needed to create such large-scale movies by- passed their characters' natural time-lines) and my old caveat that too many of the supporting parts were played by too-familiar faces from British acting royalty (it's a wonder Judi Dench didn't get a look in).But in the whole this was fantastic entertainment and a worthy finish to the saga, which I hope they don't spoil by rebooting sometime in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Satisfying conclusion,"Thus endeth one of the most popular - and profitable - series in movie history. And the good news is that it ends more with a bang than with a whimper. For once we push through the clutter of wand-waving, spell-casting and jaw-dropping CGI effects that have been the hallmark of the works, we're left with a moving, deeply human tale of an honorable man (Daniel Radcliffe) putting his life on the line for those he loves.The movie finally reaches the climax that the series has been leading to all along: the fight-to-the-death battle between Harry and his arch nemesis, Voldemort, the man who killed his parents. The one criticism one might have with this scenario is that it essentially reduces most of the other characters - including the lovable Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emily Watson) - to mere onlookers of the action.As directed by David Yates, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Harrows - Part 2"" has drama and action to spare, but it's the human element - along with an epilogue that hits all the right notes - that brings the beloved series to such a satisfying conclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"""The Return of Harry"" or... and so ended a genre-defining saga...","Well, well, well...After an epic seven-movie tour into the world of Harry Potter, here comes the final and so overwhelming conclusion of not only a decade-defining but a genre-defining franchise.Author J.K. Rowling not only revolutionized children literature through her winning streak of best-sellers but inspired what would become a landmarks of a genre relying both on spectacular special effects boosted by computer technology but traditional three-act structure (exposition with the first three films, second act starting halfway through the fourth, and the climax in the last two films) with all the compelling elements of storytelling: the fight between good and evil, the coming-of-age and the whole escapism into a world never seen before. Like Lewis Carroll, J.R.R Tolkien and George Lucas, Rowling created a whole new universe, a myth.Hogwarts, Dumbledore, Gryffindor, Aveda Kadevra... and so on and so forth, all these words have become part of an international lexicon, a staple of pop culture bound to be passed from generations to generations and to enchant children and adults all over the world. It is no surprising that the film concludes with Harry, Hermione and Ron playing grown-ups taking their children to Hogwarts through platform 3/4 like in the first film, we've all grown up watching Harry, Ron and Hermione from their baby-faced years to their maturity, and then will come a time where we'll look back at the 2011 film with equally powerful nostalgia. Oh yes, I'm sure the films will all live up to their reputation in nineteen years... and beyond.And from that emotional finale, we guess that Hogwarts have probably been rebuilt and the harrowing and deadly journey that culminated with the final fight between Voldemort and his forces of Dark magic and the resistance that combined all the cumulated knowledge of centuries of wizardry will be part of the new mythology. And I feel less like reviewing the film than concluding my seven reviews by saying that the franchise couldn't have a better conclusion. For simple reasons that don't take much analysis: first of all, it is set in Hogwarts, and while it's heartbreaking to watch so many places we're familiar with being reduced to ashes or ruins by bolts of lightning and random attacks, it's captivating to watch all the players defending the place to death.And there are deaths. Many are particularly tough to handle. And for those who have the chance to live, the story provides them chances to outdo themselves, Neville ends up having one of the most interesting arcs in the series, Mr. McGonagol and Mrs. Weasley have also their moment of awesome, and there are two reveals about Dumbledore and Snape that made me question my previous reviews and the way I instantly jumped to conclusions, underestimating Rowling's smart writing. I knew there was something enigmatic with Snape from the very start and by maintaining such a mysterious character for so long over the series, Rowling proved that she didn't have a talent for writing stories but also -as it's the case with Harry Potter- stories within stories.And this ""Deathly Hallows Part II"", as far as storytelling is concerned, is fueled with spectacular action like a fitting climax, it doesn't waste time for exposition as no introduction is needed anymore, we're already familiar with the characters and the themes. So the film plays like ""The Return of Harry"" echoing the Jedi's or the King's. And for all the action-packed scenes that are traditional offerings but never get ""routinely"", the integrity of the narrative is maintained. And the heart of the story is kept as well through reveals of relationships that were the core of the saga all along. Reading about Rowling that she lost her mother of Multiple Sclerosis before she could enjoy even the first book broke my heart but it might have shaped her inspiration when writing about the relationship between Harry and her mother, and a few other characters, or even between Harry with Voldemort.And one can't of course review this film without praising Ralph Fiennes's performance. The actor's been kept away for too long to finally implode, proving to be more than a menacing presence. He steals the show with a glare, a joke, or his hideous nose-less face... it's like the film or the book couldn't fail because it had just the perfect villain. As they say, a film is as good as its villain... but it's also as good as its ending, and while not all the chapters of the saga are equally entertaining, this last opus is a masterful conclusion and I understand now why it's the only one to be on the Top 250. It's entertaining, thrilling, suspenseful, sad, deep and comes full circle through an ending where you can't just help but shed a tear while saying goodbye to these character we've seen evolving from their childhood and even when the wizardry world was as its ""infancy"" from our perspective.How fitful that the ending scene is in a Train Station, like Hitchcock another master storyteller, Rowling loved trains and it was trains that inspired her the first vision of Harry Potter, a kid taking a train to go to a wizard school... it's only appropriate that the film would end with that note, maybe telling children that everything is possible, that they also can have their own ""train"" of inspiration and image a little something that can grow out of magical proportions. She wanted a character who could do something she couldn't: fly, she created Harry Potter and became an inspiration, a billionaire, and a name that would be mentioned in the same breath as Tolkien when fantasy literature would be approached by fans or scholars.If only I let my curiosity win over me and watch the first film, I can't believe I waited so long. Maybe I should take it as a lesson now and give a try and watch ""Fantastic Beasts"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

I was looking forward to amazing battle scenes from all the various wizards at Hogwarts. I was very underwhelmed by the action sequences. They had all been done before. I was hoping for emotion from the defense of the castle. The deaths of major characters were just glossed over in about 30 seconds. I remember reading the book and being heart broken when people died, and I didn't feel any emotion during the movie towards them.Don't bet me wrong, I enjoyed the movie. I just craved more! I almost felt like there should have been a colaboration with Michael Bay for the action sequences, to make them bigger and just more spectacular. I mean Hagrid had like 3 lines and didn't show up until like 3/4 the way through the film. I felt if they would have added another 20 min of action it would have been a spectacular film for the ages. As of right now, I see it just as OK.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Good, but lacking the gravitas required to be Great.","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part II was always going to be big and epic and pompous, all of which it delivers. It was also going to be the movie that ends the Harry Potter series, which is something it struggles with a bit more.Beginning with a brief flashback of part 1's final shot, the movie picks of exactly were the last ended. It does so though, without ever feeling forced or abrupt, rather letting the first five or ten minutes be conversations (Griphook and Ollivander respectively) before turning the heat on. After that, the movie attacks you with such ferocity you barely breathe until the ending scene.However, the action is always controlled. This could easily have been destroyed by trying to make it into a classic war movie, but though Yates dips in with plenty of battle scenes, he never goes the full Michael Bay. All in all, you end up feeling they might have shown more, letting a few key deaths happen off screen, but for the all-important PG-rating.As for following the book, from the start of it keeps the distance needed to make it film able whilst still remaining true to the material. As we near the end of the battle it differs even more, yet still letting the events happen more or less like in the novel, and though it differs most in the climactic showdown, fans of the novel will be delighted to know the epilogue is translated nearly word by word.The performances are stellar; Maggie Smith shines, as does Matthew Lewis and Radcliff does his best to carry the movie, a feat in which he mostly succeeds. For me though, the standout actors are, of course, Alan Rickman, giving his Snape a whole new dimension, but also, possibly surprising; Cieran Hinds as Aberforth Dumbledore. It isn't a big role, but he portrays it with such charisma and gravitas (especially one fantastic shot) I ended up wondering if he wouldn't have made a better Albus than Gambon. Alas, to late for that now.Despite this I have only given it a 6. Why? Because it lacks the soul and warmth it should have had. Sure there are scenes (the forest springs to mind at once) that puts pressure on your tear canals, but it isn't enough, there is not a strong enough feeling of conclusion, it just doesn't quite deliver. In the end, it never manages to top the ending from Philosophers Stone.As a conclusion, it is the same old criticism that has plagued the movie-series – the books were better. And though it is magnificently grand and spectacular, it sadly never really becomes the ""Return of the King"" it ought to have been.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Astonishing,"When I watched this film for the first time, my expectations were actually very low, since I knew what they've done to the books in film six and seven. You have to know that I'm always quite finicky about the correct transcription of literary material into films. But compared to the former Harry-Potter-Films, this one is quite close to the book on which the film was based (comparatively).All in all this last film is fairly good. It is thrilling, the effects are great, the book was not completely shredded. So even if you don't like adaptations, this one is quite viewable.I hope there are not too many mistakes in my text.

Not a huge fan, but I've watched them all and I've enjoyed most of them.If I were to the describe this movie as short as possible, I would say it's ""a Harry Potter movie"". It's almost a niche genre. You know what to expect at this point. The movie doesn't stray away from the others, and it doesn't try anything knew.

beautiful and perfect way to finish 10 years of work,"I am a huge Harry Potter book fan, and have always been a bit disappointed with each film. There has always been key aspects left out, bits that weren't put together as well as the novels, etc. But coming into this film I was hoping to not leave the theatre thinking, I wish they had done this or that, and after waiting in line for 7 hours, I left the theatre with tears in my eyes and a feeling of utter content. Through out the movie each piece that has hung in the air through out all 8 movies, was finally tied together, finally you were able to understand what everything was for and why it happened that way.The film finished with perfection, and although much did differ from the novels it was changed only for the better, and in this case (unlike in past movies) they actually succeeded in making that change, BETTER.I recommend not only seeing this movie as soon as possible, but if you are not too familiar with the Harry Potter tale, please go to a block buster or a book store and either watch or read this series, because it is truly a masterpieceGreat way to finish the series, and i'm truly saddened that it is time for goodbye.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Must see! A great ending to a spectacular series,"The end of the Harry potter series has now come, but the last film will surely make it one to remember. At least for myself I can say that I had quite the adrenaline rush to see how Harry Potter and his brave companions would destroy the remaining horcruxes and at last kill Voldemort. I must say Director David Yates really gave the much anticipated film it's character.The film started literally where it took off in part 1. Voldemort got his almighty powerful wand and it seemed that chances were slim for Harry to succeed the dark lord. If you have not read the book, I won't drop a spoiler rather tell you that the young Hogwarts students have it in them to give the dark lord a run for his money(power).What really gave me the chills was when Harry & Voldemort fought for the last time. Ten years we have been waiting to see what happens and trust me, it's worth the wait! I was in shock when I found out what happened to Harry before this, I would've never guessed.Overall, 3-D is great, action is amazing, and the ending to an amazing saga could not be better!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

For those who have not read the books, there will be surprises that you cannot foresee. For those who have read the books, the surprises will be well done.

Much improved over Part 1 and a rather satisfying way to go.,"Aaaaaaaaahh redemption. Much improved over part 1. The acting and dialogue were still a bit stiff and my comments previously on how magical combat it handled still stands but there is much more going on this time. The battle of Hogwarts was surprisingly rather well handled. Despite my issues with the combat, there were some little bits of creativity like a quick time freeze and large fiery beasts. Although basic, the terracotta army was pretty cool to see also. Many character deaths made the stakes and consequences feel more real adding some emotional depth that wasn't there for me in part 1 (other than Dobby). The action was much more competently filmed but there were quite a few moments where it felt like the extras were running or standing around not doing anything. More of a nitpick though.Overall a rather satisfying end to this cultural phenomenon of a franchise. I still think there was a lot of missed potential in terms of magical creativity but I'm glad I finally got around to seeing Harry Potter off.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"A heart touching send off to the series, but can't stand on it's own feet","Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 is the epic conclusion to the movie series, and the final piece of the Harry Potter lore. It was a great and heart touching send off, with many tears shed.The movie clocks in at 2 hours and 10 minutes, but I really wanted it to be much longer than that. For a final movie that says good bye to the characters, a lot was cut out from the book, and many deaths of important characters( not spoiling who ) were not, how do I say, good enough. You'll see.Reading the book, I almost cried because the preparation for the epic battle was awesome, and the battle itself ( in the book ) was explosive, full of action, and full of tears, laughter, and danger.In the movie however, the battles take place in the background, while the Harry and the crew go and hunt onward. This scaled the epicness back for me, and had me wanting more. The book explained much more in detail, and I hadn't read the book, I would have been lost. My friend hadn't, and all he did was ask questions after the film was over.The movie was a good time, a sad time, and a good enough send off to this series of wizards and witches. I just wish it had more substance, more to give the series an epic final goodbye, like the Lord of the Rings series did. I'll take it for what it is, and this film will be remembered for a long time.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Its Voldermort not MR bean!!,"They movie is excellent to begin with! They did justice to it as both a movie for children and adults!

His laughter had no sinister feel behind it!2) Harry and voldermort diving!! its good but seriously they should have made harry call voldermort as Tom riddle in front of everyone!!

No hugs or anything!! its Voldermort who is killed not a next door punk!!4) Lupin,Tonks and Fred deserved extra 5 minutes of attention!!5) Hogwarts seemed empty when harry walks to surrender himself to Voldermort and HErmoine n Ron let him go??Where is the invincibility cloak??6)No Grawpy and cenetaurs!! what happened??7) Lupin mentioning Harry as god father must have been there!! Also Snape communicating with Dumbeldore portrait and asking if he doesn't have any soul!!These in all would have added an extra 15 minutes!

Very very rarely do you gerecieve the opportunity to witness the total completion of something that you have loved for more than 10 years. Especially on screen.

"An ending, just not a stand alone movie","Perhaps more than any other of the series, this movie has no standing on it's own. While better viewed in order, any of the first six could be viewed and enjoyed on their own with someone unfamiliar with the books or previous movies. This movie requires having seen the seventh movie at the very least, and probably really needs all the previous movies to be enjoyed (but those that have seen those movies are the prime target).The movie contained your typical good/evil battle, with no real surprises amongst the characters. Yes, I know that.... Again, obvious.There was lots of action, lots of explaining. Just not a lot of fun. Although it would have been rather long, the final book as one movie would have been better, with the explanations woven in the longer movie, rather than needing to dominate this movie. But that simply would not be as profitable for the Potter industry.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Hallows 2 - fumbles at the goal line.,"While following the advice of professional critics I went to the 2D viewing Of Deathly Hallows part 2. Some of the recent installments had been pretty dark and the 3D glasses were supposed to make this worse.The film seemed a little unlike the previous Potter films. Most Potter films have us seeing the story through the eyes of Harry, Hermione and Ron. Hallows 2 was a little impersonal toward our Heroes. The film seemed rushed and shortcuts were taken that eliminated the dialogue we needed to really feel the leading characters pain. Harry in the film can now 'feel' the Horcruxes when near, and sees their location through Voldemort's mind. Hard to imagine Voldemort making such a mistake, but this technique allowed the filmmakers to shorten the dialogue. This was probably a result of the story being delivered in two parts. The last real character development of Harry, Hermione and Ron was in Hallows 1. Hallows 2 it seems, was meant to be an action film. Also new to the film were efforts to create humor by throwing in one-liners from time to time.I thought the film stayed fairly close to Rowling's story, until the end at least. After the Kings Cross scene, the film began to diverge greatly from the book. I wondered if this was because better 3D possibilities were attained with these changes. I watched the movie again in 3D. It wasn't darker than the 2D version and the 3D seemed to help the film. However, I'm completely puzzled why the ending was changed the way it was. After waiting for more than a decade for the final showdown, it's unfortunate we got shorted here. The original ending by Rowling was much cleaner and presented more cinematic possibilities, and simply made a better ending for the series. The CGI for the early dragon scene was very good and I'm left wondering if they just ran out time to finish the thing correctly.I've come to believe most of the professional critics are clueless about this film. It's surely the readers and serious Potter fans that contain real insight into the series. However most people I've talked to that didn't read the book were completely happy with the film and loved all the action scenes in this movie. Many book readers of the series will be disappointed.That all being said - it was a difficult story to tell. Most of the loose ends in the series were tied up. Not too much of Dumbledore's personality was revealed, and that's probably a good thing. The final fleshing out of Snape's enigmatic character were revealed. Will Rowling pick up the pen once more to give us more Harry Potter? A lot could happen in 19 years! I certainly hope so - but not enough to give this film a rating it doesn't deserve.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Not true to the book,"I think as a movie it was OK, definitely not awful. It did follow the general theme. Other reviewers have done a good job pointing out where they thought the movie was disappointing and I concur with most of those. However, the point which stands out most to me and where I really felt that Yates and his scriptwriters had not read the book properly was when Harry entered the Room of Requirement and found Ravenclaw's diadem. The book quite pointedly says that it was not one of the many glittering tiaras that Harry found. In fact, he was despairing of finding it but then he had a flashback to the fourth book where there was a mannequin with a dusty old crown on it's head. There was no reason to make it a glittering one in a box, it would not have taken more time to stick to the story with this particular scene. The movie really did feel that Yates just wanted to get it out of the way and do it as cheaply as possible ( since there would be no more prospects of making mints of money off future movies). It's a shame and I feel that if they had put Cuaron in as director and made it a 3 hour film like some of the earlier ones, they could have made one of the greatest finale movies ever which would have made them more money over the long term ( instead of having to sell it for $10 which is the price I bought it at). If the movie had been awesome, I would have been willing to pay $40+. Review written on phone so please excuse typos.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Too much destruction,"Of course one day the Harry Potter movie saga would come to an end also because the main performers are becoming older and sooner or later would not be able to act the characters of the children student wizards. With the books by J. K. Rowling it's different since they have no images. I must begin to say that I have not seen Part One therefore what I am saying here must be read having that in mind. This movie favours violent action and a lot of destruction to the detriment of the poetry of magics we have seen for instance in the H. P. AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN movie. However we must recognize that the special visual effects are unbeatable, thrilling and of excellent quality. The story is not very rich and original in terms of suspense but we can be properly entertained while watching all the adventurous scenes. One last word to the final scenes that re-establish the above mentioned poetry.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
after all this time: always!,"Perfect conclusion of a perfect saga. Every piece of the puzzle finally is in own place and now it all seems to make more sense.

The final scenes are obviously the hardest and strongest to see, not only for the battles but also for the characters: it is very moving to see them at the end of a journey that has accompanied us for almost ten years of films but which will never abandon us.

This is it and it's excellent,"I just saw the movie and I have to admit that it is an impressive film, it has it all. Unlike the more recent prequels, this time we enjoyed a good story and not just teen romance. This film has a visual quality that is worthy of 3D. It has great colors and textures, although it is known that it was not done from the beginning in this format but it is still pretty good at it. The picture is a bit dark, I hope it's only because of the 3D glasses. If you did not read the book you can see that this history is full of surprises, twists and unexpected and exciting moments. However I recommend that if children are going to see this movie they do it only in the company of their parents because of certain scenes which area a bit strong, specifically deaths. I'm sure every fan of the series who watch this movie will be pleased and those who are not will also enjoy it very much. I feel fortunate to have been part of this part of history for the cinema, no doubt this latest movie is the best of all of the eight. It is full of information, emotions, romance, drama, fights and everything that is entertaining and heartwarming we can think of. Maybe this is not the best movie of the decade buy I am sure Harry Potter's movies will be some of the ""you have to see movies"" for any movies lover.

Harry takes on Voldemort in this last movie.,"Like all the anticipated Harry Potter fans I have been waiting to watch this movie. And while doing that i read all the books again and the book 7 twice - and that was the mistake i committed! Because when I saw the movie i could not help but compare the movie with book and I have to say this - it was not what I had visualized.The problem was the name of the move: Harry Potter and 'blah blah blah... - so any thing other than Harry Potter was completely ignored from the movie. use of invisibility cloak, life of Lupin and Tonks, the whole room of requirement scene, Ron and Hermione,Earlier movies established so much about dementors being a crucial part of Voldemorts army but no there were no patronuses !However Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort was amazing and so evil ! Another one who completely stole the show was Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Short screen presence but brilliant performance... your heart almost goes out for him.The best adaption of book in the movie was King's cross scene and the worst was the duel between Voldemort and Harry Potter. They should have stuck to the book.Technically, I don't know that much but I didn't like the whole movie in black. There could have been more light, more sparks, I know it was evil and all but a bit of light would have made it easier to on the eye.I feel Rupert Grint is a better actor than Daniel Redcliff.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Pacing II,"So now we reach the end of Harry Potter and the Tortuously Extended Franchise with the final installment of Harry Potter and the Deathly Pacing. Who is at fault? Certainly not the actors young and old who give very serviceable performances despite, in most cases, being given next to nothing to do. Director David Yates can manage some serviceable pacing when he needs to. I rather think that the fault lies less with an unimaginative director than with the author and producers of whom Rowling was one. Ultimately I attribute this film's failings, as I did in Part I, to greed. Deathly Hallows, Parts I & II might make a very good 2 and a half to 3 hour movie. Instead they combine to form a deadly dull 4 hour and 36 minute snoozer. Take just 1 scene as an example. Harry, on his way to confront Voldemort, uses the Resurrection Stone, one of the Deathly Hallows that he obtained in the preceding film. The ensuing scene is utterly superfluous. It does nothing but slow the action. At a moment when we need desperately to get on to the confrontation we are stuck with a convocation that does not include all the people who have been closest to Harry and spends minutes that pass like hours in soulful looks and some babble that we and Harry all knew already. It is a waste of celluloid or disc space or whatever medium is appropriate at the moment. Even Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are given precious little to do in this film but I'm not sure that is a fault as much as I enjoy their acting. This film is, after all the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort, the moment toward which we've built over the 7 previous films. It's more than time to focus on Harry and Voldemort to the exclusion of most of the rest of the cast. Still, that's not what we get. We get much tying up of loose ends with interjected back stories that only contribute to the deathly pacing. We learn things that we should have learned in Half-Blood Prince and several other movies. Though those interjections may have been part of the 7th book they simply interfere with action of this film. We also get boxcar loads of exposition to explain plot twists for which no one ever laid the prior groundwork. The movie is a mess that completes the story but becomes a disservice to to the actors and fans. At one point late in the film Maggie Smith's Prof. McGonagall casts a weary, quizzical look in medium close up that seems more to say, ""What am I doing here if not for the paycheck and how fast can I get back to the set of Downton Abbey where I actually can display my talent and craft."" I feel for her. I do blame the directors to some extent but the producers and J. K. Rowling even more. From the start of the series the money people made great casting decisions and then put their wonderful actors in the hands of hacks like Chris Columbus and David Yates while giving fine directors like Alfonso Cuaron the boot after a single episode. Perhaps, one day once J. K. Rowling passes on to some other worldly Enchanted Forest, someone really competent who loves the stories will hire an elderly Daniel Radcliffe to play Albus Dumbledore in a really good remake of the series. I surely hope Harry Potter gets better treatment one day. He deserves it though he didn't get it here.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Best Film of the Series and Best Film of 2011 thus far.,"I've been an avid fan of the Harry Potter series since I started reading the books on my own in 3rd grade. I've followed the books and movies for a good part of my childhood. The Deathly Hallows Part 2 was and everything and more I hoped it would be. I cried when I read the final book, but I wept when I saw this film. If I could go back and count it'd have to be at least seven times I felt my heart break, and then I realized that my childhood was coming to a close during the epilogue. It's been awhile since a movie has emotionally effected me that much. The performances in this film are so powerful and thrilling (namely Daniel Radcliffe and Alan Rickman), the detail of the film's location, costumes, art direction, music, and mostly cinematography blow all of other films out of the water. The most visually beautiful film of the series. I may sound biased because I'm such a huge fan of the series from such a young age, but even if I hadn't read any of the books I'd still think it's a piece of monumental cinema.There's so much about this film that amazed me, but mostly it was the translation from text to screen. Gringotts, The Battle of Hogwarts, Snape's back story, and the final battle between Harry and Voldemort. I had my own little picture of how that played out, but it's so grand to see on film and ever so gripping.I honestly think that this final chapter in the Harry Potter series is worthy of some Oscar nods. I'm really hoping it'll at least get some nods for Best Supporting Actor (Alan Rickman), Best Art Directon, Best Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, maybe even Best Picture... who knows! With the Academy nominating 10 films a year for Best Picture it's highly possible! But, overall this is definitely the best film of the series, emotionally wrenching and heartbreaking but an absolute spectacle of a film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The Boy Who Lived... Returns To Cast One Last Spell in Messy Potter Flick,"It seems like only yesterday that the first Harry Potter flick, ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" was having it's first TV spot on Nickelodeon after an episode of ""Spongebob Squarepants"". But like many kids of my generation perhaps we don't actually remember that happening but I wouldn't be surprised if it did.After almost a decade of ""He Who Shall Not Be Named"", Dementors, new characters and different directors, it seems that everybody's favorite wizard will finally cast his final spell for the last time as the Harry Potter phenomenon comes to a close. In ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 2"", Harry, Ron and Hermoine are on their final search to find the last remaining Horcruxes created by none other than Voldermort, in order to stop him from continuing destruction in the Wizarding World.After breaking into Gringott's Bank in the beginning of the flick, Harry, Ron and Hermoine set out to return to Hogwarts to battle it out and retain a Horcrux that apparently is hidden within the school. The trio return to the school, finding out now that Snape is the Headmaster of Hogwarts who after finding out Harry has returned, sets out to warn Voldermort. Soon, the battle between Voldermort's followers known as Death Eaters and the students & staff at Hogwarts begins. What starts out promising, is too fast paced for it's own good.The film partially moves from one scene to another, practically going from Harry to searching for a Horcrux, to Voldermort, to a battle scene, to Harry again. What was suppose to be the Battle of Hogwarts turned out to be nothing but a disappointment. The battle moves on too quickly and just skips straight to the next scene and so forth. You hardly see any teacher or any student battle it out with a Death Eater. Mostly, their seen running away. Because of it's too fast pacing, the film hardly gets any deserving moments that it rightfully deserves.The film is mostly covered up with humor which to me, is the second film in the Potter series to do so other than ""Order of the Pheonix"". The humor isn't bad, but it seems that the only purpose of this film was to take it into a much lesser dramatic approach than the previous installments and make it more funny.Potter fans won't seem too disappointed in their favorite hero since the film practically ends on a good high note, but what seemed on like a thrilling adventure during it's TV advertisements, ""Deathly Hallows-Part 2"" moves on too fast and hardly matches the sense of deathly adventure that ""Deathly Hallows-Part 1"" had. It's pacing is quick, it's timing is limited and the story is told too rapidly. I won't lie and say I didn't enjoy the movie but I felt it skipped all the important elements of the book and just went straight to a high end screeching road. I am astonished that this is the best reviewed Potter film in the series and all I can say is; how can it not?""Deathly Hallows-Part 2"" is the shortest flick in the series and also the poorest by director David Yates who did a wonderful job with ""Deathly Hallows-Part 1"", the only film I think Yates did any justice to. though some great things that happen in the film are the break in at Gringott's Bank, the search for the Horcrux, Nevil Longbottom's sudden heroism (he practically shines in this movie) and Harry's suspenseful near de... well I won't spoil that. The film will leave you to tears so I suggest you take a box of tissues because it seems that Harry's journey has finally come to a close... rather too quickly.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Not as deep as it thinks it is,"This is one of those films that is simply to hard to critique due to the millions of fans going into the film with unconditional love. I however did not have that problem despite greatly enjoying the books. This film suffers from a certain shallowness that plagues the whole movie. The themes which come into fruition are poorly developed and appeal to our tendency towards intellectual simplicity. Everything in the film is black and white. There are no middle grounds. Your either with Harry, or against him. This presents a template which just seems artificial and lacking depth.Due to the fact this is the last of the series, the simplistic mentality of good and evil is much more apparent with the conclusion of multiple plots. The characters are all extremely dull as a result. They are either saints or sadists. With regards to the romances, I will not spoil anything, however it is my opinion what does occur was extremely forced.In the end, this film suffers from Return of the King syndrome. It is self aware as a film of its conclusion to the series and thus attempts to drag its feet. The film only runs for a little over 2 hours, however it felt like a 3 hour long film at least. I say wait to rent it, skip the crowds with annoying children, and view it without your rose colored potter glasses.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Satisfying Finale to the Series,"10 years after it began, the Harry Potter franchise has achieved something unheard of in film. Never before have we seen a film series that has not only kept up the overall quality through this many installments, but it actually got better as it went. There was never a bad Harry Potter film, and we can expect that there never will be. Whether ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" is really the pinnacle of film making for the series is debatable, but what isn't debatable is that it resolves this elaborately crafted story in fitting fashion, one that will surely please anyone who made it this far.It is hard to rate this final installment by itself. Since it is really the second half of a movie that was split up because of time constraints, it's really more appropriate to combine both parts of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" into one when judging it on quality. I enjoyed Part 1 a lot, feeling that although it lacked some of the excitement and wonder of the best of the series, the increasingly dark atmosphere and fantastic performances made it a worthwhile film. While Part 1 did feature far more character development, it paid off in setting up all the action and heroics that are seen in Part 2. Together, they make a marvelous picture, even if they do need each other to achieve proper balance.Part 2 does feature the same solid direction and scoring we've come to expect from the Harry Potter films, and since 7 films of character building has led to this, the film makers don't have to worry about us caring about the outcome. The length is just right, not feeling rushed or letting things cool down too much. Most of the secondary characters get their moment in the sun, properly closing arcs in dramatic (if sometimes predictable) fashion. What really sets this film apart is the truly excellent backstory segment seen 2/3 through. Beautifully filmed and edited, it ties the entire saga together to give even more depth and meaning to everything that has come before. Alan Rickman shows once again what a brilliant casting choice he was back in 2001, as he in my opinion has been the backbone of the series, commanding our attention in every scene he has ever been in.In the previous 7 films, we as an audience never really got to see the epic scope that the story promised. We caught a glimpse at the end of ""Order of the Phoenix"", but Part 2 definitely brings the heat. A convincing courtyard battle sets the stage in grand fashion. There is finally some proper consequences to all the threatening the villains do, which is much appreciated. It makes the series as a whole far more compelling when there are sacrifices on both sides and not every character is made to be simply black or white on the morality scale. Indeed, some of the most interesting material in this film has to do with a character who isn't even alive to see it.Is ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"" the best Harry Potter film ever? It is easily one of the most exciting, engaging films of the series, and the scope is unmatched. The effort put forth to send the series off in admirable fashion is clear. It's hard to imagine anyone having a negative reaction to it, something that no previous installment can claim. I would still put my money on ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" as the overall strongest Harry Potter film for a few reasons, but this definitely not far behind. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" is a terrific ending to the series. Overall score: 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
It All Ends -- And Not a Horcrux Too Soon,"So the whole damn ""Harry Potter"" thing finally ends, only to leave me wondering: if Professor McGonagall could shoot fire out of her wand and muster up a whole army of suited knights all along, why didn't she do it a whole hell of a lot sooner?And there lies my problem with the entire movie series. If you didn't read the books, which I didn't, you don't understand the story's logic half the time. Apparently it's all well explained by J.K. Rowling, but if so, the filmmakers did a bad job of transferring her explanations to the screen.All of the movies suffer from laziness, and ""Deathly Hallows Part 2,"" while much better, almost by default, than ""Deathly Hallows Part 1,"" is no exception. It assumes that the series' die-hard fans will fill in the blanks the filmmakers are too bored to fill in for us, so key moments, like the standoff between McGonagall and Snape, or the one between Molly Weasley and Bellatrix LeStrange, just sit there on the screen instead of causing us to leap to our feet in excitement.Let's just say I'm looking forward to reading the books with my sons when they're old enough. Maybe then the whole story will make more sense.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Least involving of the series.,"'HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HOLLOWS: PART 2: Four Stars (Out of Five)The eighth and final chapter of the immensely popular 'HARRY POTTER' film series.  This one is based on the second half of the seventh (and final) book of writer J.K. Rowling's classic series.  The script was once again written by Steve Kloves who has written every film in the series except for 'HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX' (which is arguably the worst one, possibly as a result).  David Yates returned to direct the film (he also directed the last three installments) and of course Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson all reprise their beloved roles.  The film is sure to please die-hard fanatics of the series but will definitely not win over any new fans as well.The film begins exactly where the last chapter left off with Harry (Radcliffe), Hermione (Watson) and Ron (Grint) burying their fallen friend Dobby.  They then set out to find the next of the three remaining Horcruxes (the items of magic which give Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) his immortality).  At the same time Voldermort finds the 'Elder Wand' and learns of their plans.  The entire magical kingdom is soon set for the biggest war their world has ever seen and Harry, Hermoine and Ron are once again caught up right in the middle of it.I've never been a big fan of the 'HARRY POTTER' series, I've never found it incredibly interesting or involving, but I have always admired the craftsmanship of most of the films. The film producers have always been able to find high quality directors and crew for most of the installments (minus maybe the first couple). The acting has always been rather decent and for the most part (except for maybe really early on) the movies have seemed to live up to fans of the book's high expectations. You definitely have to give the films credit for that. What they have failed to do is involve or interest most other movie goers who are not familiar with the source material (like myself). The greatest book to film adaptations should be able to do that as well. With that said I have found most of the movies at least slightly entertaining and again being a fan of film I can definitely admire the skill that went into making them. I did find this last chapter the least interesting or involving of the series though (that's not to say it's the worst film of the bunch). Despite all the action I had no real emotional involvement with any of the characters or what was going on with them. I think this is due to the fact that, not being a fanatic of the series, I haven't seen each film more than once and have not kept up with the mythology for the most part. So not knowing what was really going on a lot of the time did make it hard to follow and keep interest in. All of the other chapters have been able to pull off a certain amount of stand alone storytelling as well as keep up the continuing saga whereas this one spent most of it's time tying all the other films together and wrapping things up. So for that reason I found it the least involving of the series. Still there are a lot of spectacular visuals going on and big fans of the series will eat it up. Everyone else might be a little bored.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN5KZOE7p28",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Worth watching but something is missing.,"I have been fortunate to have seen this movie on the 13th (July) and I have here posted a review on my opinion about the movie. The response from real film critics and most other people has been totally positive, but in my opinion it was not THAT good.________________At first I would like to mention that the books of this current series are my favourite and will be that forever. I have also adored the movies, as the very first movie (Philosopher's Stone) had introduced me to this amazing world.I was eager to see the last movie; and now that I have just returned I would like to tell you about it.I will be totally honest...There are many things which would be confusing to understand unless you have read the book... somethings just pop-up and nothings 100%clear. (This didn't bother me too much cause I have read the books, but some people might find this a bad factor to the movie.)Then, on the other side, the acting which was there was amazing. Ralph Fiennes has had quite a bit of screen time and has done fantastically. Alan Rickman has continued his job throughout the eight films, by being the absolutely perfect Snape. Other original cast members including the three... have been great.Though, after the movie is finished and somewhat throughout, I felt that something was missing, perhaps something important, something which didn't leave this ""awesome"" movie effect...___________________Though, now as I am writing this review, I am thinking back on the last five minutes of the movie (epilouge) --- and also the books, and I as a fan feel really sad its over...",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Good but Disappointing,"This movie is a lot like that Genius student we all knew in College, who could have had a 4.0 but did not study and instead got a 3.0. The fact that this movie is good is more a testament to how great the story is. If you read the book you know some of the most important parts were either; excluded, rushed or just done badly. But in the end the overall story is so amazing that even a stripped down version is satisfying. Still the most disappointing part is that by splitting the book into 2 movies they had enough time to cover everything decently well. Instead they wasted time on irrelevant added scenes instead of showing the main fight/ending the way it should have been. In the end Harry and Voldemort circle each other as EVERYONE watched and Harry explained to Voldemort just how badly he had beaten him. In the end he even gave him a chance to feel remorse which he did not, Voldemort Loss is the ultimate Lost and Harry victory is the ultimate victory. But in the movie this is reduced to 3d effects. On top of that after the fight was over you could not tell if they had won or lost. There was no celebration, Hagrid patted Harry in the back like he had just won the spelling bee. I mean even if you did not read the book this is disappointing at that moment Harry just beat the most dangerous wizard of all time! he just ended the war! where is the celebration? There is more i could go into like how they rushed the pensive scene with the memories of Snape, but is useless because in the end people who just watch the movies are satisfied. But people who read the books know that it should have been amazing and instead it was just good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
J. K. Rowling is a masterful storyteller.  The makers of this movie are not.,"The movie only passingly reflected the second half of the book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Corners were cut and a masterpiece of a book was turned into a misshapen and expensive failure. Oh, it may be a financial success, but because of what remains of the magic and greatness of the book.In the book it was lies, hate, and abuse that separated one side from the other. Harry Potter's side was one of inclusion, of giving people choice and showing mercy. In the movie, both sides are vicious and stupid. The beautiful details and realism found in the fantasy of the book was cheapened and abbreviated in the movie. Where as the earliest movies also abbreviated from the book, as essentially all movies will, it was done in such a way that the true magic grown in the reading of the books could still be found in the movies.I came into this movie with high hopes. I saw the high rating and I knew the last book really picked up in the second half. The makers of the movie had more time with which to delve into the details since they'd split the single book into two movies. Yet scene after scene in which I wanted to see and hear the mystery and beauty I imagined while reading the book, each scene was ultimately unsatisfying, unfaithful, and mediocre.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I think the disappointment will come,"The previously-unknown David Yates has slowly been able to find his own voice with the latest 4 of the 8 instalments, by combining the sense of magic the first 2 films had, the darker tone introduced to us by Afonso Cuaron (with the third episode) but also that more grown-up approach to the story, which has been brewing and growing with each chapter (and book of course), but he also had the courage to actually hack to pieces the overly-written source and actually make a better film (clearly after book 3, no editor would dare to tell JK Rowling to cut anything out). In this last ""Deathly Hallow"", he was able to basically stretch the final battle over the course of the whole film, making it seem greater and more epic than it's ever been in the book (In the end, box office aside, it really did pay off to split the movie in two parts).Considering the incredible amount of expectations which a film like this can carry and, consequently, the almost impossible task of bringing everything to a close, HP 7.2 does a really good job! Yes, of course there will be some disappointed people, but I think the disappointment will come from the fact that secretly each of us would like this story to go on forever and, no matter what, you can never please everyone. Considering what a massive commercial machine Warner Bros is we must be so thankful for the way the franchise has been handled. Producer David Heyman is obviously a man of heart, who cares for his fans and set out to make the best films he could ever make, playing on the strengths of its (let's be honest) not-so-perfect source and in the end making it an even better product. In the end this film must be judged with that same heart and not so much with the brain, taking in consideration the series as well as this ending.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 Review,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a film directed by David Yates. This film just firmed up my belief that however good or bad the start is the ending of any story should be shockingly awesome.Plot: Harry Potter and his friends decide to stop Voldemort and the Death Eaters once and for all.Story and direction: This film is much shorter in comparison to the other parts (130 minutes). And this is actually justified because all of the setting up was done in the past 7 movies. Here we jump straight into the action. I would like to commend on the action sequences. They felt every real and each and every time I felt scared for the characters in that particular scene. The film is fast paced and not much time is wasted. The set design and cinematography is just awesome. I can just go on about the wonderful score by Alexandre Desplat. Also, the VFX is just the best of the entire series. I was just gobsmacked by the improvement the series hads shown in the VFX department. The level of maturity these characters have is very well defined in certain scenes. There are certain scenes in the film that make sense in this final part that are explained very well without deviating from the tension in the film. And I have to commend the makers on splitting up the novel into 2 parts. This was needed as many storylines and plot arcs have to be wrapped up. This film just brings the storyline to an end so beautifully that I couldn't fault the film for one moment.Performances: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as usual are great. Maggie Smith has some scenes in which she was great. Ralph Fiennes was in his best form as Voldemort. The same can be said for Helena Bonham Carter and Micheal Gambon. It was also good to have certain actors back for this one epic battle.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Snape orders the students to give up anything they know about Harry Potter's whereabouts. Then Harry steps up and challenges Snape and Minerva comes to the rescue. This scene was just amazing on another level as I saw a battle that I may have been waiting for since the last instalment.Verdict: This film is just great on so many levels. I honestly can say that in each and every scene I had goosebumps. This film series ends on a great note and delivers a very satisfying finale. This film series should be a lesson to some people on how greatness, novelty and creativity when mixed together provide an art that just cannot be forgotten and is just relished by the person watching it.

"Tonally Flat and Sorely Overstuffed, Harry's Last Hurrah is an Inflated Indulgence","The second half of Harry's grand finale is better than the first, but still struggles to cope with too many characters, too little color and an overstuffed dance card. There's just so much going on, and it's all so excessively dim...Over-reliance upon book lore has been a long-term problem for this franchise, and that issue has only grown more pronounced as the film adaptations enter their final stretch. I have no idea how anyone could make sense of Deathly Hallows 2 without keeping a store of such information, fresh and reliable, somewhere in their noggin. Maybe a Cliff's Notes handbook and a hair-trigger pause button would suffice. Casually tossing about complicated concepts like wand allegiance, multiplying spells, hallows and horcruxes, the film skims along at a high speed, in breathless pursuit of flashier material. Of that, fortunately, there's plenty, and those bits are loaded with well-constructed callbacks to the previous films. The action scenes are constant highlights, excellent in concept and in execution; a fitting farewell, in their own way, for the series at large.Quieter character moments are more of a mixed bag. Snape gets his big spotlight scene, after being completely ignored in the previous chapter, but most of the younger cast members are swept up in the desperate search for a soul mate. Everybody just wants to pair off, to hit that convenient epilogue with a litter of kids tugging at their shoestrings. Despite simmering for years and years, in many cases, such romances play more like a series of checked boxes than natural, heartfelt outpourings of emotion. Ron and Hermione are a prime example. The moment of their long-germinating embrace was evidently a difficult scene for the actors, who literally grew up together on-set, and their discomfort is clear on the screen. The kiss feels like an awkward, instantly-regretted smooch between friends, not a grand culmination, and that robs power from these beloved characters' storybook ending. They probably should've got that out of the way several movies earlier anyway. Here, in the midst of a hectic chase and a frenzied battle, even an effective payoff would've been lost in the mix.Which is another recurring issue that this film never really settles. There's enough material for three movies in here (or a seven-hundred page book, as it were) and in trying to please everyone, to fit it all in, the whole package fades into a fleeting, dizzying wash. Nothing gets a chance to breathe, lest a different scene meet the cutting room floor. Crucial time is cut from meaningful points in the main narrative, dampening their impact, to cram in a few smaller, crowd-pleasing tidbits. But those, too, are over and done with so quickly that they hardly seem worth the effort.In the end, we get (nearly) everything, without necessitating another weird mid-stream cutaway, but nothing is half as rewarding as I'd expected. A stumble over the finish line, in other words; a film that hits the novel's plot points but completely misses its spirit. Could've been worse, I guess, but it also could've been so much better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

What's next?,"After the movie had played for the last time in a cinema, you could hear the cinema owners moan. The Harry Potter movies were a cash cow.

Now it's over and everyone is thinking: What's next?While that may sound like something that may not be of interest to you, think of that: When you watch Daniel Radcliffe, do you immediately think of Harry Potter? What about the other young actors in this? It might be difficult for them to find themselves. While they all tried other things, even during the ""Potter years"", they became the faces of this movie franchise.Getting back to the movie. The special effects are up to date (something you should expect), the story concludes nicely (for someone who hasn't read the books, including myself). The acting is solid throughout. There is one scene though, that was really bad. And it involves Daniel R. and a train station. Unfortunately he can't convey the emotions he is going through in this pivotal scene.

If you've done the same, you may tend to rate the movie even lower than I did. It deserved an 8 for no other reason than it was exciting and provided fairly good acting. It differed so from the book, it was sad. The movie seemed to be in a rush to conclude the series and provided little in the background stories required to make it unforgettable. For moviegoers that did not know the story, I would expect some confusion. For those of us that read the book, I would expect plain disappointment. Unlike the conclusion to Lord of the Rings, this will not be an Oscar contender. I'm surprised that the stories author hasn't complained; my God they had two movie to do the ending properly and they missed entirely. As I read my review, I'm reconsidering the 8.

Great Saga Ends,"Harry Potter was amazing history in our lives and with this chapter it is ending.I'm so glad that they split that last book into two movies.

It really affected me in a way I've never been affected like in a movie before. I might as well admit it hear and now, this movie hammered on my emotional cords and I got chocked up and on the verge of tears, I was barely able to hold them back, but it didn't sound like the audience was able to, the person next to me was bawling her eyes out. The reason this movie affected me differently was because not only did a just get chocked up, but I was on the verge of breaking down through about 85% of the freaking' movie, which is ridiculous!

Ron is a idiot who just states the really obvious 6. Hermione becomes dumber after just one kiss from Ron. 7. Neville suddenly become a hero that always carry his sword around. 8.

When the death eaters storm into Hogwarts with Harry and giants roll off the cliff--OMG those dumb giants were farming and then they're too fat and roll off, HAHA.

"Harry Potter is not just one of literature's greatest achievements, but also one of cinema's finest moments!","Harry Potter became something of a surprise sensation in the late 90s; media-titans were after the media rights since it garnered a massive following, Nintendo tried turning the series into a gaming franchise that would go alongside the likes of Zelda and Castlevania; then David Heyman, who was working for Warner Brothers at the time, found 'The Philosopher's Stone' on the 'low-priority' shelf of the WB-UK's development catalogue. Then in 2001, Harry Potter hit the big screen and became one of cinema's most potent franchises then onward. Seven films later comes 'The Deathly Hallows: Part 2' and makes itself out to be the finest conclusion to a film series since Lord of the Rings, Return of the Jedi, and Toy Story 3. Harry Potter has become one of cinema's greatest accomplishments in the medium's entire canon.I grew up watching the series in cinemas every time a new film came out; I loved every second of every film and this conclusion is not just great Potter-fan satisfaction; it's a great film and a resounding conclusion to one of the defining stories that helped mould my childhood and teenhood. It's literal and visual cinematic magic. Harry Potter has remained a classic for damn good reasons, because it's a contemporary fantasy that co-exists within our reality without needing to worry about real-world baggage at all yet the world of wizards is still plentiful on drama, lovable characters and one of the most gorgeous cinematic universes ever constructed on film.Harry Potter is truly one of my favourite film franchises and it's a story as timeless as Star Wars, as eternal as a good old fashioned fairy tale, and a saga showing the challenges of growing up.If you somehow STILL haven't seen the Harry Potter movies yet, I implore those of you who haven't to do so. It's a universally appealing saga that is a timeless story; so join the ride millions of others have been riding on for years now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"3 words: Awful,Awful and Awful!","I don't think it matters whether you are a fan of the books or not to be able to come to the conclusion that this is the worst Harry Potter film of all and one of the most over-rated films ever! I have not read all of the books which means that I have a fairly unbiased view when watching the films-I'm not expecting the film to follow the books exactly.This film was awful for several reasons: 1)Lack of dialogue- what's the point in paying the actors millions of pounds for them to say virtually nothing throughout...apart from Harry and frankly I would rather he remained quite throughout because his voice and wimpy demeanour irritate me! 2)Poor action scenes- for example an exchange between Harry and Voldermort- was pathetic. It wasn't an intense duel; it was poorly acted.3)Wooden acting- for example the romance between Ron and Hermione- you could tell how uncomfortable they felt together! And the ending is incredibly poor- it was too abrupt and didn't connect smoothly to the rest of the film- a rush job I think.I can't believe this film is expected to gross the most money of all the films. And I can't believe I actually PAID to see it...I would have to be paid to see it again that's for sure!

I like Harry Potter films but not Harry potter,"This is an overall rating based on binge watching the six during lockdown, admittedly when it came out first I fell asleep in the cinema to the philosophers stone but my tastes changed so thought I'd try again, thoroughly enjoyed one and two and three was my favourite, 4,7 I thought were really average with 5 6 and 8 being a mixed bag in between, but overall I feel it's a good series but massively overrated film and culture wise.The bad was worse than the good was great so going beyond 6 overall is tough, I felt after 3 it became a bit to real world based for me, a lot of the charm kind of died and it felt more teen film than classic, I'm amazed it's as popular as it is because let's face it as they grew up the main three must've made the writers so gutted as Emma Watson was the best at an average level but grint and Radcliffe are terrible actors as proven by their poor careers since, Radcliffe especially took emotions out of scenes was an ungrateful entitled selfish child, didn't appreciate his help and was just a charisma vacuum, the last two especially in big moments his mannerisms and delivery were pathetic. The extras and elder actors kept the quality decent though.I genuinely didn't like potter as a person found him thoroughly up likeable and just got little enjoyment from him, the story on the whole is good, bit long, the ending was fun, would be interesting to see if the kids is something they revisit but even there the three had no presence and delivered a flat ending. How this is such an iconic series blows my mind as not one film for me would even be in top 50 of all time.

Good enough.,"Though the story is forcing the movie to further diverge from its essence and it tends to go really cheap on most of the sub-plots (I don't see how 10 more minutes on the supporting cast would have ruined the sales) I must honestly admit, that this is a fairly good solution to solve the impossibility of wrapping this monster up. Most of the decisions are justifiable if considering length, box office sales, rating and all the usual s/*t and when it comes to epicness, The Deadly Harlows 2 will not let you down. I don't think, that there ever was a realistic possibility of this movie being any better then what it has become in the end while there was a huge chance of producers ruining it.But I think, the question never was, whether it's going to be good or not, as the work has already been done along the last decade. The question was: is it going to be GOOD ENOUGH. It is good enough.With this, the Harry Potter saga is found its way into eternity and is now officially a legend, comparable, but in many ways surpassing Star Wars.

An excellent ending to one of the greatest film series in history!,"The legend ends. The excitement's largely thrilling. A motion picture of a generation... Part 2 is unlike any other final chapter or Harry Potter film ever made. It made a good finale by making it epic and larger. It's far better than part 1 and the action sequences are praisingly exciting.'Avengers Assemble' didn't need to beat it as the box office record that was the 3rd highest grossing film of all time but took this down a level lower because it shouldn't ridiculously be as successful as this. Although the 3D was an unpleasant experience David Yates(director) has the soul of an epic conclusion. An aspect of characters and relationships that return for the last time. Full of untold flashbacks and spellbinding visual effects, this film has to end with a big bang, laughter, excitement and sadness. Goodbye Harry Potter.

Harry Potter 7b,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011) was directed by David Yates. This film is wildly popular and is now ranked with the IMDb top 100 movies of all time. I can see why it's a box office hit. If you've read all the books, and seen the first seven movies, it's unthinkable not to see number eight. However, it's not clear to me why so many thousands of IMDb viewers rated the film as high as they did.The three main characters are there and--gasp--they've grown up. Emma Watson looks great in jeans, and Daniel Radcliffe needs to shave. Many of the ""dead"" characters get to come back in dream sequences, so the excellent cast is complete.Ralph Fiennes is one of the world's great villains. Any movie that includes Helena Bonham Carter and Maggie Smith as supporting actors has to have something good going for it.Director Yates has faithfully followed J.K. Rowling's plot--no one really wants a different story or a different ending. In fact, Yates has improved upon the book by paring down Rowling's ill-conceived epilogue.If you want excitement, the movie is full of it. However, as a local Rochester reviewer pointed out, most of the action consists of people pointing wands at each other and firing away.If, unlikely as that may be, you haven't seen all the other films, I wouldn't bother with this one. If you're someone who has, indeed, seen all of the other films, then you must see this one. You won't be disappointed, but you won't be enlightened or surprised either.The Harry Potter series was successful, it was fun, and now it's over.

I'm just not sure that Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is one of the best 100 movies ever made.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Oh, the childhood","10 years after it began, the Harry Potter films concluded with a two- part finale. I grew up with Harry Potter: there are pictures on my wall of me as him for Halloween, I remember going to several Harry Potter- themed birthday parties, and I have specific memories of reading the first and last books. So I was prepared for an emotional conclusion. Hell, if Lord of the Rings (something I liked but was never been invested in) could move me, surely this backbone of growing up could.Not quite. Part II gets a lot right, but I feel like many things didn't live up to their potential, and the film didn't take itself seriously enough.The good: there is a well-done conclusion for one of the best literary series of all time. The key points are there. Visually, everything is stunning as it has always been. And the performances, something I never paid attention to, are excellent. Harry, Hermoine, Ron... all admirable, but the standouts are Ralph Fiennes, maybe the greatest villain actor of all time, as Voldemort at his strongest and most terrifying. And Alan Rickman as Snape, arguably the best character from the whole series, tragedy and true loyalty personified.Major points for including a throwback scene to my favourite of the films, The Chamber of Secrets. I remember seeing that one and being scared silly.But then the issues... first of all, the film is short. There was time to expand aspects of the film. Which leads to the next problem, which is that the support cast doesn't get very much screen time. Hagrid offers two lines. The aforementioned Snape, in his most important book/film, sees three scenes. But the cuts don't end there: the final battle doesn't feel as satisfying as it does. The Weasleys have two emotional scenes during it, and both are glazed over. Neville's time to shine also doesn't feel proper.And then there's the ironically distracting movie magic. The hero climbing up from the destroyed bridge. How many times can Harry and Voldemorts wands' stop their beams right in the middle in an epic duel? By the end the effect is predictable.Also the film adds humour where humour definentley should not be. I remember that starting with Goblet of Fire the change to tone to being much darker, and in fact I didn't quite like the change. But now I'm more mature, and feel that this one tried to lighten up the tone, but unsuccessfully. McGonnagel has some real bad lines in particular.So Harry Potter is done, but I felt it went out with more of a flipendo than a rictusempra. The epilogue is nice and touching, but failed to have 'oomph' like Lord of the Rings. A legendary series with a satisfactory send-off. 7.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Emotionally satisfying and visually breath-taking, heart-breaking yet beautiful","Deathly Hallows Part-2 has achieved something which no other Fantasy film has achieved, its definitely a fantasy but a very realistic fantasy.Every single ounce of agony and pain is real. From the start till the end its a roller-coaster ride, with no pregnant pauses in between. one of the many plus points of the film is that the battle never over shadows the main tale, and David Yates shows his expertise by dealing with two three story tracks going on at the same time as the main battle progresses in the background. As earth-shattering discoveries are made, the past is questioned and true loyalties are revealed,love still manages to blossom even in times of such darkness, thus giving out a strong message that LOVE indeed is universal.Deathly Hallows Part-2 has a strong script,beautiful but heart-breaking background score, top-notch performances from the veterans and the younger cast,tight editing and absolutely brilliant direction and mesmerizing cinematography ( actually devastating-oh to watch Hogwarts destroyed is heart wrenching ). As said earlier there is not much space for talking and pondering over things in the last Potter film (except for the beginning), there is only an urgency to take action and not just sit and watch your friends and family die and thus 'all hell breaks loose'.Hallows part-2 borrows heavily from its predecessor Hallows part-1 (which was necessary) for its one complete epic tale. the screenplay writer wastes no time in establishing the references from the past,he treats you as the all-knowing audience yet allows you to derive your own conclusions on several things including the poignant ending. one cant complain because even if after 10years of watching Harry potter films, you have still not got the tale right then you are at fault not the cast and crew.the beauty of Deathly Hallows Part-2 is the balance between the lighter and the heavier ,more emotionally demanding moments , the scale of the film which never becomes too opulent, the moving performances from the stars and the technicalities and nuances of film-making not to forget the spell-binding special effects.1O years from now Deathly hallows part-2 will become sort of a Cinematic legend, something which will be equated with Titanic and Star-Wars saga.this is one of those films which you can watch again and again and never get bored of, the more you watch it the more you fall in love with the film. IT is definitely the best in the series and so far the best in the Genre of fantasy because it not only has dazzling effects and visual magic but also because it has a big heart which would help any-one and everyone connect with it easily and effortlessly. it sums up the tale beautifully, there could not have been a better ending to the EPIC SAGA. i will give it 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Amazing finale to a great franchise,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" was yet again directed by David Yates and is the second part of the seventh instalment of the franchise. In order to finally defeat Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter and his friends have to find and destroy the remaining four Horcruxes. Little do they know that the Dark Lord is in possession of the strongest wand to ever be created - the Elder Wand.This is it, the big finale everybody has been waiting for for nearly ten years and it delivers. All the previous movies have set this up to be the big showdown the series deserved. The only thing that feels lacklustre is its pasting. At times this film can feel a little rushed, as there is still a lot to cover (the destruction of four Horcruxes) over the rather short runtime (at least for a Harry Potter movie) of merely two hours. This is just a minor issue I have and is probably a result of some other movies not contributing as much to the set up of the finale as they could have. Nevertheless this is still a brilliant ending to the franchise and overall an amazing movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"My favorite in this movie franchise, probably the best movie of summer 2011","I was never really a fan of Harry Potter and especially the movies. But I gotta admit this final installment was just awesome. It wasn't as epic as I thought it would be but it's still epic. The plot also has some very emotional twist and turns that will make some viewers cry a little while watching. The girl next to me couldn't stop weeping. The special effects are top notch and the acting is the best in this franchise. I never thought I would be sad to see this franchise finally end. But during the final scene it was sad...Well just slightly that it's the end. One big gripe I have is how some of the main characters gets killed off way too easily and some even off screen.

"It is the quality of one's convictions that determines success, not the number of followers.","So here it is, the 8th and final instalment of a film franchise that has lasted 10 years and runs at just under 20 hours in total. Following straight on from the frustratingly incomplete scene setter that was Deathly Hallows Part 1, we continue to track Harry, Hermione and Ron as they search for the remaining Horcruxes that will render the evil Lord Voldermort as a mere mortal. This narrative thread is run concurrently with the Voldermort movements, where he now has in his possession The Elder Wand (the wand to rule them all) and has gathered a vast army to descend upon Hogwarts and achieve his ultimate goal of killing Harry. Meanwhile vital character story arcs are filled in and secrets will out...David Yates directs and Steve Kloves adapts to the screen, both of whom were perfect choices given their considerable input to the series. Smartly the pic has been kept to a 2 hour and 10 minute run time, and thankfully it flows nicely and the pace never stalls. Being one of those who has never read the books I can't say what has been left out or if anything has been tampered with for dramatic licence? What I know for sure is that the emotional investment garnered from being with this story for so long, to be part of these characters lives, watching them grow, ensures that this closure piece pounds the senses. Sitting down to watch it you realise that we are going to lose people we care for, and Hogwarts, the wonderful place we fist glimpsed across the night time water, is going to be attacked and reduced to a battle scarred place of war.As the effects work dazzles and the one time child actors come shining through as mature actors who have casted off previous wooden traits, the story filling strands show just what wonderful work Rowling achieved on the page. Some of the characters never stood a chance in life, some carried deep emotional scars, and others held secrets so crucial to the whole Potter universe. For a series of such fantastical genre sparkle, the Harry Potter world eventually reveals itself to be a deep and fortified humanist drama, and engaging it most certainly is. That this is achieved as battlefield carnage is raised, with wand wars booming up on the screen, it means credit is due to all involved in the making of such a cherished and intensely followed Octalogy.Is it the earth shattering finale one hoped for? Well not quite. Story wise for sure that is the case, but with the whole story driving towards the final battle between Harry and Voldermort, it's disappointing to find it's rather brief and in truth anti climatic. Harry the boy now burgeoning into a man versus the snake faced despot surely should have been a crowning glory, but sadly not so. To compound this irritating disappointment, we then get the epilogue that is bogged down by aging make-up design that is almost laughable. But these are just annoyances, not film killers, for this has been a magical ride for 10 years. Fans will feel a gap in the heart now it's over, maybe even shed a Snape like tear as well? Yet ultimately it has been a triumph and the rewatchable factor for the whole series will always remain high. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Well...,"I don't really know how to describe this movie, so I'll make use of my Spanish and say that Part II was ""asi-asi"". Yes, it is arguably the greatest saga ever told, probably the greatest I will be alive for, but as a stand-alone movie, it was mediocre. The writers/director overlooked numerous subplots from the book, and the movie felt a little impersonal. When the big battles come, and you are watching characters you fell in love with almost a decade ago meet an untimely end, you don't get very emotional like you should because it all happens so fast. Half of the heartfelt moments of the movie are basically summed up in one or two lines with melodramatic acting/writing. Not a terrible job by any of the actors, but this movie deserved a better effort all around. Not Oscar worthy in the least bit, not epic enough in the least bit, but not worth avoiding.

It was magnificent.,"I've seen it and after reflecting on it, and indeed the entire series, I don't think I have very much to say. There are heaps of people who have valid criticisms with both the books and especially the films. Neither are perfect. I always thought the films were mainly targeted towards the existing fanbase as opposed to reaching out to an ignorant audience. I think the films can be forgiven, then, for not always doing the books complete justice. But despite those flaws and more, I was left deeply touched by the end of it all. And that's all that matters to me.It's not a critique. I'm totally biased. And it's the 9 year old child in me telling me that. It's been a huge influence in my life. I was never encouraged to read or to write as a child, and the first Harry Potter novel was my first real exposure to any kind of literature. Because of that, I can't help but associate writing as being something magical and wondrous. My first stories were Harry Potter fanfics. I credit my love of English and my passion for writing to those wonderful books. So yeah. I loved the film. I love the films. I love the books. I'm a hopeless and shameless supporter.

Wow what a finale,"I firstly need to say this...reading so many reviews on this and any film that people always forget a few things...1..any film made after a book and based on said book is just that 'based on' so it wouldn't be the same.2...a review is a little about what you enjoyed and how and why you liked it so others can with an open mind watch the film for themselves and make their own judgements.So the film...it for me was fantastic, I have seen the series around 25 times now and at least 4 times at the pictures for all 8 and I love them every time. I can remember seeing these as they came out every year and as we approached this final film I was scared, sad, excited and thrilled for its release and like many I left the cinema in tears and sad that it was all over.In this final part Harry and friends have to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes and many things are learnt about some that will shock you and at the same time make you sad as you would now see that certain people were actually Harry's friend not foe. We then see an epic battle and it's all centred around Hogwarts with virtually the whole cast from all the films returning.It's exciting, sad and thrilling to watch and the ending wasn't needed in my eyes but it worked.I do think that this series of Harry Potter is the only series of films that either remained as good each sequel or got better.

"Every little thing he does is magicget it, like the song?","Finales of this magnitude usually come about once every few years for television shows, but very rarely for feature films. However, this is most certainly the case for the epic conclusion to the Harry Potter saga, filled with equal parts fan-servicing closure and genuinely emotive scenes for those less devout followers like myself. Personally, the film falls short of being the ultimate achievement in filmmaking it would've aspired to, but that does not mean it wasn't an exciting and overly engaging movie from start to finish.Part 2 picks up right where its predecessor left off, with Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) celebrating his theft of the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb. Cut to our three heroes Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), who must find and destroy the last remaining Horcruxes: a collection of rare items and the only things keeping Voldemort alive. And during the climactic battle between good and evil, we learn the all-important secrets surrounding Harry, Voldemort, Snape and other key players in the Potter universe.In fact, one aspect Part 2 conveys better than any other film in the series is the hero-villain relationship. It only makes sense that a film that has had so much time to flesh out its characters should develop some sort of key bond between the two rivals; one that goes beyond the stereotypical battle of good versus bad. I likened the situation to that of Star Wars. We know exactly what the respective hero and villain stand for, and yet they are more alike than perhaps either of them even want to acknowledge. My apologies if this sounds a little cloudy, but I risk getting blown to bits in a minefield of spoilers if I keep rambling on.I love to see filmmakers taking steps to initiate innovation in directing, and David Yates must be accordingly credited with presenting a unique plot structure. Rather than possessing a clear beginning, middle and end, this film starts off with a short introduction and a set piece at Gringotts Bank (where a Horcrux is hidden). From there, the next ninety minutes play out as one enormous set piece inside Hogwarts, combining the fight for the school, search for the remaining Horcruxes and Harry's date with destiny into a grandiose visual spectacle.But that doesn't mean the film lacks substance when it's needed. Granted, I felt little sympathy for most secondary characters that were lost, but Harry's delving into Snape's memories (revealing the true colours of his character) is arguably the strongest and most poignant scene of the film. Coupled with Harry's vision of his dead parents before facing Voldemort in the final act, the greatest achievement of these scenes is that they evoked sympathy from someone who did not expect to become so emotionally attached to any character.The film does temporarily fall into the trap of playing out like a video game considering the task of moving from one Horcrux to another: items that are nothing more than MacGuffins at their most basic level (see: Sucker Punch). This can detract from the pacing at some points, especially since the film tends to intercut between the revelations of Harry's past, and his friends' efforts to destroy the items which, by comparison, seem far less integral to the plot.Script-wise, Part 2 treads water, delivering a decent screenplay that dosen't exactly stretch one's imagination. It can become rather stale (after a while everything becomes 'brilliant' this or 'bloody hell' that) but overall it isn't a huge concern. What was disappointing, though, was the cheesy 'nineteen years later' epilogue. Aside from the obvious fact that no-one looks as if they've aged a day, it serves no real purpose in the film, and does nothing to dilute my general hatred of tacked-on 'and then this happened' scenes to close out a movie. Still, a solid effort, and a fitting end to an imaginative series.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

Deathly Hallows Part 2 a big disappointment,"Just like the previous 2 Harry Potter films Deathly Hallows Part 2 was a big disappointment. Again many important and dramatic parts of the story were left out. So many things were changed from the book itself, and that took away so much from the story and made the movie disappointing. I can't understand how so many people found this movie to be so wonderful. I found myself during the movie just shaking my head at how things were done in the movie. If you have read the book and enjoyed the story you will probably find this movie to be so disappointing in so many ways. Don't take my word for it though. Go and see it for yourself, but don't expect too much from it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The character are so wonderfully written, they all felt relatable. It felt like each if the character are just part of my own personality one way or another.

"Despite A Few Set-Backs, This Is Such A Good Ending For The Harry Potter Franchise","Pros:
1. The comedy produces genuine laughs and is appropriately placed.
2. The score, for the most part, booms out to add an extra layer of intensity, apprehension and excitement.
3. Once again, the special effects are wondrous and still look amazing 10 years later.
4. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort) and Alan Rickman (Severus Snape).
5. The sound design and sound mixing is fantastic as usual, and it helps to bring so much of the wizarding world to life.
6. The tender and emotional moments send legitimate shivers down your spine, specifically when Severus Snape acknowledges his love for Lily Potter (Geraldine Somerville), and when Harry Potter is being comforted by his deceased loved ones.
7. The Battle of Hogwarts is awe-inspiring in its scope and execution, with some of the visuals being extraordinary.
8. The movie concludes the franchise greatly with the story being rounded out touchingly.Cons:
1. There is a scene wherein a spinning camera movement is implemented and it's just strange and distracting, thus adding nothing to the scene.
2. The lighting is far too dark at certain times so it makes it really hard to make anything out.
3. The score at times can either be pointlessly inserted, or it's just overbearing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
go be nerdy if you have seen the other films you won't be disappointed,"So I watched the mega blockbuster finale to the Harry ""the nerd sorcerer"" Potter saga ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" from 2011. So was this movie good, I say abracadabra bitch, or yes in muggle speak. I have seen every Harry Potter movie and enjoyed them all. I especially like how the movies (and I guess the books to) have matured with each passing film. They also went from somewhat structured like in the sorcerers stone to less predictable and original as time has passed. I saw this last one in IMAX 3D, I personally found the 3D to not be mind blowing, which I think is common among films not shot in 3D. So if I was you I would save the cash and see this in regular boring ole' 2D. So this movie just like the others is a little dark, has fascinating characters, a mystery to be solved and mysteries to be revealed. This movie delivers these Harry standards in spades. This movie was enjoyable except for the final scene for me. I won't spoil it but it is taken from the final books epilogue. It seemed tacked on and kind of pointless. I personally think much like star wars we have not seen the last Harry Potter film. I see the next one coming in about 10 years after the next Harry book by Rowling comes out called ""Harry Potter and the quest to find something else to write that failed and the search for more money."" I think the next one should be R with a little graphic interracial (muggle on wizard) hardcore action. So this movie is a worthy ending to the series, it answers all the questions, has a wide demographic base from young to old from magic nerd to jock. So go enjoy and be nerdy for a couple of hours, but just don't start here these movies for the most part should be watched in order. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The final confrontation,"As the second of a two-part series finale, this was it. Harry Potter has to destroy the last of Voldemort's secret life forces and end things once and for all. And the battle all comes down to the showdown at the now-overrun Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Who will survive? Who will die? The answers to these and all other questions will be revealed when you watch the film. There were some changes but they didn't bother me in the slightest. As the final chapter of the film series, this is how it really ends. It's been a while since I've read the book and seen the movie, but I enjoyed both and I'm not sure which is better; they're both good. If you're more of a movie buff and love Harry Potter, this is the crown jewel. Don't wait. See it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Better than the first part.,"After seeing the first part that I found boring I thought that Harry Potter part two was better. My rating: 6/10 (not so bad). My opinion about the movie is that it has very good special effects and that it is the only thing I liked the ""most"" in Harry Potter. The special effects are the most used details in Harry Potter movie and they are so excellent, especially the scene where we see the battle of Voldemort against Harry Potter and this is the scene I preferred the most in the film. It was so well done! But it doesn't mean that I found it super good. Not at all. I am not really a fan of Harry film. I never really understood the Harry Potter stories and it is too difficult for me to understand and to make sense with it. Probably because, I never read any of the books. Harry Potter is a very violent film with a lot of bloody scenes. It is too violent sometimes. My sister read some or every Harry books but not me. But I have to admit that some things are good in the film (like the special effects, of course). Harry Potter is a good story. I've seen the entire seven films and I preferred the second and fifth one (I think). It is very hard for me to understand Harry's stories. I saw it at the cinema in 3D and to be honest the 3D glasses didn't give anything special to the screen. It was so boring! I wonder if Harry Potter is a real success in the world. But for me it isn't. There are a lot of sad feelings in the Harry films. It is very sad sometimes. But it is scarry at the same time. I will give only 1 Oscar for Harry Potter film. Good try anyway. My name is Constantin and I am fourteen years old. Goodbye.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

A Great Conclusion!,"Harry Potter and his friends, Ron and Hermione, are continuing their journey to destroy all of the Horcrux and defeat Lord Voldemort. Since this is the last one, the movie tries to make as much as they can out of it in two hours and ten minutes, and they did that greatly. Of course, it isn't perfect, but it's a good closing ending that makes sense and doesn't disappoint. The darkness is of course something noticeable (That kind of ""darkness"" and evil was stronger showed since film four) and the script gave us the most important moments from the book that makes this just another great adaptation from the Harry Potter universe. Harry Potter is older, and more and more of the secrets are coming out to be revealed. He is angry and desperate to finish this war, and if you just look at his face you can see that he has got enough. The great battle that starts to be settled in is showed greatly, but when it starts, they showed a wonderful magic massacre in the best possible way. The sequences were visually amazing, as well as the dramatic music and intense camera filming that made it unforgettable. The 1v1 fights were especially done greatly, we can finally see more of the characters from the Potter-verse fight, and that's great! The acting was good as always, and even the smaller roles did great performances. The scenography was good, even if they made the Hogwarts Castle on the computer this time, but it's not such a big problem, it looks realistic anyway. After many fights, truths, sins and chooses, Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part II becomes a great entertainment, a fantastic conclusion, and it's even rewatchable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Disappointing End,"Well the story is just in the book, thank god for that. but still the director has not shown the important scenes of the book, like the place where Beatrix is killed or the place where Neville kills nagini, in short the whole end of the movie is total disaster. For example when harry kills voldemort its shown as if he has killed some normal troll. The movie lacks dialogues, bad screenplay, it all ends very abruptly. In the start the movie is very little fun to watch, well the most boring part was when Harry talks to Dumbledore. only girls will be crying in this movie. Its not for boys at all not even for geeks. Strictly for HP fans and no one else should go and waste their time.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

You can't help but cry,"The final movie in the 8-part film franchise is the one everyone's waiting for, and not just because it's the last one. There are so many elements that make the audience feel invigorated and validated, and so much we've been waiting ten years to finally see. Have you been waiting for Maggie Smith to show she can play with the big boys? Have you been hoping Julie Walters would blow her top? Have you been waiting for Harry to choose between Hermione, Ginny, Cho Chang, and Luna? Did your heart go out to Professor Snape in the books, and you've been anxiously awaiting the film's reproduction of his backstory through flashbacks?Well, the great part about this movie is it has incredible special effects. As you've been expecting since the story took a darker turn, there's an epic build-up to a pretty intense battle. Ralph Fiennes is a very formidable bad guy, and as he and his cronies surround Hogwarts, Maggie Smith and the other good guys cast protection spells around the castle. It's a very ominous scene with quite an emotional feeling for the students and audience members, since we've all grown up watching the castle for the past ten years. The battle scenes themselves are quite upsetting, so be prepared if you've fallen in love with certain characters that not everyone gets a happy ending.Finally, the moment everyone's been waiting for: Alan Rickman gets his day in the sun. His character, Professor Snape, has become a universal cult favorite, even among those who haven't read the books. A warning to those who have read the books: the page-to-screen conversion got severely cut. The seventh novel was a very emotional read, and as you immersed yourself in the pages and pages and pages of Snape's childhood and teenage years, you were probably hoping he'd get an entire movie to himself. While he doesn't get the majority of the movie's screen time, you can still love those scenes.You can't please everyone, and J.K. Rowling received more than her fair share of criticism about the way her book series ended. If you don't end up liking the end of this movie, just remember that the books ended the same way, and Steve Kloves and the rest of Hollywood probably wanted to be faithful to the original story. There is one omission from the text that did bother me: Harry makes a speech in front of the entire school, and when he finds out he was wrong, he doesn't make another speech, as he does in the book. If you know what part I'm talking about and you loved that part of the book, it might be a good warning to know it's missing from the movie.All in all, it's a very good adaptation of the final book, including most of the text in the last two movies. You'll cry, both out of sadness and out of heartwarming nostalgia that these kids you've connected with since you and they were ten years old are now grown ups. It's a true experience watching these movies, let alone growing up alongside them and going to the theaters to see them, so with all the history between you, it's not really possible to hold lasting grudges or express more than a little disappointment in the way the story turned out. And, of course, the very end is priceless.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

"«The boy, who has survived»","It is the most famous screen adaptation in the history of cinema. Even people, who have not ever seen it, know this story about the wizard which came to our world to overcome the evil. There were seven books and eight films, because the last part was shared into two flicks due to new Hollywood standard. If you have not guessed yet, we are talking about the novel by Joan Rowling. The last film about Harry Potter was realized on the 7th of July in 2011. And it was the highest-grossing film of this year and the tenth-highest-grossing film of the all times. 
What is the secret of success of the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2""? To solve this mystery let's focus on the key factors of a movie success such as: plot and story, their relevance to the audience, star power, director, special effects, budget, release date and critics' reviews. All of these constituents are here. 
It is obviously that the plot resonates with the dreams and beliefs of target audience. Harry finally met with his enemy and the greatest battle is going to start, but surprisingly Voldemort become stronger than Harry has excepted. What way the inseparable trinity, Harry, Ron and Hermione will found to protect their school and their world? It seems to sound impossible but Harry decides to sacrifice his life to bring the death to Voldemort. The audience froze in anticipation, everyone would like Harry to live. Despite all fans of Harry Potter know the end of the book they are truly worrying during the film. 
It is going without saying that the most part of actors, who has been shooting for more than ten years at the all previous films, has a large and enthusiastic fan base. Not only main characters which were played by Denial Radcliff, Rupert Green and Emma Watson but actors of supporting roles too, like Allen Rickman or Helena Bonham Carter - of course, they were gained recognition from the audience. 
A well-known director is one more important factor. David Yates shot three movies about Harry Potter before the last one, but none of these parts has such huge box-office. They all made a great profit over 900 thousand dollars but the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" has raised 1,3 billion dollars. David Yates has brought whole his experience into his last film, he knew how to make the perfect picture.
Since the 2000s ""Harry Potter"" has changed significantly. The last part was not a fairy tale like the first part, it was amazing, mysterious and scaring world. And director needed the computer-generated imagery to integrate magic world into a real life and make film more gripping. Needless to say, that the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" was recognized by the Academy Award for the best visual effects and was awarded by BAFTA at this nomination also. Thanks to the soundtracks by gorgeous Alexandre Desplat the film won the Annual Grammy's Award. 
""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" had a budget of 250 million dollars and was co-financed by Warner Broth. Pictures and Heyday films which were very generous for whole necessary things. 
Another reason of the film's acceptance is a good labeled from the critics. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four and said, ""The finale conjures up enough awe and solemnity to serve as an appropriate finale and a dramatic contrast to the lighthearted (relative) innocence of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone all those magical years ago.""
At last, the release date. It was the middle of the summer, when cinemas became full of Harry Potter's fans. Not all previous parts were turned out in summer, lots of them were screened in autumn or in winter, when many of viewers has not opportunities to visit cinema palaces.
To sum it up, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" is an example of a commercially successful movie where various factors come into play to bring millions of viewers and provide the renown from the world cinema to all members of the film's production unit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

One Last Wave of the Wand,"Ten years after its debut, the Harry Potter film franchise has drawn to a close. The dedicated fan-based generated by the book series of the same name has been subject to a fairly consistent variety of offerings, but never (in my estimation, at least) has any one of the pictures ventured into the realm of being truly ""bad."" Thankfully, the same can be said for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. Is it epic? Not at all. But it is a slam-bang finale that—for the most part— satisfies.Picking up where Deathly Hallows: Part 1 concluded, the final act of the film has a much more action-oriented focus. The story, of course, continues to revolve around mystical items called ""horcruxes,"" the persistent evil of Lord Voldemort, and the whimsical stuff that otherwise defines the alternate world in which Hogwarts exists. The final ""revelations"" are not entirely predictable, but anyone moderately familiar with Potter lore should have a solid idea as to where the whole thing is going to end up. In a sense, that's one of the things that's made the Harry Potter story so successful: it's a clear-cut case of good vs. evil, and, given the ridiculously muddled narrative webs that many tales are caught up in these days, that's an extreme rarity. I mean, really: in the final moments, when Harry and Voldemort are wand-dueling and red and green sparks are flying, one can't help but think of other similar confrontations (think Luke Skywalker vs Darth Vader, Frodo vs. Gollem, ad infinitum). At its core, then, the movie is fueled by a basic—though extraordinarily powerful—mythos that's hard to ignore.The movie isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, though.In fact, it suffers from a similar syndrome that just about all stories with an abundance of fantastical elements seem to think is absolutely necessary: namely, a crazy amount of overblown battle sequences. Don't get me wrong: I enjoy this sort of thing every once in a while. I do, however, think that the story has to merit the inclusion of such a large-scale confrontation, though. Here, when goody-two-shoes- professors and minions-of-the-Dark-Lord face off amid the ruins of the once proud School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, there's a sense that things are a bit well forced. It's as if the filmmakers came to the realization that they were at the end, and that this was the appropriate time to plug-in sweeping armies, etc. It also seems as if the long- awaited showdown between Harry and Voldemort was much too tame. It's got its moments, but when the inevitable comes to pass, I found myself whispering, ""Really? That's it?""I know what you're thinking: well, it was better in the book. That may be true. But this isn't the book: it's the movie. And after investing countless hours in this cosmic collision that should be the end-all, be- all of the Potter universe, the unfathomably large audience that's waited patiently for this final installment deserves something much more grandiose.I say all of this with love. I really did have fun watching the movie. It's just that that special ""something"" that makes up a classic seems to be just out of arm's-reach. When taken as a whole, though, there's no denying the power of the spectacle of one of the better movie series to come along in quite some time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

However, with certain deaths revealed the true glorious purposes that those characters were burdened with.

Even though it's the shortest in runtime in the franchise, I was basically glued to the TV the entire time. I sensed so much urgency in Harry and could not be more invested in him and his allies.The ending did not disappoint and delivered plenty explosion, wizardry, and valor from the characters.

Harry Potter and the grateful it's all over,"As the franchise closes, Radcliffe finally becomes quite a fine actor. He carries the burden of the film and never fumbles the performance like in so many of this film's predecessors.The story is still a bit of a jumbled mess from the point of view of someone who has not read the books but at least all the recognizable characters are back for the pretty impressive at times Battle of Hogwarts.Voldemort, despite a fine performance from Fiennes is still just not scary or evil enough to match the truly great villains of fantasy cinema. He looks the part but the character fails to have the full impact he should.It's great to see actors of Rickman and Fiennes' calibre sharing the screen but now the franchise is finished, I only hope that all this talent can be put to better use.I don't wish for all the hours I spent watching these back but I do wish the money lavished on the budgets could have been spent on more interesting and better-written projects.

A very god ending,"I was enthralled from the opening scene to the start of the credits. Very few films capture me like that where I am so in tuned with the story.

This is Harry's story. This is his moment to set the wizarding world right. Along the way, several characters stand out. Neville Longbottom makes a stand and Professor McGonagall goes to war. There are many moments in which supporting cast members take the foreground for a moment or two, but it is still Harry's story throughout the movie. I must mention the genius of Alan Rickman as Snape here, he was a defining point in this film and one of the reasons it was so special. Now, was it a perfect movie. No. The CG at points looked amateurish and some of the dialogue didn't fit well into the movie. Does it deter you from enjoying the experience. It shouldn't. These are just little things that annoy me. The whole movie looked amazing. The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible.

Harry Potter and the deep emotional connection,"The time is 3:00am and I have just returned from a midnight showing of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II. With the final Harry Potter film and the release of Toy Story 3 this year, I have suddenly become aware how brief childhood is, and how rapidly the last 10 years have played out. Being born in the early 90s had it's benefits, one of which being that I grew up on Harry Potter. My parents would read the books to me as a child, and had it not been for Rowling I probably would not be reading novels today. Harry Potter first came to our screens in 2001 and we saw for the first time, Daniel, Rupert and Emma in their roles. As the books grew darker, the films grew darker, as the characters grew older and developed so did Radcliffe and friends, as did so many people my age. We all followed Potter on his adventures as we had adventures of our own. However, needles to say the Potter saga is over both on paper and screen and this has left a hole in my heart. I have to say, I have never been more excited for a film in which I already know what is going to happen. However, I have also never been so nervous about a film I am about to see. Would it deliver? Would it live up the books and our expectations? I found myself praying that this would not go the same way as ""The Goblet of Fire"" (a particularly sore spot of mine). The clock stuck midnight in a small but packed cinema and as they announced that they would skip all the trailers the entire audience roared with excitement and sheer happiness. The film started as it should, where we left off in Deathly Hallows Part 1. Did the film deliver? Yes it did. The pace of the film was relentless, but gentle enough when it needed to be. Potter literally had the audience in the palm of it's hand, making us laugh during scenes of death and destruction and weep during scenes of happiness. In the films previous to ""Hallows: Part 2"" I have found myself frowning and cringing at some questionable acting from the cast. I don't like to poke at talented people but I honestly felt Radcliffe in The Goblet of Fire and the Half Blood Prince did not achieve his potential, and for me was not Harry Potter. However it all changed... Daniel Radcliffe gave the absolute performance of his career and was utterly enchanting to watch. A real pleasure to have on our screens. Not only Radcliffe, but the entire cast gave it their absolute all and it showed. A few personal favourites were Alan Rickman as Snape, Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, Helen McCrory as Mother Malfoy and the brilliant Fiennes as Lord Voldemort. There was not a single flaw in the performance given by anyone and it really makes me proud to be a fan of Harry Potter. As for the 3D? It certainly added to the film but did not distract you from what was actually going on. It was subtle, and beautiful and not at all in-your-face. *cough* Avatar *cough* I've been to see many films at the cinema but have never had such a wonderful, meaningful, emotional and exciting experience other than watching the final Potter film. I kind of don't want to take off my Gryffindor uniform! Potter part 2 left me feeling mesmerised, satisfied and ecstatic but also extremely sad. It also rewarded long-term Potter fans with many references and moments of nostalgia. This film certainly has it's place in history, and I think all would agree it deserves it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Absolutely and Unequivocally Brilliant,"What can be said, really? Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 truly pulls out all the stops, and very incredibly blows away all expectation as each character receives his or her proper send-off and the much-anticipated final battle between Harry and Voldemort approaches, and approaches beautifully.The story begins exactly where we left off, and from there never fails to do what it needs to do, and that is satisfy us. Old characters return to battle, and each scene is viscerally incredible, making for not only a fantastic viewing experience, but a truly faithful one to the books. I believe it can be said that this is, expectedly, the darkest of all the movies, though that is how it should be.I must applaud, in particular, Daniel Radcliffe's and Alan Rickman's performances as Harry and Snape, respectively. Daniel truly gives the best performance of all the movies, and very emotionally carries us through to the end; as with Alan, his infamously complex character of Snape is so heart-wrenchingly portrayed as his loyalties are finally revealed, it is just stunning. This is not to say, of course, that every single other character's performance isn't incredible, for everyone truly does a fantastic job, and gets their shining moments.Being a Potter fanatic, I couldn't have been more pleased. Reader or non-reader, I assure you you will not be disappointed during this final Potter film. It is staggeringly good, and truly one of the best finales of any franchise I've yet to see.

Great ending to an amazing movie series,"It is a very well analysed and realized ending to a movie that you might have wished it will never end. Any other final chapter could not have done a better closer than JK Rowling managed through this final chapter. It will leave you sadden, and happy, it will leave the viewers with a great after taste for decades to come. It will probably address a young adult/teenage audience, but that is the greatness of it, it grows up with the audience, with the actors, with the characters. Marvelously done through a timeline of chronological sense. Truly a great movie, that needs to be watched by this generation and the next to come.Just an opinion. Just a thought. Just Steven J.

Viewers And Fans Of This Series Would Be Feeling DEATHLY Knowing That This Is The End Of The Series,"There were some great and eye-opening moments in this film and storyline instalment which I enjoyed. I felt that this film and storyline instalment could have been created better than what it was. I felt disappointed by the outlook of the whole series. I am not sure what it was. Every cast member who was in this series truly pushed themselves and did a tremendous job on keeping the whole storyline in structure for all the viewers and fans of this series. I am a writer, and these kind of series really help me and other writers come up with new creative ideas for a series. This series helped me but not too much but enough to come up with some brand new ideas that viewers and fans of this series would enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Skilled yet flawed,"Skilled yet flawed, Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a fitting end to the series. First, the story is comprehensive but incomplete. It's entirely third act, completely consumed by a climactic battle. This is emotionally tiring and thematically cramped. Furthermore, character limitations are exposed. Specifically, Voldemort is a flat villain. After so long, viewers never learned his motivations. Meanwhile, Harry is similarly generic. There isn't much complexity inside his ""chosen one"" trope. Conversely, Snape's compelling reveal gives him and Dumbledore depth (with performances to match). Yet, while that counters the script's shortcomings, it doesn't erase them.Likewise, The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is technically good, not great. The cinematography uses Dutch angles and composition, yet fails to utilize focus, color, or symbolism. The editing has powerful smash inserts and memory montages, but is awkwardly paced due to structural issues. The complex sound is occasionally stylish, but lacks thematic implications. However, the music revives John Williams' iconic score, the production is epic once again, and the cast is as elaborate as ever. Plus, the extensive effects are a given. Thus, The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is an above average film that deserves both judgement and recognition.Writing: 7/10

And so the circle closes,"As an eight part in the series there's not a single reason to explain the story or its characters, they've been defined. And so this film starts running, and doesn't really pause until the very end of it. As a book translation I guess it doesn't do too bad of a job - most events of importance get a glimmer of screen time. I have no idea how it works on people that haven't read the books though.As a film it's dark, literally. Too dark to my liking, it's a good thing to express the dark and grim feeling of the book, it's overkill to make the film look like everything was shot between dusk and dawn. This effect was even worse in 3D - which again turned out to be a dud.Overall the film felt rushed - as if the maker was done with it, glad to have the series end. As part of the audience I now feel the same - it was a good series to watch through the years but I am happy it is done now.Adding that all together makes it the worst part in the series to me, fitting but not fitting, pleasing and not pleasing.6 out of 10 last rites",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Sheer spine-chilling awesomeness and absolute heart-thumping brilliance,"It is no easy task to make a film carrying tremendously high expectations of being a finale to the most popular series in the world, not to mention the fact that the majority audience already knows every possible plot point. And yet, it is in these circumstances, or rather in-spite of it, that 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' rises to a level of cinema that previous films only fleetingly approached. Knowing fully well that millions of Potter-fans across the globe would either way lap-up the film in any form, the makers of DH-P2 have gone that extra mile in ensuring a fitting climatic end for the series, thereby elevating the already popular franchise to another dimension.The film picks up exactly from where Deathly Hallows Part 1 left off, with Harry, Ron and Hermione continuing their search for the remaining bits of Voldemort's soul, which eventually takes them to (where else but) Hogwarts. Be-fittingly, it IS Hogwarts that plays host to the final showdown, with Voldemort and his army of death eaters, snatchers and giants landing up at its doorstep hunting for Harry. What ensues is a battle of the likes of which Hogwarts has never seen before. It is in the middle of all this that one of the most important escapades from the action takes place, as Harry dives into Professor Snape's memory. You have to be made of stone to not have cried or at the least have gone watery-eyed in this sequence, where the true nature of Snape is revealed. It is followed with another escapade, where another beloved character makes an appearance. The movie also has its share of deaths, with some important characters being bumped off. The film builds up brilliantly to the ultimate climax between Harry and Lord Voldemort, with characters like Neville, Professor McGonagall and Molly Weasely playing major parts.Having been a true-blue die-hard Potter-maniac for 10 years now, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' HAD to be spot-on in its execution to get a thumbs-up from similar million others, and yet had to be elaborate enough to make it understandable for the movie-fans of the series. DH-P2 scores full marks in adapting J.K Rowling's final book as accurately as possible, with the few changes actually making the film better. Steve Kloves finishes off in style with his bang-on, sharp script that clears all ambiguities he'd left in the previous adaptations. The cinematography of the film, although not as breath-taking as previous installments, manages to create the perfect atmosphere for the finale. The release in 3D, however, does not create any particular jaw-dropping effect, with the exception of the initial gringotts-dragon scenes. The music of the film is considerably improved upon (compared to DH-P1) by Alexandre Desplat, with the right mix of hard-hitting orchestrations and soulful melodies to counter both the fierce-action and gentle emotion in the film.Director David Yates, who started his stint with 'Order of the Phoenix', successfully steers the series to its epic conclusion, with his most brilliant film till-date. Of the performances, all actors give their characters their best final shot, especially Helena Bonham Carter as the eccentric Bellatrix Lestrange. The principle characters of Harry, Ron and Hermione are given the perfect send-off with accurate performances by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Daniel manages to restrain himself at the crucial moments, and it only shows the amount he's grown as an actor since that first film 10 years ago.The film however belongs to Ralph Fiennes and Alan Rickman. While Fiennes manages to bring all-out evil in his no-holds performance as Harry's evil nemesis Lord Voldemort, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape does magic to the film in the shortest screen time, a la' Antony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. It may possibly be one of his career-defining performances that should be awarded with, at the very least, an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Though the Harry Potter series has always received the cold-shoulder by the Academy, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' may very well break the mould with a nomination/s in the top categories.As fans across the world bid adieu to the most loved phenomenon of this generation, they couldn't have hoped for a better send-off to the series than 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2'. For sheer spine-chilling awesomeness and absolute heart-thumping brilliance, I'd give the film a 4.5/5.Adios Potter!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Poor Adaptation,"I was looking forward to seeing the finale of the potter series, as the other films have been quite well presented. The latest 3 movies however have cutout vital bits of the story and the finale is just a joke. The film started off quite fast relative to the book, the whole breaking into Gringots scence was poorly adapted from the book. The final chapters of the book where 100 times better than the final parts of the film. When harry looks through Snape's memories it is way to brief, in the book a lot of emotion was shown as Snape saw the downfall to the relationship to himself and Harry potters mother. The battle between harry and Voldemort was truly disappointing as the director changed the engagement into battle between the two (and other main factors that I will not spoil for people reading this review). The positioning of Hagrid's whereabouts in the film pretty much show how poorly adapted the book was. They didn't even put in the line about Neville becoming a professor at the end.In conclusion I found the film very disappointing, I don't know why cinemas are showing it in 3D as it barely uses any 3d effects. 4*/10* A huge disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Lots of whizz, pop but lacking in the bang",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 as far as special effects and 3d were concerned were quite spectacular. The story and the acting were also very much head and shoulders above that of when the young actors started the franchise. I have to say I really enjoyed this film but that's only because I had a Harry Potter translator to get my through it. I have never read the books so my only look into the life of Harry Potter is through the films and as they are films they can only ever be adaptations from a much larger story that wouldn't be feasible in film to try and recreate. However with the story stretching over eight films now you would think there would have been a little bit more explanation as to why everything was happening. I got a general outline of why but no depth into what I have been told is a very well thought out and deep set of books. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the film I am just saying it could of been closer to a great film if there had been just a little bit more time filling in the cracks in the Plot. I'll finish with this Harry potter book fans will love this Harry Potter film fans get the book fans to explain why things are happening and sit back and enjoy its wizarding goodness.,,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Revisited on the big screen and as good as I remember it,"One of the (few) benefits of lockdown is to be able to revisit some classics on the big screen again, and that's what I did today for this last flick in the Harry Potter series.
Whereas Deathly Hallows Part 1 (aka ""3 go mad camping"") was low-key, this one hits pretty much all the right notes. It's dark, shocking at times (the dead girl after Greyback's had lunch!) and adds the right amounts of closure and mystery to the saga. There is also some nice humour, especially in the first half of the film.... Helena Bonham Carter playing Hermione playing Lestrange shows just what a fine actress she is.
My only gripe... after being the villainess of the piece for so many years, Bellatrix Lestrange gets dispatched a little too easily and quickly for my liking. But a worthy finale, and the ""final"" scene of the three stars on the bridge is genuinely moving (and should have been the end of the film in my book).",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Overall this film created a bar and reached it with great style and I think it could be capable of getting an Oscar nod for best picture and more than capable of being an unforgettable blockbuster.So to finish it all off I'd like to say Ron,Hermoine,Harry you will be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Harry Potter concludes. It will take your breath away...,"The final instalment is epic, beautiful, heart wrenching, funny, jaw dropping and enthralling. Part 1 sets the scene perfectly for the final instalment and the action comes in thick and fast. The final hour is an adrenaline rush of another kind, similar to that of Lord Of the Rings or even Return Of The Jedi every heart pounding second is deliciously played out to optimum effect and the special effects are (to put it lightly) incredible.The Harry Potter films in general are always a joy to watch, and this one is no different. Its soul purpose is to entertain its audience and boy does it work. Scenes featuring Britains finest actors are among the most enjoyable, Helena Bonham Carter is scrumptiously evil as Bellatrix Lestrange, and another side of her is shown to fantastic comedy value. Maggie Smith was always able to steal the show even when only in the film for mere seconds, here she demonstrates just how good she really is and her scenes are some of the most enjoyable in the entire film. And Ralph Fiennes' Lord Voldermort is a joy to watch, and gives the character an almost down-to-earth characteristic that makes him all the more threatening and to a lesser extent even sympathetic.The core core three Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are no longer playing around in this one. Radcliffe's progression as an actor has been slow, but ultimately very good. I was worried in the fourth film when I truly believed Radcliffe could ruin the rest of the series, but by film five he got back on track and managed to hold his own against Watson and Grint who certainly have a more natural knack for acting. His Harry Potter really is fantastic by this last instalment, he gives the character a warmth and humanity that he missed at times in previous films.All the characters in the film cement there lasting relationships in this last film, and though some rather beneficial and important moments are only scanned over, this is minor grievance as virtually nothing of significant importance is left out of the film from the book.Harry Potter has been with me since child hood all the way to adulthood and the films have continued the magic that JK Rowling first bought to my imagination with the Philosophers (Sorcerers) Stone. Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows part 2 is a fitting ending and the best in the series.

Be Proud To Be Harry Potter's Generation!,"We have finally come to the last page of J.K. Rowling's epic saga. Thiz is the final adventure of wonder boy wizard Harry Potter. The seventh and last book split into two separate movies. To be honest, it's very hard to criticize since the movies were shot back-to-back. In other words, these movies are actually one movie. The opening sequence has a very slow pace of storytelling which allows every detail can be described better. There is no need for further explanation. The story starts right away, showing the preparation of dark lord to hunt Harry Potter and the dark atmosphere surrounding Hogwarts which is now ruled by Professor Snape (Alan Rickman). Meanwhile, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) continue on their journey to find the last Horcruxes. The story eventually has some twists to throw at the end of the movie, but for most of the fans it will not be a twist anymore since they had already read the series books before thiz movie. The final battle between Harry Potter and the dark lord himself is one of the most highly anticipated scenes. The long awaited climax event is perfectly told, it looks like Daniel Radcliffe has done his best, but I think what makes that final scene so intense is also a splendid acting improvisation by Ralph Fiennes as You-Know-Who. Thiz movie is still directed by David Yates who has been the Director of thiz epic since ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" (2007), ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (2009) and, of course, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly hallows: Part 1"" (2010). Once again, thiz franchise has already become a part of each and every one of us. You will easily agree thiz statement (Spoiler Alert!), especially when we come to the end of the movie which tells Harry Potter, his wife Ginny (Bonnie Wright), Ron and Hermione send their children off to Hogwarts school from platform 3 ¾. In that very moment, we realize what we've just seen is not just Harry Potter, but it is all of us who have become older and mature during thiz franchise.

A perfect finish to a perfect series,"I don't usually review Harry Potter titles although I'm one of the biggest fans. I went for the final installment first day first show (couldn't wait any longer like I did for the others) and I wasn't disappointed at all (I never have with this franchise).The movies have gained as much of a following as the books itself, but this one takes the cake. I'm assuming that the Director, story-writers etc all worked under a lot of pressure as they had to live up to the expectations of millions of fans worldwide, and they did a hell of a job of it. The visuals are excellent, and since this movie only captures the second part of the book, there wasn't any need to gain momentum as the story progresses; the movie had us enthralled from the very beginning.I'm thoroughly saddened that this is probably the last Harry potter movie that came out (fingers crossed). It's like there's nothing more to look forward to. Yet, J.K. Rowling and everyone have enchanted us beyond our dreams all these years, so I bid adieu to you, Harry Potter, the boy who lived.

It's good but I understand why it didn't get an Oscar,"This is the end of a series that is famous around the world, the childhood of many young people around the world, I understand the director's burden when making this film. Especially since this is a movie adaptation of a book. The visual effects are quite nice, but the battle scenes all take place in dark places, making me sometimes feel uncomfortable, just hoping for a quick morning. The action scenes in the movie are also not very interesting. And there are a few things I don't really like, why are the villains always ""waiting for so long"" when they take the initiative? Don't they want it to be over quickly? Sometimes I feel that Voldemort is so lenient, from the moment he let Horcrux into Bellatrix's bank, did he trust Bella that much? Doesn't look like a bad guy at all. And did he even let Neville finish his speech? And I wonder why Harry Potter is affected by wearing the Horcrux necklace when he himself is a Horcrux? And couldn't the dialogue between Hermione, Ron, and Harry get funnier when Harry talks about how he's going to go into the woods to meet Voldemort again? Lol If she was that worried about Harry, she would have run into the woods or did something instead of sitting still and asking ""I thought you were in the woods?"" As for the character of Professor Snape, I know the intention to transform the villain (or so most of us thought) of the previous 7 films into a kind character who sacrifices for others and becomes a ""silent hero"". I don't know how things play out in the book, but this transformation in the movie was so sudden, and I still couldn't adapt my emotions to empathize with the character of Snape. Mrs. Rowling probably wanted people to think well of teachers who were strict but loved and wanted the best for their students. But if you want an audience like me to sympathize with a person who is willing to sacrifice and suffer injustice for love and then wants to clear it up by ""take my tears, let you know the truth"", it seems bit too much. This character is more confusing to me than memorable. In general, the film is quite lengthy, the film circuit is simple and I personally feel this part is not as good as the previous one. Many people say this part is better than the book, so I should feel lucky that I didn't read it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Ostentatious ending to a series that has lost its splendor of originality,"Story: Now this is where the film falls short the most, paramount importance is given to scenes where cheap romance occurs (retrieval of the basilisk teeth), which does nothing to enrich the plot, because it has no effect on the overall story, but the filmmaker does not seem o think it is important to explain Harry's ""loljks, I wasn't dead"", probably assuming that most people have read the book and the others will just say ""It was probably magic"", but this cannot be too much of a criticism because many of these weak storytelling mechanisms are taken directly from the books. As for the epilogue it seems cheap, gratuitous and completely out of tone with the rest of the film. It feels like it was left there to get a few cheap laughs and to leave the viewer with no uncertainty that Harry does live happily ever after. But most of these criticisms should probably go into a book review, because the source material is as weak as the film itself.Camera-work and Direction: Average to low standard, especially considering the budget was $250 million. The shots where steady cam was not used only seem out of character with the rest of the film. The sequences where Harry and Voldemort communicate through their psychic connection seem incredibly redundant and have a tendency towards fake experimentalism, which has no motifs and seems to be completely self-indulgent. Under this category falls also the white Kings Cross station, which seems to be an optimistic attempt to form some sort of symbolism, but once again this optimism must go unrewarded. The animations are standard, not adding much to the plot, even when they are mostly visually pleasing.Acting: The acting in the lead roles seems to be consistent with the rest of the series, even though our familiarity with the characters does not seem to make them more sympathetic. The supporting actors seem mostly relived to be over with this lengthy project and their performances are very weak, which is not saying that they are given enough screen time to give their characters any development.Sceenplay: Steve Kloves' screenplay seems to be an incomplete work where the adding in of interactions with cute animated creatures through out the film, seem to have importance over the development of the plot. With the fact that his only large job has been in writing the screenplay for the Harry Potter series, his knowledge of the overall story should have aided in tying loose ends, but these remain completely unsolved and seem accentuated with lousy dialogue and lengthily emotionally dry scenes.Soundtrack: Forgettable rehash of previous successesPoor ending to the epic (in size not in merit) Harry Potter franchise.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The End of 10 Years of Pure Magic.,"To begin, it was needed that the book be split into two movies, one movie would have been too long, and would have ruined the essence of the book. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part two is what it should be, an epic finale of amazing graphics, locations, acting, and above all truth of the book molded into pure cinematic bliss.Like most books turned into movies the text is not exactly molded to film word to word; as in the case of the film certain pieces of the book were missing, but what was put on film was still well done and understood by the readers.The Good: -The pace of the movie was explosive but easy to keep up with.-The Graphics, absolute perfection! -The story -The acting, simply amazing tears were shed by all Potter fans -The movie itself was good, but to be clear it was true brilliance.The Bad: -While the movie was still great without certain parts of the book, it would have been nice to see the finale truly converted straight from the book.-the series ended! (but thats a personal problem :) The good out weigh the bad by a lot, but any true Potter fan would love this series despite the little faults presented. Go watch it, and when it comes out to own, go buy it, and once you've done that treasure it, because this movie is pure gold, and the series is pure magic.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Good, not great","Part 2 of the final installment of the Harry Potter series begins as Harry, Ron, and Hermione continue their quest of tracking down and destroying Lord Voldemort's three remaining Horcruxes, the dark magical items posed as everyday things that are responsible for his immortality. But as the legendary Deathly Hallows are uncovered, Voldemort finds out about their mission, the fight of good against evil will come to an explosive end. Deathly Hallows: Part 2 picks up right where Part 1 left off, searching for Horcruxes. I was never really a fan of the Horcruxes plot line, but I had always tolerated it as I read the novels because even though it felt like a plot line that would be in a sub-par video game, it still felt planned, thanks to Tom Riddle's diary back in Chamber of Secrets. The Horcruxes plot line also worked well on the pages, because they were spread out in the book. However, on screen, it felt repetitive and tedious, with little to no break in between each one, especially in Part 2. Part 1 was an atmospheric and emotional movie, and even though it was basically a prelude to the conclusion of the series, it stood alone as a film rather well. Part 2 was supposed to be action-packed and also emotional, and while it was action-packed (although it felt like it took forever to get there), it wasn't as emotional as I had hoped it would be. The film felt a bit rushed and was single-noted. Part 2 is the shortest Potter installment, and it felt like it. Many scenes left me wanting more. The single-noted aspect made the film feel incomplete. It felt like it was strictly about Horcruxes and the Potter/Voldemort confrontation, with some other sub-plots barely sprinkled in. Maybe if they hadn't split the film in two, but made it one long film, it would have felt more complete. The acting was as solid as ever, with Daniel Radcliffe giving his best performance of the series. Ralph Fiennes was as evil as ever and Alan Rickman gave his best performance in the series too, as Snape. Everyone else was solid as well, but unfortunately we don't get to see them nearly as much, which was a shame. The visual effects were top-notch and can only be rivaled by Deathly Hallows: Part 1. The spell-casting, creatures, and explosions were dazzling and suitably, magical. Some of the CGI was a bit spotty, but I honestly can remember only one instance and it literally lasted two seconds. I loved that the film was all about how there is darkness in all of us, but we can learn how to overcome it. We learn quickly that no character in this series (including Dumbledore) is totally pure, and Harry must completely accept this or else he will fail. Overall, as a film, it's a good one. But when you deal with sequels and a series, as well as the most famous book series of all time, as well as expectation, Part 2 doesn't make the grade. I expected a lot more, and didn't get it. It felt rushed and wasn't at all cathartic, which is what a Potter fan who not only grew up reading the books but grew up watching the films as well was deserving of. There are a lot of variables as to why the film was not excellent, and one could argue Book 7 was one of the weaker books anyway. Still, it's a good movie and whenever you deal with an ending people are very critical if it is not exactly they way they envisioned it. Harry Potter was one of the greatest film series of all time, and even though Part 2 wasn't the best, I'm still satisfied with the series as a whole, which stuck to the books faithfully, upheld Rowling's wishes, stuck with the same actors, and above all, stayed consistently great with four different directors and the transition from kid-friendly to much, much darker themes. That is an achievement unto itself. In the 10 years since Harry's big-screen debut, the spell has never been broken.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Great Final Film but Rushed,"NO spoilers in this review. :) I caught the very first midnight showing of this movie at my local theater so there was lots of audience reaction and participation throughout the roughly two and a half hour premier. A few minutes before it started we got to see some behind the scenes snippets from other HP movies, including a screen test and with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson reading the script together prior to filming Sorcerer's Stone.OK, now on to my review of this film. Let me start right off the bat by saying this is my very first film review and I have read none of the HP books (gasp!). This review has nothing to do with how well it relates to the book or what they left out, changed or ruined, regarding your favorite parts of the books. I'm going strictly from the perspective of Joe Average movie viewer.I thought Deathly Hallows Part 1 was pretty amazing and it made sense (to me anyway) and was consistent and fluid and kept me watching and very interested. I hoped Part 2 would keep that going and to a point, it does. It is very dark and gloomy and gritty, just like Part 1. I enjoyed the movie a lot but it suffers SO much from being rushed, especially the last half, during the height of the battle for Hogwarts. I get the impression the director made a checklist of things from the book or wherever of things that must be included in the movie, and jam every last one of them in there at any cost. The cost is that the film cuts from one checklist event to the next so fast that it becomes jumbled and almost seems like it's a string of random events edited together, with nothing emotionally meaningful to tie them all together. I think most of the key snapshots of events from the book are there in one form or another but in many cases there's no how or why, and that weakens the movie considerably. Without giving anything away, there were many times that I saw major characters dead and wonder if I missed something because there was no fight scene with many of them.I really don't know how this stands up to the book but it seems like the movie is missing major continuity/transition scenes that would at least keep the casual viewer from wondering what the heck is going on here, or how'd we get here, or how'd that happen? I only hope the DVD release has about an hour of footage added back in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Almost perfect.. an 8 but Alan Rickman gives it the ninth star..,"The last episode of the Harry Potter movies is by far the best of the eight. While it does not follow the book like one would have liked, that is understandable as different things work for different mediums. The best by far was the WONDERFUL WONDERFUL acting of Alan Rickman as Snape, he is such an underrated actor. I hope that the academy will acknowledge his amazing attribution to this work of art, there is no question that an Oscar nomination is worthy.The disappointment of the movie in my opinion was the lack of the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. Why change a good thing? the gorgeous prose that Rowling wrote would have played beautifully on screen, the beauty of the battle of words instead of the battle of weapons was a key point in the epitome of the whole series. But than again, you can never have everything you ask for ;) all in all, a major success!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"This, along with the first and previous, are the only decent ones in the most overrated film series of all time.",Harry Potter is by FAR the most overrated series ive ever watched. The fans do ruin it to a large extent but the films are also just predictable and boring. The last two did pleasantly surprise me though. The cheesy lines are replaced with actual humour and the action sequences are beautifully choreographed and fun to watch. The story line is deeper and darker than the rest of them (due to the change of director) which i believe is what this film series desperately needed. I will never understand why people love harry potter as much as they do but then again there are also people who believe the amazing spider-man 2 is good so apparently anything is possible now. Harry Potter on a whole is 4/10 but these last 2 are a solid 7/8-10 and David Yates saved these from plummeting to the ground.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Good versus evil a timeless battle,"Good vs. Evil , A Timeless BattleThe ""Harry Potter"" film series, adapted from J. K. Rowling's iconic novels, presents a captivating exploration of the classic theme of good versus evil. At its core, the series chronicles the struggle between the virtuous Harry Potter and the malevolent dark wizard, Voldemort. This dichotomy not only drives the plot but also imparts profound lessons about morality, choice, and the complexities of human nature.From the very beginning, the series establishes clear distinctions between good and evil. Harry, the orphaned boy who discovers his identity as a wizard, embodies the qualities of bravery, kindness, and loyalty. He is surrounded by friends-Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger-who complement his character with their own strengths. Their unwavering support represents the light in the dark world they inhabit. In contrast, Voldemort, with his thirst for power and immortality, personifies evil. His followers, the Death Eaters, share his ruthless ideology, creating a stark contrast to Harry and his friends' values.The films illustrate that good and evil are not merely inherent traits but are shaped by choices and circumstances. This theme is poignantly exemplified in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."" The return of Voldemort signals a shift in the wizarding world, forcing characters to confront their beliefs. The Triwizard Tournament serves as a backdrop for this moral exploration, as characters like Cedric Diggory and Barty Crouch Jr. Face choices that define their paths. Cedric's noble sacrifice for Harry highlights the essence of heroism, while Barty's betrayal illustrates the seductive nature of power and ambition. The contrasting choices made by these characters demonstrate that good and evil often exist within the same world, influenced by personal decisions and moral dilemmas.As the harry potter progresses, the complexity of good and evil becomes more pronounced. Characters like Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy embody the gray areas between these two extremes. Snape, initially portrayed as an antagonist, reveals layers of depth as his true motivations unfold. His love for Lily Potter, Harry's mother, drives his actions, showcasing that even those who appear evil can have redeeming qualities. Draco, too, grapples with the expectations of his family and the pressure to conform to Voldemort's ideology. His internal conflict invites audiences to consider the impact of upbringing and societal expectations on one's moral compass.The theme of choice is further emphasized in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."" Dumbledore's famous assertion, ""It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities,"" encapsulates
' moral foundation. This lesson is crucial, as it empowers viewers to recognize their agency in defining their character and values. Harry's refusal to succumb to Voldemort's darkness illustrates the importance of standing firm in one's beliefs, even when faced with overwhelming opposition.The climactic battle between good and evil reaches its zenith in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."" The final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort serves as a culmination of the series' themes. Harry's willingness to sacrifice himself for the greater good ultimately reveals the transformative power of love and selflessness. In stark contrast, Voldemort's fear of death drives him to commit atrocities, highlighting that the pursuit of power can lead to one's downfall. This poignant lesson resonates with audiences, emphasizing that true strength lies not in domination, but in compassion and connection.Therefore, the ""Harry Potter"" film series offers a rich tapestry woven with the timeless themes of good versus evil. Through the journey of Harry and his friends, viewers are reminded that morality is complex and multifaceted. The series teaches that choices define character, and that love, sacrifice, and friendship are powerful forces in the battle against darkness. As audiences witness the struggles and triumphs of these beloved characters, they are left with meaningful lessons about the importance of standing up for what is right, the complexity of human nature, and the enduring power of good in a world often shrouded in shadows. The legacy of ""Harry Potter"" endures, reminding us all that the fight between good and evil is not only a tale of fantasy, but a reflection of our own lives and choices.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Not quite the end I imagined,"The general idea is that you don't fix what ain't broken. Unfortunately that's what they seem to be trying here anyway. I was happy that the finale was split into two, seeing as 'Half Blood Prince' was such a disaster. But they did it unevenly and the bulk went into part one. So this part felt rather sparse and lackluster story wise. Still, what actually disappointed me was how they skipped and shuffled bits around trying to make it more impressive and in the process butchered everything I loved about 'Deathly Hallows'. The final battle for example. There were things I was really looking forward to watching on screen - small but significant scenes, characters rising up to the occasion, explanations, finally. Maybe because it's the finale, expectations are obviously sky high and on top of that I've always loved the books very much. But I get the feeling the people who made this movie don't really have much love for this universe. The acting is average, special effects alright, but nothing is impressive. It's not bad, but not very good either. At least not the end I was hoping for.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Review - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"The tagline for ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is ""It all ends."" That's right, the ending has finally come to the movie series that started ten years before this movie, the movie adaptation of the classic Harry Potter book series. Like Roger Ebert wrote in his review of this film, we have a big class reunion here, and a great, epic, dark, dramatic one, too. I remember when I first saw the (comparatively) light and innocent Sorcerer's Stone. I was nine years old at the time. Here I am, eighteen, and writing the review for the last film, which I saw on Wednesday. I watched over the years as the movies got progressively deeper, more emotional, more mature, and darker, to the level of darkness at which this film is (tone-wise, and light-wise, in certain scenes). The movie picks up where the last movie left off, and covers the last third of the seventh book. This movie continues with the excellent balance of action, suspense, mystery, character and story development, tone, emotion, etc., and excellent special effects, only it has even more action.When we last left off, Harry had left the Malfoy Manor, and Dobby had been killed. Now he continues his quest to hunt for the final horcruxes and kill Lord Voldemort once and for all. His quest eventually takes him back to Hogwarts for some epic action and showdown. The film, meanwhile, takes us on a roller coaster ride through thrills, excitements, excellent suspense, and dark magical fantasy, thoroughly entertaining throughout. Although the film is over two hours long, it doesn't fee that long – it seems to zip by relatively quickly. And the film ends well, not just for is film, but for the entire series as well. It was a very well handled, well wrapped-up, strong, and emotional ending, almost as strong as it was in the book.An epic final installment to a series such as Harry Potter, which requires such a finale, is hard to achieve, and requires a lot of hard work, talent, writing, effort, and thinking. David Yates handled it very well. Granted, it's not perfect and he could have done several things to make it even better, but he does very well nonetheless. Some of the acting could've been better, too, but it was alright, especially since the main actors have gradually improved their performances as the series progressed. I even enjoyed the musical score, composed by Alexandre Desplat, especially in the parts where he references back to the themes from John Williams' old score for the first three films. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is one of the better installments in the Harry Potter franchise. It all ends, and it ends well, very good ending to the series. Harry Potter goes out at full speed and with all wands blazing.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)For more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Best Of The Series, If Not Best Of The Year (So Far)","Well... where do i start? This Movie is flippin' awesome! If you've grown to love the series in full (Speaking film, not books) then you will love it with a dire passion, and praise it until the next big thing sweeps you up. If you recently liked the newer (And admittedly Darker) films, like 5 and on, then you'll appreciate this as a true nod to a series that has well earned its place in film history, and will be remembered. And If are just getting on board with all this and were taken up to see it strictly on its hype, then you'll be incredibly surprised at how well put together this movie is, especially since it's a freakin Harry Potter film.Acting: To be honest, was there ever any bad acting in any of them? Seriously they were all good enough to keep fans completely engulfed in the series for 10 straight years. It has gotten better since they were younger obviously, but they really put their acting chops on the line for this one. Bravo.Cinematography: Beautifully shot, it helped to capture the world J.K. Rowling meant for us to see. With all of it's landscapes, creatures, Magic, Fighting, Killing, Loving, More Killing, More Fighting, and over all an entire world... full of people getting killed (Seriously, for Harry Potter there was a hell of a lot of people dying).Music: For the first time since maybe the first one, the music truly struck me. It played perfect to the film, more so than it did in the previous films in my opinion. It seems that that iconic theme that we've all been hearing for 10 years now, has gone unappreciated in a way. I know that leaving this film, i will miss that little theme.Overall: Seriously if you can't tell, I loved this movie deeply. I see the Oscars in this films future, and one of them better be a nod for Best Film. It deserves it without question. I highly recommend it, it's not just a summer blockbuster, it's a true film that should be enjoyed, respected, and admired by everyone. 10/10 no doubt in my mind.-By the way; enjoy the good movies while you can, THE HIPSTER WAVE IS COMING, trust me, it'll be worse than the 80's...",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

A Magical Farewell,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" weaves a tapestry of tearful goodbyes, shocking deaths, and the bittersweet beauty of witnessing childhood friends blossom into adulthood. It's a deeply satisfying conclusion to the beloved film series, a decade after it first took flight with a young, orphaned Harry Potter.The film prioritizes emotional resonance over elaborate Quidditch matches, a welcome shift from previous installments. As Harry, Hermione, and Ron confront the harsh realities of war, the actors portraying them deliver powerful performances that resonate with the fans who have grown alongside them.Ralph Fiennes chills as the ever-menacing Lord Voldemort, while Alan Rickman elevates Severus Snape from antagonist to complex hero with a career-defining performance. The film doesn't shy away from loss and grief, portraying the emotional toll of war with sincerity.While a few scenes feel designed to promote the wider Wizarding World franchise, momentarily distracting from the core narrative, these are minor quibbles. The heavy use of greyscale can also be visually monotonous at times.However, these shortcomings are overshadowed by the film's strengths. The special effects are impressive, particularly the awe-inspiring albino dragon. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" reminds us that blockbusters can be both entertaining and heartfelt. It's a fitting conclusion to the saga, highly recommended especially for fans of the series.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Simply put, merely a continuation with only a couple of seconds from the end of part one - no voluminous credits, just the title and then right into the film.Relatively true to the book, as were most of the others.Not Oscar worthy like LOTR; but a really fine film, nonetheless.No great acting here, but the cinematography is great although it's a shame to see the destruction of Hogwart's, which leant so much magic to the earlier films.A nice touch at the end, 19 years later...",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Obviously, if you have many expectations about each and every thing and you have already the book, then you might be disappointed about a few points. All the remaining horcruxes have been destroyed in the movie (obviously all of us know this;harry potter series cannot end without that).

Harry Potter and a Scripting Shallow Part 2,"I'm taking no reserves by telling this film is awful. By far the worst film I've seen this year, and that wouldn't be if there hadn't been so much hype about it.Every critic and every website praise this film, however I can't begin to understand how can they praise such a poor production. An irregular, cyclic, inconsistent and plot-hole-filled script, a lousy direction incapable of maintaining an action sequence long enough to have a good time and an edition work to be embarrassed (with a tighter edition you could reduce both parts into a single film). If part 1 was bad, this one kicks the bucket big time!Acting doesn't improve too much, we still get all the wooden performances we're used to and the same plot line is filled with clichés and things we've seen over and over again. It's to admire the ability of J.K. Rowling to develop intriguing situations and by the same time her incapability to resolve them with wit and style.The action sequences just pass by, the plot line is pitiful, the final battle doesn't leave a mark and the epilogue is completely unnecessary.Maybe I'm insane, and maybe everyone will think I'm out of line by giving this film 1 star out of 10, but when you grow up admiring the greatest fantasy and sci-fi sagas ever made (either in the film or book industry) like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Dune, Blade Runner and the Neverending Story, you'll know Harry Potter just doesn't have enough to be in the same rank as them.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A confusing ending to an epic tale.,"ONE LINE REVIEW : A confusing ending to an epic tale.RATING : See it in theaters(Rating scale : ""See it in theaters"", ""Wait for the instant download"", ""Don't waste your time"")NO SPOILERSIn this final chapter to the Harry Potter series, Harry (Daniel Radcliff), Harmione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) must find the three Horcrux's and destroy them to prevent Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) from becoming immortal.The biggest problem with this film is that you must have read the book in order to understand what is going on. I haven't. I've seen all the films up to this point and I had a hard time knowing what was happening.The story starts out with Harry, Harmione, and Ron burying Dobby, the elf. They then interview a goblin who sort of fills us in on all the events leading up to this point. Then they interview a wand maker to tells us who is good and bad in this film. And we're off. Except we aren't. The trio then travel around the Potter Universe to try and find three Horcrux's (a term never explained but are magical items that link to Voldermort's immortality). As they find each one they destroy it.I am trying to write a review without exposing any of the plot points. But it's hard. Because to explain to you just what is wrong with this film I'd have to give away key elements.I believe that any film must stand on its own. You shouldn't have to have seen the previous film to understand it and you shouldn't have to have read the book. ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"" fails in both cases. The film meanders around the Potter Universe finding objects and destroying them. The biggest confusion on my part is why must they destroy all three of these ""Horcrux's""? If Voldermort needs all of them to ""regenerate"" then why not just destroy one? If he doesn't need all of them then why doesn't he regenerate with the one he already has?The ending is equally confusing and you'll see why when you see the film. But basically I don't understand what it is to die in the Potter Universe. Apparently it is optional.We are never let in on the details of what is necessary to kill Voldermort. And the wand he stole from Dumbeldor's grave has some very fluid rules as to who owns it at any particular time.""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" is everything I hate about fantasy fiction. There are no rules. The writer makes them up as they go along to serve whatever is necessary to extricate the hero from whatever corner the writer has painted him into. I have seen fantasy done well (Lord of the Rings, eg) and Harry Potter is not fantasy done well.Still the visual effects are stunning and you may never get another chance to see the movie on the big screen. That is why I recommend you ""See it in the Theater."" Not because it is a great story, but because (despite its many flaws) it is a treat for the eyes.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Emotional adieu to a great series,"I am writing this review not to recommend anyone to watch this flick. Because, I know all those who have been fans of Harry Potter will see the Grand farewell to this epic series, irrespective of the reviews. As my story with this Series goes, I remember I was 14 when I watched first Harry Potter film. I watched the first Harry Potter film after the second installment had been released 4- 5 months back.I watched first H.P film by accident. I was watching cable with something good to be viewed. I happened to bump into a flick with a small boy. Later on it is turned out in the movie that, this boy was special and gifted. Then I realized, that movie was Harry Potter's first installment. Soon after watching the first installment, I liked it so much that the very next day as I remember I rented the Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets and seen it.Since then my fascination for H.P films has been immense. I was waiting for this flick for a long time. This is my personal opinion that Harry potter films from 5th installment seemed, kind of stagnant( except for the Half blood prince)From the 5th part a new director had come with a new style. I think the first four flicks were better than the latter ones.I had great anticipation from the last 2 parts. But, I don't know why it fails to create that emotions as it should have generated. There are some very emotional scenes, but they are too hasty as though left incomplete. I didn't read the books as I thought it would kill interest in watching movies. I relied entirely on movies. But, as the first four films don't seem incomplete, the latter ones do seem( again half blood prince is exception.)I am not complaining about the movie. It has been directed greatly, but a lot of things are not explained even after making 2 parts of the last book, can cause confusions in minds of those who haven't read the book.A lot of things unravel in this films. Some misconceptions also are done away, with the main one with contempt turns into reverence. I don't want to drop any spoiler. This is kind of silly of me to say, but I always felt sad after watching new installment of H.P, as I knew we are one step closer to the end of Harry Potter. That's why this film becomes very emotional that we are not going to be able to see Harry, Ron, Hermione or any other H.P characters again.As Harry Potter franchise ended, there is a feeling of happiness with ambivalence of melancholy alongside. Surely, this film is a deluge of emotions throughout. There are instances of it throughout the movie. A lot of characters who died in this movie deserved more scenes, but only their dead bodies are shown. Here, I'd say at least their fights could have been shown. It becomes injustice to these characters, whom we saw in seven H.P films.Nevertheless, this is a great end to a mesmerizing tale of a boy who lived. I grew up watching this film and will never forget Harry Potter. The series might have been ended, but Harry will live in our hearts throughout our lives. And, we will never forget Harry Potter. I want to say 'Thank you' to J. K Rowling for giving us Harry Potter.I give 10/10 to Harry Potter and 9/10 to this flick and hope if Lord Voldemort could come back once again so that we could see Harry once again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Hero's Destiny,"In the darkened misty Forbidden Forest, Daniel Radcliffe as avatar Harry Potter reunites with the dearly fallen in his journey, in possession of the Resurrection Stone. Surrendering to his destiny, Harry asks, ""Does it hurt to die?"" His mother Lily Potter (gentle and strong Geraldine Somerville), who sacrificed her life to protect her son from the dark Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), tells her beloved son, ""We never left."" Neither did us, after 10 years and 8 movies. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" has remarkable gravitas boldly embracing mortality and destiny. Director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves poignantly complete the hero's journey in the eternal conflict of good and evil.Also coming full circle with J.K. Rowling's earlier books, ""Deathly Hallows 2"" is a return to the realm of wonder and possibility. At the narrative arc with Harry in spiritual transformation, his late mentor Dumbledore (powerfully calm Michael Gambon) reminds Harry to pity the living, and those without love. The resonance of ""Harry Potter"" is that the most powerful magic is love. And I have not read the Rowling's novels, only seen the movies. Alan Rickman as the seemingly duplicitous Severus Snape is awesome in the story's provocative twist. Harry had witnessed Snape murder Dumbledore, before assuming his post has Headmaster at Hogwarts. However, much like life: All is not what it seems. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is the timeless tale of love, honor, and redemption.The ""Harry Potter"" movies strong suit has always been the supporting cast, and ""Deathly Hallows 2"" is the culmination. Ralph Fiennes is the visceral commanding dark force, yet nuanced in his malevolence. His performance forges the rage and inner power in Daniel Radcliffe's evolution of Harry. Radcliffe has matured into a strong actor. Harry's journey has always been about rediscovering his true power, and reconciling his darkness and fear. Michael Gambon even in abbreviated presence brilliantly fosters the possibility of the man Harry will become. Alan Rickman as Snape virtually steals the show in an authentic display of courage and compassion all veiled in darkness. Emma Watson has grown into a compelling actor, who wields deceptive strength and presence as her Hermione has evolved into a young woman. With Rupert Grint it is difficult to distinguish, whether he is really doing anything special or that he is so present as Ron Weasley.""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is leveled with high spirited action and vibrantly paced, as opposed to the deathly slow pacing of Part 1. There is the spectacular siege of Hogwarts by Voldermort and his minions. Yates creates amazing catharsis as Harry confronts his fate as he takes on the Dark Lord, ""Let's finish this the way we started it."" Harry, Hermione, and Ron must destroy all the Horcruxes that possess vestiges of Voldermort's soul, the leverage point of his immortality. But Voldermort must kill Harry Potter before he can become the Master of Death. Here destiny and conspiracy blur. The profound battle of good and evil and the possession of Harry's very soul are left in the powerful and convincing performances of Fiennes, Rickman and Gambon. Like Harry's Mother reminds, ""Harry, you are so loved"" We were always for Harry, and will always be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Harry Potter is Harry Potter,"Review Score 8.5/10 – You've seen it, you love it, you won't stop now. Lacks some of the magic of previous films, but it's the conclusion so go see it.HPDHP2 (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2) is well you know, it's the final Harry Potter film. It picks up where the last one left off, Voldemort has three horcruxes left and Harry, Ron, and Hermione are out to destroy them. The film wastes no time recouping anything except the fact that Voldemort just retrieved the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's Grave. The film largely rests on the final act of the Deathly Hallows, namely the Battle of Hogwarts.The film has probably the most pure action sequences in these films since ever. If the group isn't fighting or fleeing they're probably just licking their wounds for the next scene. Dialogue is sparse, and explanations are momentary distractions from all the different colored lights running around. And the action is great, its some of the best in any action film, but then again that's what action films are supposed to be about.But this film has perhaps more negative things that can be said than previous Harry Potter films. All the gooey stuff is over, all the characters have been set on their paths and the film isn't about to remind you what path they've chosen. There is no struggle within the group of friends, how to destroy horcruxes is known, what the deathly hallows are is known, and above all, what's going to happen is known. The film does not spend even one full scene talking about what its doing or where its going, there's action to be filmed.This is particularly disappointing, because I felt that HPDHP1 was one of the greatest Harry Potter films, but that film remembered one thing that HPDHP2 doesn't remember and that's that among its frenzied and confused action it knew how to slow down and allow for character to bleed out. In this movie Hermione and Ron get hardly any lines. Story is completely side-boarded except for the most climactic part of the film, which is about half an hour before the end of the story. Explanation is so sparse, that unless one were to read the books they'd not know why particular actions were taken and this can mostly be blamed on the fact that someone decided to cut down on the sentimentality and explanation.BUT I save my rant for more personal moments because despite a few issues that dig at me, HPDHP2 is one of the best action films I've seen recently, and it's the end of a series that everyone has loved, either as books, as films, or as both, and whether or not this is a success should not be measured based one less that shiny part. Therefore I say this movie has something for everyone to love, but it is a movie, and its never felt more like a movie than this one and that is a negative thing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Epic Conclusion We Were All Waiting For,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a thrilling and emotional conclusion to the beloved franchise that fans have been waiting for. This final chapter in the series is action-packed and wraps up the story in a satisfying way.The movie picks up where Part 1 left off, with Harry, Ron, and Hermione continuing their search for the remaining Horcruxes. They are determined to destroy them all in order to defeat Voldemort once and for all. The film is filled with intense battle scenes, as the trio and their friends at Hogwarts prepare for the ultimate showdown.The acting in this film is superb, with Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint giving powerful performances as Harry, Hermione, and Ron respectively. The supporting cast is also exceptional, with Alan Rickman delivering a standout performance as Severus Snape, and Ralph Fiennes portraying a menacing and chilling Voldemort.The special effects in this film are top-notch, with stunning visuals that transport the audience into the magical world of Hogwarts. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, creating an immersive experience for viewers.One of the highlights of this film is the emotional depth that it explores. The relationships between the characters are tested and pushed to their limits, leading to heart-wrenching moments that will have viewers reaching for the tissues. The theme of sacrifice is also explored in a meaningful way, as the characters must make difficult choices in order to save the ones they love.While the film does an excellent job of wrapping up the series, there are a few moments that feel rushed or incomplete. Some characters and plot points are not given the time or attention they deserve, leaving a sense of missed opportunities.Overall, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a satisfying conclusion to a beloved series. The emotional depth, expertly crafted action sequences, and outstanding performances make it a must-see for fans of the franchise. It may not be perfect, but it is a fitting end to the magical journey that has captivated audiences for over a decade.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Eh....,"I will start by saying that I really enjoyed the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. I thought, for me, it was the best of the Harry Potter films. Part 2 isn't a horrible movie, it actually starts out with some really well shot scenes. Nice pacing and a serious tone to what's being set up.I must say though that by the end of the film I felt very unsatisfied. I was told that the film was full of action and little else, but its almost like they decided to not put any heart or emotion into the film, while at the same time not really having all that much action in it either.I was very very unhappy with how they portrayed the ending. Weak. It strayed from the book a good bit......and not for the better. I also found it quite odd with what they chose to spend lots of time on and what they decided to cut very short.The series is now over and it is what it is. I just wish they could have nailed the last piece.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

It's not a bad movie by all means, but I might have expected better from it, or there is a possibility I wasn't in a good mood to watch it, lol. Either way, it was full of action, but they may have skipped explaining a few things to rush it to the end. I would say the ending was fair and a good closing to this great series.I never read the books and probably will never do, nevertheless no one can deny the Harry Potter series was part of many of our childhood and many of us probably imagined ourselves holding a wand and doing magical spells and wishing to be in their world :)

The Nostalgia of my childhood,"I know I am very late to the party and I am disappointed with myself that it took me so much time to finish them all. Watched the first 3 when I was 8 years old, loved, always stayed with me.But never watched the rest, just strayed away.Yet when I finally watched it, I did not believe why I waited so late to finish it all. Personally one of my favorites there ever will be, not many or hardly any will ever top this is special genre.I loved the trio dynamic of 3 friends, I loved the friend relationship between Harry and Hermione, just was far better then romantically one, all 3 had one of best on screen chemistry and dynamics.Some special characters deserve shout out, Severus Snape was the highlight along with Voldemort, Dumbledore and many others.The story spanning over 8 films was just great for me and finale was just as good, the setting, cinematic, atmosphere were also breathtaking.All in All one of greatest film series to be ever produced.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The epic ending!,"Finally, a long-anticipated final chapter of the Harry Porter series and yes, it's good. An epic ending.Harry Porter 7, Part 2 is kind of an adventurous ride, started with daring venture, then came the series of startling discoveries, and end with an epic fight. It's intriguing, tense, full of emotions, and it's fun. Unlike other blockbuster, high budget movies where a large sum of money is spent on stunning visuals but not on the character development or storyline, Harry Porter 7 excels in both – spectacular views with outstanding plot. It's an understatement if one says the movie's success is all due to the fame of J. K. Rowlings' novel. No it's not. In fact, they did a bit of modification to the original story, and it turns out even better than the original story, in my opinion. And don't forget to mention the pacing, the music, the settings, everything in the movie is brilliant. It really gives you the feelings of a dark, frightful atmosphereThe whole casts are good, and Alan Rickman's performance of Snape is excellent. Besides acting, voice of characters are superb, from the mumbling of Snape to the shady intimidating sound of You-Know-Who. And my quirky lovely Helena Bonham Carter, i adores her in her role of Bellatrix. Personal favor, though.The only setback is you need to go back either Part 1 or to the book, to fully appreciate Part 2. Personally, this Part 2 makes me want to go watch the whole series from the beginnings. It's well worth it.For more reviews, please visit: http://voicemotion.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is absolutely breathtaking! David Yates has been a favorable director for these films, and he really showcased his talents here. He crafted so many gorgeous shots, with a couple new creative tricks, while Mark Day's editing was absolutely seamless, really knitting the scenes together beautifully.David Yates let Part 1 take all the set up hits, and completely focused on making this a high octane, blast of fun! Yates does an amazing job of bringing all of the former events and foreshadowing together, to create countless amazing moments! There were so many twists and turns, keeping the narrative fresh, while moving at such a brisk pace with great momentum. Yates does a fantastic job of setting up this really dark and dreary tone, backed up by the amazing cinematography, and a great score, while really balancing the emotional keys well with the dark tone.It has been a great honor and pleasure to have seen all of these characters grow and mature, over the seventeen years of the saga - it's truly sad to say that it's over. Yates does an amazing job of bringing in all of the characters from the past films, and balancing them super well within the narrative. There were just countless great character moments, displaying their true talents in their own way. After all this time, you can really feel and understand the characters motives and feelings, because everyone is fleshed out so nicely, having great chemisty across the board.As a finale should be, the magic and action sequences were off the charts! It was by far the best showing of their magical abilities, having so many intriguing sequences! The amount of stakes that were set was amazing, having constant tention throughout the entire narrative.Overall, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, is phenomenal! It is by far the most entertaining film of the saga, and arguably the best; I just can't put it over The Prisoner of Azkaban!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Extra-ordinary work of character development, relations and creativity. Extra-ordinary work of humour , fantasy and imagination. The power of mankind in terms of how different could it be from other creatures in expansion of such beautiful art-works was observable within this book. Oh, Should I write about the Movie here?

magical,"The conclusion to the series hits some of the strongest emotional beats, mainly due to our long-standing connection with the characters, and provides some grand visual treats in the form of extended magical battles. While 'Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)' may be the biggest in scale and it is entertaining, it does feel lacking in depth - since some things are left oddly unexplained - and instead comes across as an extended third act for its duration. It actually plays out like one long climax, with little of the build-up required to further invest the audience, but at least it's well paced and doesn't hang about.

The world is sadder without Harry Potter,"I'm a 90s kid. I LITERALLY grew up reading, watching and absolutely LOVING the Harry Potter franchise films. I saw the first HP movie on its premiere when i was only 9, and having not read the books before, I was absolutely blown away with HP (I used to diss it but from this point, I was the biggest fan). As I grew up, so did the HP cast and I felt very emotionally attached to them as I kept on loving their movies. I was disappointed with films 5 - 7.5 and I really thought that David Yates had ruined the movies. However I was wrong as shown in this movie. Words aren't enough to describe this movie to the majority of teens around the world who grew up watching HP movies (like me). This is the first time I've literally burst out crying like mad in the cinemas. The Prince's Tale absolutely brought me to great big tears and My Previous fave HP movie (azkabhan) was overly topped by this one. In fact, I think this is my ALL TIME FAVE MOVIE. In my opinion, the Oscars have been ignoring the HP franchise way too much. This movie DESERVES TO WIN BEST PICTURE AT THE Oscars. Most 90s kids internationally admit that this franchise has kept them laughing and entertained throughout their teenage years and a franchise other than HP has never been beloved and gave so much happiness to a generation globally. I not only cried at the absolute tear breaking moving emotions displayed through mind blowing acting my Dan Radcliffe (His acting has improved enormously through out the movies, but his acting in this one was Oscar WORTHY for BEST ACTOR full stop), but the terrible fact that with HP over, I feel that my childhood is over (it really is)and since I am so emotionally attached to HP characters, I couldn't easily let them go. With HP ended, I feel my youth is ending and it is. HP kept my teenage years with something to look forward to in the cinemas through 10 years, and no other franchise in the world has achieved that. HP is the BEST and most beloved franchise in the world to the 90s kids and it won't change because HP not only represents the height of entertainment in our era, but it represents our youth and joyful memories of our school days. I am still very sad that HP is over, more than anyone. I've read all the books, watched all the movies, but I have to say, this movie is the best of all, the perfect finish to a perfect franchise. And whatever other overrated franchises like twilight may be a better representation of their youth to the minority, the majority of 90s kids around the world will always pick HP as their all time favorite franchise ever. It will go down in history not only with success in numbers but in the hearts of 90s kids and other youth of this era. I would be very disappointed if Daniel Radcliffe who is obviously a very talented and hard working professional actor does not win Best actor at the Oscars, because I've never seen an actor at his age display a character with such ground breaking emotion and reality. I would be more disappointed if this movie does not win Best Picture at the Oscars, because this movie is not just a movie, but a form of happiness that have kept the youth of our era entertained for a decade and that is something that is not likely to be achieved even in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Yates : a total dissapointment,"Since david Yates took over the franachise it went downhill fast .The dialog became. Much lees important , or changed drasticly and the action became much more importand .Everything was rushed and the emotional scenes en important info for the story and for the relations between the characters was damaged because of it .Mr Yates made a big mistake , a mistake that is made more often in modern blockbusters .And that is that Harry Potter is not a story about wizards witches elves magic
and wands , but a story about courage , sacrifice , friendship and the fight between good and evil.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"The End of a Saga, The End of It all","A great film, I love the Harry Potter films, all sparking there own magic and telling fantastic stories. Some are Travel Hp 5 and 7 Respectfuly and the others containing a sense of magic, and family dynamics, Hp 1 and 2. And Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire having action as it's main aim, Hp 6 being Dramatic and dark. But the increadible arc ends when we are hit with the 8th Installment of the franchise, that embarks on a greater adventure like no other. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, Ends the run of films well.Neville Longbottom was always the most awkward one out of the friend group, and he was always embarrassed on a weekly basis. However, that all changes in this film. He's tougher and certainly more braver. This is perfect growth as he was always the shell, now he's finally concured any on going fears, and decides to help the gang defeat the one we do not speak his name. It's great to see him taking on a fierce roll, it shows he's changed as a character. And that's sometimes Vital.I love the scenes when Harry Is talking to Dumbledore and the importance of Dumbledore throughout the series. As he was such a key character in the franchise so even though he had previously passed away, I like seeing him again, and being the guidance for Harry, Much like in the Chamber of Secrets. It works here too, because we know what Dumbledore means to Harry, Goblet of Fire didn't quite get that right, but we atleast got to see the importance of him, and why he was a key figure in the series as a whole.It feels like a true Finale as well, as everyone gets to join in on the madness, and even destroy the villains themselves. It highlights the importance of each character and why they are in this film in particular, Like Ron's, Ginnys, Fred and George's mum is annoyed with Bellatrix is nasty comment towards her own daughter, so she becomes strong and fierce and kills her. It's a great way of showing emotion and the characters importance to the series as a whole. Which is a great build up to what was happening before, Characters having more things to do, getting more involved in the plot, it works here.I like the fact that Ginny and Harry had kids, much like Ron and Hermione. They had kids, and at the end of the story they got shiped of to Hogwarts, as well as there parents who had gone previously. It's a great way to end on a cliffhanger and add a bit of mystery to the mix, it gells well with ending the franchise, and even starting a new legacy. And Part 8 does a fantastic job of this. The only real thing, was Harry and Ginnys relationship. As it was rather under-developed, with that said a great way to end the franchise. It went out on a high, a Finale done right.Would I recommend this film?,Yes, Fantastic. Especially if your a Potterhead, you'll love it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Lost the Charming Magic,"14 July 2011. When the special effects seem fake at times, when there is a scene later in the movie that appears to be a memory that is photographically superior to most of the rest of the movie in terms of sharp clarity, when the character development and evolution seems to have stalled, when characters die off screen losing the emotive intensity, when the high point of the movie, perhaps the one that really stands out comes towards the end of the movie where Harry Potter must face himself doesn't really flesh out completely and latter scenes seem to also give away the surprise, when the pieces and mystery seem patched together, it appears this last Harry Potter has grown up into adolescence when magic becomes only dreams and fairy tales, stuff that only young children believe in. It seems that Potter has outgrown the need for magic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A middling series ends on a low-point.,"I'll admit that I've never been big on the film series as a whole (only saying I even liked two of the installments), but after the major emotional improvement that was Deathly Hallows: Part I it just felt like they threw all of that way for Part II. They put 95% of the focus onto Harry and let all of the other characters fall by the wayside, so when major emotional peaks happened like the Hermoine and Ron kiss that had been building for eight entire films, it became this throwaway moment that had no significance. This happened a good dozen or so times throughout the film with moments that were supposed to be huge emotional payoffs and ended up just feeling like footnotes on ""The Harry Story"" for two hours.This is the only film in the series where I felt like they should have actually made it longer, since instead of dragging like some of the installments it felt like so much of it was incredibly rushed to get to Harry's big scenes (several of which did drag a lot). Several of the big moments felt incredibly cheesy, but the action scenes were pretty well done other than the pauses in the middle of them for poorly delivered one-liners. My favorite character in the book series ended up being someone I couldn't have cared less about in the films and his huge moment here gave me absolutely nothing. Overall, a large disappointment to end a very disappointing series.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

I had a marvelous time.,"Everyone returns, including the brother and dead sister of the beloved Professor Dumbledore, who live in an oil painting, and even the ghost of Dumbledore himself, played once again by Michael Gambon. Hogwarts is now in the malevolent hands of the sinister Severus Snape (hissing, sniveling Alan Rickman), who is holding students and staff hostage as they wait for Harry to rescue them. The walls and platforms that hold up Hogwarts crumble and collapse like Tinker Toys in a masterpiece of destruction, turning the school of magic into the world's most colossal rubbish heap. A humongous man-eating snake with fangs that strike the audience in 3-D almost devours Hermione, while Ron narrowly escapes a cauldron of flames on a broomstick. With Hogwarts gone and almost every member of the cast killed off by Voldemort, there could obviously never be another installment. But there's still time for tender-hearted Professor Minerva McGonagell (Maggie Smith) to save the day with a spell she's been waiting for years to try. There is even a flashback that explains the sinister role Snape played in Harry's life story that I found unexpectedly touching. The only thing left to do to bring this saga to a heart-stopping conclusion is for Harry to enter the forbidden forest of death like a true hero and face his destiny with Voldemort, played one last time by the hatchet-faced Ralph Fiennes, who actually shows his human side for the first time. Frankly, I'm sorry to see him go.None of it makes one lick of sense and a lot of the dialogue is pure jabberwocky, decipherable only by those who know the books by heart. This includes billions of rabid fans, so I don't think anyone is even slightly worried that a little formality like incoherence will affect the box office. The movie never wore out my patience like Part 1 did, because the awesome effects take over where the plot used to be, and although this is the end, my guess is that it will fire the imagination for years to come. What fun to feel like a kid again. I had a marvelous time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
David Yates Conjures A Magnificent End to A Renowned Book/Film Series,"Since 2001, I've watched every Harry Potter film ever made. Now here's something that can be difficult to put in proper words. I'm just... in complete shock and have to say that it's an astounding and compelling end to a famous franchise!The top film critics were absolutely right about it all. The series started off as a lighthearted piece where we got to know the young cast, but as the movies progressed further into a darker tone (with ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" director Alfonso Cuaron starting it there), we see this cast growing up before our eyes, delivering such wonderful performances. It was certainly not overacting, director David Yates turned it all around with such finesse ever since he took control of 2007's ""Order of the Phoenix.""The final duel of Harry Potter vs. Lord Voldemort has finally arrived and I was at the edge of my seat anxiously waiting to see the end result (I could literally hear some people gasping, slowly cheering, and even a small handful of them tearing up).I've read the original book of ""Deathly Hallows"" and there were quite a few changes that occurred in the movie (though I won't say what those are). Point here is, it's very intricate to interpret this particular book into film, but at least this adaptation kept as closely as it can to the original. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have permanently solidified their careers, thanks to the franchise that has shaped them as we see today!With great robustness in the story both in triumph and tragedy, author JK Rowling certainly brought us to our knees begging to see more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Best Potter movie!!!,"Every now and then there comes a great movie that can't be explained without spoiling the events. This is one of them. Especially since this movie is the last one, closing the story of our four-eyed magician once and for all (maybe). How can I describe this movie without actually spoiling the content? (!!!) Well, I can't. I mean of course I can, but that would ruin the whole movie for you, and even though my heart is begging me to spoil everything, I want you to experience it for yourselves. I want you to feel the same way I did when I walked out of that cinema. And if you haven't read the book, do not worry since this is actually a great interpretation of the book unlike most of the previous movies (even though some minor things were off). I will give Harry Potter and the deathly hallows a perfect ten, and this based mainly on the flow of the movie. I loved the action, I loved the drama and I LOVED it all put together. But I will also give it perfect ten because of the way it made me feel. It made me feel sad on the sad moments, it made me feel happy on the happy parts, and it made my day at the end of the movie. Right now I only feel saddened because it is all over. But talk about going out with a bang!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
My favourite movie,There is just something special with these movies. I grew up with the harry potter films and i just never stopped watching. I dont know if i am biased because of nostalgia from this movie but this is a clear 10/10 in my head. 7 movies build up the story of this one movie. And it did not dissapoint. When you are watching harry potter you are not just watching a movie. You are watching people grow up. In about 20 hours you can witness actors growing from the age of 11/12 to 20+ its just a cinematic masterpeice.

Deadly,"What a way to end this amazing franchise, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 is everything I wanted from a conclusion to such a big franchise, and this film did it perfectly, I'm a sucker for a good conclusion and this film is the definition of a good conclusion.It wrapped everything up perfectly, with some of the best writing I've seen in the films, it's the movie where everyone is at their absolute best, Daniel Radcliffe is the best he's ever been in this role and Alan Rickman is also the best he's been as Snape, the film has a stunning and beautifully emotional ending with one of the most well done fake outs of all time, incredible characterization was given to every character, including Neville, the action is stunning, the music is phenomenal, and it has a stunning and epic finale.Accompanied by some of the most well used flashbacks I've seen in a film and some of the most disturbing CGI images I've seen in a long time, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 was the perfect conclusion to this amazing franchise, and I honestly don't think they could've done it better.I'm gonna give Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 an A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"For those who are Harry Potter Book fans, don't watch it...","I am just coming after watching the movie and my review: it was too fast and had many loopholes(though the ones who did not read the books will love it). I have read the books many times, especially Prisoner of Azkaban and Deathly Hallows which happen to be my favorite in the series.If you loved the books very much, you will not feel the same emotions or the same thrill or the same satisfaction that one gets after reading the Book. The fighting scenes are not shown in great detail. The robbery scene is also very lame. It seems that the screenwriter and the director both loved being hasty. The movie was too quick, so quick that there was no time for the audience to react during the emotional or the shocking scenes. Instead of an adaptation this movie seemed like ""Robbing"" the story of the book. But it could not rob it's soul. I did not even feel like the saga had ""Ended"".But being a great lover of movies I keep the movies and books apart. Ignoring the books, I will give the movie an honest 8. The movie is enjoyable and emotional and shocking only if you keep the book apart or if you have never read it. This is a live example of how books can be better than movies almost every time. I did have a lot of experience of it. However the third installment and the Lord of the Rings trilogy are exceptional cases. So, otherwise, the movie is great.Well what more can I say? You read the summary, that's enough...",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
What My Childhood Died For,"I remember when I was five years old. I remember my mother reading Harry Potter to me, the way her hands turned the pages, the way she placed her bookmark in the book when she thought I had fallen asleep. I remember wanting to be Harry Potter. I was Harry Potter twice for Halloween, as a matter of fact, wandless and only armed with jack-o-lantern shaped box for keeping candy. And now, almost at age 18, I have created a new memory of my own, that of sitting next to my mother, and now my brother, in a dark theater, sobbing together at the thought that it really is the end of my favorite series, Harry Potter.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is the near-perfect finale to one of the most beloved series ever written. David Yates has created the first, and unfortunately only, classic of the Harry Potter film series in a spectacular and emotional thrill ride. Dark, brooding, and downright suspenseful, Harry Potter ends with an enormous bang, one whose reverberations will be felt for years to come.The bang that this movie creates only begins with its fine actors. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have matured into real adult actors now. Once cute and dopey, the trio has now become truly magical at their profession. Though it's a spectacle to watch the chemistry between our three leads, they're overshadowed by an impossibly large supporting cast. Maggie Smith returns to give a sweet performance. Ralph Fiennes reprises his role as Voldemort and totally creeps us out. The real star of the show is, however, Alan Rickman. Finally, Rickman emerges from the depths of the great sets and shows his true acting chops as Snape. He's just fantastic to watch.And the film is technically brilliant as well. The visual effects go heavy on the pyrotechnics, so why not throw in a little slow-motion while we're at it? And so David Yates does, but whereas most directors (other than Zack Snyder, that is) can't handle slow-motion, Yates does it perfectly. It's thrilling, and it's only aided by Eduardo Serra's cinematography. He's an expert at what he does: Serra loves playing with color, and it totally works in every way. Sometimes, the film is so drab looking that it almost becomes black-and-white. What Serra films is gorgeous. He's secured himself a nomination for Best Cinematography.The film isn't without its flaws however. Steve Kloves' script is lacking as usual, placing far too much emphasis on action and not enough on the characters themselves. Humor is used improperly to lighten the otherwise moody atmosphere. That said, the way Kloves writes action, and the way Yates directs it, is marvelous.While it can't help but feel as though there's a full half hour missing from the final cut, Yates and his team have made a brilliant film. I almost feel weird saying that a Harry Potter film is great. Mainstream films just shouldn't be this good, but thankfully, they still can be. Movie magic still does exist after all.Unfortunately, no matter how many times we see these characters when we watch the movies or read the books again, they'll never be fully resurrected. It's the first time that matters the most. After that, it's never the same. Everything ends, unfortunately, and so does the Harry Potter series. I have grown so much with Harry Potter, but it's finally time to lay it to rest. Goodbye, Harry and crew. You'll be sorely missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Quite good,"Some of the kiddies here were quite impressed by this film. Indeed, it is among the best of the series, but it is not a masterpiece of cinema. It is a competent adaptation of the novels into film. In fact, the last book was transformed into two films to milk the franchise as much as possible which therefore reduce the artistic accomplishments of these films.However, abstracting away from such issues and watching this film as a film it is very good. It is flawed in parts but in other ways it is very good and sometimes even powerful if you are invested into the characters from watching the previous films or reading the novels.However, doesn't watch this if you haven't watched the previous films or read the novels. It doesn't make sense that way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
It All Ends,"(Rating: 12A, 130 mins) Written by Zen Terrelonge of zentertainmentweekly.comStarring – Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Ralph Fiennes, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Matthew Lewis.What begun in the 90′s as books, bows out in the 21st Century with the films, which have made a dizzying four billion pounds - Harry Potter is unquestionably, one of the greatest modern legacies to have been forged.For a decade, the world has been watching the Harry Potter series brought to life and the young cast have grown from fresh-faced children to talented, young actors.After a wonderful 10 years, the finale that has had such a phenomenal following has landed.Tonight, in cinemas across the country, when the clock strikes midnight, fans will finally see the end of Potter Mania as we know it.The tagline we've heard for weeks upon weeks 'It All Ends' is finally upon us and it's the perfect close to the uber, perfect world.For anyone that has the audacity, to never have dabbled with Potter here's the nutshell version.Power obsessed wizard You-Know-Who (Voldemort, don't speak his name though, it's taboo) becomes the most feared sorcerer of all time.He kills Potter's parents and hundreds more in order to achieve greatness.Plan backfires, left powerless for a decade but regains power.Now this is the last stand between Good vs Evil.The film spares no time explaining the past and continues from Part I instantaneously.We resume with the survivors of Malfoy Manor and the hunt for Horcruxes steams along at full pelt, like the Hogwarts Express on mutated lumps of super-coal.New characters are introduced, old characters develop and you can always expect the unexpected. Trust me.The movie still receives token tweaks but they're immaterial, for it is as accurate as a film adaptation can be and for that I am over the moon!Duels, death, disaster and darkness all descend upon Hogwarts School of Witchraft and Wizardry and the school has never looked more visually excellent.Dare I even say, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts even looks manages to feel more inviting than ever?The bulk of the film takes place at the castle and as well it should, it's the biggest character of all – one that connects all children of the wand.With the heat on Harry (Radcliffe), Ron (Grint) and Hermione (Watson) to destroy the horcruxes and ol' snake features slithering along on their trail, its only a matter of time until they come head to head.The acting is on needle-sharp point with the cast pouring their heart and soul into the finale, you can see that in every word they utter.Radcliffe is Harry Potter; a true hero, selfless in the face of danger, a born leader, now a man ready to accept his destiny.Fiennes has made You-Know-Who, a most wonderful villain, he is absolutely ruthless and fascinating to see in action.Other outstanding performances come from veterans, Smith and Rickman as Professor's McGonagall and Snape – though only handed a limited screen presence, they command their time with grandeur.Interestingly, an unlikely contender for Harry's position of Gryffindor Legend is found in Neville Longbottom (Lewis), who is given the chance to do something apart from blunder.Though something wicked waits at every turn, the magic is absolutely beautiful and combined with a sensational orchestral soundtrack, these provide the monumental and dramatic send off the series has undeniably earned.If you're worried about less magic in your lives don't be. I believe if Universal Studios have any sense they'll be making a Gringotts Roller-coaster as we speak!This world has touched many people's lives for different reasons and in different ways, what will succeed it and if anything ever will hit such heights is anyones guess.I can't fault the film in anyway and I wouldn't want to, it's the best of the eight.Touching, emotional and thrilling, the Deathly Hallows is positively breathtaking in every way.I think it's only fair for us all to say a special thank you to J.K. Rowling, without her, our lives would all have a little less spark in them.And to Mr. Harry Potter – The Boy Who Lived!Magnificent 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Movie should have been longer and in 2D,"Plot: The film hinges on the final battle between death eaters and other wizards. Hogwarts is the center of all action. Death and destruction is no longer discussed in background. You literally see the beautiful castle, Hogsmeade and Gringotts being ripped apart and people die. Let me stop with that.Special Effects: The film has been shot in 3D and, as with its prequels, the final episode boots really good CGI. Apparations, flying broomsticks, dragons, giants, slithering snakes, magic - everything is thrown at the audience in the two hour running time of the movie. And its all so beautifully interwoven that you end up applauding their physics rather than cringe thinking about their improbability.Cast: The main stars need no introduction. I guess this series was blessed, for they managed to complete production of eight movies with almost the same cast as they began. So in order to review the casting I need to go back in time - I guess it is unnecessary. I do not think we are going to get a more fitting description of Harry or Ron or Hermione. The only gripe is that we get to see less of some favorite characters (like Hagrid for example).Performance: The lead characters have done good. Not just in this movie but the entire series. Kudos to the kids who dared to spend the most crucial years of their lives to entertain us (yeah they definitely got a handsome pay in return) and have been keen to learn from day one to get their acting skills honed. Of the others I would always rate Alan Rickman's portrayal of the complex character of Snape as a cut above the rest - it was like a character written in the book come alive. Evanna Lynch also cast her character (of Luna Lovegood) with charm. Helena Bonham Carter will forever be remembered as the sneering Bellatrix Lestrange.Read the full review at http://blog.nrajesh.com/review-deathly-hallows-2",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Just meh,"So before I'm judged to hate Harry Potter or not understand it, I've read all the books and seen all the movies, and apart from both the Deathly Hallows films, seen them all more than once. Now since the Goblet of Fire, the franchise has started to go a bit downhill. Number 5 and 6 were pretty bad in my opinion, and Deathly Hallows Part 1 was alright, nothing incredible.To finish off a series of films that has inspired the imagination of an entire generation, everything has to go perfect and for so many people this was just incredible but for me it, well it was just meh. It kept with the most recent dark themes that the later Potter films carried but to say this film is incredible or to give it a top 250 spot seems ridiculous to me. It feels like people just wanted it to be so incredible because this was the last one and we aren't going to see Daniel, Rupert and Emma fighting the dark lord again.So what did i think about what actually happened in this movie, well it didn't have much dialogue that you expect from a movie based on a book. It seemed that instead of trying to go so much on the themes of the book, they instead tried to make it one, rather long, non-exhilarating, attempt at being epic battle which just took away from the story and pushed the CGI based blockbuster aspect into the forefront.This isn't a terrible film, nor would i say that people who find it perfect are stupid or wrong, and i certainly wouldn't say don't see it, i mean there are some great aspects of it, mainly Neville who no doubt steals the show. In my opinion though it fell short on what the books and series would've wanted it to end, and there is NO WAY that it should be in the top 250, with a higher rating then Rocky, Truman Show, Drive, Let the Right One In and many other incredible films. 5/10 for me, but you should make up your own mind",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
If you thought this movie was a 10 you never read the book,"I am giving this movie a 1 out of 10 because so many morons on this website chose to give it a 10 out of 10.Were the special effects amazing? They dumped a couple hundred million into it so they better be.Were all of the familiar famous faces around? Of course they all got paid to mail this bullshit in.Was this the worst adaptation of a Harry Potter book to film to date? By far the worst, I didn't think they could mess up an ending when the perfect script had already been written but Hollywood managed it again!This film sucked for so many reasons I tried to list them all and the review length couldn't even contain them so I gave up even trying.If you read the 7th book and think that this movie was ANYTHING but a TRAVESTY you must be working for the movie industry.IMDb IS BROKEN giving a horrible greedy movie like this an 8.5 out of 10. I remember a time when I could come on here and rely on the raw score of a film and read reviews and actually trust the people who had written them to give me a decent unspoiled account of a movie and a recommendation on whether I should see it or not. Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic must be broken to because this movie SUCKED. It was the funniest epic i've ever seen for all the wrong reasons, overly violent in all the wrong places and underwhelming in all the places that mattered, dark when it should have been light and light when it should have been dark. Pretty much exactly how it shouldn't have been in almost every way imaginable.. Worst of all it got every single characters spotlight moment ABSOLUTELY WRONG. They have made some terrible adaptations out of the books to this point but this one takes the cake. Why would you change an ending everybody loved? Why would you take an epic battle and turn it into a cgi snooze fest. Why would you ruin every emotional moment in the finale of the most epic series of our generation by changing them in nonsensical ways. I cannot understand Hollywood or this broken website for that matter.Do yourself a favor and whack it instead of seeing this rubbish, you'll save $10 and have a far more satisfying conclusion.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Thanks for the decade of MAGIC, Harry!","Saving the BEST for last ... the final film of the Harry Potter saga (8 films over a ten year span!!!) is rather monumental in what it achieves.By far the most grown-up and mature of the films (which, after the last couple, IS saying something), HP and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has a high death toll (readers of the books won't be shocked by this) and the entire film is a fitting farewell to one of the world's most favorite literary and cinematic heroes of ALL time. *sniff sniff*Who'd have thought the tale(s) of the bespectacled boy wizard, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), and his two best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) -- first-conceived on a pub napkin! -- would have made for such gripping celluloid? The Deathly Hallows Part 2 has EVERYTHING wanted in a good film (action, drama, romance, suspense, good dialogue, chemistry, great characters, some hearty laughs and some stifled tears). This film -- as directed by David Yates (he has directed the final 4 Potter films) -- is a tribute to such a fine character (and ALL of the supporting players LARGE and small), a tribute to Ms. Rowling, and a tribute to the millions (billions?) of loyal Harry Potter fans the world over.In addition to our dependable trio, Deathly Hallows Part 2 gives ample (enough) screen time to several Potter supporting players. Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) FINALLY gets to shine/step-up like his three classmates; Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) gets a Yoda-Moment (awesome-ness!!!); Mrs. Weasley (Julie Walters) gets to deliver the book/film's BEST line of dialogue; the batty Bellatrix LeStrange (Helena Bonham Carter) vamps evil craziness as her master, Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), seethes hate. Ever-so-brief glimpses of Hogwarts classmates and professors (like Emma Thompson's Sybil Trelawney) is also pleasing to loyal fans of the previous films. The most notable new addition to the cast is Kelly MacDonald who -- as Helena Ravenclaw -- gives House Ravenclaw their most-important role in the entire film franchise (just-in-time, I'd say).It may sound dumb; but this final film is EPIC on several levels ... and that ""epic-ness"" is different for every viewer -- and that is one of the reasons Potter is so special (his/the film's ""connection"" is different for every fan). This franchise is no fantasy fluff ... it has graduated (with honors!) to classic cinema that will endure for all time.Seeing this cast grow-up in front of us has been both a marvel and a treat (with nary a Lohan-moment amongst them!!!); and it also makes many of the faceless deaths in the film more resounding as we realize most of them were mere children who's bravery and heroics cost them their lives as they stood-up for GOODNESS in a world wrought with evil (damn you, Voldemort!).There are moments in this film that make the audience feel proud of the heroics on screen and ALL of it makes us thankful. Thank you, Harry Potter ... thank you for forever. You've made magic happen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Well Done.,"Let's be honest, a certain amount of 'die hard fans' of the books were always going to come on here, knocking the film and being completely ridiculous, that's predictable enough. Ignore them, they're silly. It's a bloody wonderful movie, one I would be happy to watch again and again, and I LOVE the books. It's a different medium, there are differences! And people talking about Crabbe just 'disappearing', well, the actor was arrested for drug charges? So no Harry Potter for him. But it is brilliant. Yes, some things were rushed, yes, some things didn't quite happen as expected. But it would be boring to watch a film that's exactly the same as its book.

Hopefully, there will something equal to come along soon.As usual, the special effects and the Hogwarts castle set decoration are brilliant and very entertaining.

A befitting conclusion!,"So my 'Harry Potter' revisiting session has finally come to an end, and I must admit, the series concluded itself on an almost perfect note.

For instance, that Severus Snape backstory had me crying like a baby; the impact it had on me was unbelievable and that impact carried on quite successfully in the climactic portion, making the final showdown between Potter and Voldemort all the more significant and remarkable.P.

"Mostly good, but failed in some places","As a huge fan of the books, I was sad and excited to see the final movie in the series. Throughout most of the film I was quite pleased that the story was either well-represented or deviated in ways that helped to move the film along. The final scene with Snape in particular was extremely well-done.But I left with a bad taste in my mouth because two of the best scenes (the last two) were cut short in disappointing ways. The growth of Harry from the beginning to the end of the series is one of the great themes, and the book brilliantly displays that in the final two scenes. In the movie though, the dialogue that best captures his growth is almost entirely eliminated, leaving holes that to me were unacceptable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

I was kind of hoping Ron would die. Not that I have anything against Ron, I just thought he'd be an excellent choice. And the epilogue is so unnecessary. I hoped the film wouldn't include it. They lived happily ever after. We get it.

A captivating masterpeice.,"**Movie Review: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2***Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2*, the epic conclusion to the beloved Harry Potter series, delivers a spellbinding and emotionally charged finale that lives up to the high expectations of fans worldwide.The film picks up where its predecessor left off, with Harry, Ron, and Hermione on a mission to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes and defeat the Dark Lord once and for all. The plot is intricate and full of twists and turns, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. From the thrilling break-in at Gringotts to the epic battle at Hogwarts, the pacing is relentless, creating a sense of urgency that grips the viewers from start to finish.One of the film's strengths lies in its character development. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione face their final challenges, their growth as individuals and as friends is palpable. The emotional depth of the characters is expertly portrayed by the talented cast, especially Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, who have truly come into their own as actors over the course of the series. Alan Rickman's portrayal of Severus Snape is particularly noteworthy, adding layers of complexity to a character who has been shrouded in mystery until now.The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. The visual effects team has outdone themselves, bringing to life the magical world of Hogwarts with breathtaking spells, enchanted creatures, and epic duels. The Battle of Hogwarts, in particular, is a cinematic masterpiece, showcasing the full scale of the wizarding war and the bravery of the characters we have grown to love.In addition to the intense action, the film delves into the rich lore of the Harry Potter universe. The revelations about Snape's past, Dumbledore's plans, and the true nature of the Elder Wand add layers of depth to the story, providing satisfying answers to long-standing questions while introducing new mysteries to ponder.The emotional resonance of *Deathly Hallows - Part 2* cannot be overstated. The film explores themes of sacrifice, friendship, and the power of love, culminating in a deeply moving and satisfying conclusion. The sacrifices made by beloved characters are felt keenly, reminding us of the high stakes of the wizarding world's battle against evil.Finally, the film's epilogue, set nineteen years later, provides a poignant and heartwarming glimpse into the future of our favorite characters. Seeing Harry, Ron, Hermione, and their friends as parents, sending their own children off to Hogwarts, is a beautiful reminder of the enduring legacy of the series.In summary, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2* is a triumphant finale that captures the essence of J.

"The best Potter film to date, they surely saved the best for last.","I'm going to make this review as brief as possible. Deathly Hallows Part 2 was great. I went to see it last night at midnight, and i must say, i was blown away. I love music, especially musical scores in films; this movie had a GREAT musical score. The special effects were like nothing I've seen before in any of the Harry Potter films. The action sequences were fun and not too worn out,combined with the truly epic music, it made for some truly epic moments in the film. I have read every book and seen every film, so there were many moments where i found myself crying, and those tear-jerking moments nearly stole the film away, and might even have for other people. The final battle between Harry and Voldemort is insane, I found myself and many other on the edge of their seat as the showdown ensued, which only added another layer of epicness to the movie. There was stuff added and removed from the book version, but thats okay, to the common movie-goer who wants to see a Grade A summer film, they wont know the difference. David Yates did a great job directing and I wouldn't be surprised if this movie was Oscar nominated!Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 gets a 10/10 for its excellent action, epic music, mind blowing special effects, and some wonderful, tear jerking moments.

I really felt for this guy, and that he is Lily's soul-mate is beyond touching. It would have been nice to have had sentimental wraps for more characters like Hagrid, Buckbeak, even Draco, but HP7II is not about being sappy. I felt completely engaged, fulfilled, and even a bit exhausted after this excellent film. This experience has deep lessons to offer, and I'm on my way to check it out again now. Undoubtedly I will see this movie more in it's first-run theater showing, than any other film. Lifetime achievement Oscars for the whole lot, I say!

After watching for the third time 10 yrs after original I think #8 was a major let down,"After watching for the third time 10 yrs after original I think #8 was a major let down.I just finished rewatching the entire group of Potter movies... all over the past few days. And I realized, while most of the final movie was really good... after Voldemort was killed, I though the rest was a major major let down and totally anti-climactic. I've read all the opinions and reasons why online but nevertheless... it was a terrible ending. For such a fabulous group of movies, why in the world couldn't they have spent more time on the ending. I wanted to give it a 5 rating but because the other 90% of the movies were so great I didn't. Horrible ending. So much could have been made of the ending could have been made with another 15 minutes. I really am disgusted by it. It was like wow they spent ten years on the series but were in such a damn hurry at the end, like they were running out of time and had to wrap it up quickly. Yates and Rowling did a great job for 90% of the 8 movies but really screwed the ending. The ending in the book was much much much more satisfying and felt like a proper ending.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Review from a Non-Reader,"As a non-reader, I enjoyed the film. I have never read the books but have watched the other movies in the series. Compared to all of the previous, I believe that this was the best one out of all. It doesn't mean that it was fantastic but was a good solid movie.What I most enjoyed from the movie was the sense of dread, action, and depth of emotion exhibited by the characters; plus, it was believable. In my opinion, the other movies failed to reach this endeavor by instead focusing on pretty CG effects.The things that I didn't enjoy about it is first the virtual lack of musical score in the movie. I remember a few scenes but it was completely noticeable that you are left with ""dead air"" for most of the movie. I understand using this device to cause introspection and greater attention to what is happening; however, the whole movie attempted to utilize this, and by doing so, I believe it failed to achieve the aim. Secondly, the failure on explanation and exposition. It wasn't entirely clear what the characters were aiming to accomplish. The scenes appeared to be disjointed and didn't explain their motivations.Yet, It was an overall solid movie and I recommend it for others to see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Fail Part 2,"Awful, awful is the word that comes to mind. After the highly waste part one was and trying to find out how to destroy the horcrux this starts where the last one left off.Harry and co continue their quest in England to find the last few horcrux which is summed up quickly within the first half hour then to go and prepare for the final fight at hogwarts for next hour and a bit.At this point I thought why Hogwarts yes the final Horcrux is there but wouldn't Voldemort want to take this into a giant field not a school. The battle feels rushed and you can't see any of the action :(The story explains how Harry survived Voldemorts killing curse. The explanation flawed and shows how the story could pretty much end from the beginning (which would've ended this horrible story).The story feels like an RPG finding 7 objects to defeat the bad guy and to be honest I wanted Voldemort to triumph instead of seeing a sickly sweet epilogue showing that J.K Rowling can make another saga at Hogwarts if she wanted to make more money.All in all the end is a fail, for this to be considered good is poor stupidity and biased views. There are other movies that should be watched witch don't force you to watch the movie twice to get to end of their epic ending.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Ending scene,Harry Potter skipped a crucial scene at the end when Draco left with his parents. An alternate scene was meant to be given by the end of the movie when Draco was about to leave right before he does so the alternate scene shows him throwing his wand to harry before an epic battle between harry and Voldemort went down. We didn't get that scene so therefor this movie will never receive the 10 out of 10 it wants there are also multiple other scenes throughout the movies we never got that would've made the HP movie series a 10 out of 10 but you dug your own grave and here are the results.

The worst climax ever put to film,"OK so I'm a huge film fan and I've been on this Harry Potter ride for the last 11 years. Every film is just a piece of a grand puzzle that will all come to a triumphant conclusion. Well somebody forgot to tell everyone involved with the film. I have never been more let down by the end of anything ever. The main focus or my rage is to be focused on the 30 sec light show between Harry and Voldemort. Harry destroys all the Whorecruxes and finally faces off against the ultimate evil but now that his little trinkets are broken he's actually a pretty weak wizard. In fact Harry kills him in 2 seconds and he just melts away. We've been waiting for this battle for 11 years and all that happens is Harry's beam is stronger. No screaming, no yelling, no fight for their lives. Just 2 beams meeting and Harry's is better.You don't diminish the enemies power throughout the films. To build suspense you increase his power, making him nearly unstoppable at the end and somehow Harry must overcome the unsurmountable to succeed. Instead Voldemort is now weak and his super wand is busted. Splitting this movie into 2 parts was simply a tool to make another billion. They stretched out boring story telling for the last 4 hours of this series and they didn't even wrap up the characters. They just jump 19 years into the future and Harry Potter is just some guy with a wizard for a son. The most powerful wizards seem to all be pivotal parts of the wizard world but Harry is just some guy in a sweater vest.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

amazing series,the whole series was amazing i just like all the part and there is no reason to unlike it. there is no movie like this who just made magic to a another level and everything just beyond end is good everything is perfect that's it full entertainment and more then entertainment. however my favorite scene was from part 3 that time travel and harry and hermini travels to time to make things perfect that was my favorite scene in whole but i like it at all when you start watching first time first part you feel very amazing mostly when i see that pictures scene it just like real type gif files etc. but very real however maybe it can possible with technology not now not here but in future it will not all but some or more then some. the biggest story ever and and every part is interested that scene was quite funny when they are showing them selves after 19 year they are not looking old at all.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Book is 100 times better,The movie does not cover most of the important plots of other characters. The movie only only tells the story of harry Potter whereas the other character are far more interesting but the movie leaves their story out completely.It is not just this movie but the whole series was not made well. They have spent too much time trying to show harry's emotions instead of showing more about the magical world. Primarily the movie is shot for kids and not for mature adults unlike the books. The special effects are good but was highly disappointed by the story.

Even if this movie would be nothing without the other movies in the franchise it's definitely one of the best.I really like the shooting and directing of the movie as it is really well made and fits very well.

"In the long-awaited series finale, Harry Potter, played by Daniel Radcliffe, returns for the final battle of good versus evil.","In the long-awaited series finale, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 (2011), Harry Potter, played by Daniel Radcliffe, returns for the final battle of good versus evil. Also returning from Part 1 are the director, David Yates, and the screenwriter, Steve Kloves, for the completion of the Deathly Hallows, continuing where the story left off .With Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) obtaining the Elder Wand it would seem that he is more powerful than we have yet seen him. And, the race is on as Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), continue to search with Harry for each horcrux to destroy; in order to weaken and hopefully defeat Voldemort. The expertise, of these experienced film developers and in the actors who have completely absorbed their characters, surely shows in the enjoyment of the viewer. I can't imagine anyone not appreciating the value, of the entertainment, offered by this film.In keeping with the overall dark tone of the movie the color palette is limited. In the scenery dull days and darkness persist throughout the movie leading up to the final battle. Sepia tones exist in the telling of the age of buildings that we are to believe have stood for hundreds of years. Even in an opening scene, as the characters stand on a sunny beach, the tone is dark as the actors are shown large and in the forefront and in very dark clothing; they are overshadowing the brighter lit beach and water. The CGI graphics are blended seamlessly in the same color palette giving little away as to where they begin and end.Another important aspect, of the movie, that lends itself well to the tone and theme is in the sound effects and dialogue. The original score, as always, is impressive and assists the theme in every scene. Even in the quietest moments where there is very little background sound, like where you are to hear the dark Lord, Voldemort, as he clearly enunciates commands, the impact is one in tune with the dark theme of the movie. Another clearly effective portion, of sound, is in a battle scene where the sound is dulled and not everything that is going on in the background can be heard; one can imagine this is how a person in a raging battle would hear; from deafened tones.There are a lot of movie series that offer examples of good versus evil; like The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Star Wars Trilogy, and the Twilight series. This one, however, is made even more special by the span of time that it has impacted even younger generations and in the long run, several generations. Along with this being a well-loved series, the theme of good ""magic"" versus evil ""magic"" makes the journey more intriguing and fun. I have to say that I feel quite fortunate to have followed all of the books and the movies and the finale did not disappoint me. I believe that my viewing had an even greater impact on me for seeing this film in the IMAX 3D. I even attended it twice and have since purchases the DVD for my collection.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Harry ends Voldemort in Style.,A MUST WATCH. Total entertainer with ample doses of heart-filled excitement. The suspense created in the 1st half is acutely executed with a brilliant end. Harry Potter Series really ends in style. This is one is certainly the best of the lot. Honestly being a crazy fan can't think of any negative points to this one. Maybe since the last part the time-line could have been a little longer something about 2hrs 30mins. The last part surely made me emotional. Perhaps it would have been little better if the character of Severus Snape could be given in a little more detail and maybe the final duel could have been a little fearsome. But the nonetheless THE MOVIE IS BRILLIANT.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Simply The Best,"Far and away the best film of the series. Very emotional and moving - great action; tension; and a phenomenally well done ending. Very, very satisfying in spite of the melancholy of the fact that a movie series many fans have followed faithfully for the past 10 years.I was not a fan of the early movies but went to all of them anyways simply because my kids enjoyed them so much - they ostensibly grew up at similar ages as the Potter - and had read every book.The films have generally improved but there is no doubt this last film was great. Unlike the other films, part 2 of the deathly hallows was actually, in my view, better than the last half of the book. I found the action in the book difficult to follow and maintain coherency. Perhaps it is that fast paced and complex action is easier seen on the screen than penned on the page.Nevertheless, this is head and shoulders the best of all eight Potter films. It brings to a close what is, really, a very powerful cultural phenomena in western society.The themes of redemption; of imperfection of characters; of love; of justice; and self-sacrifice all play a part. I felt that Rowling had made the teen characters too foolishly flawed and emotional - far more than many are at that age. But this particular film - while not neglecting that feature - presented the characters in a stronger light. Especially Harry. Well done Daniel Radcliffe.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"To all Harry Potter's fan, Do not watch this movie","One year on since the movie was premiered and I can still taste the bitter pill the production team of Harry Potter 8 made me swallow and to believe I actually paid money for it.After the first installment of Deathly Hallows I said to myself You know what, that wasn't bad, not bad at all"" but that was more because it didn't disappoint me as much as the other 6 films.I have, as you guessed it, read all the books, back and forth, north to south and I loved them. And the climax that was book number 7. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that the book would be so good, but it was and is one my favorites.It almost got tarnished and burned with the death mark because of the eight film. Why is that movie so poor? Because the production team had in its mainstream view's and perhaps laziness given themselves no time to get a feel for the book and the wizarding world the author created. Scenes and venues changed, the proper way something happened was changed and often utterly deformed from its original setting. I will lose your attention by starting to talk about ""that did not happened like this in the book"" so I will end my bad review shortly.Do not watch this movie. Thank heavens we have the books. Get yourself cozy and read the book(s), and it doesn't care if you have already read them, re-read them, everything to get your interest away from this movie.ps.

The end at last....worth waiting for!,"The final movie in a franchise such as this does carry with it certain expectations. Everyone will want big visuals, satisfying story arcs and showdowns / comeuppance for particular heroes and villains.This movie does not disappoint on that front, with many of the characters being allowed their moments to shine. The siege of Hogwarts and the battle that follows is the best visual treat of the movie!Secrets are finally revealed and the meaning of the Deathly Hallows is explained which leads to a twist just before the battle we've all been waiting for, both the one between the good wizards and the death eaters, and the one between Voldemort and Potter.When it's all over, the ending was somewhat predictable in outcome, but it's the ending everyone wanted. Anything less would have left viewers unhappy with a bad taste in their mouths. However in that predictability it is satisfying, you just feel very happy and content with how it all ends up.With anything as beloved as the Harry Potter stories are, it's hard to expect the movies to match every single persons expectations, but it comes pretty close to what I'm assuming many people would have wanted.It's a shame it's all over, but it was an awesome ride!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
what an ending...,"i must first say that harry potter has not only spoken what goes on in the lives of witches and wizards of J.K.Rowling's world, but it has dazzled us with it's panache story line and mysterious plot that surely comes to wrap in this thrilling finale.we pick up right were we left of from part 1 of DEATHLY HALLOWS, as Voldermort takes the elder wand from Dumbledore's grave. the opening new scene,shows us that this is not a film to be taken lightly. and this is proved further by the Director's daring choice in camera-work, editing and general direction.out of all the harry potter films, this has to be the one where the entire cats, including supporting roles as well, give their all. each scene, even with no dialogue is breathtaking. the performances from Daniel, Emma and Rupert where to put it, SUPERB. not one moment did i find myself criticising their performances, because they were just that committed to making sure that this finale went off with a bang. for the first time, Rupert's comedic timing was just sport on, Daniel's panache and daring to show off harry potter was an achievement that many should be proud of, Emma pit forth Hermione in a way we have never seen Hermione before. this is all showing just how their performances were as convincing as i was when i first read harry potter and thought that this world was real. the supporting cast, Maggie smith, Matthew lewis, Ralph fiennes, Alan Rickman and so one make the most of the time they have on screen and let me tell you it is not in an way disappointing.however, the one person we must truly thank for bringing us an emotional precipice to the harry potter saga, is the director David YATES. There are just no words to describe how marvellous he directed this. each shot, each special visual effect, each movement has a purpose that serves the story and that can only be achieved if the director cares about what happening. he directs this with dignity and dare i say it, a daring sense of humour.i'm truly glad to call myself a harry potter fanatic, but for those who've yet to see or hear about potter, i urge you to go and see this movie, because trust me when i say, the movie doesn't not disappoint in giving us surprises and delivering the emotion of finishing such an iconic saga.i recommend this film to anyone who wants to be dazzled by fine film making, amazing make believe and all round phenomenal performances.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Great movie - ""cliff notes"" of the books","As a huge fan of the books, yes I loved this movie. I am giving it 10 stars as it was definitely full-filling as the end of the series - however I am looking at the last few movies as more of a ""cliff-notes"" version of the books.As another review noted, there were many details left out of the movie. One thing I was extremely disappointed in was the ""death scene"" of Fred Weasley. For those who may not have ever read the books, they would not have realized who it was for the scene was cut so short and there was no dialogue to it at all.The backstory of Dumbledore. I understand that to bring in the backstory and details that the books require, would make these movies 4 hours long each (and a lot of us, I'm sure would be happy with that!) - but the fact that the audience has no idea WHY Dumbledore was the owner of the elder wand or WHY his sister was killed and his brother hated him...it left so many un-answered questions for those who have not read the books.Snape's scene. I love Severus Snape, and think Alan Rickman did a BRILLIANT job portraying the character. I am actually very happy with how Snape's death scene and his ""memories scene"" went down. For the memories scene, they do leave out a few details, however the emotion you get from Snape and how much he truly loved Lilly Potter is so raw it's beautiful. We all know he loved Lilly Potter with every last breath (literally) and in turn loved/hated Harry. He hated Harry for being James' son but loved that he was a part of Lilly.All in all, as a potter-head, I am happy with this film. Definitely parts that were left out that should have been kept in the movie - but, again, I look at this more like a ""cliff-notes"" version of the books.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

None of us heard anything really deep that justifie the fact the Tom Riddle had a whole miserable life and no one was there to taught him how to control magic and about limits.

10 Out Of 10 - A Decade Of Harry Potter,"It seems these days, that we have come to we live in a world of cynicism and low expectations, punctuated by mediocrity and ignorance, a world whose only highlights are a mindless pursuit of fame and notoriety. In this seemingly bottomless void, stepped JK Rowling and Harry Potter, with and old-fashioned tale of loyalty, friendship, courage, self-sacrifice, love, care and the understanding that sometimes there are undertakings and noble pursuits greater than ourselves, actions worthy of a common goal, whose end result will benefit a cause worthier than our immediate selfish wants, namely the greater good (which is a recurring theme in the books and the movies). No matter what one might think about the whole Harry Potter phenomenon, one cannot deny the impressive and positive impact upon the world.I did not start out as a Harry Potter fan, my own life being too busy and hectic to allow me paying attention to what I saw as a fanciful children's tale. For the turnaround I credit, as strange as it might seem, Alfonso Cuaron. I was a fan of his previous movies, and I was drawn and curious by the fact that he should choose to work on the Harry Potter franchise. After I saw ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" everything changed. I was lucky enough to discover the world of Harry Potter through this master movie-maker's lens, and what a wonderful introduction it was! Subsequently I watched all the movies and became more and more impressed.You have to understand that I saw the movies first long before reading any of the novels. In time however, after all the books had been published I went back and saw each movie and read the corresponding novel. In hindsight I think, I was lucky to do it that way, since I had no pre-conceived notions or expectations.Now that I have seen the last movie and read the last novel, I can see it all stretch before my mind's eye, the wonderful complexity, the imagination, originality and great sense of wonder these works, both books and movies, contain and impart on all its fans, both readers and viewers.No, the movies are not perfect, far from it, they are at times quite uneven in vision, style, understanding of the material, but overall I think that they retained the essence and spirit of the books, and gave a wonderful visual rendition of Rowling's work. My favourites remain to this day ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""The Goblet Of Fire"".Alas, my thanks and appreciation go to JK Rowling whose brilliant mind gave us this gift, and to Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron, Mike Newell, David Yates, as well as Steven Klovis and David Heyman, the group of people who worked tirelessly in bringing to life, on the big screen, the universe of Harry Potter and his friends. I would be remiss not to also say a big thank you to Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint as well as the rest of the cast and crew of these movies who literally inhabited these characters and their world, and created such a believable and authentic version of them before our very eyes. Whatever they may choose to do with their lives, and whatever their lives might become, I wish all these people nothing but the best and good luck always. A nod also to Warner Bros. for their support and commitment to this whole project.It was a wonderful adventure and I'm privileged to have been part of it in my small way!""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 1+2"" 8 out 10 / ""Harry Potter""-the entire movie franchise 10 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Absolutely what a finale is supposed to be,"The movie is really an epic. It start on a high and never lets down. And since its so grand and fast, it does looses out on the parts where we have to slow down a bit and feel sorry for those who are dying between the epic battle scenes (most of the time they are important characters).I have particularly noticed that this movie shows ""You Know Who"" as pretty weak compared to the previous ones; I believe this is done only in the movie so that Daniel Radcliffe could be shown of equal match if not superior, to Ralph Fiennes, from the moment the movie starts, cause if it is done at the exact time this is needed, I don't think Daniel Radcliffe has the acting powers to pull it off. I always liked movies where villains are more stronger so this is kind of a set back.These are minor setbacks however, the movie makes up in terms of visuals, in 3D its a real treat. And don't worry about the story, this is the final chapter and this is more about concluding everything and giving you a good final showdown, the story was supposed to be Part I, this one is all about these are things you didn't know, this is how it ends, and in case of kids stories, ""and they lived happily ever after"", but Harry and Co. don't look much like kids anymore.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The perfect way to end it,"Yes indeed, it's all over. The eighth and final Harry Potter movie is perhaps the best of the entire lot, as it seamlessly mixes fantastic action with intricate exposition.

It's a textbook example of how to finish a film series.HP 7a begins right where the HP 7a left off, a departure from the other films (which dove almost right into a major action scene). I liked that, because even though the final book was split into two movies, for the sake of continuity it's best to think of them as one long, long movie. This continuity allowed us to remain in sync with the characters and their plight, rather than removing us from the action.Harry is still on the lookout for the remaining Horcruxes, objects into which Voldemort has placed portions of his soul. He, along with Ron and Hermione, have left Hogwarts, which is now under the ruthless rule of one Professor Snape, who may or may not have had something to do with the death of the last headmaster (Dumbledore). Snape may or may not be working for the Dark Lord; it's something that's been ambiguous for many movies now. Meanwhile, Voldemort is assembling his forces and, knowing the prophecy that says only he or Harry may live, seeks his enemy's demise.There are two major, long scenes in the movie: one involves a break in (and break out) of the goblin bank Gringotts, and the other is the epic Battle of Hogwarts. Both seem terrifyingly real, especially when viewed in IMAX 3D. I don't often go for the IMAX experience, or for 3D, but this was a good choice. Director Peter Yates made great use of the technology.I think the movie is fairly true to the book, with only some minor changes. For example, the character of Crabbe, one of Draco Malfoy's buddies, doesn't appear in the movie - because the actor who played him had had a drug conviction, thus necessitating a script change. But for the most part, things are as they were in the book.The most touching moments are the quiet, sometimes unexpected ones. There are many times during the movie when characters feel that they could die at any moment, so they say and do things believing there may not be time later on. The terrific cast - especially the younger actors - is compelling as always, believable not only as witches and wizard but as loving, feeling human being just like us.Of course, the biggest emotional moment takes place in the Forbidden Forest, an ethereal scene that brings back a lot of memories for Harry; it's somewhat reminiscent of the cave scene on Dagobah in The Empire Strikes Back, except that in this case the scene propels the plot and serves as an emotional counter to all the battling going on around it.There are no major flaws in this movie, and the minor ones are inconsequential. The film maintains its sense of urgency, seriousness, and dark attitude; you genuinely feel as if the fate of the world rests on this manchild with a lightning scar. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is a beautiful, elegant coda to a long-running series that began as a kids' movie and became more mature as it progressed, much like its youthful main cast.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"J.K's grand finale, Harry's final frontier.","J.K. Rowling must be a woman of overriding emotions. Beginning by scribbling in those coffee shops paid off into blockbuster magic. Harry Potter's final instalment is a fitting tribute to J.K's beautiful, eccentric imagination, pursuing the world of magic in a tone that replicates every living soul's beliefs of wizardry. The tone of the magic becoming dark and disconcerting was foreseeable as legend has it that there are those who experiment beyond a devilish level. Those desirable Potter fans that have travelled throughout the world of Hogwarts, having been given an illustrated ending full of emotion and power that encourage those devotees to support Harry and his compatriots on their route towards Voldermort's destruction.The characters have matured and materialised as have the actors, becoming older and more professional towards their dedication throughout their prolonged Potter endurance. One can only envisage the depth of sadness of the franchise reaching its climax. We have endured a figurative and wonderful relationship between Harry, Hermoine and Ron. They have characterised the film and developed Rowling's paperback into a picturesque reality as they visualised the potential of the series and knew cinema has never and will never experience cinema again like this. The sheer emotions of the actors during the premier exemplified the devotion and commitment to something that will live with them and characterise them for the rest of their careers. The question is whether the trio can reach the heights of the Harry Potter franchise in future projects.This final adventure encapsulates the nature of the relationship and feud between both Harry and Voldermort. Giving us a deepening explanation of the events that have unfolded in the previous seven outings. Voldermort's determination to siege power and defeat the brave Harry brings the pair closer than we have ever seen, giving us a true picture of how J.K. Rowling has attempted to encompass one of the greatest battles between two individual in cinema history.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
