Ya gotta have a sense of humor!,"When this film came out with all of the PR and things, I hated it. I hated it without even seeing it. Then, as with many movies, I caught this on Digital Cable TV, by accident. I had NO intention of seeing it, but once I did, I cannot tell you how much I loved it.This is the Farrley Brothers at their funniest. The idea is simple, a guy (Ben Stiller) who had a crush on a woman (Carmen Diaz) he knew since high school and continued to yearn for her privately, finally getting an opportunity to try to reconnect what never got going. This is something almost everyone can identify with.What makes this work...is its a dead-on hard hitting comedy.  The Farrley Brothers spared no one: male or female, handicapped or able bodied, black or white, rich or poor, job or not, straight or gay, animal or vegetable, blonde or brunette, educated or not. It is NOT a cinematic masterpiece so don't look for one, it is not a punch line comedy or slapstick comedy, it is sophomore humor done very well because you're going to be laughing at what you think you shouldn't no matter how much you want to say you would never laugh at something like that.Plus the Farrley Brothers added in ""some things"" that...well... may have just happened to you at some point in your adolecence, and put a comedic/gross quality to it that shocks you into laughing at it. All through the film you might laugh because you're thinking, ""Better them than me"".....even if it was you!Not for eveyone's taste, even those who think they know comedy, but this is that kinda comedy that is hard to do once you've reached maturity and forgotten what it was like to laugh at simple things. This is as simple as it gets. Don't put too much into it, it is what it is, and to me, it was really funny! Good Show!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny but crude.,"This is gross out comedy classic; Its aged relatively well as 20 years have passed now. Sometimes hilarious, sometimes crude and disgusting, maybe the very best movie from the Farrelly Brothers. Outstanding Matt Dillon in one of his best roles. The hair gel scene is infamous now as is the bathroom scene. Very funny and Cameron Diaz was so gorgeous in this. Classic stuff",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A real trend-setter.,"Whenver we refer to modern comedies I think we have to go all the way back to ""There's Something About Mary"" to see where this all started. It set the new standards for comedy and also became a much imitated movie. Movies however very rarely reached the level of this movie ever again, including all of the Farrelly brothers own later work.It's the sort of raunchy comedy, that makes some completely inappropriate jokes and makes for instance fun of both psychically and mentally handicapped people, among many other things. This is the foremost reason why some people can't really stand this movie but luckily most others are able to see the talent and effort that were put into making this movie and why the movie works out so well.As strange as it sounds, it's actually a real subtle done comedy. It's not predictable in any way and the build up and execution of it is spot on. It even makes all of the moments, that usually seem like something totally lame and forced, work out as something hilarious.It also has a great, yet very simple premise, of a bunch of guys all falling for the same girl. It's the sort of story that provides the movie with plenty of silly comical moments, in which the characters lie and constantly are backstabbing each other, all to get the girl in the end.Cameron Diaz forms the perfect centerpiece for this movie and the movie is filled with plenty of comical characters, all played by some capable genre actors. This movie is still from the time when it was cool to like Ben Stiller and yes, he also really is perfect in his role. But basically everyone is perfectly cast in this, which is obviously also a reason why the movie and all of its comedy works out so well.Comedies like this only seem to come once every 10 years, or so.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unconventional satire stays on course while delivering major laughs,"A lot of my friends said they hated this, but after i saw it and loved what I saw, it became apparent that many of these people hadn't seen it, they just KNEW they would hate it from the degradingly mysoginistic slapstick it supposedly represented.  Sorry, wrong movie.  This is a classic satire, replete with balladeer narrator.  The gags flow fast and funny and expertly walk the tightrope between politically incorrect and unkind.  This is surprisingly a movie that is very true to itself and its characters with a lot of plotlines that tie up nicely in unusual ways.  And, it's a feel-good movie too.  Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller are marvelous together in the leads.",,Anonymous,Romance
One of the funniest movies of the 90's.,"I desperately wish that the Farelly brothers would go back to doing gross-out comedies like they did with Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, Me, Myself, and Irene, and this. This is by far the best of all their movies. There are three kinds of comedy. Comedies that make you smile (Sixteen Candles), comedies that make you laugh (Airplane), and comedies that cause you to nearly asphyxiate yourself from laughing so hard. This is one of those rare third category movies. With the friends I watched it with, the laughs sounded like nuclear bombs going off in my room. It's that funny.Thirteen years ago, Ted (Ben Stiller) landed a prom date with the most popular and beautiful girl in school, Mary (Cameron Diaz). Unfortunately, the date wasn't meant to be, for Ted has his manhood damaged right in front of Mary, and ends up in the hospital instead of the prom.Thirteen years later, Ted decides to track Mary down, and have a second chance with his dream girl. He hires sleazy private eye, Pat (Matt Dillon)to find her for him. Pat finds her, and she's grown up beautiful. Pat decides he wants to date her. He stalks her, finds out everything she wants in a man, and poses as just that. Meanwhile, Ted has been led to believe that Mary has become fat white trash in a wheelchair. Pat and Mary start dating.Well, by the end of the movie, every man who is involved in the story has tried to make a move on Mary. We all know how it ends, but it's one funny ride. One thing about this movie that's commendable is how the mentally retarded character is treated. He is treated in a way that isn't rude, or offensive. Mary sticks up for him, and he's really innocent. The funniest gag in the movie involves a NEW brand of HAIR GEL (compliments of Ted, and tested by Mary). I won't tell you what's really being mistaken for hair gel, but when you find out, you'll laugh so hard, you gag. This movie knows what a comedy of this type should be like. Each gag goes somewhere, and is really big. They're usually extended scenes with punchlines. Me, Myself, and Irene goes for the cheapest laughs you can find, but There's Something About Mary takes it's time, carefully planning each gag, in order to make it gut-bustingly hilarious. That's just what this movie is. 10/10.It is rated R for Strong Comic Sexual Content, and Language. Sex: 8/10 Violence: 3/10 Swearing: 9/10 Drugs: 2/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
There's Something About Mary,"Insanely off the wall comedy from the Farrelly Brothers that delivers from start to finish. Wonderful early sequence with Keith David as Diaz's father busting heavily braced Stiller's chops. Stiller's zipper scene goes down as one of the funniest and most painful things I have ever witnessed on film. Diaz is divine the woman of Stiller's dreams...Dillon is hired to find Diaz...He falls in love with her and gives Stiller a bum story... Lee Evans, a pizza boy, is in love with her too... then Brett Favre comes into the picture.  Every scene has something memorable from Dillon's attempts at reviving a dog to Stiller's ""pre date entertainment."" A classic that doesn't take itself too seriously.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Funny, but surprisingly sweet too.","The shock comedy aside (zipper and hair gel scenes), purposeful unpolitically correct moments (humor at expense of handicapped, animal cruelty), the most surprising thing about this film is it has heart and is rather sweet.   It's not the completely nasty, cruel comedy you might have been expecting.  There's a nice love story in here too.  It's corny and cliche'd and doesn't feel overly cloying because there are enough shockingly funny moments to offset it.  The acting is good, the pacing brisk, and the jokes, well... you've heard all about the best ones by now.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Goofy, low brow humour- but it has something...","In the past I have not been a great fan of the Farrelly brothers films, however this film is an exception. The dog scenes were probably the funniest personally, but there were heaps of other scenes that are well worth a mention. Cameron Diaz was fantastic as Mary, the girl everyone is after and Ben Stiller was excellent. Matt Dillon was way too over the top- I know his role somewhat warranted it- but did he have to be so excessive? He seemed so irritating. There is no doubt that the humour in this film is of the lowest possible calibre, but it really works- think Dumb & Dumber, but only quite good. Despite all the comic situations in the film, there is still something undeniably sweet in the centre of the story, I think thats what made it work. Its certainly not top class entertainment, but its highly recommended for when you are in a stupid mood and need a good laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"There's something about Mary, and I agree.","The plot is nothing new: A guy trying to get the love of the one he admired. We all have seen something like this in the past, and we will see something like this in the future. But in this movie the plot isn't important.When you watch it you just know how it's gonna end, and so the focus is not on the plot but the actual happenings in the movie, and there's a lot. First, the movie is funny, with its many gags that just keeps on coming (a Farrelly Bros. tradition). They might not be in everyone's taste, but at least they aren't forced or out of place. Second, the people seem real enough to be in the situations they brought themselves into (kudos for the great acting, though it could be better). Third, Cameron Diaz is adorable, beautiful, and a marvel to look at. Plus, she got the job carrying the whole movie and she accomplished that ever so gracefully. You just can't help but fall in love with her too, along with every guy in the film.This is a very good romantic comedy by the Farrelly Bros.. Just like in ""Dumb and Dumber"" or ""King Pin"", the brothers have made a comedy that has just the right amount of everything. Excellent job!!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of those comedies where you groan or cringe as much as you laugh. But such laughs!!,"There's Something About Mary (1998)A goofy, mixed bag of a film, but with a few gut-ripping hilarious scenes that you can't miss. You have to like silly stuff. You have to put up with some padding here and there (I don't recommend the longer version unless you are already love the movie). And you have to turn a blind eye to political correctness (it has none, though not like Borat, which feeds off it, more just incidentally).Ben Stiller is great in his own way, lovable and dull at the same time, which is the idea. The other supporting male actors are comic regulars, and not my favorites, but they do what this kind of movie needs them to do. Even Bret Favre is as stiff on camera and as beefy as a quarterback is supposed to be.But there is, naturally, something about Cameron Diaz, that clicks with audiences--her cute, perky charm, most of all. That fact that all these guys like her for her looks is not the most enlightened approach to love, is it? But then, this isn't a high brow movie, or one with scruples in particular. It's a pretty clumsy movie, in many ways, just a series of gags that sometimes are just too funny for words. ""Sometimes"" being more often than a lot of other comedies.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
One Of The Funniest Films Ever Made,"I don`t like comedies but I do enjoy much of the Farrelly Brothers stuff and THERE`S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY is their greatest achievment which is probably down to their casting . Ben Stiller is perfect as Ted while Matt Dillon is absolutely outstanding as sleazy ( And boy do I mean sleazy ) private investigator Pat Healy . My only criticism is of Cameron Diaz who`s slightly bland , but she is attractive and that`s all that mattersI suppose how funny you`ll find this film is down to your own subjective opinion of what should or shouldn`t be made fun of . I`ll be honest and say that jokes featuring stalking , serial killers , semen , spiking doggie snacks with drugs and learning difficulties are all fair game ,and perhaps I`m being too honest in saying I laughed out loud at these serious subjects being made fun of ?Sorry if this review has been very short but I find it difficult to write hundreds of words about a film I love",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A love it or hate it movie........,"Thats the way the world is unfortunately. There are two types of people those who love movies like this beacuse they are very funny and those who don't because they have a manner which means they have to look for problems wherever they look (Read politicians, minority groups). There really is no need to go and see a movie like this if you want to come out and complain. You've seen their previous movies, don't buy a ticket. The deal with the Farrellys is that they understand that if something is funny then it should be laughed at. Someone falls over, laugh. Don't go and help him up. Mary has the ability to make the viewer laugh. More than once and more frequently than not. In my opinion that makes a comedy a good comedy. I truly believe that you stick any old actors into brilliant material and situations as are in mary then you will laugh. That being said though the ensemble really do pull together and play off each other to startling effect and even the Farrelly regulars have some great moments. Lee Evans in particular has broken America and looks to have a bright future ahead of him in film. Stiller is Stellar and Diaz a bombshell once more. Even Matt Dillon proves 'I can do comedy'.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just not funny and I'm not a prude,"With a stolen storyline, stilted acting, sophmoric unfunny gags(sophmoric CAN be funny if done right as in Jim Carey in Ace Ventura) this is a waste of film and only one of two movies in recent memory that I walked out on. The only redeeming value was Carme Diaz whose perkiness was totally wasted in this male fantasy. Like the ""Emperor's New Clothes"", this film, once hailed, did not lead to bold denunciations any critics. Even ""Kingpin"" was funny, but this fell totally flat.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
There's definitely something about this film that draws one to watch it,"There's definitely something about this film. When I saw this film, I was thinking of The Wedding Singer because both movies were set relatively the same time and both lead actresses happened to be blonde.I thought Ben Stiller played an excellent character in Ted as he tried locate the girl he had a crush on in high school. Cameron Diaz was superb in her role as Mary and the actor who played her brother was an excellent addition to the movie because he played his part as a disabled man really well. I'm not a real huge Matt Dillon fan and his role in this movie didn't do much to change my mind. He was very despicable as the sleazy private investigator who has the task of tracking the high school crush down; however, what he doesn't tell Ted when he does find her makes this film more interesting.Who would think that this film has twists that would blow the audience away; it does and not just one, it has two. These twists are really something of a shock, especially to me who was not expecting it to occur the way it did.Overall, this film was enjoyable I wouldn't mind seeing it a second time.",,Anonymous,Romance

"A second viewing was definitely better for me than the first, but I still don't exactly get its reputation","This Farrelly brothers comedy was a huge success, and I clearly remember knowing about it and seeing that famous cover image of Cameron Diaz in the role of Mary back in 1998, but I was too young for R-rated movies at the time. I finally saw ""There's Something About Mary"" for the first time early last year, and knowing how popular it was, I had pretty high expectations, but was REALLY let down! I thought it was easily the most overrated comedy I had ever seen, and didn't get why it had gotten so much praise! After that, I had no intention of watching it again. I just wrote a bad review of it and then moved on. However, I recently decided to give it another try, though I wasn't expecting it to be that much better than the first time. I think it turned out to be above average for me this time, which was more than I expected.In 1985, Ted is a high school student and has a crush on a popular girl named Mary. He gets a date to go to the prom with her, but unfortunately, after a terrible zipper accident at Mary's house, the date is cut short! Ted has to go to the hospital before he gets to go to the prom with his new girlfriend. Thirteen years later, he hasn't seen Mary since that ambulance took him away, but still can't get her off his mind. He is still in love with her, so he hires a private investigator named Pat Healy to find her and get information about her for him. Pat discovers that Mary is now an orthopedic surgeon living in Miami. She lives with her significantly older roommate, Magda, and a Border Terrier dog named Puffer. It turns out that Ted is in luck, as Mary is still single as well, but Pat finds himself falling in love with her. He lies to Ted about her so he can win her heart without any trouble, and it turns out Ted really shouldn't have hired this guy!Even during my second viewing, I was only finding occasional mildly amusing parts around the beginning. I didn't find Mary's mentally handicapped brother, Warren, being assaulted after being tricked into saying, ""Have you seen my wiener?"" very funny, and still didn't the second time, which was not surprising. I also still just didn't find Warren to be a very funny character. The first BIG laugh I found the second time was Mary's stepfather pulling Ted's leg at the door, and I remember finding that funny the first time as well. It's also funny when Ted is seen urinating through the window, but this leads to the genital/zipper accident, which I found more painful to watch than anything I had ever seen in a comedy before! I'm not sure exactly why, since I had previously seen male genital injuries in comedy, but maybe it's because the one here was longer than any I had seen before, and I found that it got increasingly uncomfortable up to the ""We've got a bleeder"" quote! The second time, I knew it was coming, so it wasn't nearly as bad, but it was still another part I didn't find very funny. After that, I found some good laughs occasionally during my second viewing, but was still finding the film boring for the most part and no more than average, even though I was definitely laughing more than I did the first time. Like the first time, I still thought the sex soliciting scene was pretty lame. Eventually, however, I found that the plot somehow got more entertaining the second time I watched this 1998 romantic comedy. I even found the semen hair gel segment pretty funny, and I don't recall finding it funny at all the first time!After two viewings of this hit romantic comedy from the controversial Farrelly brothers, I still can't say I understand all the high praise, but after seeing it a second time, I can't call it a bad movie anymore, nor can I even call it a mediocre movie, even if I still think it comes close to that. Even though Ted getting his genitals caught in his zipper still didn't amuse me too much the second time, and I still found the close-up of it unsettling (good thing that shot is VERY brief), I don't quite despise that part as much as I used to. It is now another comedy I can refer to as a mixed blessing. Since ""There's Something About Mary"" is from Peter and Bobby Farrelly, you're absolutely right if you assume that it's very raunchy, often juvenile, and irreverent, and as popular as it is, it could easily disgust many viewers. I don't think the movie is NEARLY as funny as maybe most others who have seen it do, but won't just advise everyone to just skip it, either.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Something...,"""There's Something About Mary"" is a comedy and romance movie which has to do with a man who gets a chance to meet his dream girl from high school and in his date comes the disaster. We also watch in this movie how was this disaster and how he wants to comeback stronger and surest.I liked this movie because of the plot and the storyline. I also liked the direction of Bobby Farrelly's and Peter Farrelly's. I believe that the interpretation of Cameron Diaz who plays as Mary was simply great and Ben Stiller's who plays as Ted was equally great. Another good interpretation made by Matt Dillon who plays as Healy.Lastly I have to tell you that ""There's Something About Mary"" is a really nice movie which I believe you will love, it combines romance and love with comedy and laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
There's Something About Mary and there's also something about this movie that makes me like it more than most other gross-out comedies,"There's Something About Mary is an apt title, for there is something about this movie that is quite endearing, particularly if you are a gross-out fan. Even if you are not a real fan of gross-outs, as is the case with me, you can still enjoy this film. This is because I find it to be funnier and more enjoyable than most other gross-out comedies (and that includes Team America). As a romantic comedy, it is also enjoyable and that is saying something as romantic comedy is, to me, a bastardised version of real comedy, often with a weak romance and diluted laughs. This is certainly not the case here. Having said that, it is not perfect: The Farrelly Brothers use a retard for cheap laughs once too often, which I did not like, the disabled guy wasn't that funny and the plot is a bit clichéd and predictable, but I expected that.The story is about a man named Ted, who we see meet a beautiful girl, Mary, during his teenage years. However, their budding romance falls away when Ted gets his dick caught in his zipper. By the way, this scene is absolutely hilarious and so is the aftermath, after the police officer tells him to 'pull it out'; next minute, he is being carted off in an ambulance, never to see Mary again...or so we think for a minute.Until of course, he finds himself fantasising about Mary years later. He hires a private investigator, Pat Healy, to do some snooping on her. This takes a turn for the worse, as the investigator falls in love with Mary and lies to Ted. Ted finds out about his deceiving ways, thanks to Woogy and goes to see Mary himself.This movie is hilarious at times, funny at others; occasionally, it falls flat. There are too many hilarious and funny scenes to mention here, so I'll mention the best ones: the 'dick zipper' one, the 'fishing line' one and the one where the retard goes psycho and hits Pat Healy in the face. To be impartial, I will say that I have already mentioned some of the imperfect bits above.The acting is quite good too. Ben Stiller does a good job as the nervy, fantasising, sensible Ted, while Matt Dillon is good as the 'sleazy investigator'. Cameron Diaz, in the days when she was still hot, is OK, but not much more than your typical love interest. The rest of the cast is nothing more than OK, including W. Earl Brown, the guy who plays the retard (as anyone could play his role).I'll finish by saying that this is one of the best gross-out/romantic comedies I've ever seen and is definitely worth a Friday night or a DVD rental. There is a good chance that you'll be laughing like I did throughout the movie. To clinch this review, I will say that:There's Something About Mary!4/5 stars",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mostly Hilarious,"""Theres Something About Mary"" stands as a pioneer for the early 2000s crass commedies.

Holy cow i have never laughed like that in a movie.The big laughs this film pulls makes it memorable alone. But aside from those huge laughs, this movie falls short in my opinion. It lacks real heart. When it isnt funny, its mostly really dumb and almost cringeworthy.When i wasnt laughing i wasnt having that great of a time.Its worth a watch for ben stillers teeth alone.

Classic,"There's Something About Mary (1998)**** (out of 4)I remember seeing this film on opening night at the very first screening. The place was about full and I really wasn't sure what to expect from the film but I went in since it was the only movie playing that I hadn't already seen. From the opening scene to the end it hit me as a masterpiece and I think it still stands as one of the greatest comedies ever made. About half of the crowd members in that first showing walked out in disgust and one even asked me how I could laugh at such things but I went back and watched it four more times and it seemed, weeks after its release, people finally got what was so special about the movie. This is one of the few comedies that keeps my eyes watered up from laughing so hard. The hilarious prom sequence, the drugged up dog, the wacky group of characters and the hilarious jail sequence. There are so many hilarious moments in this film that I think it deserves it's statue as a classic. Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller, Lee Evans and Chris Elliott are all wonderful in the film and all of them have the perfect comedy timing to really make all of their characters blend together well. I also think Keith David, as Mary's stepfather, doesn't get the credit he deserves because the hysterical prom sequence gets a lot of laughs due to his humor. The gross out nature of the film is something that was original and of crouse ripped off in future years. After this film was released we started getting all sorts of ""gross"" comedies but I think the majority of them missed the boat because they didn't realize that this film had a very big heart, which helped the movie.",,Anonymous,Romance
That's A Sore Point,"I shall assume that most people know the basic plot of this romantic comedy about a man trying to track down his High School sweetheart and cut directly to the chase. This is not nearly as good a film as the critics would have you believe. The styles that make up this film (gross out comedy and romantic fluff) really do not work together. The result is a film that, like some of the characters, is schizophrenic. However, there are many good points to be going on with.In many places the film is very, very, funny. The infamous `trapped in trouser-fly' scene is cleverly put together, and the whole 1985 prologue is extremely well thought-out. Keith David walks away with the acting honours for the whole movie as Mary's black step-father, who also gets the best line: `Don't make me open a can of Whoop-ass now!'. Bad taste proliferates here like fungus in a petri dish. A dog is poisoned, resuscitated with an electric cord, set on fire and fed Speed, there is some terrifying nudity, and the hair-gel sequence has already passed into American movie folklore. Do not watch this film if you are easily offended. The performances are not bad in general, but there is something lacking. Ben Stiller gets surprisingly little to do, and Lee Evans' American accent is very bad for such a talented comedian. On the other hand, Diaz is surprisingly good, making the best of a badly written character.The Farellys seem to think that they can handle the gentler sections, but the opposite is unfortunately the case. They are incapable of the softer scenes between Stiller and Diaz, and constantly inject humour into all the wrong places. On the whole the film is quirky, with popular folk singer Jonathan Richman narrating through song and getting shot at the end. If you don't expect too much from this then you will enjoy yourself, particularly if you see it with friends as I did. But when the trailers are more exciting than the film itself, you can't help thinking twice about whether you should have seen Armageddon instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lame Comedy,"Years after a disastrous date with the high school beauty queen, a nerd hires a private detective to find her. The film has some amusing moments (Stiller wrestling a little dog, the famous hair gel scene), but the pacing is too lethargic for a comedy and it goes on much too long. The humor is sophomoric, which is fine if the gags are funny but for the most part they are not. Diaz displays a fine flair for comedy. This role served as a blueprint for Stiller's career while the film did so for the Farrelly Brothers (who'll never be confused for the Coen Brothers). Dillon seems to be having fun. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the audience.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Back when it was okay to laugh at almost anything.,"Ted (Ben Stiller) is still in love with Mary (Cameron Diaz), despite having not seen her for thirteen years (since a disastrous prom night date), so he hires sleazy claims investigator Healy (Matt Dillon) to try and track down the woman of his dreams; unfortunately, Healy also falls for Mary, forcing Ted to go looking for the girl himself.Cameron Diaz: sometimes I think she is smokin', and other times I find her extra-wide Joker-style mouth off-putting.There's Something About Mary: some parts of the film I find incredibly funny, other parts less so.Still, I would rather watch The Farrelly Brothers' politically incorrect brand of comedy than most films that pass for comedy these days. Back when There's Something About Mary came out, we were allowed to laugh at almost anything without being made to feel guilty; sadly, nowadays, finding certain things amusing is frowned upon, putting films like this in danger of being labelled as problematic or even possibly cancelled.I long for today's generation to admit that 'retards' can be funny, a dog dying of an overdose is hilarious, getting your frank and beans mangled in your zipper is gut-busting stuff, and cleaning the pipes and ending up with jizz on your earlobe is comedy gold. I think the world would be a far better place if we were able to laugh at stuff without people getting their knickers in a bunch.It's not perfect (Kingpin is my favourite Farrelly film) but I still rate There's Something About Mary 7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for Lee Evans on crutches trying to pick up his keys.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Something about weirdos that'll have you laughing so hard that it hurts...,"THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY that has every man in the film falling for her (sometimes literally) in a comedy that moves along with gay abandon and no shortage of slapstick silliness. Mary is played with breezy style by CAMERON DIAZ (a throwback perhaps to Carole Lombard's wackiness in this sort of thing), and, of course, BEN STILLER gets to play the lovesick fool who ruins his first prom date with her by getting stung by his zipper.There are too many sight gags here to enumerate, but the funniest have to do with Mary's dog and the other is the famous scene where hair-gel takes on a new meaning.MATT DILLON is the sleazy friend who agrees to find the missing Mary after many years have separated Stiller and Diaz, only to find that he's instantly in love with her too. Naturally, he tells Stiller that she's turned into a blimp in a wheelchair--and you can predict that when Stiller finds out the truth there will be hell to pay.Hilarious moments dominate the breezy comedy from the Farrelly Brothers, full of visual and verbal gags that are non-stop until the last moment. By all means, worth seeing unless you're completely grossed out by this type of humor.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not the usually low comedy you see everyday. Cameron Diaz was also a part of this perfect puzzle. Her beauty and talent keeps fascinating me in a way that rare actors do. Even being predictable, this movie never fails to make you laugh. I have found really difficult to find movies like this. I truly recommend it to anyone. Proof that good movies don't need special effects and violence to be enjoyed.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Hysteria aside, this is actually worth the time; a messy and full-of-mayhem piece covering several bases at once as well as certain others I'm not even sure it knows exist.","There's Something About Mary is a healthy mix of content which doesn't really work with that of rounded, authentic laughs; of situational comedy which is most certainly at times very funny with that of meaner, cruder humour which most certainly is not. The whole thing just about forges together into a film worth one's time, although looses energy when its lead does indeed catch up with a particular girl whom he has always liked, but has nary seen for the best part of ten years. The film is well worth the effort when the humour revolving around a case of two separate instances of deceptive identity is in full flow; other things, such as dramatic reveals and twists feel present more for the absurd pomp and circumstance of it all, do not work as well. Irregardless, the film's odd air of genre hybridisation, as classical Hollywood-era noir appears to crash head on with latter-part 20th Century gross out comedic laughs, is infectious at the best times and only moderately annoying at the worst – it boils down into something worth seeing.We cover a perilous and injustice-ridden quest involving Ben Stiller's rounded and generally bang-up guy, Ted Stroehmann. At the core of the film are his desperate attempts to first get back to the girl of both his youth and of his dreams in the titular Mary, before then proceed to try and win her heart all over again. Along the way, narcissistic and unpleasant men try to sabotage his chances. Mary is the woman in question, and she's played by Cameron Diaz; a woman we observe cycling in the prologue when it was still the 1980s and the main players were all still at high school. She trundles along to said place of study donning a radiant smile; beautiful hair and bright attire - her scopophilic qualities reiterated by all of those whom gaze upon her, and she blots out the unglamourous looking other women as she peddles along.One of those eyeing her is Stiller's aforementioned Ted; a guy revealed to be a little different to that of the rest of the ogling kids, even if he begins out on a similar plain. This differentiation occurs when he steps in on a situation in which a boy at the school with special needs is undergoing a bit of a trauma. Helping him out and bringing calm to the situation, it transpires the boy is Mary's brother and upon thanking him for intervening, poor Ted's feelings for her are implemented to the point that the rest of his life will be largely defined her presence (or lack of) in it in some capacity. The fact the film takes Ted from sharing a domain built on voyeurism as well as an unadulterated lust to know Mary more personally before, most likely, move onto the next woman, and then onto the places he eventually ends up helps move the film away from accusations of it being crasser than it actually is.Things kick off when Ted scores a date to the school-ending prom for his actions involving Mary's sibling, although it all goes spectacularly wrong when he heads over to pick her up and ends in such a disaster that he does not see her again for the duration that allows him to get to the age of being the late-twenty-something-year-old author he is. Desperate, he hires Matt Dillon's private detective Pat Healy to find her and report back. Dillon plays a man with a big gold watch; a little tickle moustache; nudey calenders on the walls of his office and a set of general characteristics that just scream ""avoid"". What Healy does is bend the reality of Mary's looks and situation to allow for him to advance on the unbeknown Mary himself, something made more complicated by the presence of Lee Evans' character: a paraplegic English academic. Acting out of fondness, Ted takes to the road and goes to find her anyway.From this premise, The American filmmaking duo of The Farrelly brothers spin an often humorous film within which we are surprised by how much we actually come to care for what transpires. The Farrelly's actually do well to demonstrate their credentials as filmmakers and prove their ability to time a joke, thus moving the film away from just a flurry of cheap puns more suited to a secondary school playground, during the set up wherein there is a particular edit so well timed that the laugh is in the cut itself and manages to draw attention away from what was otherwise meant to be an instance in which the reveal of a man's semi-veiled genitalia filling the frame was designed to induce giggles. Most of the film's energy, though, does indeed derive from these early segments when we will Stiller on to get to where Mary is and in Dillon's laughable facade. The film could almost certainly be recommended on a level of laughs, in spite of its often veering sources for these laughs; but it is the bends and curves in the narrative as things develop, twinned with one of the more likable leads from memory driving a film of this ilk, which keep it treading water.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Remember the Porky movies?,"Yeah, those movies about a group of teens who 'discover' their sexuality. There is a scene where a woman grabs one of the boys by his genitals.

"Something's Certainly About Mary, But I'm Not Quite Sure What","There's Something About Mary is an absurdly over-the-top comedy that left me scratching my head, wondering just what that ""something"" actually is. It's a dose of bewildering humor with a plot that takes more twists and turns than a rollercoaster.Meet Ted (Ben Stiller), our lovable stalker-in-chief, who spends over a decade pining for the titular Mary (Cameron Diaz). Watching the mishaps and misadventures of his unrelenting obsession with Mary is like witnessing a car crash in slow motion - you can't look away, but you can't quite figure out why you're watching either. And, of course, he's not alone in his pursuit. There's a lineup of bizarre and borderline insane characters, from sleazy private detectives to a geeky British architect with a rather unfortunate tan, each more crass and outrageous than the last. They all vie for Mary's affection, as if she possesses some mystical charm that turns men into The Most Ridiculous Movie Characters Ever. Mary is undoubtedly charming, but her enduring appeal to a horde of questionable suitors is a head-scratcher. Is it her hair? Her smile? Her apparent ability to make men lose all reason? We may never know.The humor in There's Something About Mary is a curious mix of slapstick, cringe-worthy moments, and gross-out gags. From getting ""stuck"" in compromising positions to a certain ""hair gel"" incident that still haunts my nightmares, this movie pushes the boundaries of taste in the name of comedy. Don't get me wrong; there are moments in the film that are genuinely funny. The Farrelly brothers have a knack for finding humor in the most awkward situations, and some of the one-liners manage to hit the mark. However, those moments are often overshadowed by the relentless barrage of crude gags and questionable taste. But here's the kicker: despite the absurdity and the awkward situations, There's Something About Mary somehow manages to be strangely endearing. It's like a guilty pleasure you can't quite explain, a comedic enigma that leaves you laughing and bewildered in equal measure.There's Something About Mary is a movie that you either love for its audacious, no-holds-barred approach to comedy or despise for its relentless crassness. It's a divisive piece of cinema that revels in its own absurdity. It will make you laugh, cringe, and scratch your head, often all at the same time. But don't expect to find any straightforward answers about what that ""something"" is - that's a mystery that may forever remain unsolved.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"bah, it's okay","the farrelly brothers are still yet to make a funnier film than dumb and dumber. This outing sees ben stiller and cameron diaz together, in the hope of getting a lot of laughs. Instead it gets just a few laughs. The film relies too much on the 5 main set piece gags, and the time between them is wasted on dull jokes and not very amusing physical comedy. It looks bright enough, with the usual colourful framing, but it leaves you wanting more.The actors try very hard to dish out the humour but it leads them nowhere. And lee evans is just so cringeworthy, doing an american accent so bad, you just wanna turn it off right there and then. But yes, the set pieces are funny, rib ticklingly funny. It's just a shame there is so much dead air in this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ben Stiller is marvelous as the geek that wants a reunion with his almost Prom date. Cameron Diaz is Mary. And it seems everyone is in love with Mary. Comedy fits her like a glove. She has a quality that should shine in any role she chooses. Matt Dillon is excellent as a jerk and Chris Elliott is well...Chris Elliott. You will laugh and then laugh harder.

Mary, a girl that every man wants. We slowly get to meet all her stalkers along the way. Why is she so perfect? Because she just is. Easily Cameron Diaz's best performance. She was crazy beautiful, high spirited, compassionate and just a normal girl looking for a good man to love. Ben Stiller, Matt Dillion and everyone else in the movie was fantastic. It flowed so nicely. They were all funny, charming and perfect for the roles.I loved the colours in the movie, the constant pink popping up here and there. Something about it felt down to earth. It was believable. A normal guy with less than good luck trying to impress a beautiful girl. The jokes were not over done because they were also down to earth.

Funny,"Rewatched the other night with wifey.Saw this when it was released back in the 90's and thought it was brilliant. A lot of humour we hadn't seen before (and maybe some we wish we hadn't).""There's Something About Mary"" tells the fictional story of a girl, Mary (Cameron Diaz), who becomes an obsession for many guys. The film revolves around Ted (Ben Stiller), who went to school with Mary and as an older man decides to try to track her down. He hires PI Pat Healy (Matt Dillon, in one of his best efforts)to track her down. Healy finds her, but falls for her and consequently makes up a story to try to deter Ted from pursuing her.

Average comedy,"Gross out comedy is fast becoming one of Hollywoods biggest industrys. The American Pie films, South Park bigger Longer and Uncut and numerous Adam Sandler movies are among the biggest grossers and in 1998 There's Something about Mary became one of the genres biggest hits. The film opened to generally positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, as years went by the films popularity grew and since then by many has been regarded as one of the funniest films of all time. I don't share that opinion. The story is simple, a guy gets asked to the prom by a girl(called Mary) he fancys only for a rather unfortunate incident to occur which prevents him from saying goodbye to her as she moves to Miami shortly afterword. Years later and now a man he realises he is still in love with Mary and hires a sleazy private investigator to find her. However he to falls in love with her and soon becomes clear There's Something about Mary..... The film doesn't contain many subtle jokes, but as the genre suggests it shouldn't specilize in them so it would be unfair to complain about that. However the abundance of Toilet humour and sex related jokes does become waring after about an hour and half of the gags fall right on their face, in saying that there are some inspired moments but to few to warrent the praise the film has received. The performances have a certain charm but Stiller and Diaz in the leads aren't really convincing enough, you could argue Dillions Sleazy detective is the only person who raises an above average laugh count but there's no arguing about the fact he carries the movie at times. The film does have entertainment value and some ideas are good, but are rarely carried of to full potential. In the end There may be something special about Mary, but there's nothing special about this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"one of the best comedies ever, badly underrated here at 7 something","I remember seeing this movie in the theatre and people were rolling in the aisles pretty much start to finish. Yes, some of the jokes are a bit crude and sexual and I'll wait for my 9 y/o son to be like 13, 14 before we can watch that together, but it's one of the funniest movies I know and I've pretty much seen them all. Not that there has been a lot to see in the last 10 years. One might even cut out all the major sexual stuff, have a 5min shorter movie and it'd still be very funny, ok, minus the zipper incident, you need to leave that in.Also, this movie has one of funniest, most original (!) and uplifting credit sequence I am aware of. Makes me still smile all the way through it, just brilliant.All the actors are also phantastic. Cameron Diaz is a GODESS in this movie, and funny, her best role. Ben Stiller was not a household name yet, and this movie pretty much made him that, I think. All the supporting roles are great as well, the only exception is the only none actor/comedian Brett Farve who was a fun cameo, but himself a bit wooden, but sure, not his profession.And yes, since that is kind of a thing now, the movie even aged perfectly fine the last 25 years, PC-wise, I just finished seeing it for the x-th time and everyone who is in any way sexist or otherwise bad person is getting their comeuppance. There are no cheap shots or mean spirited jokes against gays, handicapped, physically or otherwise, interracial marriage, nothing like that.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Yes, there definetly something about her...","A couple of scenes from There's Something About Mary have already become legend. The scrotum-in-the-zipper scene and, of course, the flying style-gel scene have guaranteed places in the Gross-Me-Out Hall of Fame. The Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby, have provided us with the funniest mainstream comedy since AUSTIN POWERS.The minds behind the successful Dumb and Dumber and the overlooked Kingpin have concocted an outrageous batch of gags and assembled a game cast to embody them. Ben Stiller is Rhode Island Ted, a nerdy, mouth-full-of-metal highschooler who has a crush on the impossibly tall, blonde and beautiful Mary (Cameron Diaz). Much to his surprise, she becomes his date to the prom. Well, almost. A nasty close encounter with the aforementioned zipper dashes his hopes of romance on the dance floor. Thirteen years later, Ted, with the braces (and zipper) now removed, is still thinking of Mary. You see, there is definitely something special about Mary. He has her located in Miami by hiring a sleaze ball private investigator (Matt Dillon), and the obsession continues.Stiller is endearing as smitten Ted and Diaz is absolutely charming as Mary. No doubt, there's something about Cameron. You can easily see why she is driving everyone crazy. A terrific supporting cast including Dillon, Lee Evans, Chris Elliot and Green Bay Packer Brett Favre, add laughs. Quite astonishing is Lin Shaye as Mary's ever-present neighbor, Magda, whose bleached-blonde bouffant is way beyond white and whose dangerously tanned skin reminds me of a top-quality Naugahyde sofa. Look for Magda's dog Puffy too. He deserves a doggie Oscar all his own. Love Puffy's stunt double, which looks like an overgrown, stiff-legged Beanie Baby, has seen better days.

Getting the genitals caught between a zip fastener? Are these things supposed to be funny?.Besides, this brainless movies, like Austin Powers too, that are originally made for you to rest and enjoy them, without the obligation of thinking, are, actually, very boring.Not that I don't like funny and easy movies, but this is too much for me.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Farrelly Brothers' Do It Again.,"In the tradition of ""Dumb & Dumber"" comes the equally hilarious and demented ""There's Something About Mary"". Ben Stiller stars as a loser who wonders what might have been after he was unable to go to the prom with his true love Mary (Cameron Diaz). The reason he cannot go is an important part of the movie in itself. Fast-forward a few years and Stiller continues to think of Diaz. Of course he enlists the help of slimy private investigator Matt Dillon to find her, but a problem occurs: Dillon falls in love with Diaz. This creates a problem for Lee Evans who plays a scholar in front of Diaz but is really a simple pizza delivery man. What follows are crazy situations and oh yes, don't forget Stiller's friend Chris Elliott who has a secret of his own. The film is just amazing in its ability to make the audience laugh. Every gag works to perfection and the whole film is a test to get through because you are laughing so hard that you might miss the next gag which is coming up. The jokes come in a constant wave and the whole film is just so comical that few can question the achievement of the film-makers. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Romance

A Fun Comedy that Probably Couldn't be Made Today,"This is a movie that I used to catch all the time on the movie channels. What is funny is that sitting down to watch this with Jaime, I wasn't sure if I had seen this all the way through or not. I knew it enough though. It had been a while since the last time I checked it out though. Before getting into the movie itself, I should say that I'm a fan of the Farrelly brothers who directed this.If you don't know about this movie, it is all about Mary (Cameron Diaz). We get introduced to her through Ted (Ben Stiller). He met her in high school, she realized he was a good guy and asks him to prom. Ted treats her mentally handicapped brother, Warren (W. Earl Brown), good and that he is a good guy. There is an incident though that cuts the night short when he comes to pick her up.It then jumps to the present. We see Ted telling these events to a therapist, played by Richard Jenkins. Ted still thinks about Mary. His best friend Dom (Chris Elliott) knows this and gets him in touch with a private investigator, Healy (Matt Dillon), to find her. He goes to Miami to find her and falls in love with her too. These aren't the only guys. They continually sabotage each other to win her heart, regardless of what she wants.Where I should start is that I'm not sure if a movie like this could be made today. It came out in that special time of comedies. I still found this funny, but I also find it problematic. There are things said that made me cringe. That is what this comedy is all about though. We have these guys who go crazy over Mary to get her to like them. The acting there is great for what a movie like this needs to work. We have the likes of Dillon, Stiller, Jeffrey Tambor, Keith David, Sarah Silverman, Khandi Alexander and Jenkins. There are also Farrelly brother regulars like Elliot, Lin Shaye and Rob Moran. They all just work to give the characters the personality they need.This is not a great comedy, but it just works. If you are easily offended, I would say you should probably skip this one. This is a switch your brain off movie and just enjoy the ride for sure.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

There's Nothing About Mary,"The main conceit driving this movie is that Cameron Diaz (playing Mary) is irresistible to all men. She isn't. She's cute and perky and her character has a good sense of humor (as the Farrelly Brothers divided women in their commentary, between funny--gets it or funny--talks it; and I've always been drawn to women who are funny--talks it).Apart from that, I don't like jokes about bodily functions or fluids. I don't want to forbid them, I simply don't find them funny; and they are here.In fact, the only scenes I laughed at were the ones concerning a dog (no spoilers!).While we're on it, I've never seen the charm of Ben Stiller. Chris Elliot, son of the famous Bob of Bob and Ray, has funny genes. But while I like humor that skewers sacred cows, it didn't have enough of that. Watching the extended version I see they cut some funny stuff out. Too bad.In the spirit of trying to find good in everything I will say it's nice for the Farrelly Brothers to try to build a story on characters rather than stick figures parroting funny lines. And to be honest, finding a truly sexy woman who can be funny (and I've met a few in my life, so they're out there) is difficult. Eventually, however, my inability to believe in Mary's superpowers over men made the whole movie collapse. It was kind of funny at the end, too; but, frankly, I think Mary made the wrong choice (no spoilers!)Not my cup of tea. Or whatever.",,Anonymous,Romance

I laughed a lot and felt good while watching it.If you're on the search of a classic, easy Ben Stiller flick, look no further!While at times, the mood does seem just a little bit creepy, I find the film to be an overall enjoyable watch. It's fun, it's cute, it's funny, and it's unforgettable.Also, I would like to say that a unique musical device used throughout the movie is pretty entertaining, and one aspect of the film that I loved.

"Rude, tasteless and boring","I was expecting this movie to be at least a decent romance movie. I was wrong. It was my own fault. I decided to watch this movie because I judged it by the title and the plot line. I thought it would be a good romance comedy like ""When Harry Met Sally"". I should have researched about this film more. That's 119 minutes of my life that's gone now. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this. I don't get why it's rated a 7.2, there have been much much better films that were rated much lower. Goes to show that IMDb ratings suck.I would have liked this movie if there weren't so many tasteless jokes inserted into it that weren't even funny. If you like movies with raunchy humor that repeats its gags over and over, then maybe you'll like this movie. I know I didn't.Viewed on: April 7, 2011",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"OK  it's basic, but some of it is very funny","Despite a disastrous prom date, Ted is still pining for his high school sweetheart Mary 13 years later.  Hearing she is in Miami she hires a private detective to find out more about her to help him get the courage to go and meet her again.  However the detective starts to fall for Mary and uses his information to get close to her.  On discovering this Ted sets out by road to meet Mary himself  assuming he can get there in one piece.I usually like to write a little about the plotting of any film I review and weight it on it's relative merits but can I do that here? The plot is unimportant compared to the importance of OTT and tasteless jokes and routines that the script allows. So in terms of plot - who cares who ends up with Mary or any detail like that, this is all about the comedy. It is pretty funny but it depends on your taste. Suffice to say that fans of Noel Coward, Oscar Wilde or Woody Allen might find this a little below them. This is not the film to check out if you're looking for wit or intelligent humour. Instead this is where you want to go for the most basic of crude jokes and silly physical comedy.However I don't mean to sound snobbish like this sort of thing is just tasteless and rubbish. Instead it is very funny at some key stages. I defy you not to laugh at some of the more outrageous or exaggerated physical routines - the dog or the prom date are two of the best. More than that the film has added lots of touches which just add to the material even if they aren't logical, for example the wandering band or the final scene with the old man on the balcony are two good examples of weird little add-ons that just are funny because they are not within the reality of the film. Of course, taste has left the building and many people may find it too basic or not like laughing as one of the characters on crutches tries to pick something up off the floor or laughing at Mary's mentally slow brother.The cast do well.  Stiller plays well in his usual sort of role (see Meet the Parents etc) and Dillon hams it up to great effect in a role outside of his normal type of stuff.  Diaz is pretty good and it's nice o see her make fun of herself.  Evans is very funny as Norman and his physical comedy skills are put to good effect in some scenes where `you know you SHOULDN'T laugh'  but you do.Overall this is trashy low-brow comedy.  It is in poor taste for the majority of the film and the targets are often easy.  However I defy you not to laugh during the film  it may never be viewed as art but dammit, it's funny for the majority of the time.",,Anonymous,Romance
"A half standard, half extreme comedy/love story mix","Theres nothing really new about ""Something about Mary"", except one thing: the creators do seem like they have tried to top some of the rudities in today's average comedy. Parts of the film let you go mad in your cinema seat and go like ""heck, they can`t really do that!"", other parts just let me think ""what is this supposed to mean? Was that funny?"". Somehow the film tries to fulfill too many demands: comedy, romance and brutal nonsense.

Must be about 10 years since I see it last and recently came across the extended cut of it. This movie has to be one of the best comedies of all time and the extended cut only made it better. It hasn't really aged at all and still competes with (and beats) any comedy of today.Along with a great soundtrack, the movie has perhaps the best end credits ever seen in a movie (Hall Pass sequence is up there, better than the Hall Pass movie itself perhaps).

"There's much to like in this wishful, yet crude comedy.","There's something to like about THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. A nicely rounded satire about guys telling all about the girl they love proves that such desiring moments are hilarious in a sophisticated way. If only wishes do exist in becoming true. Cameron Diaz may not be doing so much at first, but there's reason to find her likeable as a young woman who becomes attracted by guys who want to dig her. This has to be the best performance for Diaz so far, yet a no-show at the Oscars. A name to watch for in future Hollywood releases. This is also a truly unique style of modern-day comedy. It's real cool to have the story told through some brief singing numbers, making this much more special. Unintentionally funny bits are sweet and nifty. In a nutshell, it's fun-filled all the way through, but the ""R"" rating is what bothered me the most. You might have heard rumors about Fox putting the movie out on video as a watered down ""PG"" release. That should have been a smart idea, and while the crudeness can be laughable on occasion, it takes some of the advantage away in willing to be a truly heartfelt satire. Still, this is one of the better modern comedies I've seen, and one to show to your buddy who has strong temptation over pretty gals.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

They take FULL advantage of their first R-rated movie, supplying us with some really shocking and unexpected scenes that some people will probably take offense to, but nonetheless are guaranteed to make you double up in your seats from laughter. But the movie also has a surprising sweetness about it, which separates MARY from The Farrelly's previous films (which were very funny).

Romantic Trip of Floridication,"Among the best comedies of the late 90's we can find this perfect play of great acting and marvelous film making with some of the best stars of Hollywood. The film covers many sensitive topics and it is slightly politically incorrect by American standards, although nothing like SNL in the 80's i hear. Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz are so in love that this relation covers space and time. It covers the space of several states and several periods in life, even differently, showing the high quality of the film and well-executed play by two of the most prominent actors/comedians of the modern age of movies. In their teens, Cameron Diaz is this unreachable dream girl in a high school where several characters meet and open up the story with good interplay and interesting conversations, although childish as well. It gets your attention right off and it gets the story going on four wheels in Florida where now Diaz has found her dream job and is taking care of the disabled kids. Ben Stiller, after having fixed all his problems with his underated organs and overrated practices, goes on a field trip to meet his girl, without much hope of relating to her again. Then, cometh the man, Mat Dillon, who plays the role of this out of wack investigative journalist who can find anything anywhere and biy does he find a catch. Althoug primarely not as interested, he finds out that he also has the hots for Mary and from what it seems also the top dog to win her hand. Here is where the plot thickens and other guys also fall in love with Mary aand forget about their profession and follow love.The story is wonderfully organized, with a very good tempo of interactions and some really funny humor that also hits a bit dangerously sensitive notes by today's standards and it does get a bit filthy for young audiences. Itk may have been under-played in the beginning but it must have taken off on the later viewings and video showing, because the more you watch it the more you like it. A real comedy of love affairs and how not to do things with women, while Cameron Diaz must have had the time of her life in this film and really radiates poetry in motion in every scene. Having been filmed mostly in sunny Florida really makes this one attractive in many ways. The scene in the house of Mary and her mother or Magda, her woman friend of the house, either when she gets the dog in the bathroom or when she meets Mat Dillon, provides a household comedy for American easy living. The architect plot iswell mixed with the friend who was a designer and her ""incapacitated mentor"" who can really teach some life lessons with love, while later reveals himself as a phony, ""like they all are"". The music, the filming, the funny situations and the story, although a bit harsh in their treatment of certain subjects make for a really outstanding comedy to remember.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
There's Something About Mary: 6/10,"Why is it that bad taste and offensive material is acceptable if there are some morals thrown in? People rarely question this, as it's especially true in movies made by the Farrelly brothers, known for their bad taste in such movies as Dumb and Dumber. If people laugh, they forget that what they're laughing at is offensive. And while there is a little bit of clean humor in There's Something About Mary, it's few and far between as jokes involving at least three bodily functions are shown, mentally retarded people are ridiculed (but not as much as you may think), and fake dogs are injured (but not killed). It's another day in the life of a Farrelly brother.Ted (Ben Stiller), as a somewhat nerdy high schooler in the 80s, is going to the prom with popular girl Mary (Cameron Diaz), but an unfortunate accident has Ted going to the hospital. Thirteen years later, Ted still hasn't gotten over Mary, so he hires private investigator Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to find out about her. Pat discovers that there's ""something about Mary"" and falls in love with her. Ted now has to go to Florida to stop Pat, but gets into a lot of zany mishaps along the way.Mary works, but in moderation. It seems like the only time it goes for the full comedic effect and works is during the truly inspired scenes. The bathroom scene in the beginning is great-that, and the first ""dog/speed"" scene are the only two that had me cracking up for the whole scene. The rest of the movie had a laugh or two, but not really that much. The ""hair gel"" part seemed to over-the-top to be even remotely believable. There's some good characters, like Magda (Lin Shaye) and Dom (Chris Elliot) that have their moments, but none of them even stand out. Diaz does what she does, playing a level-headed, all-around nice person, and Stiller playing his slightly-nebbish person perfectly, but it's either that or some weird over-the-top guy (like Zoolander or Dodgeball).The romantic parts of the movie worked for what they were meant to do, which was further the humor. I suppose I bought the relationship between Stiller and Diaz, although Dillon's over-the-top character was more realistic in his fascination with Mary. But, since Dillon wasn't in either of the aforementioned scenes, he didn't evoke many laughs. Mary's 2 hour runtime went by pretty quickly, and I suppose when you have a runtime like that, being entertaining is more important than being funny, and that's obviously the case with Mary, although it's not its intention.My rating: 6/10Rated R for strong comic sexual content and language.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Movie Schitzo's Review of ""There's Something About Mary""","One of The Farreley Brothers greatest films that is also known as probably one of the most famous gross out comedies of all time and the blast off of The Farreley Brother's career, this is one of the stupid yet sweet films everyone loves to watch along the lines of ""Me, Myself and Irene"". The story is simple: Ted Stromen (Ben Stiller) is a High School geek who has a crush on the prettiest girl in school Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz) although she has a mentally challenged brother named Warren (W Earl Brown) who sometimes gets Ted into some embarrassing situations. Ted decides to ask Mary to the Prom and on Prom night, a disaster happens that keeps Ted and Mary from dancing all through the night. Flash forward 13 years and Ted is a wreck after the date never happened. So Ted hires a sleazy private Dick Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to spy on Mary, to see how she is doing. But, after getting one glimpse of Mary, he lies to Ted and moves to get closer to Mary. This is one of those tasteless comedies that no one would have thought would work but it did and became an instant cult classic and boosted The Farrelley Brothers up to the status as the kings of comedy gross out movies. Some side characters are Tucker (Lee Evans), a friend of Mary's and Dom (Chris Elliot) an ex boyfriend of Mary's.

Good... but a little disappointing,"This movie is probably the surprise hit of the summer, which I'm sure is due in part to it's advertising campaign.  Don't get me wrong, it was a funny movie, but I have to say I walked out of the theater a little disappointed. The reason?  The television commercials for 'Mary' were way too revealing, in other words I had seen almost all of the funny parts on tv before even seeing the film (the zipper, the dog, the hair gel, to name a few).  It was like knowing the outcome of a mystery story before even reading the book. While the ads did get me to spend some bucks to see the film (the ultimate goal of the ads), I sat there thinking ""ok, I've already seen this part, show me something new"".  Unfortunately, there were very few of those ""new"" parts.  Cameron Diaz is definitely the high point of the film.  She is a very good comedic actress.  Of course it doesn't hurt that she is also very beautiful too.  I look for her to really become one of the better actresses around in the coming years.  Matt Dillon was also surprisingly good as a sleazy private eye.  A low point was the totally unfunny Chris Elliot.

DUMB & DUMBER, I am now convinced, was not a TRUE Farrelly Bros. film - it was purely Jim Carrey run loose!

What can I say? Yes the movie is gross. And yes the movie is offensive. Is there anything wrong with that? No - in this case! The plot is basically this: Ben Stiller, after 13 years, is still longing for his high school sweetheart Mary, the increasingly beautiful and talented Cameron Diaz. In turn, Ben's friend, played by Chris Elliot, sets him up with a private investigator (played by the increasingly great Matt Dillon) to find his Mary.

The gel scene and the dog on fire scene were great, but some stuff like the fish hook scene and the singers were just stupid. The whole deal with her retarded brother was just offensively bad - the only thing that was funny was Dillon's failed pick-up line ""I work with retards"" which showed how scummy his character was rather than poke cheap laughs at the disabled.

"By making fun of any human being who is not white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, straight or in perfect health, the Farrelly brothers' film is one of the funniest of the 90's","What makes a joke funny? The content of the text? The situation where it is told? Or maybe the political, social or historical moment? It's hard to describe exactly. A comedy masterpiece with iconic scenes, ""There's Something About Mary?"" today would have the power to reframe what we consume as funny. Directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly, ""There's Something About Mary?"" it features silly but endearing jokes that work very well with its cartoonish characters. The film brings a much more interesting humor than in ""Dumb and Dumber"", making it a mixture between romantic comedy and politically incorrect nonsense. The feature was one of the last to contain the classic universal humor that was lost in the old drawings of Bugs Bunny, who on the last day 27 completed 80 years, without shame of pleasing or not Greeks and Trojans. Included in the list of the 100 best comedies of all time by BBC London and the American Film Institute, precisely because of this stereotyped breach of expectation that we are conditioned.This comes from the unusual invitation of the most beautiful blonde in school, Mary (Cameron Diaz), to the ugliest nerd, Ted (Ben Stiller), in order to accompany her to the prom because of all her altruistic simplicity. The girl's family of dreams is formed by the mocking afro-descendant stepfather (Keith David) married to the blonde mother (Markie Post) and the robust intellectually disabled brother Warren (W. Earl Brown), responsible for the funniest scenes, precisely because he is not taxed. Victim when ridiculed, fighting back naturally and unexpectedly. Thirteen years later, when they meet in Miami, when everything is heading towards a happy ending again, the crook detective (Matt Dillon), the American football player, Brett Favre, playing himself, and the disabled person with limited mobility. And muscular spasticity (Lee Evans) who pokes fun at his own physical limitations Monty Python style. All trying to conquer her at any cost. After all, who's going to keep Mary?The Americans - fathers of ""politically correct"" - are masters of this subject. Hollywood is also politically correct. Ninety percent of American film production adheres to strict rules of behavior, to which certain subjects will always be taboo and certain scenes may never be filmed. And then we arrive at Who's Going to Stay with Mary? By the same directors of ""Dumb and Dumber"". Here, the directorial duo's silly humor becomes even more acidic (or in bad taste, as you like) than ever before. Want an example? Just remember the sequence in which Jeff Daniels goes to a bathroom in Dumb and Dumb after taking a cup of laxative. Or the sequence, in Kingpin, where Woody Harrelson gets milk all over his mouth after drinking the liquid he ""milked"" from a cow - actually, a bull. Well then: in Who's Going to Stay with Mary? Scenes like these abound - after all, who could forget the substance that Cameron Diaz uses as hair gel in this film?What about a golden rule in Hollywood that ""animals should never suffer"". Why, in ""Dumb Dumb"" Jim Carrey sells a headless parakeet to a blind boy. Is there anything more politically incorrect than that? Yes, there is: in There's Something About Mary? Matt Dillon paints and embroiders a beautiful little dog that insists on barking at the most inappropriate times. Not to mention the resuscitation scene of that same dog or the MMA-style fight he has with Ben Stiller's character, which doesn't end so well for the animal (this scene is hilarious).The problem is that some shots are too explicit (like the opening sequence, in the bathroom, which even shows what happened to the ""lower parts"" of Stiller's character) and the film has an irregular rhythm, alternating frenetic moments with others of more slowdowns (which are misused by directors). The pace of the film starts very well, and the catastrophes that happen to Ted moments before the prom were really genius. However, in the course of the plot they exaggerated in some aspects, losing a little its essence. For example: they developed three characters very well in it, and in the end, they simply fit three more, all of a sudden, without any plausible context. Even the third admirer was quite acceptable, it gave us the feeling that it was really ""probable"" to happen, but when the others entered, we thought: ""No, it's just a movie"". It made the ending forced and contrived, but still a lot of fun.Some sequences are especially hilarious, while others are just silly - and unfunny. Overall, the film entertains with its illogical humor and its ""parallel"" universe. The story, completely filled with funny and somewhat embarrassing situations, is remembered until today. And all the success of these situations is due, in addition to the great work of the directors, to the perfect harmony between the main actors. Cameron Diaz simply rocks the role, lavishing charisma and sympathy, elements that would make her a big star in the future. Ben Stiller found in this work his great vocation in comedy, becoming popular with the public as an actor of the genre. Matt Dillon faces a character totally different from his style, doing surprisingly great in the role, where it is clear how much he is at ease. And it was the joining of this trio heading the cast, which made the film a great success.Perhaps the reason for so much success are the film's balconies, most of which are supreme. Hilarious scenes, such as that accident with the zipper, in addition to the famous ""gel scene"", certainly marked an entire young generation. Other cool moments are the parts in which a couple of men, who have nothing to do with the story, appear singing about Mary, participating in a way as improvised narrators. In a way, we can say that this film defined the careers of Stiller and Diaz, in a way that opened doors for both of them in new opportunities. Cameron knew how to make better use of opportunities, even working with renowned directors, such as Martin Scorsese. Stiller embarked on the path of pure comedy, starring in and directing the stupid (Zoolander, 2001), and returning to work with the Farrelly brothers in the more recent and weaker ""Before Only Than Mal Casado"" (The Heartbreak Kid, 2007). Even having done less than pleasant work after Who Will Stay with Mary, with the exception of the praised ""Tropical Thunder"" (Tropic Thunder, 2008), Ben Stiller has already established himself among the public, always guaranteeing good box office.There's Something About Mary is a comedy like few others. Maybe he makes a few mistakes along the way, but nothing that interferes with his genius. The Farrelly brothers never outdid themselves after this comedy, but they've already made quite a name for themselves through it. Ensuring good laughs, this work knows how to have fun in an unusual way, always bringing back hilarious memories. Sometimes, to have fun in the dark of the cinema, it is necessary to give up a more severe critical sense and any trace of modesty. Such is the case with ""Who's Getting Mary?"", a comedy so shameless and politically incorrect that it's hard to believe it made more than 170 million greenbacks in the US, a country deservedly famous for its hypocritical moral pruritus. By making fun of any human being who is not white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, straight or in perfect health, the Farrelly brothers' film leaves no stone unturned. And it's one of the funniest of the 90's.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

lame,"Unfunny, amateurish, juvenile from start to finish. These jokes and gags would have been rejected by the Three Stooges as too lame. The cast is awful. Not a single comedic talent among Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz and Matt Dillon. It seems the Farrelly brothers are the type of wits who think armpit noises are the height of comedy. No laugh is too cheap for these guys. Is it considered daring and original these days to ridicule the handicapped?",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lower your expectations,"This film contains two of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in my life (they both involve the dog) and the ending is clever and sweet, but as for the rest. . . I don't get what all the hosannas are about. The film's actually pretty plodding and slow-moving and there are long, loooong stretches where there are no laughs at all. As for the two most infamous scenes - i.e. the bathroom scene and the bit with the hair gel - they're not really done that well: the joke is too obvious and the timing is terrible. I think, in general, the Farrelly brothers lack the kind of light touch that is necessary for comedy (yes, even gross-out comedy), and their movies (including Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin) tend to consist of long set-ups for jokes that are sometimes funny but most often not. And even when they're funny, you can't quite forget how long the set up was, and wonder why the pacing couldn't be better and more assured.Anyway, I don't want to rip on this movie too much - it's got a good spirit, the entire cast is appealing (if rather unexceptional) and there's even a nice little message underneath it all. As light entertainment you could do a lot worse, but you may be left wondering what all the big fuss was about. Lower your expectations just a bit and you should enjoy it just fine.",,Anonymous,Romance

A classic that I have found a new appreciation for after many years,"This was a film that I very first see as a teenager around two years after its release when it was first televised....back then I found it 'quite funny and a film that had its own style' though now after watching it the second time around in 2018 I can truly appreciate what a well written and distinct comedy it is and though it fits that 'goofy comedy' genre, there is no film quite like it, it makes me wish the 'Farrelly Brothers' still had the spark to produce good films (especially comparing to 'Stuck On You' and my recent first watch of 'Dumb and Dumber 2' which was underwhelming).
Firstly I'v noticed a few reviews on here with concerns over the film containing 'toilet humour' and 'insensitivity', this indeed is true, there are many moments of both crudeness and narcissism. 
In terms of the crude humour, these are simply light hearted quick laugh scenarios built around a well written comedy that otherwise uses good understanding and comedy around in depth concepts such as 'want', 'loneliness', 'motives', 'greed', 'kindness', 'true love', 'lust' 'social indifference' and the 'relatability between the cultural stereotypes involved despite them being different'. The characters written into the story strongly portray these aspects well and the way the story is structured shows hallmarks of good writing with a story that progresses with the 'game of chess' power struggle between the hapless characters as new info comes to light for them and they take steps to obtain their goal.
In terms of the insensitivity, though the film portrays unsavoury characters that are for example 'misogynistic' or 'insulting of disabled people' , it clearly in no way 'condones or glorifies it', in fact it does quite the opposite, it observes narcissistic attitudes in a comical way using the medium of these desperate characters ultimately coming unstuck; the film also contains strong 'empathic characters' who 'stick up for the little guy' and have more noble motives to their gains of which the film ultimately 'roots for' and centres around, as well as the other plainly 'quirky characters' who are simply 'up against it' and are somewhere in the middle.
As mentioned before, the film very much has its 'own feel and style' which in this new age of mostly 'accepted and often blindly defended uniform mediocrity' when it comes to the feel and style around art, shows a good example of a film to take notes from for a production that shows good individualality, character and distinct feeling to it, which are often traits which make films memorable cult classics such as what this has become.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Do you want only to laugh?,"Do you want to see a movie where you can laugh, where the main character is clumsy but generous and idealist, where nearly the whole bunch of characters are only caricatures and where every vulgarity forbidden in other films is allowed here? Then watch this movie... Personally I watched it because I wanted to have some good laughs and I had what I wanted, nut nothing more. I adored the previous Farrelly bros' movie (Dumb & Dumber) where everything was crazy and farcical. The defect of this one is that there are two characters that are too human (played by the divine Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller): so the exhilarating scenes that include Stiller (and where you laugh almost to tears) seem uprooted from the other more serious scenes where the directors have to develop the story, just because they have two human character,too. So the rhythm of the movie seems to limp (just like many characters) and it goes too long, for a movie of this kind. The invention of the two boys that play and sing (like a greek chorus all through the movie) is very good. A few last words about the advertised ""politically uncorrect"" in this movie: I found the scenes including disableds not too disturbing. In fact I believe it's right to treat them like the rest of the people because they are human beings just like the others, but take care not to exaggerate, or it could transform in racism.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

If it's said that girls like naughty people, then maybe the hookers, drug addicts, prisoners are the role models of women too.The love of two people is the same, it is a completely different equation, combined in such a way that no two are alike. If everyone has a formula, then why, for thousands of years, we've paired up with someone else who doesn't have a formula at all. Two people with completely different professions can fall in love, two completely different people in terms of childhood, personality, and living environment come together. The fact that a lawyer girl loves you while you are completely illiterate in law, a fashion girl can fall in love with a guy dressed as a beggar. Or you can completely conquer a Biomedical girl while your head barely knows what medicine is.The person we love is a completely separate box, only when we really love can we find the key to open that box.

Watching the extended version I see they cut some funny stuff out. Too bad.

One of the 90's best comedies,"Ted (Ben Stiller) has been in love with Mary (Cameron Diaz) since High School, and thirteen years later, he is realising his life is going nowhere because of it. He decides to track her down, using the help of a top-notch private investigator named Pat Healy (Matt Dillon), and try to rebuild the relationship they once had. But when the investigator also falls in love with Mary, it isn't easy for Ted to find his lost love, and madness follows, all about Mary.Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller had a very impressive chemistry together, and I always think of this as one of Diaz's best roles. She was a very good Mary, and she made the character very likable with her charming smile. I found there to actually be something about her, but maybe it was just the way they portrayed her. Ben Stiller was mediocre, but does provide some very funny moments and contributes immensely to the film. The way he voiced it over was also a good touch. I thought Matt Dillon as the private detective was a great choice and he was an good villain, though a little too creepy. All the other actors were excellent in their parts, (especially the seven-minute abs guy, who was hilarious).The only problem with this movie, and it is a small one, was how 9/10 of the sequences in the film aren't 'laugh out loud funny'. I found a lot of the film to to be entertaining, and/or sweet, but not a lot of it made me actually laugh my guts out. Another thing I found annoying, how they said the F word in nearly every sentence. I felt they overused it, in some parts of the movie was necessary to curse, but the majority of the time it seemed fake and tacky when the characters swore. I mean, it would have been just as funny without that much swearing.A little raunchy, but very entertaining.",,Anonymous,Romance
A great cast!,"Before I had even watched the film, I predicted that it would be one of those sh*tty films, like American Pie, and my prediction blurred my mind and so I never got to watch it.... until now. The idea of Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz, and Matt Dillon starring together in a comedy film had to be good, and to make it even better, let the Farrelly Brothers direct it. The two brothers have directed sh*t and crap but it is good to know that that their goal isn't always to direct feces and if you want proof, watch There's Something About Mary. The rest can go in the toilet, with the exception of ""Dumb & Dumber"". I probably wouldn't ever like them as directors no MATTER what they make. Before I go any further let me warn you that this film isn't funny all the way through but it does have some scenes, five or six, that will make you laugh out loud. The story is pretty simple but likable and it has a sense of nostalgia stuck to it. It is about a guy who still thirteen years later is in love with the girl who he WAS supposed to go to the prom with but he never did make it since it was a complete disaster. (Minor Spoiler) Apparently, he had an accident in his girlfriends bathroom that consisted of his balls being stuck in his zipper which was pulled all the way up. The problem could have easily been fixed if the ambulance, fire truck, and EVERYONE hadn't been there to witness the once-in-a-lifetime event(Spoiler End). One of his ""beans"" was shown to the audience and it looked really gross but mostly, PAINFUL. The song ""There's something about Mary"" used in this film is stuck in my head for it's memorable lyrics and the deep voice by the guy who sang it, Jonathan Richman. The beat that goes along with it is catchy and enjoyable. Ben stiller who plays the unlucky Ted has, in this film, comedy written all over him. He plays his role well and the shift from a high school student to a grown up man is really obvious and greatly done. The make up artists have really done a good job of making an ugly Ted into a ""handsome"" one. Matt Dillon is, what I found in this film, very annoying and hateable and that is a good thing. I think that the director wanted him to be exactly that and Matt Dillon has hit that right on the mark but, of course, that doesn't change the way I fell about him in this movie. His character Pat Healy is very sneaky and manipulative but ""weird"" is the word to describe him. (Minor Spoiler) Which sick man will change his ugly teeth to more uglier ones just to impress the girl he wants to be(Spoiler End). Cameron Diaz on the other hand is more about looks than professionalism. I found her character Mary to be very smart, can't say that in real life though, and attractive, and that is why both of them are after her. Pat Healy describes her as: ""Husband... negative. Children and a Labrador... negative. Tight little package... affirmative."" To put it straight I wasn't too happy with Diaz.Thirteen years ago, Ted (Ben Stiller) was last seen hanging out with a bunch of unattractive guys until he met Mary (Cameron Diaz). Their prom night was gone terribly wrong and his disaster resulted him landing in the hospital. Now, he still can't stop thinking about Mary. He hires a private investigator who goes by the name Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to tail Mary and her retarded brother, Warren. As soon as Pat sets his eyes on Mary, he wants her. He lies to Ted about her being fat and stuck in a wheelchair so he can capture her. He uses his gadgets to eavesdrop on Mary to find out her likes and interests but mostly the man of her dreams. Everything is going great until Ted finds out he is being lied to by a friend, Dom (Chris Elliot), who knows more about Mary than he is letting on. The race begins on who will steal Mary's heart.My favorite bits were: the beginning in the bathroom and when Mary uses Ted's gel on hair, but is it actually gel? The worst bit was everything that contained Pat Healy and his annoying personality. The ending is probably one of the silliest endings in a long time. Of course, I won't spoil it for you but the ending nearly ruined the film, nearly..... The film involves homosexuals, psychopaths, balls, a*s, and a whole load of silliness. Be prepared to check your mood as soon as you start watching this. It is highly recommended for comedy fans because it does not disappoint and the plot for this film will keep viewers entertained. If not, forget that you ever read this review. There's something about Mary........ 7.2/10""His friends would say stop whining, they've had enough of that. / His friends would say stop pining, there's other girls to look at. / They've tried to set him up with Tiffany and Indigo, / But there's something about Mary that they don't know. / Mary, there's just something about Mary.""

Cameron Diaz steals the show,"In this Farraly brothers flick, Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, and Ben stiller all team up to tell us what is so special about Mary. Cameron is definitely the best part of this movie, she really does show her acting chops here. Matt Dillon does alright in his sleezy dirt bag role. Lin Shaye is great in the role of Magda, I enjoyed her funny whacky performance. As for Ben stiller, he did alright I suppose, but personally, I would've preferred a different male lead actor. The comedy works just fine, although it was a bit too crass for my taste at times, like the ""hair gel"" scene for instance, didn't really need to see that LOL. The movie is well paced too, the pace isn't too fast or too slow, it didn't drag, but didn't really feel rushed. There is something about Mary, she stars in a comedy movie that isn't half bad, I actually didn't expect to like it as much as I did. 7/10 for There's something about Mary.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Simply the best,"The Farrely Brothers are still struggling to make another hit movie, that comes close to this effort. But they haven't succeeded (yet). And while everything seems to fit here, you can't but wonder, if it only was a fluke? Are the Farrely Brothers any good or were they just lucky with one movie?Well let's leave this question open and grab a hold of this movie. Ben Stiller is top notch casted as the male leading role. His ability in physical and oral comedy, can't be matched by many. Cameron Diaz and Co. willing to go extra miles (especially the ""hair"" scene is pretty memorable) for any joke. It get's as politically incorrect as it can be, without losing it's touch with the viewers. A great movie indeed, a shame the directors couldn't follow up to that success though ...",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Funny movie, but.....","This is a fun film, but really...can't we make a movie without using the ""F"" word so many times? In ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", Dustin Hoffman's character proved that things can be just as funny without curse words. For instance, when he's being fired from his boss, instead of saying the ""F"" word, he looks at his boss and says, ""Shame on you."" Now that's creatively funny! This film, otherwise, was very fun to watch. Having Brett Favre in the film was a bit much, but it was basically worth a movie-watcher's time. Ben Stiller, as usual, was a hit, but Matt Dillon proves to us once again that he can play any role. Good job, Matt. One thing I would have left out was the shot of one of Ben's testicles hanging out. Even though it was not a real shot of one, some people would not know this or appreciate it. That was in poor taste in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Still outrageously funny,"There are few films as well done as 'There's Something About Mary.' Of course that doesn't mean that it's for everyone, as there are some scenes there that some may find 'offensive,' but, apart from those few who are easily shocked by scenes of 'adult humour,' it should be appreciated by most.The 'romantic comedy' format of film-making is as old as the hills: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again. Now, without wishing to 'spoil' the story too much, 'There's Something About Mary' hardly breaks that rule, but it's all about the way it's told.I've already mentioned the humour. It's NOT for all the family. There are plenty of jokes that could be considered (a) bad taste (b) adult in nature or (c) both. However, don't go thinking that this is going to be some sort of raunchy adult comedy with bawdy characters constantly engaging in slapstick comedy and who you won't care about. Somehow, this film actually gives us some rather touching moments which go a little deeper than your average 'boy meets girl' film.It's probably something about the cast. Sometimes everything (or I should probably say everyONE) just falls into place. It's hardly an 'ensemble' film, but there are a few different characters to keep track of and therefore some different story arcs to follow. Most of the marketing of the movie was focused on (then!) Box Office goldmine Cameron Diaz and you could be mistaken for thinking that she was practically starring in the film all on her own. However, it's worth mentioning that Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon are both excellent in their roles. They provide some great conflict and male insecurities which contrast Diaz's sweetness.The other two characters that are worth a mention are Chris Elliot and Lee Evans. Elliot isn't given as much screen time as the rest, but whenever he's in front of camera he's worth every moment. If the film has a weak spot - in my opinion - it's Lee Evans. I don't know why, but I've never been a fan of his manic stand-up and I find his performance about as enjoyable as his 'gags.'Perhaps the best thing about the film is that - even after over twenty years - it's still as funny as it was when it first came out. It doesn't seem to have aged at all and, whether you're just looking for a 'boy meets girl' film, or something a little more outrageous and adult in nature, this one should tick all the boxes you're looking for. And, if your only knowledge of the film is that off picture of Cameron Diaz with the funny hair-do, then the scene that you'll be waiting for is very much worth the wait.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
An okay comedy!,"Lee Evans in particular is really funny in this movie, who I also loved in Mouse Hunt. At first it didn't seem like something I'd like with how they made fun of the mentally disabled guy and how over the top some of the things were with the puppy getting hurt, but eventually I got the point of what this movie was trying to be with its comedic style. Cameron Diaz has been in some bad on-animated movies but I can't consider this to be one of those necessarily. She played a good character and Ben Stiller did as well! It was clever how all of the guys who lied to her wound up together in the same room in the end and I laughed at a few scenes for sure. I don't entirely regret watching!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A very disappointing, boring movie.","A few scenes in this movie were funny, but I thought most of it was just boring, slow-moving, and dumb, like something you'd expect in a bad TV sitcom. None of the characters were at all likeable, and I found it very hard to believe that the air-head Mary was supposed to be an orthopedic surgeon! Although I'm not easily offended (I loved Pink Flamingos), I thought the way they ridiculed the man on crutches was inexcusable, and not at all funny. It made me cringe. I liked Kingpin, but I hated this movie. I'm at a loss to understand why so many people liked it. I want my $3.00 back from the video store.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
There's something about this movie,"Regardless of being considered 'another raunchy rom-com' at face value, beneath it is something truly funny and endearing, with several quirky characters in their pursuits of Mary.Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon make perfect contrasting leads with two very different approaches in seeing Mary through numerous situations that increase in absurdity and hilarity. Cameron Diaz is perfectly kind as Mary, playing the unaware-but-not-dumb in reaction to the men in her life pining for her. The heart of the story fits very well, portraying the fear of losing your one chance at love and what you'd be willing to do to attain it.The range of comedy goes from relatable to absurd in a heartbeat, almost always seamlessly, and the final act I feel like couldn've been expanded upon a bit more. The humour probably won't speak to everyone, but I think the raunchy nature really amplifies the movie as a comedy.But overall, There's Something About Mary is a hilariously heartfelt treat that's sure to make most audiences laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
There's something about movie makers that are out to impress!,"Ted is recounting the story of his first and only true love Mary. After defending her handicapped brother Mary starts to get to know the goofy Ted and begins to like him, even inviting him to the prom. However, after going to her house and getting his genitals caught in his zip the evening goes from bad to worse with Ted spending the night in hospital and missing the prom.After years of failed relationships Ted reminisces about Mary with his best friend who advises him to seek her out through a private detective friend of his (Played deliciously by Matt Dillon!) who also falls for Mary along with every other man in the film, thus begins this comedy of errors that made both Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz a star and put Matt Dillon back on the map, and also, to some degree, began the rebirth of American comedy.This film has largely been forgotten in moviegoers minds by more recent films such as ""American Pie"" ""40 year old virgin"" and ""Knocked up"", but this is the film that started that flurry in that it shocked people with how far it could go. The sight gags are side-splittingly funny and the physical comedy throughout is hilarious, from Matt Dillon playing ball to the legendary dog fight, it's all good. The script is great and allows all the characters to shine, but as always with films like this it's the chemistry between the leads that's the key and Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz come together with such charm and ease that it carries you along.As with a number of other examples over time,such as ""Rocky"", ""Airplane"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", it is clear that the Farrelly brothers had a very clear indication of what they wanted to do with comedy and put a lot of themselves in there and it shows. Their passion for their craft has never been more in evidence.In an age when so many films get to the top of the box office by hype and advertising. It clawed it's way to the top because people saw it and saw it again and the reason they did that is because it is that good.True the crude humour won't be to everyone's taste, but if you've got the stomach for some belly laughs and a small amount of smut, then you can't go far wrong here.Megatron!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Well, well, well, who would have thought that I would have a good time watching this!","Knowing that this movie was made by the same directors who did movies like Dumb and Dumber and Dumb and Dumberer I already feared the worst. I don't mind having a good laugh, but at least give me some mature humor and not the farting, vomiting,... kind, because that's just childish. Even though it sometimes seems to go that way (using sperm as hair gel or getting with your penis stuck in your zipper), this movie wasn't too bad after all.Surprisingly enough they added a love story that was quite enjoyable. A man is looking for his dream girl from high school. Even though their first date (the school prom) went terribly wrong and he hasn't heard of her since, he has never forgotten about her. He sends out a private investigator to find her and to find out if she's married or not. The P.I. does his job, but falls in love with her himself...The acting is OK and the story is interesting.

We all had a 'Mary' in our life ...,"They're beautiful, they embrace life with an extraordinary optimism and wherever they come, it's like sunshine blossoming all over the place. The world is full of girls like Mary, pretty to both eyes and hearts, whose beauty never nourished a snobbish attitude that we'd have forgiven anyway. Cameron Diaz is the titular Mary, and Mary is not just a name, but a concept.We all had a Mary, a 'prettiest girl' in school, one that melted the hearts of studs and athletes as much as geeks and losers; all boys devoted their admiration for Mary like embracing an inaccessible dream. I was in love with a 'Mary' during almost ten years. Needless to say that it wasn't reciprocal, but I never cared, if she smiled at me, she'd had made my day, if she talked, I would spend one minute thinking of the best response, and if we had a date , well, only my dreams involved me as the 'lucky one'.""There's Something About Mary"" is a cinematic tribute to this eternal lovely figure that either enchanted or indirectly ruined our memories.And Cameron Diaz, with her blonde hair, communicative smile and eternally positive attitude, embodied the most fascinating traits of these dream-like creatures. Her performance is perfect because she is genuinely sweet, tender and funny beyond her sexiness. She's such a good person, she even asks Ted (Ben Stiller) to be her cavalier for the prom. Granted movies have their shares of geeky escapism, but Cameron Diaz makes believable that such a girl would not feel indifferent to an awkward braces-wearing schmuck like Stiller. It's believable because these girls are so often labeled as inaccessible by average guys that no one dares to seduce them, which makes them inexperienced enough to fall for the one who tries, inviting the other adulators to come off their holes.Directed by the Farrelly Brothers, ""Mary"" is about a confrontation between men who have all in common, their obsessive fascination for 'Mary'. Since, it's not a game with a win-win situation, it's up to the most sincere, the most clever or the most malicious to win her heart. And this simple premise leads to one of the funniest comedies of the 90's, a laugh riot from beginning to end. For the trivia, the film made the last Gene Siskel's Top 10 before his death in 1999, it was in the Top 10 highest-grossing movies of 1998, and holds a honorable 27th spot in the American Film Institute Top 100 comedies as the most recent film to make it in the list.And there's a reason why the film meets with such popular acclaim: it IS funny to a level of slapstick that could have only been possible in a spoof movie, which ""Mary"" is not, but it's beyond labels and no gag is taken for granted, they're all pushed to their extreme limits. And for its risk-taking approach to humor, the film succeeds. Take the unfortunate 'zipper' accident that ruins what could have been Ted's life highlight (and turned out to be the whole opposite), showing the reactions of all the community was already hilarious, but the film doesn't hesitate to give us an 'explicit' idea about the state of Ted's genitals. We never know what we see exactly, but we know it might hurt like hell.After the incident, Mary moves to Florida and Ted loses touch with her, for several years and determined to find out her new whereabouts, in order to exorcise his unfulfilled obsessions, he hires Matt Dillon as a private-eye. Even more brilliant than his casting, the idea of putting this villainous old-fashioned mustache in Dillon is a stroke of genius, because only a naive guy like Ted could have trusted him. But that's what makes Stiller one of the most defining losers of the 90's, what his subsequent series of misadventures never contradict. I won't spoil all the gags, but some have already penetrated Pop-Culture forever they deserve more than a mention.Yes, I'm speaking of the infamous hair gel. Before his date with Mary, Ted's friend, played by Chris Elliot, advises him to pleasure himself, because ""the most honest moment in a man's life are the few minutes after he's blown his load - now that is a medical fact"". Kudos to the writers for such a line full of wisdom because it is true! The whole 'blowing' process is a nice gag, the mysterious disappearance of the seminal liquid, is intriguing and funny, but the final punch line is enough to give the film its ticket in the ¨Pantheon of great comedies"", much more for Mary's reaction which, as silly as it is, keeps her in character, yes, she's still the well-meaning and innocent Mary.And that's the film's secret beyond its crude and raunchy humor, forgive me the cliché; it has a heart, incarnated by Mary. She's the Pandora box or Helen of Troy, inspiring her little fan-club the most deceitful ways to win her. Stiller, Dillon and Elliot are perfect, the other cast features a disabled close friend who's not totally blameless, a roommate named Magda who seemed to have spent her whole life in a UV oven, and naturally, there's no comedy without a scene-stealing animal, the dog in ""Mary"" reduces the one from ""Mask"" to the level of ""Benji"". There's also a weird guitarist playing the 'Greek chorus' figure, and whose final shot will be a double satisfaction for viewers, the second being the nice twist on the happy-ending, perhaps the only forgivable bit of unoriginality.But it's still funny, warm, touching in fact, there's something about ""Mary"" that touches your heart, because it's still about two people learning to love each other without lying or stalking. It's all about honest love. What was wrong with these guys? They idolized Mary, and maintained their passion on a love-at-first-sight level, while it takes more to win a girl's heart, especially a girl like Mary ...",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"This movie is bad! Really, really bad!","I decided to watch this movie because Cameron Diaz was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. Despite the fact that Cameron is a fine young actress, I regret having wasted my time watching this movie.  The ""something"" about Mary must be that; she attracts all those outlaws, who keep competing to see who is the worst idiot she has attracted. Cameron is a young doctor who does nothing related to medicine in the movie. I just did not get what is funny about this movie! Ben Stiller, who is normally a good actor, plays this loser.  In the beginning he wears this horrible wig pretending to be young and is not convincing at all. Since I did not watch Dumb and Dumber I am unable to cross reference. But my recommendation is stay away from this movie. It is awful! There is no script or point to this race of the out-laws that cute young doctor attracts. The writers seem of have simply tried to collect all the dumb gags associated with attraction to women and thrown them all together in this hodge podge script.What is suprising to me is that they found someone to pay for this film to be made.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"What is that line about ""time to leave childish things . . .""?","Since it was only 101 minutes, the Farrelly boys had plenty of room to really make this film a comedy classic -- by persuading Spielberg to allow them to include the opening scene from ""Saving Private Ryan"" -- then, by the time we got to the genital mutilation, police brutality, and paraplegic contortions, we would truly be rolling in the aisles.  Sorry folks, I wish I could say that I just don't get it, but sadly, I do -- living in the real world gives one enough insight into why this ""comedy"" scores an 8.5 in the IMDb voting poll and a similar reaction in the man/woman in the street.

Unfortunately I have no aspirations to see it again... or the sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than you remember,"Anyone who has seen a Farrelly brothers movie before will know what to expect here; plenty of trademark lowbrow humour, but blended with enough warmth and heart that they have created a minor 90s classic.That this film is better than expected is due in no small part to the star wattage of Cameron Diaz, who is radiant and dazzling as the free-spirited Mary; casting a spell of longing over every guy who meets her, and inadvertently turning them into obsessed stalkers.Ben Stiller too is perfectly cast, as a sweet natured admirer who you'll want to win the race for Mary's affections. But the course of true love never did run smooth, and series of bad luck incidents threaten to derail his dreams.Standing in his way are a supporting cast including Mat Dillon, putting in a memorable turn as a douchebag private detective, and Keith David having a lot of fun as Mary's over protective step-father. But although it's great to see Lee Evans being cast in a U. S. movie, his American accent here is perhaps best forgotten.However extra plus points must also be given for the casting of Jonathan Richman as a quirky guitar strumming singer, who appears periodically to give the film exposition. And of course for Puffy the dog, who threatens to steal every scene he is in, as a small yappy mutt, whose bark may, or may not, be worse than his bite.So yes, this is still just essentially a film that promises and delivers it's fair share of crude laughs. (No Mary; that ISN'T hair gel that Ben Stiller is wearing.)But by the time the movie ends, with a crowd-pleasing cast singalong of ""Build Me Up Buttercup"" by The Foundations, you may just find that you feel a little bit happier in your heart than you did a couple of hours earlier.Which is to be saluted.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Comedy I Absolutely Love,"This movie needs another review like California needs a drier climate. Seriously, I can't help myself because this might just be my favorite comedy of all time.This is the perfect storm of political incorrectness matching the talents of Ben Stiller, Matt Dillon, Chris Elliott,Cameron Diaz, and The Farrelly Brothers hitting everyone's sweet-spot all at once. Then there's the devices of Jonathan Richman's surreal interjection and the musical soundtrack itself. What a great atmosphere to spring a hilarious story from! Plus, for all the ""take no prisoner's"" satire there's an actual heart too.The movie moves quite well as it paints loser Ted growing up, finding his love, tripping everything up (as expected, yet hilariously not as expected), and never forgetting aboutMary. The journey he takes is absolute gold. So many funny things making repeated viewing not just mandatory, but even better.Now, I think I must admit this kind of comedy isn't so wonderfully entertaining to everyone. In fact, it's kind of a cult group who, many years later, still count this as a comedic watershed moment. But, if you like it in the first 15-minutes then it just gets better and you know who you are. I wish this kind of magic could be more of regular thing. I mean The Farrelly's were really on to something here. I've enjoyed many of their other movies such as Dumb and Dumber and Me, Myself, and Irene (this one almost as much). But, as of 2014 the latest version of D&DTo (liked it well enough, not great though) makes it clear there's been a big void in the years since. I'll just watch this again to help fill it in! It's that good in my humble opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Something about this seems off,"The Farrelly Brothers always try to include at least one gross out scene in their movies. In There's Something About Mary the scene is when Ben Stiller is masturbating before his big date with Cameron Diaz. When Stiller finishes, he goes to the door only to find out the sperm is on his ear. Diaz mistakes it for hair gel, puts it in her hair, and that leads to one of many comical situations in There's Something About Mary.While not all of the film is hilarious, many scenes to squeeze out a bad or a good laugh. Ben Stiller plays Ted Stroehmann who was a geeky braceface in High School who had a date with Mary (Diaz) for Senoir Prom. Because of an embarrassing accident Ted was unable to accompany Mary to that prom and has never seen her since.Thirteen years later, Ted hires Pat (Dillon), a sleazeball private detective who falls head of heels when he finds Mary who now lives in Miami. Pat lies to Ted about Mary's life so he can have her all to herself. Ted believes something is up, and it becomes a game for Mary's love.Cameron Diaz is one of my favorite female leads because she is one of the very actors/actresses that can go crazy without getting carried away. Unlike Jim Carrey who is so over the top and ridiculous he is unwatchable, but Diaz has smarts and clever wit behind her gags which makes her a joy to watch on screen.There's Something About Mary is way more clever than Dumb and Dumber, but it still has things that bother me. Mainly the ridiculous and obnoxious scenes of Ben Stiller fighting with Mary's roommate's dog Puffy that goes on and on. Obviously the dog fighting is not real, but I've always felt squeamish, uncomfortable, and just upset by anytime of animal harm in films.The scene is around three minutes in length, and it's unnecessary. I don't see the humor of a grown humor wrestling with a dog on a floor bending, squeezing, choking, strangling, and harming a defenseless dog. Major downfall in the quality just because of an unnecessary scene.Besides the mean-spirited clip, There's Something About Mary not only charms in humor but it's characters are strong. Stiller and Dillon are a great on screen pair even though Dillon makes you hate his character the whole time he is on screen. Not to mention Chris Elliot is great as well. The true highlight is Cameron Diaz, but the whole cast is just perfect in their own right.There's Something About Mary is a few points shy of being ""the perfect comedy"" film.Starring: Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Chris Elliot, Lee Evans, and Lin Shaye.

One of the best films of the year,"The Farrelly brothers' There's Something About Mary is a crude yet surprisingly sweet comedy that involves a 13-year crush, a casted up dog, and a zipper problem (Beans above the frank is quite the original gag).  The film turns out to be a top notch comedy that puts the characters into ridiculous yet hilarious situations that makes them even more like-able. These characters include the Pathetic detective (Matt Dillon), the 2-sided personality (Lee Evans), the real one who's in love (Ben Stiller) and the apple of their eyes Mary (Played nice by Cameron Diaz).  Packed into 2 hours of gross-out comedy, this film is the funniest film of the year, and of many others.  A++",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A fun movie with some genuinely funny moments,"Though I wouldn't put ""There's Something About Mary"" on the AFI list of best comedies of all time, it does have some genuinely funny moments.  Basically, the film is uneven and dull in spots, but if often works.  And when it delivers, it delivers with a bang.  I still wish I could find the zipper scene as incredibly funny as everyone else, but being a guy the gag is just too painful to be funny.  The gag is directed very well by the Farrellys, with some funny moments where unexpected strangers barge in on Stiller during the unfortunate accident, but the overall scene had me groaning more than laughing.  It's funny how if you showed a guy getting his hand sawed off with a chainsaw, I probably wouldn't cringe, but I cannot watch a guy getting his genitals stuck in his zipper.  So for all you women reading this, yes it's that painful!  However, the hair gel scene is classic.  Ben Stiller is great in the lead, but Matt Dillon made me laugh the most as his sleazy character, and his performance is really underrated.  There's one scene where Mary giggles with her friends after she says, ""I have a vibrator.""  Matt laughs along, sitting one table away.  Then the girls get silent and looks towards Matt, and he goes completely silent.  His reaction during that moment always cracks me up.  And of course, the scenes with the dog are really funny as well.  Cameron Diaz is perfectly cast as the beautiful, yet sweet and friendly, Mary.  Lee Evans as Mary's architect friend also gives an underrated performance.  If you watch the movie, you'll see why.  Chris Elliott is a hit-or-miss comic actor.  I've seen much more obnoxious comics than him, yet his schtick doesn't always pan out.  I certainly could've done without him in this movie, and the joke about the ""love blisters"" was just plain disgusting.  The Farrellys are great at what they do, but comedy's a subjective process and though I may feel they go overboard with certain gags, other people may have different opinions.  But I was laughing most of the time and that's all that counts.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The ugly duckling of romantic-comedies...,"Background:I am a 24 year old male engineering and computer science student living in SC. I do have a large humanities background.Overview:I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. I think that it is the ugly duckling of romantic-comedies. It was quite some time into the movie before I was one over by this film. At first for some reason I tried to take it seriously even though it is completely obvious that do so is pointless.If you have ever wondered what is the worst thing that could have ever possibly happen at your prom, or if anyone's prom experience was worse than yours, then this movie is worth your time. (If you are a guy you might need to seek therapy afterwards; it is pretty traumatic.)If you think that you have the worst luck in the world, then check out this movie. If you don't think it could get any worse, all you have to do is wait a little while, and then it does in this one.I think some of the shock comedy routines were a bit too much, but the movie would come off as too serious, lame, and corny without them. (Movie has a R rating because of nudity; it is not what you are expecting.)I think this is good movie to watch on TV or HBO and maybe rent if you are having a hard time finding something to watch. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it but I don't regret having watch it.Thanks.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"terrible, terrible, terrible","I am actually angry.

Don't you know how terrible this is!?!? What's so funny?!?"" Little automatons laughing at the most sophomoric humor to grace the screen since Ben Stiller first decided he was funny. Oh, and by sophomoric I mean high school sophomores, little kids who giggle at the word ""masturbate"" (did I hear Beavis and Butthead?), who snicker at the thought of a scrotom-in-zipper scenario - even if it is milked for twenty minutes!! I've actually heard (I need to sit down for this part), I've actually heard some people remark on this movie's ""daring""?!? As if showing a crippled guy try to pick up keys is either original or funny. Don't you dare give these writers credit for what amounts to twenty minutes of script writing claptrap. What's REALLY funny? Think about it. Not what embarrasses you (hair gel - that's not funny, that's easy. EASY. That's not a joke, that's kids hanging out on the street corner. That's - I've got it! That's stupid!). Not what is tragic (the dog scene - and I don't mean the creative crotch biting, which no one has seen before, I mean the animal's near death experience. Setting it on fire is funny? Think about it. What kind of laughter is that generating, really?). I mean, what is truly funny? Sure as hell isn't this movie. You know what? Most people in the movie theater laughed. Did you ever see the original ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers""? Remember that guy who runs around screaming they're going to get us? It appears I'm that guy (even friends of mine liked this movie).

Jon Monsarrat review: a top comedy of all time,"I used to love this film. It's wacky, the timing is right on, and there's a real plot. I read the autobiography of Chuck Jones, the creator of Bugs Bunny, who said that for comedy you need the protagonist to be a straight man and the world is wacky around him. Otherwise, if the protagonist is the weirdo, it's farce, and for some reason comedy works and farce doesn't. There's Something About Mary gets that balance right, but the weirdness doesn't consume the film so that the plot no longer matters. We can still identify with the characters. Matt Dillon is especially good.But, years later rewatching it... It's just too creepy to base a movie on guys stalking their love interest in a ""boys will be boys"" way.

One of Farrellys' best,"From the Farrelly brothers, this is their highly inappropriate entry. After Dumb & Dumber and Kingpin, they're going further into outrageousness. Has there ever been another zipper incident filmed like that? That was some visual of those twig and berries. Who could forget the hair gel? Ted (Ben Stiller) is a nice guy who come to the defence of Mary (Cameron Diaz)'s mentally handicap brother. She agrees to go to the prom, but something terrible happens and they don't see each other for 13 years. He still pines for her, and hires sleazy PI Healy (Matt Dillon) to find her. Only Healy falls for her too, and he uses all his underhanded skills to get her.If there was one problem, it was that Ben Stiller couldn't get involved with Cameron Diaz sooner. For a long while, Cameron Diaz and Matt Dillon were doing their dance all by themselves. A more tougher write could have integrated everybody. That is a minor problem which is soon forgotten with the craziness. I remember as we got up to leave the theater, I hear a little girl bugging her big sister about what was behind his ear, and the big sis who couldn't shut her up. That's when I knew that it was mission accomplished.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!,"FARRELLY brothers. Absolutely, near perfect script. And a belly laugh every few minutes, especially 2nd half. Great cast, Cameron Diaz starts portraying a high school senior, very believably despite being 26.I'm not going into the plot, because you deserve to see it, sans preconceptions. I'll just say, Mary is the center of fantasy, for many men, not the least of which is an NFL QB.I will either thumbs down, hem and haw, or vote thumbs up.

Adolescent hilarity,"Here's how you know you're watching a keeper: when Brett Favre shows up with his complete lack of screen presence, yet the laughter continues unabated.""There's Something About Mary"" is every winning virtue of the Farrelly Brothers served up in an oddball love story. It moves seamlessly from an awkward teen movie straight into middle-aged depravity. Just an array of sleazy characters, and they are hysterical; chiefly Keith David, Matt Dillon and Chris Klein. As if the one-liners aren't enough, you've got the story of Ted's prom night from Hell, or the story of Mongo the special kid on a leash.This had me in stitches back in the '90s and it still does today.

"Undoubtedly funny, undoubtedly not the funniest","There's something about Mary. But there's something missing about Mary, too. Many reviews were promising unending laughs while viewing this film. They were promising a new surprise every few minutes, hilarious and provocating fun from the Farrellys. Everybody was speaking about the cojones-munching dog, the zip scene or a particular kind of gel, and I expected other gags like these to be contained in the film. Unfortunately, all the scenes people were speaking about were all the scenes that were worth seeing... (okay, I'd enjoy a marathon of Bergman movies if they were acted by Cameron Diaz, but it doesn't matter...) After all, the so called ""innovative"" humour of the film, the gags everybody would be indigned to see were not so innovative. Kevin Smith movies are more laughable than this ""Mary"" on that part... So, there's definitely something about Mary... but that something is not sheer genius, just good craft, two hours of fun, a life to remember.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"There's something horrible about this ""comedy""","The first word that comes to mind with this movie is BORING. Truly boring! And pathetically disappointing! I have seen hundreds and hundreds of movies over the years, and some very very funny comedies, but this one?? Where do I start? Not one scene made me laugh or even smile...not one! I am glad to see that I am not the only one here who can agree. Like some users have said: This has got to be one of the most overrated movies of the 90's. And I agree with the user who said that this is one of those movies it's ""cool to say you like"".So, so true! Every now and then, movies come out that become trendy and 'everyone has to see it'. Then, as it receives much hype in press and media, I seriously believe many people are afraid to be 'different', and so they choose to say that they too thought it was good even though they keep their true opinion to themselves. (other examples of this phenomenon are ""SkinDeep"", ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"" - all among the worst movies I have ever paid to see).And by the way, in no way did I think this movie was 'disgusting' or 'gross'. No, it was just plain UNFUNNY and so bad that I truly question what modern comedy-making has come to. Look at ""Scary Movie"" as well.....yet another modern movie that's supposed to be funny, but is one of the worst alleged 'comedies' I have ever seen.If you wanna see a *good* example of a comedy that manages to actually use sexual jokes and crudity on a TRULY FUNNY level, go see ""Ford Fairlane"".If you wanna see *good* examples of movies that can be BOTH 'gross' (and actually can be called gross) AND funny - go see ""Dead Alive"", ""Army of Darkness"" or ""Evil Dead II""I am embarrassed on behalf of the people who made this movie and I will from now on stay away from anything they make.

"A fun movie I enjoyed, but I wasn't a fan of the humour","There's Something About Mary (1998) follows a man who messes up his shot with his prom date, years later, he gets the opportunity to see her again. I definitely enjoyed watching this film, but it's also a very strange movie. I honestly have no idea how I felt about it, it was fun but definitely a product of its time.I'd firstly like to address my main issue with the film. I expected it to be outdated, but it seemed bad even for the 90s! Some of the humour was personally hard for me to look past, it was just too problematic. This was a shame, as the non-offensive jokes were pretty funny and I liked the ridiculous and slapstick humour.Carrying on from my previous point, another reason I found it to be problematic was because of the bad message. It seemed to normalise and excuse stalking, and the film as a whole gets a lot more creepy the more I think about it. I just feel as if Mary was a victim of everyone, and I was honestly hoping she'd get back with Brett!Moving on to the visuals, which were pretty good! The cinematography wasn't anything special but I don't really think it needed to be, but the film consisted of a lot of colourful set design which I liked! It was bright and well lit, and I also really loved the characters' costuming.The acting was poor, but I think this added to the 90s cheesy charm. I initially watched this film for Matt Dillon, and I found his character to be pretty funny and consistently interesting to watch. Lin Shaye was also in this film, her character was unexpected to say the least. Lastly, Mary was a sweet and caring character, Cameron Diaz did very well in the role!Last of all, this movie was fast paced and fun, and I can't deny that it was entertaining. It definitely wasn't anything special, but it was a good movie to have on in the background as it was an easy watch.

Outrageously hilarious gross-out comedy from auteur siblings in silliness, The Farrelly Brothers  Bobby & Peter  clearly out-doing themselves in taking sick humor to all new levels.

Funny and Entertaining,"There's Something About Mary is a crazy romantic comedy film. It is pretty predictable but it is still fun to watch. The comedy in this film is definitely not your normal comedy. There is a lot of language and sexual innuendo in this film but it isn't really completely inappropriate. Even with all the craziness in this film there is still a nice story that is being told. This film is about being who you are and living with no regrets.The movie starts out with Ted (Ben Stiller) who is kind of a geeky, teenage boy. He likes this girl named Mary (Cameron Diaz) who is a beautiful, popular girl. Ted sticks up for a boy who is being picked on and this boy happens to be Mary's brother. After this the two of them are supposed to go to prom together. When Ted shows up to take Mary to the prom he is using the restroom and has an unfortunate zipper accident which sends him to the hospital. After this Mary and her family move away and Ted does not see her again.The movie then jumps ahead 14 years and Ted is in therapy discussing the issue. He talks about what happened and how he regrets never getting to see Mary again. He then decides to hire Healy (Matt Dillion) to go to Miami which is where Mary is now and ""spy"" on her. Healy does this and realizes that he wants Mary for himself so he reports back to Ted that she is still in Miami and he makes her sound unattractive so that Ted will change his mind about calling her. This works for a while but then Ted realizes what Healy did and he goes down to Miami to talk to Mary. This is not without a little convincing himself though. He is not sure that he is comfortable enough to do this. Eventually he works up enough nerve to go and talk to her. The two of them hit it off and begin dating until Mary finds out, through an anonymous letter, that Ted had sent Healy to spy on her. This is where Ted begins to realize that he needs to just get over himself and tell her how he feels. As he is walking out of her house, after they argue about the situation, he tells her the only reason that he did this was because he needed to find out once and for all what would have happened.After this Mary is forced to make a decision as to who she wants to be with. She can be with Ted or she can be with Healy, who basically stalks her. Obviously she chooses Ted; it would be silly if the movie ended any other way.There is one thing that I think this film does really well. That would be characterization. As I stated earlier this movie is crazy but at the center of it there is a really good story. The characters are really important to that story. I think the producers did a really good job casting the actors that they did. All of the actors portray the characters the way they were meant to be portrayed I think.Overall I feel this movie was good. It is not my kind of movie but I still enjoyed the story and the characters. It is always nice to see a character work through some issues or regrets they may have and be happy in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Genuinely funny raunchy romantic comedy,"After over 21 years since its release and having watching this film for the first time, can say that expectations were met. Of course having heard much praise about this film in regards to it being one of the better romantic comedies, as well as one of the Farrelly brothers best films.What makes the film great and entertaining are not only the performances from the main cast of Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz and Matt Dillon bit that it isn't completely predictable and the humor works.Many have claimed that the comedy is too gross or low brow but that is the style of the Farrelly brothers. And given that, this is more than a typical rom-com which is perhaps what some people had not initially realized prior to viewing. Though the raunchy and subtle gross out humor is what makes this movie more enjoyable.The pace of the film moves solid with it being under two hours but there is plenty of things that occur along the way keeping one on the edge of their seat.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
There's Something About Nothing...,"I don't understand all the hype about this film. Okay, so it's irreverant. That doesn't always mean funny.The film starts out in the mid-eighties, when geeky high-schooler Ted Stroehmann (played by Ben Stiller) finds the girl of his dreams -- Mary (Cameron Diaz). After being nice to Mary's mentally deformed brother, Ted is asked by Mary to go to the prom with her. But due to some ""unfortunate incidents,"" Ted is unable to take her, and we warp to 1997/8.Ted keeps thinking about Mary, so his friend (Chris Elliot) gets a Private Investigator (Matt Dillon) to track down Mary.Pretty soon, everyone is heading head-over-heels regarding Mary, and a predictable ending sums up the film.Okay, here's the review: the film started out great. I enjoyed all the jokes in the beginning, and was not bothered by the politically incorrect jokes that most people who hated this film were offended by.But, once we warp to '97, the jokes start to fall flat -- and plain disgusting -- and I wondered why audiences and critics around the globe loved this film. Another big turn-off for me was the ""cleaning the tubes"" scene. We didn't need visuals, Farrelly brothers.I did chuckle throughout the film, but I expected ""Mary"" to be the best comedy of the year. What a let-down.I was the rare person who enjoyed ""Dumb and Dumber."" It rides along the line of crude and normal, and never passes the line. ""Mary,"" however, crosses the line shamelessly, and never gets back on track. It just keeps slipping farther and farther into immature, eighth grade, gross-out humor. The fact the Peter and Bobby Farrelly have to subject audiences to such disgusting visuals and gags is disappointing, and I think they should be ashamed of themselves.I like Ben Stiller, but this film was just too raunchy and unfunny to enjoy his performance. I could tell he tried to make it funny, but it just failed. I saw on AMC that he didn't want to do the ""cleaning the tubes"" scene because he was afraid it would ruin his career. I don't blame him.""Mary"" overall has some laughs, but not enough, and despite being crude or not, it still is not an outrageously funny film, and not the best of 1998.2.5/5 stars --John Ulmer",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

3/5 Good. Worth Watching,"USA 1998 Directors: Peter Farrelly & Bobby Farrelly Cast: Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Chris Elliott, Lin Shaye, Lee Evans, W. Earl BrownIn these awfully politically correct times, its sometimes refreshing to sit through an exercise in bad taste, an area Something About Mary excels in. Fortunately, it is also funny with a sporadic spattering of true 'laugh out loud' moments.The story is all about Ben (Stiller), consumed with regret about the fact that he well and truly messed up his only chance with high school sweetheart Mary (Diaz) during an ill-fated prom night thirteen years earlier, decides to do something about it - locate Mary through the deviously sly private investigator Patt Healy (Dillion). Unfortunately for Ben, Patt has ulterior motives...Ben Stiller is his usual self in a role not too dissimilar from any of his other roles. Cameron Diaz is also good, and creates adequate screen chemistry with her many devotees (!). But ultimately, the 'star' (probably a misnomer) of this film is Matt Dillon, a fact largely due to the script as opposed to the acting performance he gives, which is more than sufficient for a film of this type. To be honest however, we aren't given characters we truly care about, but rather fodder to the endless string of gags, which often works against the film.The laughs come thick and fast, however at times it feels as if the Farrely brothers go somewhat overboard in an attempt to induce fits of laughter with many scenes having a very contrived feel to them. Likely their previous work, the humor is not of the subtle and witty type, and the feather the Farrelly brothers attempt to tickle the audience with is of industrial strength. Though despite the crassness, it is overall quite a sweet film, which will leave most audiences warm and fuzzy as opposed to repelled.After such tripe as Kingpin and Dumb and Dumber, The Farrelly brothers have delivered a comedy not only lewd and vulgar but also funny. This isn't fine art, but it never aspires to be. Worth watching just as long as you aren't expecting anything remotely intellectual. Not the best comedy out there, but harmless fun nevertheless.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Mary is so vacuous and boring it is hard to imagine all these blokes being obsessed with her, but then again, electrocuted dogs and hairsprog is all part of the kind of humour that leaves you chortling and squirming in this escapist effort.

"So Funny, but, Is it really necessary to say the ""f"" word so many times?","Wow, what a good comedy; ""Something about Mary"" is going to make you laugh either you want it or not. The jokes are so outrageous that or you're going to chuckle, to laugh, or to crack up as i did almost the whole time.The story is about Ted, a nerdy guy who is in love with the nicest and prettiest girl of the school: Mary. When he luckily gets to go to the prom with Mary, and he's going to pick her up at her house, one of the most hilarious sequence of the movie starts, you'll laugh so hard that you're going to have to see it one more time to catch all the phrases and dialog.But, the sequence ends, and now we are in the present, with Ted still in love with Mary; so he hires by a friend's advise Pat Healy, to spy on her, though he denies that he's a stalker, and then almost every man that gets to know Mary falls for her.But that's not the best this movie has to offer. This is a basic, simple plot to have a lot of explosive funny sequences, and there are a very good amount of good ones.SPOILERS AHEAD:1-The zipper sequence. 2-The dog resurrection sequence. 3-The masturbation scene (wait till you hear the background music and that scene) 4-The gel part. 5-The fight Ted vs. Dog. 6-The reunion of all the creeps who are in love with Mary. 7-And a final murder of a singer.Those are the highligths, but you are certainly going to find a lot more in here.My only personal objection is the 40 f... words; I mean, they could have take out all the f words, and the movie would have been as funny as it is, but is good anyway. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"if you're not with us, you're against us...","...I speak, of course, about those people who actually have a sense of humor: bawdy, high-brow, crude, intelligent. If it's funny, it's funny.Rather than going into detail about why this movie was so funny, I'd like to stand on my soapbox and reprimand the people who just didn't get it. I've seen a lot of BAD comedies; I dare say that a majority of movies that strive for that genre marginally produce laughter from me. There's nothing worse than a contrived comedy scene that fails to make you laugh.But, considering all of this movie's contrived scenes, I can't imagine for a second that anyone would think this comedy to be over the top or gratuitous in any way. The bawdy and prurient scenes certainly push the envelope of what we're used to in any movie, but they're all logical conclusions to the comedy sequences in which they belong. And boy, they made me laugh to the point of embarrassment since I'm so not used to laughing so hard.I also have a problem with the word ""offensive,"" because just about anything put into a context in which it doesn't belong can be deemed ""offensive."" Even a Cross. Or an American flag.Now, I thought Dumb and Dumber was horrible and contrived. Kingpin was great, but was less of a comedy than it was a cult-ish romp of fun. But there's something about Something About Mary... the Farelly brothers have perfected what they've strived for in their past films.So, if you don't get it, you're either a) a victim of the dumbed down, politically correct, sterile intellect that is constantly being pushed by the mainstream media, or b) just no damn fun to be around.

Simply unpleasant to watch,"I know I'm a freak.  Everybody else loved this movie, but I detested it.I simply found it unpleasant to watch.  I'm not opposed to physical comedy -- I thought ""The Naked Gun"" was hysterical.  I'm not even opposed to comedy in bad taste -- I thought ""Eating Raul"" was terrific.No, this film just had few redeeming characteristics.All the characters in this film, with the exception of Mary herself, are hateful, deceitful, pathetic monsters.  I don't care about them other than mildly hoping they'll get what they want so that at least the movie will END.  But no, sixteen hours later, they're still flailing about.  At least it *felt* like sixteen hours.  It might have been more.This is just an unpleasant film.  It's gross and aesthetically vile.  How long can one person sit and watch enormous zits and sperm in a woman's hair and fishhooks getting caught in a man's mouth?  Is this what passes for humor these days?Apparently so, because everybody but me thought it was hysterical.I have two ways of rating a film.  One is ""the watch-meter"", which is simply this:  how many times did I look at my watch during the movie?  In this case, I lost count.The other is a simple yes or no question:  given the choice between sitting in this theater and watching this movie for two hours, or sitting in this theater and staring at a blank movie screen for two hours, which would I choose?In this case, ""Something About Mary"" won out ... but *just barely*.

hysterically funny but not for everyone,"There is something about Mary is hysterically funny but it's not for everybody. Prigs need not apply and in fact would be WELL advised to stay well clear of it as they are highly likely to be offended. This is evidenced by a large number of 1 star reviews I see here. The gags push the boundaries of propriety as far as possible and then push them some more. Some were a bit too much even for me (the ""hair gel"" and the zipper scenes) and I generally don't mind ""inappropriate"" jokes (one of my favorite movies is Bad Santa).But my only real complaint about the movie (and the reason I decided to write this review) is not about its content or directing but this: What in the world did they do to poor Cameron Diaz?! What SOB thought it was a good idea to starve this gorgeous girl for this role? Really. Sometimes I just hate Hollywood for what they do to women. Just compare how she looks in The Mask (1994) and here (1998). In The Mask and even in later movies like Head Above Water (1996) and Feeling Minnesota (1996) she is voluptuous and curvy.

"""That Was Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!""","The Farrelly brothers produced and directed this outstanding comedy film, and are fast assuming cult status as generators of high-quality 'nerd humour' pieces.Ted is a dorky high school student who falls in love with the beautiful and vivacious Mary, a girl who has recently moved to this Rhode Island neighbourhood.  Ted is smitten by Mary (played with immense charm by Cameron Diaz) simply because she knows his name.  No 'babe' has ever bothered to remember who Ted is until now.  His fumbling ways mark him down as a loser from the outset.  He is completely tongue-tied when asking Berenice to the senior prom, and even worse misfortune befalls him when he attempts to escort Mary.  A catalogue of amusing disasters at Mary's home culminates in a cringe-making accident.  The comic invention of this scene is marvellous. Just watch for the wedding photo on Mary's mantelpiece.So far, the film has been a traditional American high school comedy, but now the story leaps forward thirteen years.  Mary has qualified in medicine at Princeton and is now in private practice somewhere in Florida.  Ted (Ben Stiller) has not shaken off the aura of a loser, but at least the sad hairstyle has been abandoned.  He is now a regular, likeable guy - and still carrying a torch for Mary.His friend Dom (Chris Elliott) advises Ted to go after his dream.  He persuades Ted to hire a private investigator in order to trace Mary.  Enter Matt Dillon as the irresistibly cruddy sleazeball private eye, Pat Healey. The film may be moving along nicely at this point, but Dillon provides booster rockets.   The reviving of the dog is a gem of a scene.It is interesting to see English stand-up comic Lee Evans taking on a dramatic role (Tucker).  Later, when he is Norm the pizza boy, his American accent occasionally slips, but as one would expect of him, he does the comedy mime stuff exceptionally well.There are some very funny stand-alone set pieces in the film, such as the gay bust and the squad room antics.  Perhaps one shouldn't look too hard for schematic treatments in a light-hearted caper such as ""Mary"", but there are some discernible themes in place here.  One recurrent device is dissembling, with the characters constantly surprising the viewer by revealing their 'true' identities, and similarly, much of the plot information on which we rely turns out to be bogus.  It is as if the male characters know that they are unworthy of Mary's love, and have to bolster their prospects by erecting impressive facades.  The only guy who remains true to himself is the one who wins her heart.Another repeating joke is the geeky music.  A song duo accompanies the action with corny ditties which sound like they have been composed by thirteen-year-olds.  This is much funnier in practice than it sounds in black and white - and it has the added benefit of reinforcing the film's central premise - that Ted is an unlucky dipstick who can never hope for anything good in life.The switching of the action back and forth between warm Florida and wintry Rhode Island is a useful plot mechanism because it suggests movement in the story, and it points up the contrast between the cold, Maryless north and the bright, hopeful south, where Mary is.Physical and mental disability do not normally form the subject matter of popular comedy.  The Farrelly brothers and their writers (correctly, in my view) have approached this film from the angle that nothing is taboo, and (if handled well) disability can be funny.  They DO handle it well, and it IS funny.""Mary"" is an appealing, good-natured film which owes much to Cameron Diaz for its charm and lightness of touch.  The cast clearly enjoy working together, and the final credits include an unusual treatment of ""Build Me Up, Buttercup"" which encapsulates the sense of exuberant good fun in which this excellent film is steeped.",,Anonymous,Romance

Overall this movie is a must watch for anyone even if they do not particularly like the Farrely Brothers other movies you should watch this movie and if you do not like it then you have some issues. I rate it 93%. GO THE FARRELY BROTHERS.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Watch it or lose out!,"13 years ago, Ted was going to the senior prom with Mary, but following a painful accident, Ted was hospitalized and by the time he'd come out, Mary had moved away to Florida....And he hasn't stopped thinking about her since.Egged on by a friend, Ted hires Pat Healey, a private investigator to track down Mary and get some info on her.As Healey finds out, Mary hasn't lost anything in the past 13 years, and he decides he'd rather blow Ted out of the water than simply hand Mary over to him. So he begins spinning Ted a yarn about how fat and unattractive Mary's become.Not satisfied with hearing about Mary, Ted decides he has to see for himself what's become of the his long lost love.Ted just can't keep out of trouble, picking up a mentally deranged hitchhiker, stumbling over a band of homosexual gang rapists and inevitably getting himself throw in jail and roughed up by the cops along the way.Once he's got to Florida, Ted finds Healey's not his only rival in love; a demented pizza delivery boy and others are all vying for Mary's affections. With all these men chasing her, it's easy to tell, there really IS something about Mary.Peppered with musical soliloquies, outrageous jokes and more political incorrectness than a George W Bush speech, 'There's Something About Mary' is undoubtedly another Farrelly brothers classic.Guaranteed to have you rocking with laughter from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cue the vomit.,"What a piece of garbage. I literally did not laugh once while watching this so-called comedy. I found it infantile and gratuitous, and anyone will tell you that when those two characteristics are combined (as they are masterfully in this movie), it's a recipe for cinematic disaster. Big names in a profitable film, says they; talented actors wasting their abilities in an insult to American taste, says I. I saw this film in the theater, and I actually left in the middle to go to the concession stand, which had never happened before. Granted, I needed something to snack on, but I eagerly embraced the fringe benefit of having a few moments free of the idiocy of There's Something About Mary. Would that I had driven there myself; in that case, I could have just gone home. I suppose there's an outside chance that I actually missed something funny during those three minutes in the lobby, but I highly doubt it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

At times very funny.,"It's safe to say that this flim should not be seen by people who believe in political correctness, because they won't find it here.  Many of the jokes are aimed at touchy subjects and whilst I didn't find them offensive, others may.Just like in Dumb and Dumber, the directors don't rely on cheap gags all the way through the film, concentrating instead on a few very funny moments (about five in this case).  In between the main jokes though, the plot is pretty thin and meaningless.I would however recommend it to most people though as when you do laugh, you laugh hard.  I was most impressed by Cameron Diaz who shows a great willingness to have jokes directly aimed at her, something which many people sadly aren't willing to do.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Disappointing,"This film was a disappointment. Having seen Diaz in other films and loving her, this film failed to move the earth for me.

Scraping the barrel to find funny,"Many years ago, I read a comment by a past great comic (I can't remember who it was) who said that modern examples of toilet humor just meant that the writers couldn't come up with real comedy. That might apply as well to writers of raunchy, distasteful and demeaning material. One hesitates to call it humor or comedy. I am aware, though, that there is a market for such material, so there are those writers (and producers, actors and others) who would want to cash in on it.Thus we have this 1998 film, ""There's Something About Mary."" The cast leads in this film all have shaky records of success with comedies. That goes for Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller, especially. Matt Dillon's career is most promising with drama. Most of these comedies have not been box office hits. And for most such films, the efforts for comedy are primarily situational, along with the crude and crass dialog. There is minimal clever or witty dialog. It does seem that the writers for this film checked their minds at the theater doors.Other reviewers noted the newness of the comedy approach in this 1998 film. And, while it was a big box office hit (probably because of the interest in the new comedy method), the brand didn't stick as a huge success. For that, there have been more failures (losses) than successes (profits). Most movie fans, it seems, still prefer intelligent, genuine comedy and clever scripts over the obscene and crude. The two stars are for a couple of funny instances in this otherwise dreary attempt at humor.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Infantile something about nothing,"* (1 star of 5)There`s Something About Mary Directed by Bobby and Peter Farelli, 1999Infantile something about nothingI did not watch this movie amidst all the hype that it enjoyed when it was released (and grossing in excess of $100 million in US box office). Maybe that is why. Then again, maybe not.This movie is one big, loud, silly, vulgar, pathetic and - excuse me - 'dumb-ass' movie. The latter in the sense that it contains scenes so stupid and so degrading that I was actually watching most of it with my mouth open in total amazement as to the length the Farelly brothers went in creating what I term 'shock-laughs'.There is male sperm being mistaken for hair gel. There is the male genitals getting stuck in a zipper (and was that the most original they could come up with? I mean, Porky`s The Movie, did a better twist on the `male penis' - giggle giggle - getting stuck `somewhere' and that was over 20 years ago!), there is animal cruelty, there is handicapped people being made fun of, and there is a pair of old breasts courtesy of an elderly woman made out to ridicule.All of this can be fun, do not get me wrong. If done in an original and fresh form. Only this is so vivid and so out-there that it most of the time seems oddly restrained in all of its brash nature and truly un-appropriate throughout.And what`s with that fake dog? My local toy store has better stuffed teddy bears. Scenes like that of the much used clichè : 'girl´s killer dog attacking the boy who is there to pick her up for a date', well they have been seen a million times before. So the least they could do was make something of it. But oh no. It really is annoying to the point you would question the effort they - the film makers - lacked in trying just vaguely to make this somewhat believable for the sake of a good laugh. Instead we get Ben Stiller wrestling a toy dog.Knowing the directors (they also made the crude and over-the-top Jim Carrey laugh, Dumb & Dumber, yet here Carrey added a touch of poignancy to the stupid laughs), There`s Something About Mary will not shock as many people as is intended. It strives so hard to be as unpolitically correct as possible and is merely concieved as being a bunch of implausible laughs blown totally out of proportion.It is beyond screwball. It is screwball fast forwarded.It may work (and obviously did at the box office) for teenagers but since it has no subtlety whatsoever I kept expecting aliens to land og Mary to turn into an axe-murderer.I remember seeing the trailer for this movie. All the above mentioned scenes were in it. Also a scene where Mary`s brother gets a fish hook stuck in Ben Stillers mouth. And that is about it. There you have it. The laughs. I have talked to many people who were dissapointed in the movie because the trailer already showed all the laughs. In a nutshell people; the film makers again play it as loud as possible whenever possible. Even when editing the trailer.This movie has not got one, honest laugh. Ok, correction. There is one good belly-shaker. A mix up. The main character played by Ben Stiller gets mistaken for somebody else and held in custody by the local (southern) police force (subsequently Stiller gets fondled by a big brute in jail and so forth). Ever seen such a scene in any movie before in your life? Yeah, exactly.",,Anonymous,Romance

HIlarious comedy from Dillon and STiller,"I still don't get the thing about Dillon's big teeth. Were they artificial, or was he just poking them out? Whatever, they made him even more dorky than the character he plays in this hilarious, cruel comedy about getting penises stuck in zippers and throwing yippy inbred dogs out windows.Knowing that Matt and Cameron Diaz were significant others during this time made the show even more enjoyable. Obviously, they could both turn off the goony character Matt plays, as the private dick, hired to find the girl that Ben lost many years ago in his own private Hell.This is a great movie for nerdy teen-agers going through the Hell of adolescence and thinking they'll never get the girl or get the guy. In this case, both persevere and become successes in their chosen profession, thereby having the finances to do what ever the script has them doing without the bother of having to show up 8 to 5.The beautiful Florida scenery is also enjoyable, as is the daffy next door neighbor, the owner of said daffy dog. It became a class when it came out, and it's still hilarious. You can't be depressed watching this trip through la-la land. Unless you think that a bunch of cops pouncing on some homsexuals is funny....which obviously the Republicans will get a great laugh out of. Sorta like waterboarding Muslims.Nonetheless, think of how we've progressed (?????) and enjoy the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not a movie to bring home to mom and dad...but it's great!,"This is definitely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Everything about this film is great!  The story is surprisingly both sweet and hilarious at the same time.  The story is absolutely fantastic and incredibly well written, the story flows very smoothly from scene to scene and makes every character important to the overall story.  What makes this such a great story are all the great characters in the film, all played by fantastic actors.  It isn't often that you have a truly great comedy film with such a great cast.The star is obviously Cameron Diaz, playing one of my personal favorite roles to date.  She's such a beautiful actress and such a good actress.  Ben Stiller, what can I say?  Nothing less than a STUD!!!  I absolutely love his character, he plays such a genuinely likable guy.  Ben's little movements and reactions completely make the movie for me.  Lee Evans really shows off his acting talent in this film as well, just amazing, that's all I have to say.  Matt Dillon, Jeffery Tambor, Lin Shaye, Chris Elliot, Keith David and everyone else also play their roles flawlessly.  I also feel that I have to mention W. Earl Brown, who plays the part of ""Warren"".  This guy is a truly fantastic actor!  It's too bad that comedies are exempt from receiving Oscars (well, not always), this guy plays a phenomenal supporting character. There are also some great cameos and minor roles, played by Richard Tyson, Rob Moran, Harland Williams, Sarah Silverman, Richard Jenkins and Brett Favre.Those Farrelly Brothers are nothing less than comedic geniuses!!!  This is just another great comedy to add to their impressive list of comedy films. Keep up the good work guys!The comedy in this film is pretty much what you'd expect from a Farrelly Brothers film, but this one REALLY pushes the envelope.  There is a lot of very ""dirty"" or ""questionable"" humor in this film...but it's just plain hilarious.  I would strongly urge you to see some of their earlier work first, and if you like any of those films, then give this one a shot.  This is most definitely not a comedy for everyone, but I sure found it funny as all hell.I truly hope that you can respect this film for what it is and I hope, even more so, that you laugh just half as much as I did watching this film.

Its characters are phony and inhuman and I could not care less about any of them. ""Kingpin"" was a much, much better film, its characters funny and sympathetic.

Okay At Best,"TSAM is an okay comedy, but honestly, not that funny. All the jokes get lame after a while, (the zipper? the dog? the gel? all stupid now) the characters are too stupid to be clever or funny, and it is WAY too long. Something like Happy Gilmore I could see over and over-funny, solid characters, a good plot, and just right at 90 minutes. This goes on for far too long, and the characters especially make it dumb. It goes long stretches without belly laughs, and then goes for some unnecessary raunchy stuff. Ben Stiller is usually very funny, but is just dumb here. And the old lady's boobs? What's up with that? And the dog fight scene? That's supposed to be funny? I mean, the Farrelly's got lucky with Dumb and Dumber (a classic) but then this came, then other tragedies (Outside Providence anyone?). Frankly, there is nothing seriously wrong with TSAM, it is simply not funny. I don't get it. If you want something stupid but funny, go rent Tommy Boy, or better, buy it. 4/10",,Anonymous,Romance

Getting your twig and berries caught in a zipper is not funny....,"...but watching the ""Oh sweet Jesus"" reaction to the people who see it is priceless.I mean, its just downright tragic what happen's to poor Ben Stiller's character, but the ""you gotta see this"" attitude displayed by the cops and firemen who show up is what makes ""There's Something about Mary"" into the comedy gem that it is.Incongruities, perfectly timed incongruities are what makes this film tick, and the Farelly brothers showed the importance of editing, timing and context that make this film one of the funniest comedies of all time. In lesser hands, this material might have become consigned to the bin where all tasteless, stupid and sophomoric films lie; it is tasteless, stupid and sophomoric... and pure genius.When you look at comedy classics like ""Some Like it Hot"" or ""It Happened One Night"", the material is less funny to the modern film-goer, but they remain funny because the interplay between characters and the editing are rock solid. Its all about the delivery.Years back, my wife and I were film buffs--we saw all the art-house stuff as well as the mainstream films. Today, we may see three or four movies a year in the theater. We saw ""There's Something About Mary"" after it had gone to HBO, and we both had tears coming down our faces.

Will love blossom again?There aren't many comedies which make me laugh so hard (at certain moments), that it starts to hurt. This movie ""There...Mary"" even makes me laugh simply thinking about it. It has so many iconic scenes that are to die for, but what is striking is that this movie is NOT a non stop silly comedy. It's a slowburning comedy, which lasts over 2 hours. Such a long length is unheard of for a comedy, but it never becomes boring, despite this length. On the contrary the many scenes that are not full blown jokes do contribute to learning to know the characters. I wouldnt call it character devellopment, but this movie is a fun story about LOOSERS, who are being portrayed in ALL their weaknesses and shameful anxieties. Sometimes gross, sometimes absolutely silly, sometimes endearing, but ALWAYS HILARIOUS.Really, really good acting and a terrific story.

Best Comedy of the Summer,"Hilarious scenes along with a superb screenplay equal this outstanding romantic comedy from the laugh-a-minute Farrelly brothers.  Cameron Diaz is an extremely talented actress and stunningly gorgeous (a rare combination) and obviously carries this movie.  Stiller, Dillon, Lee Evans, W. Earl Brown, Chris Elliot, and Keith David all contribute acceptably to this film which, if you are not easily offended, will leave you in tears and pains of laughters weeks after you view it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the funniest comedies ever,Sorry folks but if you do not rate this movie as a 9 or 10 you just cannot recognize funny. Every scene with the dog in this movie was ROFL kind of funny. When Ben Stiller tries to revive the dog after an overdose with a couple of wires that was one of the funniest scenes in a movie I have ever seen.If you are not laughing your a$$ off after watching this scene check into your closest hospital for a personality transplant. You just do not recognize comedic genius at work. I am not even a big Ben Stiller fan but he has reached the pinnacle of success in this movie.In the future this will be viewed in the same context as the Lucy Show when Lucy was working at the chocolate factory! But if you did not rate this a 9 or 10 you probably do not even know what I am referring to!!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The 2 guys,"I just have to mention that I really enjoyed the two guys who sang and played the guitars.  My guy clapped at the end of the movie (those of you who saw it know why) and I slapped him!  I enjoyed their singing!!!  I'm the only one, so far, but I did!This film was highly humorous, not what I expected at all.  I even laughed at the dog-scenes, and I have 2 of my own.  I was pleasantly surprised at this movie and now understand why everyone talks about it so much (even still).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Laugh Out Loud Funny,"This Is the funniest movie ever! I always laugh so much every time i watch this show. It never gets old. I wish comedy movies were made like the olden ones, as now most comedies are plain stupid. Matt Dillon, and Ben Stiller are so funny in this show. In my opinion this is the greatest comedy movie ever made! The most memorable scenes, and funniest I think is when Matt Dillon's character is telling Cameron Diaz's how he control's his ""retards"", and what he does with him. I always love the part when Ben Stiller and Cameron's dog have an epic fight. I think this movie transformed Ben Stiller's movie career and to be the star that he is today.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best comedy ever!,"This is the funniest film I've ever seen - and I've watched hundreds of comedy films. This is laugh-out-loud hilarious. This is what a comedy film should be like.Sure, it's not realistic that Cameron Diaz's red-hot character would want someone average like Ben Stiller's character. However, if you can suspend your disbelief in that regard - the film is riotously funny.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hilarious!!!,"This is one of the best movies that the Farrelly Brothers made.  Probably the best of Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller.  Gross out gags make this movie hilarious.  I especially loved ""Is that hair gel?"" and ""Frank and Beans!!"" Those were hilarious.  the rest of the cast makes this movie shine golden. The plot follows a man who is in love with a high school sweetheart, who tries to find her while getting foiled by numerous hilarious plans.  Special condolences are to matt Dillon.  he did really good as the slimeball detective.Overall the movie is hilarious and every joke works perfectly.  Rating BIG 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the sweetest and funniest romantic comedies I've ever seen!,"THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, in my opinion, is one of the sweetest and funniest romantic comedies I've ever seen! I thought that Mary (Cameron Diaz) looked very beautiful, especially with her long hair and prom dress. When Ted (Ben Stiller) had that little incident on the night of the prom, I got a little uncomfortable. I don't want to say why. Also, when he found Mary in Florida, I felt happy for him. This was because it had been 13 years since the last time they saw each other. There was only one person I couldn't stand, and that was Healy (Matt Dillon). This was because he told Ted lies about Mary. Plus, he wanted her all for himself. Also, I liked the songs that Jonathan Richman sang throughout the movie. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, or Ben Stiller, I highly recommend this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A total classic!!! One of the best comedies ever made!!!!,"Just about everyone has seen this movie. If you haven't, where the hell have you been? I felt compelled to write a blurb on this, because I was surprised to see this only having a 72 rating on IMDb. I'm guessing, some of the offensiveness causes a certain minority of folks to bring the rating down, but why the hell would those peeps even watch a comedy like this in the first place? Anyways, this is one of the top 10 comedies ever made. I saw this in the theater originally. There were 4-5 scenes in this movie that caused me to laugh the hardest I've ever laughed while watching a movie. I think that was the case with most people. It was a blast to watch it in the theater a second time just to witness everyone laughing hysterically. I've seen the movie about 5 times. It has 0 rewatchability for me at this point, but it doesn't change the classic factor of this movie.At this point the only debate about this movie is where on the all time funny list does it belong. It's easily a top 10 and potentially a top 5. On my list it's a top 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

There's something about 'There's something about mary.',"Why do people take offense to lowbrow humor?  This was one of the only movies in which I was in tears because I was laughing so hard.  'Dumb and Dumber' was OK and 'Kingpin' was pretty good, they didn't have much substance to then.  'There's Something About Mary' had heart and gross-out humor making a genius movie.  Most movies depend on one or the other.Sure it was about stalkers but poltical correctness is not a good thing, and that is what this movie is against.  I know people who were offended by it big time, but still laughed at it.  I think any movie which gets you to laugh and enjoy yourself is a good movie.  Other movies are just mediocre.To those who hate low-brow humor and gross-out gags, why don't you get them? I say you should lighten up and enjoy yourselves.  Let loose.  Your going to be entertained and let yourselves be entertained.  Not everything has to be intellectual and make you think.  Either that, or you have no sense of humor.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Silly gross-out humor,"While not always averse to crude humor, although I usually would rather see it on a limited scale (Blazing Saddles is an exception), excesses and stupidity mean gross-out humor.  And they also make a movie silly and sophomoric.  And this idiotic movie about sophomoric-type people is not funny most of the time.For the romance, we have Mary (Cameron Diaz, attractive, not beautiful, in my book) pursued by numerous love interests, and finally won over by a loser/schmuck.  And was he ever.  My girlfriend asked me whether women, too, should be entitled to some appealing good looks and other things, you know, Cary Grant, Tom Cruise, whoever.  But I guess it was part of the humor, loser humor.  Cameron Diaz in this movie is pretty with a girl-next-door look, but not sexy, like she can appear in photos and other movies.  Her acting job, however, was better than that of any of the main men.  Aside from the dumb scenes, the movie drags at times, particularly at the finish, when I wanted the movie just to get it over with and end, end, end.Why did TV Guide name the gel scene one of the top 50 of all time?  It is one of the (narrower number) most idiotic of all time, and yet it still would have acquitted itself a little better if it were shorter and not pompously drawn out.  But it should be emphasized that almost all the crude scenes lacked the subtlety of When Harry Met Sally and The Truth About Cats and Dogs, and of Mel Brooks, who knows how to make crude humor funny.  And the stuff in There's Something About Mary does not have the humor of slapstick, which I love.  It is, look at me, how idiotically silly, rather than klutzy, I am.  Little intelligence or wit went in.  This movie is vastly overrated, and only for people with bad taste and infantile dispositions.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's a nineties version (the ""gross out"" scene notwithstanding) of the old screwball comedies of bygone years.Don't miss the end credits.A couple of criticisms:It is a bit of a stretch to imagine the Cameron Diaz character as a well to do orthopedic surgeon.

"Yuck, what an awful movie!","I can't believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny. Shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty, disgust and stupidity, 'There's Something About Mary' leaves little reason to stay until the end. Sure, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, but that is never going to be enough to save a movie.  Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the movie is a loser.Not once were any of the scenes believable.  The shots were badly timed and poorly framed.  The Farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs.  I check IMDB to see what they are working on just so I know what to avoid.2/10; the bonus is from the one time I smiled.  It's not like I'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion.  My wife hated it, too.  The next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and laughed ourselves silly.  This movie just stunk.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

There certainly is something about Mary.,"I just had to see this one twice -- it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  It is absolutely the best thing Cameron Diaz has ever done and Ben Stiller is magnificent.There are certain surrealistic qualities to this film that are very intriguing.  There are parts that are not for everyone -- some people walked out of the theatre at a certain point in the movie. However, if you can get over your possible initial discomfort and just sit back and enjoy Ted Stroehmann's (Ben Stiller) angst this is a great movie for the summer.Because of some of the content I was not certain if the person I went with would be comfortable or not -- but she loved it.I highly recommend this movie as the funniest movie of this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not even accidently funny collection of ancient jokes.,"Avoid this at all cost. This film consists of a collection of jokes that have been around since the middle ages.

Words cannot describe how funny it is but what I can describe is the reaction of the audience.  I have been to a ton of movies on my life, and many comedies.  I have never heard an audience have such a reaction to a film.  The movie was so hysterically funny, people were screaming, rolling in their seats, especially for the first 20 mins of the film (which features the infamous ""frank and beans"" shot).  The true test of this film was could it sustain the initial laughs throughout the movie and the answer is a definite yes. Cameron Diaz and Matt Dillon give stand out performances, while Ben Stiller shines as a ... well for lack of a better word ""loser.""

"Crude, cheap, puerile humour. Go see it.","I haven't laughed this much at a movie for aeons. This one is done by the same pair that did Dumb and Dumber, but it's a lot funnier. The movie has it's odd moments, such as the singing duo who turn up at the start. Go see it with a big crowd of like minded people, 'cause this is a film which can easily offend the more politically correct. I saw it when shown by the college film soc, and it is well suited to student film-goers. Definitely, leave your good taste buds at home - this is one that people with more mature senses of humour might balk at. This film makes a good point for button-fly jeans... The movie starts off slow, but after the initial pre-prom disaster scene, picks up speed. From the other comments posted here, I think if you've seen the trailer, then you might have seen a bit too much for your own good.

Perhaps the funniest movie I've seen in my 14 years on Earth,"There's something about Mary, that's what Ted Peloquin (Ben Stiller) finds out when he falls in love with Mary Jenson (Cameron Diaz), now Ted isn't the best looking guy, not by a long shot, but yet, he helps out, unknowingly, Mary's retarded brother, which leads Mary to ask Ted out to the prom.  Now, when he gets to her house, he gets his, um, member stuck in his zipper (for all you men who see it, you'll wonder how he did it, I know I did), after that, the date is ruined when he gets it out, and is a bleeder, so he needs to go to the hospital, needless to say, the date is over.  Then, 13 years later, he wants to find Mary again, so his friend (Chris Elliot) to hire one of his friends, named Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to find Mary, he falls for her, tells her she is unattractive, in the hopes that he gives up, but yet, he doesn't. He tracks her down, he falls in love.  And of course, this is a comedy, and a lot of very funny situations.  Although it has some funny situations, there are some long spots where there isn't many laughs, but where the laughs come, they come hard.  Such as the dog on speed.  Now, this is one helluva funny movie, I left with tears in my eyes, don't leave right away, because, during the first half of the credits there is a funny musical number, of sorts.

"A very funny movie, with a good heart.","This is one of my favourite films.Although it is primarily a comedy, the story behind the film is actually very sad. It is the tale of a young student, who falls in love with a pretty girl, but who's chance of wooing her is dashed by a cruel (but very funny) prom night disaster.For the next 13 years, he leads a lonely and empty existence, his life (to all intents and purposes) ruined by the tragic loss of his one true love. And then one day, a chance remark by a friend makes him decide to do something about this...What happens next is a study of the demons that haunt those obsessed by something that seems unobtainable, and the pressures that face those who are the objects of such obsession.The film is also very funny. Some of the comic situations are undeniably basic (some would say juvenile), but they are done so well that I found myself howling with laughter, when more usually I would have turned my nose up (usually I'm not overly fond of adolescent humour).The message that I took away from the film was about perspective. As individuals, we can often lose our perspectives, and this can lead to unbearable emotional suffering. But, if you can act with honour and with dignity, you will eventually be rewarded, one way or another.Some people may be offended by this film , and some may not like it.

Pretty funny comedy.,"In the summer of 1998 this was the surprise hit that came out of nowhere. The Farrelly brothers had another hit, the other being ""Dumb and Dumber"", and while this one is funny ""Dumb and Dumber"" is better.  Sure this made more money and stuff, but it isn't funny all the way through as Dumb is. This one focuses on a guy who wants to find the girl he almost had a date with in high school, but do to a very funny accident it wasn't meant to be. He has to compete though with numerous other guys who also really want Mary including the private investigator he hired to find her.  This movie has a lot of funny scenes, but the ending wasn't all that funny to me.  There were other times in this one that weren't that great as well, but it still plays very well.  All the actors are good, especially Stiller and Dillon.  Cameron Diaz, the title character though is rather bland with her funniest moment being what she wipes through her hair.  She is only marginally better in this than is Rene Zellwegger is in ""Me, Myself, and Irene"" as the title gal in that one.

"No, it's not the funniest movie of the decade--but still pretty hilarious","Generally speaking, gross-out comedy doesn't have much appeal to me, so I didn't expect to like ""There's Something About Mary.""  Having seen it, though, I have to say that there really is something about ""There's Something About Mary.""  There were a few scenes that I think went a bit too far in the gross-out department (no need, really, for the close-up in the penis-stuck-in-the-zipper scene, or for the fish-hook through the lip; I also thought the masturbation/semen-as-hair-gel thing was superfluous and not all that funny).  However, there was a lot more to this movie than gross-out jokes.  I thought much of the dialogue was actually quite smart, and the wacky humor was deliciously unpredictable -- for instance, the episode where Pat, the sleazy detective played by Matt Dillon, gives Ted (Ben Stiller) the false report on Mary in order to get Ted to lose interest in getting together with her; the hitchhiker with the ""six-minute abs"" pitch; Pat telling Mary he loves ""working with retards""; the cell-phone conversation Pat intends for Mary to overhear.  The scenes with Puffy the dog were hilarious too, and I usually CRINGE at any suggestion of cruelty to animals!  I rather liked the plot twists, especially the one involving Mary's friend Tucker (brilliantly played by the British comedian Lee Evans). And guess what, I thought there was something very sweet about the romance in ""Mary.""  Ben Stiller creates a believable and (despite his many faults) ultimately sympathetic character.  And as Mary, Cameron Diaz projects an irresistible mix of naivete, good-heartedness, and spirit.  So what if it's not very plausible that she would be a successful surgeon?  This is an eccentric comedy, not a serious drama.  (To me, Cameron Diaz as a surgeon is much more plausible than Julia Roberts as a hooker.)   The film actually makes you care about these people -- in addition to making you laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too bad that comedy of this sort can never be repeated,"I watched this movie when it came out in the theaters and managed to only watch it again today, after a good 25 years. Needless to say, I did not remember anything about it which allowed me to watch it really unbiased.Technically speaking, this movie is no masterpiece but it also does not aim to be one. Aspects like acting or cinematography are just fine and adequate for this type of film. Judging only by this, I would give it a ""pleasant"" 6.But where the film delivers is at it's humor. I would not be exaggerating if I said that I was rolling with laughter every 3 minutes or so. The writers have gone far and beyond to inject some kind of humor in almost every scene. Best moment for me, when the dog goes crazy. I honestly have a hard time to remember a movie that gave me so many consistent laughs. Judging by this, this movie more than exceeded it's goals and gets an 8 from me.There's something about Mary is a silly, lightweight, romantic and enormously funny movie.And it is so because the writers don't hold back. They make fun of everything and anyone, they don't hold the jokes back for political correctness. They let it all out and the result is hilarious. Unfortunately these days, such a movie wouldn't be possible to make, so we need to watch old stuff to catch a laugh.This movie kick started more similar movies in the silly, teen, lightweight type of comedies of the early 2000s. But I don't think that any of them was able to surpass this one. Hmm.. Maybe eurotrip, that one was also too funny.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tasteless and puerile,"About the only thing they didn't do here was light farts with matches and giggle. It's that kind of movie, a new low for Hollywood. Sex is one thing. Puerile humour is another. They are richly combined in this insultingly tasteless film. I imagine a group of thirteen year old teens watching it would find it hilarious and even crudely educational.To me it was proof of the decadence of contemporary Hollywood and the corroded moral standards of the United States.Sex is a great form of humour. This was not humour but embarrassing vulgarity laced with needless foul language and premised on the validity of lies and deception.I was tempted to turn it off after the first few minutes but forced myself to watch because it is such an excellent example of the moral vacuum that has engulfed the United States. I have no problem with sophisticated sexual humour or even shocking sexual farce. That does not offend me. This did!",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great and essential film.,"It is an excellent comedy that is based on simple premises that always work: you have to avoid being politically correct, the more extreme the more fun, and the idea is that the characters take seriously everything that happens around them. The latter is inherited from the great Buster Keaton and is always effective. The film is luminous because it has a great cast in its splendor generating gags that are classic and whose repetition never tires. It is one of those comedies that is appreciated for its effectiveness and self-confidence. The reason for not having more films like this is that the ease of parody was introduced years ago and the average result ranges from bad to abominable. This film is essential.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bring an oxygen mask with you... you'll need it!!,"I thought I would never again laugh as hard as I did when I saw THE NAKED GUN way back when. I'm glad to say that is no longer true. There's Something About Mary had me clutching my sides many a time, gasping for air! This was without a doubt THE funniest movie I have ever seen, and judging from the astounding box office returns and longevity, many, many people agree with me. This is a perfect blend of comedy (yes, some of it raunchy and irreverent, but oh so good!), character development (usually lacking in theses kinds of films) and great casting that really makes you feel for the characters.

"Clearly a reflection of the times, as SAT scores drop further","Our ""culture"" is at present at the nadir of this millennium in terms of art, music, quest for knowledge, philosphy and most other like measures.  To us, we're vapidly thrilled when Erkyl prances about, when some poor sap takes a baseball to the groin and it's caught on video and when the atonal dissonance of Nirvana blasts at us on MTV.  Having said this, it is perfectly understandable why the Gen-X dominated masses rated this putrid, purile movie as highly as they did.This movie was so bad that ""reprehensible"" does not go far enough as an apt description.  I've only seen one other movie in which I felt similarly moved to just walk out of the theater in silent protest to the terrible moviemaking I was so unfortunate to have witnessed.  Don't believe the slack-jawed uninformed when deciding whether or not to see this film -- avoid it, take a wide berth around it and go see ANYTHING else.Now, the typical response to those of us who found this movie to be incredibly bad in all respects is that we are ""bible thumpers"" or can't respect the anti-political correctness the movie adheres to.  Sure we can. It's just a fascinatingly bad moive. The specific vulgarities were nauseating, yes (the sperm in the hair perhaps being the topper), but the real objection is in that EVERYONE in the entire movie is a complete and utter reprobate,  from Ben Stiller's imbecilic character to Cameron Diaz's sexy but senseless (she's a doctor?  Give me a break) character.  And those were the two most intelligent characters in the entire movie.  The remaining coterie of scumbags aren't worth mentioning.

Hilarious,"What is it about Mary (or should I say Cameron Diaz) that is and stays so funny, even if you have seen the movie several times. Is it her innocence, her wit, her laughter, her looks or her appearance. Maybe it's not just Cameron but everyone who plays in this movie. The movie is a real feel-good movie, with lots of laughter en lots of comic or even hilarious moments e.g. the scene in which Matt Dillon is re-animating the dog or the scene in which Mary's friend Magda appears topless before the window.

Is she really going out with him?,"Having been a big fan of Ben Stiller, it may surprise you that I only saw 'There's Something About Mary' only today. I don't know what it is, I think it was the Farrelly Brothers, who I'm not a huge fan of, that prevented me from seeing this sooner. I really liked this tale of somewhat-obsessive love. Ben Stiller basically plays the same character he plays in all of his comedies, eg the hyper-neurotic type (one wonders if that's the kind of guy he is in real life) and Cameron Diaz plays Mary, his love-of-his-live-but-only-if-she-knew-it. Diaz's role is not too complicated, the somewhat ditzy-yet-smart blonde that I've seen her do before. The one character that really caught me off guard was Matt Damon playing Healy. Although I think Matt Dillon is a mighty fine actor, I just don't think broad comedy suits him. As for the movie itself, it's goofy fun. Not going to change the world, it's in the ""offensive-but-don't-take-it-seriously"" mold, and quite breezy and easy to sit through. I laughed quite a bit.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A comedy worth watching repeatedly.,"It's the rare comedy that's even funnier the second time you watch it, than it was the first. Something about Mary fits that definition perfectly. It's one of the most memorable Ben Stiller comedies, for a lot of reasons.The story itself isn't something that we haven't seen been before, but it's told exceptionally well and flows quickly from hilarious situation to hilarious situation. Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz have great on-screen chemistry, even though a lot of their time is spent with their equally funny co-stars. And it's nice to be reminded of how gorgeous she was in her younger days.Be prepared to wince and cover your eyes a few times, because some of the funniest moments in the movie are also the hardest to watch. Overly tanned boobs, painful crotch accidents, and masturbation jokes, are all par for the course.

It has to be seen to be believed,"I felt kind of guilty when I was watching this film, and I'm sure many people before me have also. I mean how can they not? The Farrley Brothers have insulted pretty much everyone in this film, and I knew that this was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. From gender to race, gays to bi's, rich to poor, old to young, handicapped to retarded. No one is spared. No one is safe from being utterly offended. However in despite of the amazingly crude humour against the people of society, ""There's Something About Mary"" is inescapably, and undeniably, an incredibly funny film that can not passed from anyone belonging to any of the listed categories of people.It's a classic in comedy that definitely deserves the reputation of being one of the most outrageous pieces of image moving entertainment ever. While it tells a very obvious story, the hard hitting comedy never fails to amuse audiences. Ted (Ben Stiller) scores a prom date with the most beautiful girl in school, Mary, played by the luscious Cameron Diaz. But due to a painfully unfortunate event and a very public rush to the hospital, the date had to be postponed, after which the lovable Mary moved away, out of Ted's life. Thirteen years later, Ted is still fixed on Mary's memory and hires a private investigator to look her up. But when the sleazy P.I ends up falling in love with Mary also, an endless love fest of pathetic men competing for Mary's heart takes place, and it's not pretty.The plot twists in this movie are just as funny and entertaining as the insulting cultural referencing. However it's not as good as Cameron Diaz's wonderful performance. I've always been a sucker for the adorably humorous and stunningly beautiful Cameron Diaz. I'll admit that the only reason I considered watching this movie in the first place was for her irresistible charm. In fact, I'm pretty sure, that without Ms Diaz to play the role of Mary, this movie wouldn't have even worked. It goes to show you just how dependent this movie really is. You take away Cameron, and you take away the movie.But I'm not going to be one-sighted. There are many more things to be loved in this movie besides Ms Diaz. Like for example the ridiculously funny and disturbing bathroom scene, you know which one I'm talking about, the unfortunate event that took place just before prom night thirteen years ago. While it may have put some people off, that was one of the most painfully hilarious moments in film ever, and that's not just my opinion. I remember reading an article about the top ten bathroom scenes, and as I recall, that was definitely one of the top 3, along side the scene in ""Psycho"" by Alfred Hitchcock.""There's Something about Mary"" is not for everyone, which is understandable, but it's also very sad, because this is one of the funniest movies ever made. Too miss it, would be to miss out on one the most enjoyable experiences in comedy film. Cameron Diaz is at her most charming, and the Farrley Brother's are at their most funniest. Don't miss this film, because I assure you that one day, you'll regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Modern-Day Comedy Sleaze,"Sorry, but I didn't think this was as good as most people did. Many moviegoers thought this was hilarious; I didn't. Oh, I laughed hard at a few scenes, of course, but the main attraction for me was Cameron Diaz' face more than the comedy. The humor is a little too sleazy for my tastes. I love comedy and own a bunch of DVDs of that genre, but I don't need excessive profanity and sex to make me laugh.Why would they put so many f-words in a comedy? Just asking. There has to be at least 40 in here plus a dozen abuses of the Lord's name in vain. You know, if it's a crime movie I can understand, but a comedy?

Hilarious!!,"I hate romantic comedies. However There's Something About Mary is so much more than that, which makes it the greatest romantic comedy ever. It has all the right ingredients: absolutely hilarious characters, great writing, wonderful performances from all, and an adorable, wacky love story.Ben Stiller is just precious as a former geek still obsessed with his high school dream girl, Mary. He is so cute, clueless, and just irresistible. Cameron Diaz is extremely likeable too as the levelheaded Mary, probably the only sane character in the whole film.  She and Stiller are so cute that even I, despiser of romantic comedies, cried at parts because the story was just so sweet.Besides the two stars, Chris Elliott, Lee Evans, and Matt Dillon are absolutely hilarious as her three stalkers, especially Elliott, and W. Earl Brown is riotous as Mary's brother Warren. The two funniest performances in the film though would have to go to Harland Williams whose five minutes on screen as an insane hitchhiker will leave you in stitches for days, and of course the brilliant dog whose name I can't remember.There are just so many scenes that bring tears of laughter just thinking about them.

why so funny?,"Entertainers can EITHER be funny OR be Politically Correct. They cannot be both. The more a film acquiesces to bourgeois conventions, good taste and all that junk, the less amusing it is. It was the Farrely brothers flagrant disregard for political correctness that made this the funniest movie of the decade.In other words, what made this film so hilarious to some of us was precisely what made it so odious to others. Imagine how dull the film would have been if the makers had a more refined social conscience: no laughs at the expense of dogs, retards or nice guys. Just ""Friends"" jokes. ""Friends"" is a good example, come to think of it, of the sort of humor that offends no one: it makes you giggle a little, that's all. But for a joke to be rip-roaringly funny, it has to have a target. As an illustration: When Dillon and Diaz have their notorious ""I-play-with-retards"" dialogue, it is ten times funnier if there are Retard Awareness activists outside picketing the theater.

The movie ""There's something about Mary"" speaks a little about how we all feel while seeing that good looking blonde walking through the door that just says there's something about that girl. Let us face it, we have all been there and this movie puts it in the open by introducing Mary played Cameron Diaz in this stalking realm of comedy and laughter while breaking hearts of everyone around her.Leaving a trail of love potion 69 Ted played by Ben Stiller shows us the real action and mindset of each individual guy in the world. Mary is extremely hot and old school driving him wild. In the directive approach using Mary as a sex symbol and then splicing her attitude with a female that enjoys the dirtiness of hot wings and good old fashion football Mary is the perfect match for trouble. Being stalked for most her life starting in high school Mary leaves haunting love bug Dom (Woogie) played by Chris Elliot bitten and stricken for his last breathe to see Mary as his own.The movie really brings us closer to thoughts and ideas making the plot and theme really clear to what the main objective is and how the movie plans to display it artistically. Using dramatic impulses in the back of our conscience asking ourselves what is so special about Mary. The director's main focus is on the idea of making us all want to fall in love with Mary. They use the ideas that her character is to perfect for words by making her a guys best friend or girl next door that we all want to meet. The plot from the beginning takes us only a short amount of time to decipher because it is apparent that either Ben Stiller's character is in love with Mary or he is a major dork with hopes far beyond his wildest dreams.I also enjoyed this movie because it involved plenty of action with the some of the best actors in Hollywood. Later during the film Healy played by Matt Dillon makes his debut as a wonderful private eye that can't keep his eyes to himself. Not only does he add to Teds problems trying to hunt down the love of his life, he is the problem in Ted's life. Adding to the plot as the villain unseen Matt Dillon's character prepares us to take a nose dive out of a typical love story in to a beautiful disaster arena of lying and scheming. He is not the trust worthy character he usually plays, nor is Tucker played by Lee Evans, Mary's best crippled friend who apparently builds pizza sky scrapers for a living. In comparison another one of Ben Stiller's movies ""Along came Polly"" symbolizes the same background of ""There's something about Mary"". The theme of finding another loved one in present time and how to make love work when recreating the past. The movie was awesome and the pick for characters could not have been better judged for such an adventurous motion picture.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"As much as I love comedy, this film didn't engage me","I do love comedy, some of my favourite films/shows are comedy based. But I have seen There's Something About Mary three times now, and I didn't like/wasn't engaged by it either time.I do like how it looks, the film does look striking, I like the soundtrack, there was one joke that I was amused at(the one in the bathroom) and the performances of Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz are good.However, apart from one joke, I just didn't find There's Something About Mary funny. The Farrelly Brothers I know are notorious for their lack of subtlety, but I was expecting something funnier considering the reputation it has. The script is full of dialogue that is rather juvenile and tasteless and the gags are puerile and fall flat more than they score. I know people will say this is what makes the film funny, I respect that, it's just not my kind of humour, that's all. The premise is simple, I have no problem with that. When the story is this thin and this predictable, I am not so kind. The film feels unevenly paced too, then again it probably has a lot to do with the lack of laughs from my experience, and the characters I don't care about.Overall, I wanted to like it, but it didn't work for me. Maybe I'll see it again some day and pray that my reaction will be different then. 4/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Totally 'Politically Incorrect' Hilarity,"It was completely refreshing to see a movie that allowed us to lighten up a bit and have a good laugh at all the things about which we are not supposed to be laughing.Cameron Diaz shines right through the film, and the supporting cast obviously have a ball.  I especially liked the musical accompaniment - and their unfortunate end!Not a film for the conservative, but don't miss it if you like a good belly laugh!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable comedy that really sparkles!,"The movie starts with a song and ends with a song, and in-between, the song links the principal scenes.  The film never falters with its great script, fast pace and excellent acting.  Cameron Diaz really sparkles as the much sought-after Mary and Ben Stiller gives an amazing performance as the shy Ted.  Matt Dillon plays the lying eaves-dropping investigator with all stops out! As a result, it turns out to be one of the best comedies of the year. A couple of scenes are very risque, but manage to keep just within the bounds of censorship.  It's about a love-sick guy who seeks out a girl he knew 13 years before.  She's moved to Florida so he has to engage a private investigator to seek out and stalk her.  It so happens that the stalker falls for Mary, too.  Two of the funniest scenes involve a family dog.  In one scene the dog which has been over-dosed with a soporific drug has to be hurriedly resuscitated (a really farcical scene) and later, poor Ted is savagely attacked by the dog as it goes for his throat and other extremities.  These are only two of the extremely funny situations which keep the laughter bursting forth.  Ted is one of those unfortunate guys who always seem to be in trouble through no fault of their own,  Whether the girl of his dreams chooses him in the end from amongst her various admirers cannot be divulged here.  It can only be said that finally sincerity wins the day.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's rude, it's crude, it's raunchy.  Could anyone ask for more?","There's Something About Mary is the Farrelly brother's third effort. There first two movies, Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin, were among the most sophmoric, tasteless, movies I have ever seen.  There were also two of the funniest.  What made those movies so delightful was the absolute effort that was made to get us to laugh.  As Mel Brooks has said about his movies, they ""rise below vulgarity.""As funny as those two movies are, the Farrelly brothers have clearly stepped it up a notch with this film, which is most likely not the funniest film of all time, but definitely merits consideration.  The film begins in the wonderful state of Rhode Island, and after a very inside joke about ""Borrington,"" shows the first meeting between Ted (Ben Stiller) and Mary (Cameron Diaz).  From the first meeting, that involves Mary's mentally challenged brother, we get the sense that sensitivity isn't a high value in this movie, and that laughter is.Describing the rest of the plot is mostly pointless, although it does contain several delightful twists.  The movie does not rely on its plot, but relies on a combination of high slapstick comedy and the ability to exploit the worst, darkest part of human nature, especially as contrasted to the unbelievably sweet and wholesome Mary.These two elements as well as one incredibly funny misunderstanding (about serial killing of all things), have made this movie a true delight, and a purely fun ride into raunchy fantasy.  Not that you don't need a thick skin to view this film.  It pokes fun at a variety of sources, most disturbingly at people with mental retardation.  However, it is clear the film revels much more in the stupidity of those people who tend to exploit people with mental retardation.The film also contains the wonderful and humorous presence of one of the great rock n' roll musicians of all time, Jonathan Richman, who is all ham in this one.  When all is said and done, no one is smarter, no one is a better person for seeing this film.  It makes no great statements, it offers no insight into humanity.  It is what it is:  The funniest, most rip roaring laugh your a** off good time you will have at the movies, and if that isn't worth $8, then save the money and buy a better sense of humor.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Brilliant Slapstick,"There's Something About Mary is a great movie, continuing a long and glorious tradition of good and enjoyable Slapstick. Critics will not use phrases like A Witty Satire or A Comic View on Human Nature. But if you want 1.5 hours of fun and humor, and if you can't remember the last time you rolled on the floor inside a cinema, then this is the film for you.The film has a good balance of intelligent humor and Jerry Lewis - Style comedy. The cast is great, and even an actor like Matt Delon, and I use the word actor in a very loose way, manages to give a good performance. Cameron Diaz is great as usual, and Ben Stiller is doing a good job.(If you didn't see the movie yet, please skip to the next paragraph because I'll refer to some scenes now.) When Pat Healy asks Mary for a change because he is stuck with small coins from Nepal, or when he accidently drops some blueprints of a children hospital, you get a wide grin on your face and say Jesus, what a son of a bitch'... And that's a sign of good filmmaking. And when you discover that Tucker is also an imposter, and that the great dialoge they made in the Architecture Exhibition (""Santiago, Chile? Sure, twice last year..."")  was all a fake, you start to appreciate the intelligence of the script.But the real fun is the slapstick part. The dog scenes (""Oh, so you are the little dog making all that noise..."") are sure to make you roll on the floor, unless you went to the cinema wearing a jacket and a tie.In short - a great comedy, and a good return on your ticket money.Uri Rubner, nice27m@hotmail.com",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Funniest Movie Ever... A comedic Masterpeice.,"This was the funniest movie ever. It just MAKES you laugh. You have to laugh. It doesn't have as many funny scenes as some comedies, but the scenes that are funny are UN-forgettable. The thing the makers of this movie did, was they brought on one funny joke after another, so while your busy laughing your head off and hitting your chair as hard as you can, you miss the next joke. It's great. Not only are the jokes as funny as hell, but at the same time there's a very interesting story to watch. This is a cult classic comedy. Better than any other Romantic comedy(Most of which are very predictable and boring). If any comedy can be called a masterpiece, than this is it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hilarious!,"Hilarious! Thats the first word coming to mind when you've seen this. From the high school years and proceeding forward, the laughs don't stop coming as the movie goes on with each character (Healy, The hitchhiker, Tucker, Woogy, as well as the supporting cast) bringing a new incident that cracks you up. This is a one of a kind romantic comedy that truly stands out. There's no exaggeration or the cast / script writers trying too hard in any of the sequences. The movie just sails through with the viewer wanting more after each scene. Lets not forget the entertaining soundtrack and music which makes the impact of each scene felt in the viewer. Cameron Diaz fits the role of Mary perfectly. Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon are also at their very best. There's Something About Mary is truly a treat to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Funnier than hell!,"I have to say that Dumb and Dumber is my favorite Farrley's brother movie, however this is VERY close second.It's funny when I think about the fact that Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller were actually in a romantic comedy together, but the truth is, they were both perfect for the roles that they played. There is something about Cameron, and she was made for this part.After a humiliating and basically unforgettable Prom night, when he was sixteen, Greg (Stiller) never fully recovers from the humiliation he suffered thirteen years earlier. He decides, that even though it's been several years, he'd like to look up the girl he essentially blew all of his chances with, so long ago.He hires a private detective to look into finding her, since Greg lives in Rhode Island, and Mary (Diaz) lives in Miami, FL. After finding her, and following her around, he falls in love with her too, and tells Greg that she is not worth his time and tries to get him to forget about her.Even though, Greg is discouraged he decides to look into finding her anyway. Along the way to Florida, he runs into some trouble with the law (which I won't give away, but the police scene is probably the funniest in the entire movie. For those who have seen the movie, I'm referring to the part with the two officers, who think he's done something other than what he thinks he's being charged for.), ans finally makes it to Florida.While he's there, Pat (Dillan), the P.I., learns of Greg's coming, and the two try to get one another out of Mary's life.With other mishaps, and funny situations that go on in the film, it's one of the most well-written scripts, and funniest films to watch ever.I recommend it to anyone who likes a good comedy, however there is some pretty graphic dialogue from time to time, so I wouldn't suggest the film to anyone under seventeen. But, it is funny and I've seen it countless times.And now, an excerpt from the film:""Greg, this wasn't your first time, was it?"" ""No."" ""How many we talking' here?"" ""My whole life? I dunno. Twenty-five, maybe fifty. I dunno, who keeps track? Look I know that this is like the Bible belt down here, but where I'm from this is not that big a deal.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Surprise! Superbly written, well directed","Some brothers finally grow up! I've tried to watch the Farley Brothers' other films, but turned them off after 20 minutes -- they just were not funny (""Dumb & Dumber"" being the prime example).But ""There's Something About Mary"" is a real eye opener. The script, acting, and directing are really top notch, especially the script. The brothers Farley have matured and produced a genuinely hilarious movie that I will admit I've seen 4 times and would see again, preferably in a theater. Outside of one or two superfluous scenes, nothing is wasted in the film. And the use of Jonathan Richmond as the ""Cat Balloo"" style singing narrator (okay, he ain't no Nat King Cole or Stubby Kaye) is inspired. Everything clicks, unlike the Farleys' earlier films which, as best I can tell, appealed only to the dumbest and dumberest (such words) among us.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Gleefully rude, politically incorrect, laugh till it hurts comedy.  Any questions?","This movie is hysterical. That's the bottom line. If you want to laugh, and don't mind severe stomach pain as a result, pop this in the DVD player and enjoy. Admittedly, it's pretty lowbrow, but when so many ""comedies"" fail to generate any more than a few chuckles, it's amazing to see a movie that will actually make you laugh (and laugh hard) all the way through.After their prom night was ended too soon after an unholy disaster, Ted Strohmann (Ben Stiller) and Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz) never saw each other again. Now, thirteen years later, Ted is still pining over the woman he loved, and at the advice of a friend, hires a sleazy private investigator to look her up. Once there, he falls for her too. It's a battle of wits, wills, and bodily fluids to determine who gets the girl.Comedy is difficult to pull off. There is so much that has to be perfect to get an honest laugh: timing, reactions, the appropriate build-up, and of course the delivery. The people making this movie certainly have what it takes. This is the best sort of comedy; it's not the lines that provoke laughs (although there are a few good one-liners), it's what happens and how it happens.The talent pool in this movie is terrific. Cameron Diaz is dazzling as the object of every guy's affection. Mary might as well be called Mary Sunshine. She's nice to a fault, and one of those people who can change the tone of a room just by being there. Yet Diaz never lets Mary become two-dimensional. She knows what she wants, but just attracts degenerates, creeps and losers. And it's no feat to understand why every guy would go crazy around her; Diaz is also drop-dead gorgeous.Her co-stars may be losers, but they're funny losers. Ben Stiller is a master of reaction shots, and that serves him well here. Ted is a mixture of guilt and panic, and that sets up some of the film's funniest sequences well. Matt Dillon broke into film playing teenage bad boys, but Dillon proves that he's got considerable comic talent. Lee Evans is pretty funny as Mary's friend who has a secret of his own. W. Earl Brown didn't get any accolades for his spot-on portrayal of Mary's ""retarded"" brother, Warren, but he's outstanding. He's funny without being insulting or a walking plot device. Also of note is Keith David, who is hysterical in the one of the film's beginning scenes.The Farrelly Brothers are known for their low-brow, crude comedy, and that's what they give us here. This is a raunchy, occasionally dark, comedy that appeals to the lowest level of humor. And it works. There are quite a few hysterical sequences, and the inbetween parts develop a cute, if preposterous, romance. It also takes chances (a minstrel duo narrating the story? Who've thought?). A little on the long side, but it's funny all the way through. Not for kids or the tightly-wound, but it's got the one thing that every comedy needs: it's funny.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
one of the worst ever,"What happened here? Multiple friends (many who've been friends for over 30 years) raved and raved about this movie until they convinced me to go see it with them.

(Answer: they didn't.) Since seeing the movie, I've come to an interesting observation, and I wonder if anyone else has experienced anything similar. It's clear in my case that all who loved this movie are straight people, and all who hated it/were bored by it are gays.

I was almost forced into laughing at something that I would normally be completely disgusted over (hair gel scene).I found the musical interludes, Chris Elliot, and Ben Stiller's trip to Florida the funniest parts (besides the gratuitous zipper and gel scenes). The dog-speed scenes were not that funny.  They were stupid physical comedy.But other than the dog scenes (maybe it is me, since the previews spoiled those scenes), this movie was non-stop funny.

Average & Overrated,"Ted (Ben Stiller) was a nerd who almost went to the prom with a high school beauty, Mary (Cameron Diaz).  When he *ahem* is not able to attend, the two of them don't keep in touch.  Years later, he hires a private investigator (Matt Dillon) to locate her so they can catch up on each others' lives and remnisce (sp?) about the past, and, as Ted hopes, maybe even pick up where they left off.  But as the PI begins to fall in love with Mary, he does everything he can to keep Ted away from her.The plot sounds like it could be entertaining, but this movie just doesn't deliver.  It isn't really as gross as many people say; there are some jump scenes, but nothing too serious.  Dillon and Stiller do seem to perform the roles well, but they aren't grand, and even good performances can't save a bad movie.The directorial work is marginal, but bearable.  It's really the script that did this one in.  As interesting as the plot may sound, it only has the potential to go so far, and even here, it did not meet that limited potential.  You'd be better off renting ""Dumb & Dumber"" if you're in the mood for a good comedy, because this is mostly a grouping of cliches and some sexual references which are neither funny nor actually crude/offensive, just bland.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Like the classic films of Mel Brooks, this one often aims below the lowest common denominator.

This movie reminds me of the song ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love?""  It's about those fools who wear their hearts on their sleeves in the name of love. All three of these guys will go to any lengths to please the woman of their dreams and that's why I found this movie so humorous. The tone of the movie mocks these love-starved guys while simultaneously persuading the audience to feel sympathy for them.

How sad, this movie is so much more than that...Everybody associates the Farrely brothers with ""Dumb and Dumber"".  This movie is just as good, if not better.

More than just a few jizm gags,"Ben Stiller carries on the loser shtick, this time coming off slightly below his Flirting with Disaster high point but perhaps a nudge better than the more recent Meet the Parents. In this one he's got less of a leading man type role, letting some of the other players (Matt Dillon, Lee Evans) get the odd word in edgeways, which is nice, and also giving Cameron Diaz' Mary a fair bit of screen time. This central group of characters are pitch perfect, from the tight and hilarious script down to every face and gesture they make, and with a clever but not overcomplicated plot and plenty of top-notch gags there's plenty of fun to be had. It's a lot more reliant on wit and plot, and less on puerile toilet humour, than much of the Farrelly's output (and that of their recent successors/acolytes), which makes it a much more rounded and enjoyable comedy. Great fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

And I had heard some good stories about it. (From whom, I am now wondering.)Well, my expectations came true: this movie was painfully unfunny. You can laugh about jokes because you think they're funny-in my view, these jokes were quite the opposite; and you can laugh about jokes because of the way they are carried out: the tempo, the acting, etc. Alas, all of those qualities were not present in this movie.From now, I can safely leave Farrelly films alone. I'd say: 1 out of 10.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the Better Films shot in Rhode Island,"Rhode Island's favorite film makers, the Farrelly Brothers created one of the funniest films of the 1990's. There's Something About Mary was a story unlike many comedies. The film was a giant chance that ended up being a giant success. Since then, the Farrelly's have gone onto doing films the way they want with other not so popular films like Shallow Hal and Say It Ain't So. Still, the 1998 comedy blockbuster put Rhode Island on the map once again. Scenes shot on the East Side of Providence and downtown are still talked about today by the locals. Stories still float around about the antics Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon created on and off the set. More than 6 years have pasted and still the movie holds up on its own as one of the best comedies if not one of the best movies premiering in 1998.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love story with a twist!,"Coming off with hits like ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""Kingpin"", audience must have expected funny but juvenile and uncomfortable scenes from Farrelly brothers .But what they did not expect was a mature and sweet love story. Sure this is a romantic movie. But this is not another clichéd love story. No, this is a romantic movie with twist. It contains elements of a black comedy as well as a mindless gross-out teen sex comedy (of which I am a big fan) Though the main plot is not new, how it is executed is. The best part of the movie is its unpredictability. You actually wonder whether the boy will get the girl or not? The movie shocks you not only with its brilliant twists-and-turns but also with its grossness. This movie is quite re-watchable even if it loses shock value after you have seen it many times. Those who are fan of the first three ""American Pie"" movies will quite appreciate its humor. Though the gags may not be as disgusting or sexual like the 1999 American Pie, they are still funny and memorable. Some of them are so funny that your stomach will hurt from laughter even if you know what is going to happen. Even if you don't like its humor, you will still like the movie for its memorable character, brilliant pacing, nice music and believable acting, which is done by everyone in cast. Be warned this movie is not for everyone due to its vulgarity and political incorrectness.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I watched this film from start to finish and it failed to register on my funny bone enough to make me even smile, let alone laugh. I have no problem with sophomoric, juvenile, puerile, obscene and offensive humour... as long as it actually is humour. Animal House fits all those adjectives, yet it manages to be funny.

This film will serve as a model for all comedies to come.  Rather than trying to be funny with believability, all reality was thrown out the window with a much more digestible result.

"You're right, I agree with the title","This to me is one of the funniest comedies of 1998. Ever since ""The Mask"", Cameron Diaz is on a hot streak. Playing the object of every man's desire, no wonder she's so irresistible! Ever since the prom night accident, Ted(Ben Stiller) wants to see here after all those years. Zipping up his ""franks and beans"" was embarrassing enough, but seeing Mary(Diaz) fixing her strap didn't cause him to wonder. I knew from the start this movie was good. Then when Mary was living in Florida, Ben hires Pat Healy(Matt Dillon) the sleazy detective, not only to find her but to have her for himself. I think switching binoculars wasn't that important when Mary was unhooking her bra. But seeing that overly tanned lady top was a riot. All these characters, all the laughs, this movie got it all. Brett Farve as himself, that boosts the NFL big time. I laughed till my insides hurt, ""There's Something About Mary"" is a must see movie. And The Farrelly Brothers did a fantastic job at it.

They don't make comedies like they used to...,"...that is, comedies used to make the audience laugh.""There's Something About Mary"" is a spectacularly un-funny film, with no plot development, characters that are a mystery (I guess partly because they're not worth caring about in the first place), writing that is on the level of 5th grade boys telling dirty jokes on a campout, direction that is - well, direction-less, and a meandering storyline that doesn't entice the viewer to care about where the movie is going. By switching early on who is driving the story (Ben Stiller to Matt Dillon) the audience is confused as to what's going on, then when switching back to Stiller, the 'situations' that Stiller gets in when trying to hook up with Mary (who just seems to be in whatever scene doing whatever actions the script called for, without any semblance of belonging ever) are contrived, juvenile, and insulting to the intelligence.Why anyone beyond the preview audience went to see this movie is beyond me; even ""The Haunted Mansion"" which was criminally un-funny had more laughs than this reject from a garbage disposal.If more viewers would discover the classics of comedy - Chaplin, the Marx Brothers, Preston Sturges, Howard Hawks, Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, and other greats, then talentless hacks like the Farelly's would no longer be forcing such tripe on the American public, and truly funny pictures would be shown at theatres.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Simply the funniest comedy I've ever seen,"Having seen well over 10,000 movies myself I can, without a doubt in my mind, say that is the the funniest movie I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The over-the-top script and no holds barred jokes left me literally rolling out of my seat in the theater - and I wasn't the only one. I have seen several movies that received a standing ovation, as did this one, but this one topped everything else because the trailer I saw of it a few months back received a standing ovation as well - which is something I had never seen before. I'm sure there are people out there who don't appreciate the vulgarity of some of the jokes, but I think they're missing the point.  The whole point of the film is to be a farce, and critics who claim the movie is a farce are actually right.  Too bad they don't understand it though...

I'd like to speak well of this comedy but I can't succeed in. However, the main idea of the movie was interesting. This is the story of a young man (Ben Stiller who wish to pick up the trail of a girl he loved, Mary (Cameron Diaz) when he was in high school. For this, he hires a detective (Matt Dillon) but it's not easy: not only falls Dillon in love with her but the competition is very hard because Mary's got other admirers, notably a so-called architect (Lee Evans) and even an elderly man!Unfortunately, the Farrelly brothers obviously felt like introducing a crude and even disgusting humor which is everything except funny. When you think about ""Toto le héros"" a fantastic movie made by Jaco Van Dormael who succeeded in introducing a quiet and ironic humor even in dramatic sequences, you can't help feeling dismay towards ""there's something about Mary"".  Not only, its humor lacks of sharpness and subtlety but it's also completely irrelevant and it doesn't lend itself to certain sequences in the movie. This major flaw spoils it and it's a pity because it enjoys a good performance, especially Matt Dillon and Lee Evans.

Boring and stupid,"This movie is horrible.

The only funny scene is the one in the police station, but by then I was too tired and bored to laugh. A couple other scenes have good comic potential, such as the dog on speed, but they are wasted and fall flat.Even with the horrible script, which has no tangible plot and can't figure out who the main character is and doesn't bother to develop characters at all, it COULD have been funny with the right actors (this is what saved ""Dumb and Dumber""). Unfortunately, everyone here is bland and listless. I guess I'll make an exception for Lee Evans, who really is a talented comedian and does his best with an unfunny character. But Stiller and Dillon don't even seem to be trying that hard. Diaz doesn't even have personality; she's nothing more than a plot device. Except there is no plot. So I don't know what she is.

He worked on me and woke me to see when he pushed the j stimulator into the space and I felt the feeling in my legs go away. He had me put out and shoved it in and the next thing I remember is waking up with fear of falling. He had his wife as his nurse so that no one could smell him. He paralyzed other people before me and damaged in other ways at Swedish Hospital in Englewood, Colorado. A police officer at Swedish doing security smelled one day who could smell alcohol and turned him in to Swedish and they did nothing. That's where I'm coming from. He finally didn't renew his license when doctors had to post any lawsuits. Which he had more than 10 injured by him. And he moved to Pueblo, Colorado with a woman brain surgeon who had also killed someone and damagedI felt for all. If any one of them injured watched it. We had four people at Craig Hospital at the same time when one after another found each other. This is why I left the theater crying. It wasn't funny to me. Anyone else disabled who watched it? Thank you for letting me review this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
There's Something About Mary,"4/10 - I think the Farrelly brothers just maybe aren't my style of comedy, but this movie that should have been a slam dunk is not only not funny but has pretty ruthlessly failed the test of time.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny but full of f** f** f**,Maybe it's the thing to not be able to say anything without swearing for no reason but I think it spoils the film. Good story and funny antics make it worth watching but it would be good for a younger audience if it were edited.,5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Something is wrong with Mary,"Alto0ugh th e story is interesting the plot is neatly disgusting. Why ? Simple the story shows 3 +1 people coaxing a woman, The first of them was the near 5o marry her while they were younger - in the high school - when something happened (io forgot the story 10 days after watching the movie )n and her family left the city. 14 years after a friend and schoolmate advised her where she lives.Now what makes the story feel so ridiculous if not disgusting : full of american gags of time: mummifying in a way a dog in the screen ,flamed and then water put to get again live, other similar gags int the same scene, shrunken old woman's boobs , girls brother a dummy person asking his wurst - indirectly making anyone feel for his ...penis as most other people felt in the scene- , the friend of Stiller who has a mysterious disease from lukewarm and moist getting dull pustules in his face , another person with hand supports in front of herin a way that she could not use them properly , and many other stupid gags that fill nearly the whole movie.Now on the latter 1 on the equation : he is her ex spouse.This makes me rate the plot to 1/5.If all these gags could be removed and remade I feel the stoy would be much better.My curiosity was th only reason to watch it even if the time was too late (1 on the morning ) and I was disappointed to lose my time.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great premise ruined by over the top,vulgar humor.","I like the premise of this movie a lot.Cameron Diaz was perfect in her role as Mary,the girl that every guy dreams of,although not always in a flattering way..Ben Stiller was a perfect lead.It had all the makings for a great comedy and in the eyes of many,it is a great comedy.Here's what killed it for me personally,however:The over the top GROSS humor.I'm just not into it,and I may well have nightmares about the,shall I say,bodily function humor contained here.It's embedded in my mind and it will,no doubt take a long time to shake it.It ruined what would have been an otherwise enjoyable viewing experience.I won't be visiting this film again.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
don't waste your money - skip the movie,"generally i rented this movie 'cause I saw that it has a pretty good rating here on IMDB... 7.9 or so... fortunately, i had some coupons and spent only $1.50 when renting it.... if I paid whole price for this i would for sure commit a suicide...OK - the movie is one of the worst 'comedies' (i guess it goes under that classification) that I ever saw! I gave it 2 of 10 just because there are a few 'joke' taken from old movies worthed remembering. This movie... how should i put it? Well I would be happy if by some mysterious force all the copies disappeared from the world. The 'humor' is idiotic and it basically aims to the audience younger than 12 AND slightly retarded. Bad taste is always welcome in the movies - but this is just PLAIN stupid. Cameron Diaz looks fine - but if you want to admire her - just buy the poster and hang it on the wall.... CONCLUSION: this kind of 'movies' (and there are really few this stupid) should be forbidden by the law! (yeah i heard about the first amendment - but this is the good example why we need the exemption from it). I WANT MY $1.50 BACK!!!ps: also i would be happy to meet those individuals who gave this movie 8, 9, 10 here on IMDB... i have the interest in retards too, you see",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Once is Enough...,"Some video games are fun the first time you play them. You beat the game and never touch it again. That's because there's nothing new the second or third time through. That's what this movie is like. It's funny maybe once, but since it's been so over-hyped you may be expecting too much. It's also kind of long. I liked Kingpin WAY more, maybe because nobody really talked about it and spoiled the jokes ahead of time. And Kingpin has Bill Murray, a definite sign of quality.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
IS THIS COMEDY??????,"It really worries me that films like ""Mary"" actually make people laugh!Someone must be truly desperate to laugh with this film's disgusting and pretty rough jokes.It might be better than ""Dumb and Dumber"" and C.Diaz is ,as always,gorgeous but is that a good reason to tolerate this outrageous attack on good taste? I think not!",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
What's so funny?,"I sat through this nearly two hour movie and laughed once.  What is so funny?  Someone please explain it to me.  By the way, I'm 18, not some out of touch 40 year old, and I still don't get it.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sight-gag city,"The first hour was humorous, but wore me down in the 2nd hour. There are only so many vulgar sight gags one can sit through without wishing for a real story. If this is the future of filmmaking, I am worried!",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Low-grade humor is back !,"There's something about Mary doesn't deserve lots of comment. It was not funny (i.e. a stupid bathroom scene that continued to embarrass me for about ten to 15 minutes...), but there was a lot of laughing in the theater. Which explains the degree of intelligence I suppose of the average 'movie-watcher'. TSABM was too long, the plot was too predictable and as I said, the jokes for very low-grade. But I should have known better, my friends had warned me after they had seen Dumb and Dumber some time ago. Yes, you are right maybe I expected too much, like some people expect Godzilla to be a super intellectual film with a great plot and actors, while the lizard is the main subject of the movie...",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
