A New Perspective on Vietnam,"Short review: I typically do not care for Vietnam War movies. Some, like Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" are good. ""Platoon"" is alright, ""Casualties of War"" is okay... ""Hamburger Hill"" is blah, ""Good morning Vietnam"" too happy. The running theme is either firefights (which is good eye candy but poor storytelling) or the futility of war.""We Were Soldiers"" has a different take. First, Mel Gibson plays a colonel with a degree, allowing him to not only think like a soldier but an academic. He understands military history and why strategies have or have not worked, and why Vietnam is as pointless as Korea was.But what really stood out was the focus on the wives. The story is almost always about the boys becoming men in the battlefield. We rarely, if ever, see their parents or spouses. Here is an exception... the wives are their own squadron, bonding together and keeping strong. And that's the reality of war: people don't just die -- someone else has to feel that loss.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Into the heart of a movie battle like no other,"It is hard to stand out and be a unique war film. They've been making war films pretty much since the invention of film it seems. So you would think by now that it's all been done before, and for the most part it has. Yet We Were Soldiers manages to separate itself from the pack and give us a unique take on one particular battle in one particular war. Depicted here is the first major battle involving American troops in the Vietnam War. The fact that this battle takes place in what is known as the Valley of Death tells you all you need to know about what awaits the men who head into combat.The central figure in the movie is Lt. Col Hal Moore, played by Mel Gibson. Moore, leading the 7th Cavalry, will train his men and lead them into whatever hell awaits them. The film begins back home as Moore assembles his new unit and begins to whip them into shape. Here we learn much about what makes Hal Moore tick and begin to see him for the true leader of men he is. These opening scenes are important as they show many of Moore's motivations and also the obstacles which are placed in his way. The time back home also allows us to see Moore the family man with his strong, stoic wife, played by Madeline Stowe, and their young children. We also meet other key characters. There is Moore's second-in-command, battle-tested Sgt. Maj. Plumley, played with wonderful gruffness and all the appropriate seriousness by Sam Elliott. There is helicopter pilot Bruce Crandall, played by Greg Kinnear, and young Lt. Jack Geoghegan, played, surprisingly well for someone who came to prominence in a silly farce like American Pie, by Chris Klein. But the key figure throughout is undeniably Moore and Gibson's strong, confident portrayal is a key to the movie's success.While important in establishing the key characters and the emotional ties that bind them to each other and those whom they are leaving behind, the opening scenes back home have a feeling of just biding time about them. The film really takes off when the 7th Cavalry is dropped into the Valley of Death and confronts the overwhelming enemy force which awaits them. The rest of the film deals with this one epic, unrelenting battle. It sounds clich√©d but the battle scenes are so well choreographed and photographed that you do truly feel as if you are there. The intensity of the conflict jumps off the screen. The focus is on the valor and heroism of the American soldiers but unlike so many war films which present a nameless, faceless enemy we also get to see things from the Vietnamese perspective. We see the enemy leaders detailing their strategy and also are presented with reminders that the Americans are not the only ones with loving, concerned families back home. We see the toll on both sides, not just for the soldiers but perhaps most poignantly in scenes inter-cut from home where soldiers' wives wait to learn the fates of the men they love.We Were Soldiers is a brutally honest, unflinching look at the hell that is war. It is a story which begged to be told. Seeing as it is adapted from a book by two of the central figures in the conflict, Hal Moore and reporter Joe Galloway who found himself thrust into the middle of the conflict (and who is played wonderfully by Barry Pepper in the film) you can rest assured that unlike so many other war films this one would focus on ""getting it right."" The film tells it as it truly was. It is at times invigorating and inspiring and at other times truly heartbreaking. All in all it is a fitting tribute to, as the film states at the beginning, the men on both sides who died in that place.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Finally, somebody got it right about Vietnam!","Over the years, the movie going public has been subjected to film after film after film about the Vietnam War. Unfortunately, most of them are largely philosophical and don't paint the American soldier in a very positive light. The film makers usually take a leftist position towards the government and try to use the conflict on the ground as some sort of metaphor for the existential purpose of life. Thus, we get subjected to films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon, and Casualties of War. Although those film makers are certainly free to show us these interpretations of Vietnam, it gets old seeing our military trashed and our brave soldiers painted as drugged up sadists who were fighting for an immoral cause.From the beginning, you could tell We Were Soldiers is something different. It clearly shows the American soldier as what he/she usually is: Professional, brave, intelligent, and resourceful. There are no higher moral questions draped over this film. We simply see war as what it truly is. It is a conflict built up in the minds of our governments and carried out on the battlefield by our soldiers. Nothing more. Nothing less. Ultimately it is just about the man next to you and the men you're fighting against. We Were Soldiers focuses on this and this alone.The Ia Drang battle scenes (which take up most of the screen time) are ferocious. Mel Gibson shines as Col. Moore. He is the ultimate personification of masculinity. He ignores repeated requests for him to leave the battlefield as his troops are cut off and outnumbered. He seems to take the loss of each man personally as each commander should do. The combat footage is very graphic. This is not a film for those with weak stomachs.This film also gives us another thing other Vietnam War films are reluctant to even touch. It shows us behind the scenes footage of the North Vietnamese Army planning their assaults and evaluating American tactics. It's about time some movie showed the human side to the NVA. They are usually portrayed as heartless, soul-less savages. This is ridiculous. They were family men who took just as much pride in a job well done as our own troops.We Were Soldiers is an experience you won't soon forget. It is the pinnacle of what a war film should be. Not much time wasted on politics or existential philosophy. It is simply a graphic a realistic portrayal of war. For the soldiers on the battlefield, it isn't a matter of politics or a question of should we be here or not. What it comes down to is this: you have to kill your enemy or he will kill you!4 1/2 of 5 starsSo sayeth the Hound.",8.0,Anonymous,History
I've been waiting over 30 years for one,"Ever since 1970 when I finished my third tour of combat duty with the Marines in Viet Nam I have been waiting for a film that reflected the American Fighting Man in the Viet Nam war as an American Fighting Man; not a drugged-out, anti-war whiner. Well this is it. The movie is non-stop action after the first fifteen minutes of character development is finished. Having experienced what it is like to be over-run by the NVA during the third week of my first VN tour I can tell you that this movie does an excellent job of showing the excitement, tension, exhaustion, chaos, and courage of an extended battle. While this is by no means the best war movie I have ever seen, it is the first Viet Nam war movie which has provided me with a sense of satisfaction after leaving the theater. Mel Gibson turns in a good performance, Sam Elliot is a bit stiff. The wives of the soldiers are believable. Including a bit of the NVA's attitude about the war adds a balanced flavor to the film. Overall I would say that you will experience at least a small part the intensity of war if you go to this movie. I took my female companion and she was shocked, touched, and thrilled with it. As Americans, we need to remember that freedom is not, and never has been, free. It is always paid for with the blood of those who fight to get it, sustain it, or expand it. The politically correct may not like this film, but then who cares what they like. Thanks for making this film Mel. I've been waiting over 30 years to see it.",,Anonymous,History
Great Movie,"I found this movie to be very good.  I had refused to see it in the theater because I figured that it would just be another bad war movie.  I was wrong.  Mel Gibson delivers a powerful performance.  I especially enjoy how his frankness, and compassion feel believable for the character he protrays.Also this movie is different in how it depicts the enemy.  They aren't shown as overly inferior, or ruthless.  I don't like how many movies show the Vietnamese as a bunch of blood thirsty animals.  The enemies leader is shown as being high intelligent, and if anything overly confident.Yes, this movie is bloody, but it is impossible to depict the harsh realities of war without violence.  I think that everything is shown in a manner that does not take honor away from the soldiers.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Vietnam Veteran Contemplates WE WERE Soldiers,"I live with a Vietnam Vet who served in the late 1960s with 1st Cav. Medivac. During service he earned two Purple Hearts, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal. Since WE WERE SOLDIERS concerns the 1st Cav., Randy wanted to see it. I reluctantly agreed; I am not partial to war films and I dislike Mel Gibson, and Randy is very hard on Vietnam War films. He dismisses PLATOON as a Hollywood 8x10 glossy; says APOCALYPSE NOW is an interesting movie that captures the paranoia, but all the technical details are wrong; and describes DEER HUNTER as excellent in its depiction of the strangeness of coming home but so full of plot holes that he can hardly endure it. And about one and all he says: ""It wasn't like that.""He was silent through the film, and when we left the theatre I asked what he thought. He said, ""They finally got it. That's what it was like. All the details are right. The actors were just like the men I knew. They looked like that and they talked like that. And the army wives too, they really were like that, at least every one I ever knew."" The he was silent for a long time. At last he said, ""You remember the scene where the guy tries to pick up a burn victim by the legs and all the skin slides off? Something like that happened to me once. It was at a helicopter crash. I went to pick him up and all the skin just slid right off. It looked just like that, too. I've never told any one about it."" In most respects WE WERE SOLDIERS is a war movie plain and simple. There are several moments when the film relates the war to the politics and social movements that swirled about it, and the near destruction of the 1st. Cav.'s 7th Battalion at Ia Drang clearly arises from the top brass' foolish decision to send the 7th into an obvious ambush--but the film is not so much interested in what was going on at home or at the army's top as it is in what was actually occurring on the ground. And in this it is extremely meticulous, detailed, and often horrifically successful. Neither Randy nor I--nor any one in the theatre I could see--was bored by or dismissive of the film. It grabs you and it grabs you hard, and I can easily say that it is one of the finest war movies I have ever seen, far superior to the likes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which seems quite tame in comparison.Perhaps the single most impressive thing about the film is that it never casts its characters in a heroic light; they are simply soldiers who have been sent to do a job, and they do it knowing the risks, and they do it well in spite of the odds. Mel Gibson, although I generally despise him as both an actor and a human being, is very, very good as commanding officer Hal Moore, and he is equaled by Sam Elliot, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and every other actor on the battlefield. The supporting female cast, seen early in the film and in shorter scenes showing the home front as the battle rages, is also particularly fine, with Julie Moore able to convey in glance what most actresses could not communicate in five pages of dialogue. The script, direction, cinematography, and special effects are sharp, fast, and possess a ""you are there"" quality that is very powerful.I myself had a criticism; there were points in the film when I found the use of a very modernistic, new-agey piece of music to be intrusive and out of place. And we both felt that a scene near the end of the movie, when a Vietnamese commander comments on the battle, to be improbable and faintly absurd. But these are nit-picky quibbles. WE WERE SOLDIERS is a damn fine movie. I'll give Randy, who served two tours of duty in Vietnam, the last word: ""It may not be 'the' Vietnam movie. I don't think there could ever be 'the' Vietnam movie. But they pretty much get everything right. That's how it looked and sounded, and that's what I saw, and this is the best movie about Vietnam I've ever seen."" Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10.0,Anonymous,History
Portent of Things to Come,"I wasn't expecting much from this film because many of the reviews I'd read at the time of its release argued that it, and the book it was based on, were retrograde. The US soldiers provide the heroes and the North Vietnamese the villains. But it wasn't nearly so simple as that.Obviously it's been heavily influenced by ""Saving Private Ryan"", at least in one respect. It's even gorier than SPR. If a phosphorous grenade explodes, we see the Grunt with the flaming stuff stuck to his skin and clothing, burning holes into him, and we see a buddy cutting away the burning flesh of his cheek with a knife. When a Grunt is caught in a friendly-napalm blast he really burns and afterward his charred flesh is blackened, so that when a buddy tries to take his legs and pull him towards a Medivac the flesh of both legs from the knees down peels off into his buddy's hands. And of course there is squib charge upon squib charge exploding in slow motion, an unfortunate clich√© by now.One wonders just in passing how far this trend towards realistic gore can go -- and what the purpose behind the trip is. Well, it can't go much farther than it has. It seems just a short time ago that ""M*A*S*H"" had one shocking scene in it -- a wounded soldier in a hospital whose arterial blood pumped out of his body towards the surgeon. Actually it was more than thirty years ago. But our cinematic carnage has progressed by leaps and bounds. ""M*A*S*H"" was an early milestone. So was ""Bonny and Clyde,"" which introduced slow-motion death to American movies. ""Saving Private Ryan"" was a shocking blood bath. Now we have ""Blackhawk Down"", with a still-living soldier whose lower half has been blown away. And now there's ""We Were Soldiers.""As for WHY there has been such an increase of realism in violence, well, that's a different question whose answer can only be guessed at. Many cinematic movements like this one seem to follow a trajectory in which each film must out-do the previous examples of the genre. If gore is good box office, then more gore is even better box office. There may be a sincere desire on the part of the producers to show combat as it really is, but like all motives this one may be mixed, with some commercial interests thrown into the stew. And the motives of the audiences who turn these films into marketable products? It would be nice to think that they leave the theaters having learned something about the results of combat. But if that's the case, we don't seem to be showing much evidence of having grasped the lesson. In a sense, sensational gore cheapens and degrades the experience of the men and women who have lived through these extreme situations. So much suffering brings tears to the eyes, especially when we see the survivors visiting graves and monuments after the battle, as we do both here and in ""Saving Private Ryan."" And then, having wept, the audience leaves the theater and embraces the next war. The arousal jag is over. Good intentions, when viewed from a slightly different angle, have an uncanny way of resembling exploitation.Okay. Enough philosophy. The movie is better than I'd expected it to be, the excess of gore and the slow-motion clich√©s aside. (I was also confused by the topography, although locations are clearly labelled. Where exactly is the creek bed?) There isn't much in the way of home-front scenes, but what there is neatly reflects the anxiety and pain of those left behind. The combat scenes are exhausting. A few hundred Americans opposed by some four thousand regulars of the North Vietnamese army. (About the same ratio of Americans to adversaries as General Custer faced, only he had no air support. Custer is brought up several times.)But, most important, this is the first film I can remember seeing about the Vietnam war in which the enemy is presented as something other than outright evil. There is a good deal of irony in the movie. Mel Gibson prays before the battle. Take us under your wing, and so forth, he asks. Then throws in, ""Ignore those pagans praying to a different God."" Much later in the film, long enough for us to have forgotten Gibson's racist plea, the commander of the North Vietnamese army is also seen praying -- presumably to the same God. And one of the NV soldiers is humanized to the extent of keeping on his person a diary written to his wife. (The soldier wears glasses so we can tell him from the other North Vietnamese and remember him.) He dies heroically and when the Americans take the diary from his body and flip through it, they find a picture of his wife, a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Gibson's wife, played by Madeleine Stowe. We win the battle (Ia Drang) of course, but even this is undercut by irony. The NV commander looks at the piles of bodies after the Americans leave. He shakes his head and says, ""What a tragedy."" The worst part of it, he muses, is that the Americans will treat this as a victory and the war will go on to its necessary end, although now it will mean just that many more deaths.Should you bother watching this? I think so. This one would have been a true original if it had appeared twenty years ago.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Powerful and moving, not a film for everyone however","I was privileged to see a preview of Mel Gibson's new film ""We Were Soldiers"" based upon the book written by his real life character, Lt. Col. Harold Moore, along with Joe Galloway. I attended a showing along with numerous other Viet Nam vets and it would seem that there were as many opinions about the movie as there were viewers.  Like the war itself, each person in attendance probably had some personal experiences that the movie brought back from that deep, and sometimes distant, place we have put them.The movie was almost overwhelmingly graphical, but afterwards I realized this was instrumental in the telling of the story.  For the movie is truly about the leadership that Col. Moore brought to his men of the 1st of the 7th, and his determination that they would not suffer the fate of the French in Viet Nam, nor his own unit's most infamous battle, that of Custer's Stand at Little Big Horn.It was his determination and commitment that his men be as highly trained, as strongly molded as a unit, and most importantly as well lead as possible that stands out. This determination is obviously rooted in his deeply abiding belief that military leaders shall never forget that when they lead men into war, many of those men will never come back alive, but that those who lead shall never abandon them, even in their shared darkest hours.And while the movie highly succeeds in conveying the horror and tragedy that war is....has been...and always shall be, it was more difficult for me to realize that our War Department and Army could have been so callous as to have delegated the responsibility of notifying next-of-kin of the death of their loved ones to the local Yellow Cab company. Then I realized that in late 1965 it was all so new and no one knew that this war was going to grow and consume so many young American lives over the next nine years.The two most significant scenes in the movie for me were firstly, the scene when the course of the battle teeters on the brink of either disaster or success and the most important communication that Col. Moore's superiors have to convey is that General Westmoreland would like for him to leave the battlefield and fly to Saigon so the general can have a briefing. This more than anything pointed out how tragically we were doomed to failure in Viet Nam due to the political will, not the military will, being in control. The second most significant scene was in the airport where one soldier is pushing his buddy through the concourse and the voice over says...""They did not fight for God.....country.....right. They fought for each other"", a fact that every Viet Nam vet would attest to.This a movie worth seeing. It is another testament, with a worthy cinematographic effort, to the futility and absurdity of war, and how that among madness can be greatness. It is a movie that will unlikely leave the viewer devoid of emotion.  What those emotions may be are as likely to be as highly personal, as the strength of their feeling.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great battle scenes but pretty weak in many other areas,"Great battle scenes but pretty weak in many other areas.A telling of the 1st Battalion, 7 Cavalry Regiment, 1st Calvary Division's battle against overwhelming odds in the La Drang valley of Vietnam in 1965. Seen through the eyes of the battalion's commander, Lt. Col. Hal Moore (played by Mel Gibson), we see him take command of the battalion and its preparations to go into Vietnam. We also see how the French had, years earlier, been defeated in the same area. The battle was to be the first major engagement between US and NVA forces in Vietnam and showed the use of helicopters as mobility providers and assault support aircraft.Very gritty battle scenes. Captures well the chaos and confusion of battle, plus the desperation and terror involved when things aren't going well. Mostly accurate, by most accounts, though some minor liberties are taken for dramatic effect.The problem, however, lies with just about everything else. Dialogue is quite over-the-top, as if just about everybody is played by John Wayne. Many simple passages of dialogue are turned into speeches, and clich√©-filled speeches at that.In keeping with the cheesy dialogue, some pretty heavy-handed, overly gung ho scenes too. Once again, reminded me of a John Wayne movie.Overall, quite entertaining, just uneven because of the mix of gritty battle scenes and cheesy dialogue and other scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"""They Finally Got it Right!""","""We Were Soldiers"" is based on a real life battle of the Viet Nam war that took place in 1965 in a remote part of Viet Nam. It is based on a book by Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway who are portrayed in the film by Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper respectively.The film opens with a depiction of the 1954 slaughter of French troops by the Vietnamese army. Twenty one years later Lt. Col Moore (Gibson) and his battalion of 395 men are thrust unknowingly into the same hornet's nest consisting of some 4,000 battle hardened Viet Nam regulars who have been fighting their enemies for many years.Director Randall Wallace tells the story from three perspectives. Firstly from the viewpoint of the Americans. Outnumbered ten to one they face impossible odds. How Col. Moore rallies his troops and gets them to pull together as a team is a central theme of the picture. Secondly, the story is told from the viewpoint of the wives and families left behind and the problems they have to deal with. Lastly, the Vietnamese army is shown not as unfeeling monsters, but as a professional army defending their beliefs and territory.The battle scenes are as realistic and convincing as any war movie that you will ever see. We suffer through the casualties both on the battlefield and at home along with the participants. The special effects are seamless and exciting.Mel Gibson gives a convincing performance as Moore and if you watch the DVD, you can see the amazing similarities between the two men. Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore and Keri Russell plays Barbara Geoghegan two of the wives who take on the unenviable task of delivering those dreaded telegrams to the widows from the War Department. Chris Klein plays Russell's husband Jack a new officer and father. His scene with Gibson in the base chapel is memorable. Greg Kinnear plays Captain Crandall the head of Moore's helicopter fleet. Don Duong is very effective as the Vietnamese commander. But acting cudos go to veteran Sam Elliot as the crusty Sgt. Major Plumley.""We Were Soldiers"" is a gripping Viet Nam war drama told in a way that reflects ALL of the participants in an impartially realistic way. As Hank Moore says on the DVD, They finally got it right.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Not bad but could have been a lot better.,"I saw this film at the theatre when it came out and thought it was pretty good on the big screen.I have it on DVD and have watched it a couple more times. Unfortunately my opinion of this film has lessened with two repeat screenings.I'll still rate it a 6 out of 10 because the battle scenes are largely very good.It's not a bad film but could have been a lot better given the subject material, the historical background and the scale of the battle. I haven't read the book about the real event.I loved Sam Elliot as the Sgt Major and thought Barry Pepper was good.With subsequent viewings I have paid more attention to what I think are the overbearing clich√©s, patriotism and corniness (""I'm glad I could die for my country"", ""tell my wife I love her"", ""we'll give 'em hell sir"" etc).While there's nothing wrong with patriotism and I can't speak from experience, I suspect Hoot (Eric Bana)in Blackhawk Down was far more realistic about men under fire when he said ""Once that first bullet goes past your head politics goes right out the window"" and ""It's about the man next to you"".Colonel Moore (Gibson) seems too perfect. An officer, gentleman, historian, wonderful father, husband, religious man and leads from the front. He would be a shoe-in for President. He seemed a bit too gung-ho under fire. All that was missing was for him to be holding an M-60 (heavy machine gun) in one hand and firing it from the hip. Did he not have any weaknesses?Perhaps Gibson had too much influence over the director in regards to the character of Moore. They have worked together on Braveheart and I think Gibson's company made the movie (I may be mistaken).Not an Oscar winning performance from Gibson, but it appeared to be a Medal of Honour winning performance from Moore.Some other annoying bits:Director Wallace seems to love killing people off in mid-sentence. If I go to war I'm going to keep my mouth shut. I'm less likely to become a casualty.We are introduced to the Japanese American soldier who informs us that he is about to become a father, it's so blatant that we should endear ourselves to him a bit more just before he is horrifically (mortally?)wounded.I know that they can do wonders with special effects these days but do the directors judge the success of their project by seeing if they can outdo the last war film by illustrating even more horrific injuries then the last film (Saving Private Ryan, Blackhawk Down, We Were Soldiers). I think we got the blood splatter on the camera lens at least 3 times in WWS.Remember Elias getting killed in Platoon. Not a limb missing or head exploding in sight (ok, the squibs didn't go off) but still dramatic and moving.Did the American soldiers carry entrenching tools? I would have thought that in a battle like that soldiers would have been digging in with spades, helmets or even their hands. A lot of them seemed to be relying on vegetation for cover. It's not paintballs being fired.Another thing that irks me are the next of kin notifications coming in while the battle rages. ""The army wasn't ready"" says Moore's wife. They seemed right up on ther play with forwarding the bad news home. How could they have had an accurate idea of casualties in the middle of the battle when most of ther KIA were still down in the field. I would have thought it may have been a couple of days or longer before next of kin could be notified.I realize what the director was trying to do here but he broke up the momentum of the film and the grieving widows after the battle and near the end of the film would have been a far more realistic and poignant ending to the film, especially contrasted with Moore being able to return home to his family.I seem to be being very negative about the film. However, as stated before, it's not a bad film but it's disappointing because it could have been a lot better.Worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Among the best war films in recent memory,"`Saving Private Ryan' redefined the war genre and opened the floodgates to a new generation of war movies.  It pushed the boundaries of acceptability by frankly showing war in all its grisly glory.  As such it gave us a better understanding of how terrible and frightening war is.  `Black Hawk Down' took the graphic violence to a new level, with an intensity that matched the beach landing of SPR, but of a duration that was almost unbearable.`We Were Soldiers' is the latest big budget war offering from Hollywood. In many ways, I consider this to be the most complete of the three. Writer/Director Randall Wallace (who wrote ""Braveheart"", ""Pearl Harbor"" and the screenplay for this film), takes the understanding of war to the next level, by offering more than one perspective to the events.  Of the three films, this film has the best workup, the best character development, and the most nuanced look at the battle.  He brings all the sustained intensity of BHD in the action sequences, but introduces the NVA perspective, the wives' perspective and a far more charismatic and heroic central figure in Lt. Col. Hal Moore.Based on real events, this film shows war as being horrendous and heartless to both sides.  It expands outside the combat zone to visit the ramifications on the families as well.  The scenes with the wives getting the telegrams are poignant reminders of how war reaches beyond the battlefield.  Wallace's treatment grabs us on an emotional level and shocks the senses.  Unlike BHD, which presented the characters in a very anonymous way, we come to know these characters and their families and identify with them.Of course, the film lacks the hard edge that would make it starkly believable.  It is after all a Hollywood production and not a documentary. However, Wallace pours enough realism into the depictions to assure that this doesn't turn into another sappy melodrama like `Pearl Harbor', which was really nothing more than a romance with a long battle scene in the middle.  Wallace finds the optimal balance between engaging storytelling and the brutality of combat.The acting is excellent.  Mel Gibson offers the right combination of hard nosed officer and father figure (both to his children and his men). Gibson is steadfast and courageous without being harsh.  His portrayal of Moore is so well played, so charismatic and heroic, that it is impossible to believe that such a person could actually exist.Sam Elliot follows an outstanding performance in `The Contender' with this gem as Sergeant Major Plumley, the tough as nails warhorse who serves as Moore's non commissioned adjutant.  Elliot plays the intransigent career soldier to the hilt, where nothing including life itself is more important than honor and discipline.  Barry Pepper also turns in a fine performance as Joe Galloway, the photo journalist who hops on a helicopter to take pictures in the center of the battle and finds himself with a rifle in his hands fighting for his life.This is among the best war films in recent memory and probably the best film on the Vietnam War film since `Full Metal Jacket'.  I rated it a 10/10. This film is not for everyone.  It contains graphic violence and disturbingly realistic battle scenes.  It is a gripping and distressing film that should be required viewing for statesmen and generals alike.",10.0,Anonymous,History
We Were Soldiers is uneven but a moving tribute to Vietnam Warriors,"This movie unfolds slowly, beginning with a somewhat corny attempt to build a picture of the soldiers at home. Mel Gibson seems to be a likable sort, although he is a bit much as the gung-ho, Bible-thumping colonel in the Air Cavalry. His wife at first seems rather unsympathetic. In fact, she looks as if she were stung in the upper lip by a bee. Her performance, and that of the other officer's wives, comes off as rather stilted. Once orders come through and Gibson's regiment are deployed to Vietnam, things pick up considerably. A wave of helicopters takes the first sixty men to a hot landing zone in the Central Highlands. The photography is impressive and the action ratchets up very quickly. Right after landing, some dope decides to chase an enemy scout up a hill into the jungle, leading his squad after him. This foolhardy act comes off as a bit absurd, but the results form an important part of the story. The small group of soldiers are cut off from the rest of the regiment, and for the next day and night, they are under continual attack from an enemy determined to annihilate them. The surviving NCO displays a coolness under fire that saves the lives of at least some of his fellows. Down with the main body of the regiment, which has been steadily reinforced, the colonel and his tough-as-nails sergeant have their hands full fending off wave after wave of enemy combatants. While some might contend that the movie is a bit over the top here and there, it does a good job of depicting the confusion, excitement, and fear of a pitched battle. Many of the scenes are gruesome and seemingly realistic, with the minor criticism that support of US troops from artillery and from the air seems a bit too instantaneous and precise. At one point, the NVA and Viet Cong are overwhelming the surrounded and outnumbered Americans and yet are cut to pieces by machine gun fire and napalm from the air. At the same time, however, some of the Americans are killed or seriously wounded from friendly fire simply because the targeted enemy is right on top of them. The guy who plays the determined North Vietnamese commander does an effective job, sending so many of his troops to their deaths in trying at all costs to defeat the Americans in their first major battle and win an important psychological victory. It might be said that ""We Were Soldiers"" attempts to honor the enemy nearly as much as it does our own forces. They certainly died in much greater numbers than we did and this skirmish was no exception. Regardless of the outcome of the war, any vet who survived a struggle of this intensity should hold his head high, while those who died deserve every honor accorded them.An eery dirge punctuates the action at certain key moments in the battle, and after it is over, the field littered with corpses, the colonel (it is said) finishes his tour of duty and finally returns home to be reunited with his family, one of the lucky ones who came home physically and mentally intact. When he rings the door bell and his wife, fearing the worst, sends the kids to bed and opens the door, it is a very emotional moment. The credits then begin to roll to a moving anthem. So, although the movie takes too much time to get rolling, it has a strong patriotic finish and seems to be a fairly accurate, if somewhat propagandized depiction of battle in the Vietnam era. On balance, it is a good, stirring war movie much more like those about WWII than the usual cynical offering about Vietnam. Worth watching more than once.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Seeing the enemy and home in a different light,"This film is so different from the traditionally cynical (and rightly so) Vietnam War movies.  While it goes without question that this film depicts the bloody and gruesome horrors of the tragedy of the first major conflict of the war, it does so while juxtaposing the story with that of stories of the home front and the enemy.  The enemy in this film is not the animalistic, silent enemy we are used to.  We hear this enemy speak, we see his love for his family and his devotion to his cause.  While being bombarded with images of death and destruction on the battlefield, we are brought back home to see the wives as they face the death themselves.While of course not a flawless movie, it was without a doubt moving, and I highly recommend it.",,Anonymous,History
Choppering into the Little Big Horn,"If LtCol Harold Moore did not actually exist, it would be necessary for Hollywood to invent him.  A tough-talking, straightforward leader of men, equal parts swagger and heart, he loves his troops like his own children, refuses to leave the combat zone while his boys are in the sharp end, and sheds tears for the fallen in between barking orders into a radio handset and shooting charging enemies through the head.  The crazy thing about Moore, and about ""We Were Soldiers"" in general, is not how much is Hollywood hokum, but how much seems to be but isn't.  Moore is a real person and he was by all accounts (including, but not limited to, his own) a tough soldier, a shrewd commander, and the kind of crazy SOB who would be the first to go in and the last to leave.""We Were Soldiers"" is the story of Moore and his 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry (Custer's old unit) in the Ia Drang valley, the first major confrontation between American and Vietnamese troops.  This alternately brilliant and exasperating movie is based on a book by Moore and UPI reporter Joe Galloway, with the cumbersome but oddly poetic title ""We Were Soldiers Once...and Young"".  It begins with Moore's assignment to the Army's first dedicated air cavalry unit, which is among the first US combat troops sent to Vietnam.  What starts as a mission to destroy an enemy force that attacked an American base becomes a brutal siege as the Cav are surrounded and trapped, 395 men pitted against nearly two thousand of the enemy.Moore is played by Mel Gibson, who adeptly portrays both the paternal kindness of a decent man and the manic glint so common in good infantry officers.  Unfortunately, the movie focuses so much on him that it loses some of its big-picture scope.  After a while it begins to seem that Gibson is everywhere; no firefight can commence unless he fires the opening volley, no act of valor passes without a shot of Gibson's eyes welling up with pained pride at the sacrifice of his soldiers.  A little of this is good, too much of it is bad.  Moore probably was larger than life, but Gibson's Moore almost threatens to be larger than the movie.The supporting cast is led by Sam Elliott, whose Sergeant Major Plumley is destined to take his place among the greatest flinty NCO portrayals in film history.  Barry Pepper plays Galloway, and delivers the movie's intro and epilogue, though he doesn't appear until late in the movie.  The movie parallels the story of the battle with that of the officers' wives, led by Madeleine Stowe as Julie Moore.  The wives' story is given some short shrift (and some very clumsy scenes), though it is in parts so wrenching it is almost a relief to return to the war zone.One memorable passage in Moore's book likens the sound of a bullet hitting flesh to that of a canoe paddle slapping wet mud, an image that is at once comical and horrifying.  We have come to expect graphic carnage from our war movies these days.  However, instead of the rapid-fire speed-lapse photography seen in ""Saving Private Ryan's"" unforgettable Normandy sequence, writer/director Randall Wallace offers more straightforward depictions of the businesslike horrors of close combat: he doesn't use a lot of camera tricks to communicate the concept of chaotic violence, he just fills the screen with chaotic violence and lets us watch it in its unflinching fury. And call me an air-show junkie, but he has some beautiful sequences of Hueys diving over hilltops, flying in through smoke, etc.Most latter-day war movies give a nod to the enemy, making him human, not a faceless monster.  For all this movie's flag-waving sentimentality, it's actually better in this regard than most.  The Vietnamese are not fearless stoics; we see a young NVA infantryman panting and wide-eyed with fear as he charges the equally afraid Americans (something even anti-American screeds like ""Platoon"" never showed).  It's also instructive to watch Moore and his opposite number (Don Duong) moving among their troops doing similar things: offering encouragement, making stirring speeches, and plotting the demise of the other.This is a battle picture, a movie that exhaustively analyzes a single big-picture event in a war.  While movies of this type have been made for years, this is one of the very few to come out of Vietnam.  The pantheon of great (and not-so-great) Vietnam movies all have one thing in common: they portray specific events that did not, strictly speaking, actually take place.  Those movies are more about Vietnam as a general phenomenon than about anything that quantifiably happened there.  In this way, ""We Were Soldiers"" represents something quite daring: Wallace has made an early-40s WWII movie about the Vietnam War.And that's part of the problem: the movie has far too many places where it goes for overblown sentiment and emotional manipulation, often hokey to the point of embarrassment.  The fact that many of the cliches are true and many of the corny Hollywood moments are based in fact does not excuse slathering them in high melodrama.  This is doubly a shame because these scenes overshadow some stunning moments that work better for being small: none of the shots of Moore's eyes misting at the loss of his men can match the power of a scene that shows him standing by himself, his back to the camera as his shoulders shake with his unseen sobs.  This is a good movie, but it misses its chance to be a great movie because it doesn't trust us in the folding seats to adequately grasp the point.When ""We Were Soldiers"" goes wrong, it makes you want to roll your eyes. But when it gets it right, it cuts straight through to you with a sound like a canoe paddle slapping wet mud.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Behind even a forgotten war lies the memory of the fallen...,"Behind even a forgotten war lies the memory of the fallen...This movie is definitely among the top 10 films ever made. It places the viewer right in the middle of the Vietnam War, grabs their emotions and sets them free. This movie commemorates the memories and makes heroes of each and every husband, brother, and son involved in a forgotten war- a war that was dismissed and frowned upon by the American nation as a whole. The film also takes the viewer into the home of the soldier. It invades the private life of the loved ones at home. We feel as though we are a part of the family in one scene, and the buddy of a fallen soldier in the next. A wife, child, friend of a soldier gone to war to fight for an ungrateful nation one minute, and the next the brave and loyal soldier.

Has all the standard clich√©s in it but still is a movie worth watching.,"""We Were Soldiers"" is a nicely made movie but isn't exactly memorable, original or impressive enough to leave a lasting impression.There are several problems I had with this movie. Perhaps the biggest problem was that it wasn't easy to follow. It was hard to tell who was where at the moment fighting. Basically all we ever get to see are the Americans and the NVA shooting at each other through bushes and running towards each other. The movie lacks a sense of scale and because of that the movie also doesn't ever really become realistic. It's interesting that they also show the NVA side of the battle, something that's a very rare thing in a Vietnam-war movie but it's all done in a very shallow and formulaic way.Which brings me to another problem I had with this movie. It's all too formulaic and not original enough. The characters are build up in a sappy way and they lack substance and aren't likable or interesting enough. And having dying soldiers saying 'tell my wife I love her' has got to be one of the biggest movie clich√©s in movie history. There were really some scene's that made me cringe such as the scene in which a dying soldier says 'I'm glad I could die for my country'. I know it is wrong but I actually laughed and I mean really laughed during that scene. It was so embarrassing and totally unrealistic to look at. It took away all of the emotions and sense of desperateness and danger. It was a very over-dramatized and because of that also not a believable enough movie, to follow. They over-dramatized it even more to add the wives of the soldiers to the storyline. For me those sequences didn't worked and were only distracting and felt unnecessary.The movie is good looking and the battle sequences are nicely set up but it never becomes really tense or spectacular. Because of that ""We Were Soldiers"" is a good looking movie that is worth watching just maybe once but at the same time is also very forgettable movie that lacks real substance.The excellent musical score by Nick Glennie-Smith is wonderful though and is to be honest the only reason why I ever wanted to see this movie.There are better and more realistic Vietnam war movies to watch out there instead. Randall Wallace has created a sappy, over-the-top dramatic movie that doesn't make an awfully large impression.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Very real story,"This has to be the most real war story I have seen... ever. I found Black Hawk Down laughable, Windtalkers sad, but this... wow.This is an excellent film that tells the true tale from the biography of Lt. Col. Hal Morris. It shows the horrors that the families go through, as well as the men. It even shows how the ""enemy"" are people too.I would like to make a personal editorial here, since I feel a great wrong has been posted about this movie by some people here... To all the people calling this flag waving propaganda, you obviously didn't watch the movie, hence I feel your votes should be removed for this film. If anything, it showed the horrors of war, how our men suffered for what was believed to be a noble mission, and how in spite of terrible odds they overcame, and the promise that ""No one will be left behind"" was kept. I know people who were there. They ended up having nightmares because it hit so close to home. This was REAL. If it were propaganda, everyone would get home and we would all be happy. You want to talk Propaganda, watch almost any John Wayne movie, or even Patton. This was not. Men died. Good Men. Family men - on both sides. Yes, the only way we survived that battle was superior technology, but it was the only reason. They were dropped into an ambush, yet they survived. Lt. Col. Morris didn't come back proud of what he did, he was just happy the mission was accomplished and they survived. Yet, he was hurt badly by every wasted life. Propaganda? You totally missed the point! Is propaganda showing how we killed our own men because of our mistakes? Lies? Tell me, were you there? I didn't think so. Unless you were there, stop with the misinformation. Your the ones spreading propaganda and lies, not the film! If you want to get picky, then I will cover one more thing. Was there some fictionalizing? Of course! they had to squeeze in over 40 characters into a few leads! Lots of stuff had to be cut, so things were glossed over and cut. I'm not saying it's perfect in character detail, but the overall story was left in tact. This was not a Hollywood story even with the changes. The plot did not deceive. That battle was as real as a recreation could be. Even Lt. Col. Hal Morris, who is retired and was there, says so. Even my ex-boss and a couple other friends, who were either at that battle or at Nam, said so. If anyone has a right to point out lies, it's our ignored and abused Nam veterans.My apologies to everyone else for that rant.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Anti-Vietnam or anti-war?,"We, average movie lovers, are a little tired of Vietnam movies. Hollywood mass-produces them and indifferent films with different casts parade on the theaters.But the thing we are really tired of is Anti-Vietnam movies, with the message ""We Shouldn't Be Here"" written all over them. I don't argue that America should battle there, but the message has become boring after watching it over and over again. ""Platoon"" brings together everything I hate about Vietnam movies so it's the worst example for me, with ""Born on the 4th of July"" close behind it.But I know that Kubrick and De Palma used the same setting to produce masterpieces ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Casualties of War"".""We were soldiers"" does not excel like the two I mentioned above, but is definitely a good movie despite those negative criticism it got from the critics. First of all it is an anti-war movie, not anti-Vietnam. It has a humanitarian attitude. ""Thin Red Line"" has the same attitude but so much that it was a distraction. Randall Wallace, gives a good mixture of combat and humanity.Mel Gibson is his usual self and does not disappoint. Gregg Kinnear delivers a decent performance as ""Snake"" and it was an interesting change to watch Sam Elliott without his legendary mustache.Violence and bloody scenes can disturb the ones with a weak stomach, but if you like a decent war movie, forget the critics and watch ""We were Soldiers""",7.0,Anonymous,History
John Wayne wishes he made this movie,"In the tradition of such war film classics as The Bridges at Toko Ri, To Hell and Back well as John Wayne's The Green Berets is this seemingly out of place epic with the amount of cynical pestilence abound.The pace is lightning fast once the scenes transfer into the early period of the Vietnam war before the public grew impatient. The score of the film is often overlooked but in this case it provides plenty of emotion especially as the 7th Regiment assembles for the trip to South Vietnam beneath the radio towers late at night.Of a forgotten battle with unknown heroes for both forces this is a great war movie that should be a lesson for future productions.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Very entertaining and disturbing,"It's hard to say what I didn't like about this movie. The acting was great. The effects were great. The dialogue was great. The tempo was non-stop. Maybe that was it ... I rented this and found I had to take a break to get my breath back! Should a movie really engage you so closely in the dirty realities of battle? Watching ET ride a bicycle across the sky is so much easier on the brain. Do I really want to watch guys getting their bodies shot apart?Still, I'd highly recommend the movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. I did find Mel Gibson to be a bit of an awkward fit for Colonel Moore. His pretty boy face was a bit short of real for the gutsy role, even with all the dirt and blood smeared on it. But being the actor he is, he pulls it off. A young Scott Glenn would have been a best cast for the part.What I did really like about the movie is that it did not overly glamorize or deify war. Both the Americans and the Vietnamese suffered greatly, and the movie effectively showed suffering on both sides.Haven't seen this yet? Go rent it now. This is not the type of movie you'll want to watch several times .. once is enough, but still, you'll enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A massacre,"This movie fails in most areas and is an obvious ploy to cash-in on the patriotism fad. The makers should have spent more time editing the film to at least make it passable as a war/action movie, instead of rushing to release this piece of trash. Nevertheless, the writing was so poor that it never really had a chance to become a memorable work.My biggest problem with this film is that none of the characters are worth caring about. The quick jumps from scene to scene and the cliche-ridden dialog preclude the viewer from ever getting a deeper look into the hearts and minds of the players. Mel Gibson's Hal Moore was portrayed as a mythic warrior who somehow had the omniscience to predict all of the NVA's moves, and yet his notes on the French massacre looked like they were written by a ten year old. Furthermore, his religious drivel was really overdone.And just because a soldier is wearing a bracelet emblazoned with his newborn's name, that doesn't mean I'm going to care if he lives or dies in battle. It's sad when a wafer-thin flick like American Pie gives Chris Klein's character more depth than a supposedly ""serious"" film like We Were Soldiers.Additionally, the soldiers' wives were given a fair amount of screen time but little to do other than receive telegrams and cry. Madeleine Stowe was decent as Moore's wife (but incidentally, her collagen-injected lips were a bit distracting). And one particularly offensive scene involved these women - the scene in which they were discussing the laundromat. I thought it was in poor taste to make a joke out of racial discrimination.Another incredibly offensive thing about the movie was the half-hearted attempt to present the Vietnamese as human beings. As someone else wrote here, it was very patronizing. The NVA soldiers facelessly marched up and down hills and were subsequently mowed down by gunfire like Bruce Lee disposed of hordes of ninjas. And yet the director wants us to care when the wife of a fallen soldier looks at his photo. Which is it?In terms of action, the battle scenes were average. The blood and gore was on par with recent war movies. But the Americans were painted as kids who were afraid to advance unless copious amounts of bombs were dropped on the Vietnamese first. Perhaps that's how it was, but if you're going to try to tap into nationalistic fervor by picking one battle that the US won and by exaggerating the deeds of a Lt. Colonel, you may as well go all the way and invent some compelling and dramatic events on the field of battle. I might have enjoyed this film on a superficial level if there were at least some in-depth tactical maneuvers involved. Greg Kinnear flying in to the save the day isn't good enough.Ultimately, We Were Soldiers is a weak war movie. It has no heart, no drama, and little action. I strongly suggest that you skip this one, as it doesn't come close to comparing to great films like Apocalypse Now and to a lesser extent, Platoon.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Factual to the point of pain,"I should never be surprised that people, who wouldn't recognize Principle, much less Honor, Duty, or Country if it introduced itself, see virtue as vice.  As one who served in that war, I found the movie to be factual to the point of pain.  Those who call this movie racist, lack vocabulary. or an understanding of racism.  I don't know which is sadder.  This movie tells a part of a soldier's story very well.  Soldiers march to a different drummer, how tragic that so many, today, still refuse to honor those who protected them.The millions in Indo-China murdered at the hands of the Communist cry that our ""racism"" was so poorly lead at the highest civilian levels that we abandon them.  Their blood is not on my hands or on the hands of my fellow soldiers.  It is on the hands of those who are so blind they refuse to see. A valid case could be made that that there are errors in the story, certainly it doesn't tell the rest of the story, or of the next part of this battle where US casualties were 40%.  What it does tell it tells very well. Those men were volunteers, and their nobility shows in this movie.  I recommend it, especially for any who would want to understand those who served at that time.",,Anonymous,History

"Intense and well-staged, but nothing we haven't seen before","After Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan reinvented the way the brutality and chaos of war was depicted on the cinema screen back in 1998, Hollywood went slightly nuts for all things World War II. At one point, it felt as though we were getting one every other week, and fatigue naturally kicked in, especially since none measured up to Spielberg's visual masterpiece (if very flawed film), other than Terrence Malick's superior The Thin Red Line released the same year. By 2002, attention was moving towards the Vietnam conflict, an unjust and borderline psychotic war that resulting in heavy losses on all sides. It was a favourite topic for many filmmakers in the 1980's, and produced a few greats, but interest seemed to wane as we moved into the 90's. In 2002, We Were Soldiers was supposed to rekindle our fascination with Vietnam, but has since faded into a long list of half-forgotten war movies.Based on the book We Were Soldiers Once... and Young by Hal Moore and Joseph L. Galloway, Randall Wallace's film attempts to cover the Battle of Ia Drang from three perspectives: the 400 American men fighting at the front, the 4,000 Vietnamese troops they're up against, and the wives at home fearing the arrival of a taxi cab bringing them unwanted news. The bulk of the action follows Moore (Mel Gibson), then a lieutenant colonel, through training his troops and eventually onto the front line, where intelligence is so sparse that they have no idea what they are up against. It turns out that the Americans are greatly outnumbered, and so begins one of the bloodiest battles of the entire war. He is later joined by reporter Galloway (Barry Pepper), who captured much of the conflict on camera as well as picking up a rifle himself. At home, Moore's wife Julie (Madeleine Stowe) intercepts all the letters informing the devastated wives of their loss to hand-deliver them herself.We Were Soldiers feels like more of a complete overview on the battle thanks to this unique perspective, while the action is some of the toughest and most unflinching in the genre. Perhaps down to its more observational approach - apparently the events take place almost exactly how it played out in real life - the film often gets criticised and labelled as a pro-war movie. I don't feel that what we see is glamorising or promoting war in any way. On the contrary, it refuses to really to take a stand, and this is what makes Wallace's movie far less interesting than it should be. It all boils down to 'war is Hell', but most people know this already whether they have experienced combat or not. The battle scenes are intense, horrifying and well-staged, and demand to be admired from a technical point of view. But it's nothing we haven't seen before. Despite Chris Klein's failure to really convince as a human, We Were Soldiers features many impressive performances, most notably by Sam Elliott as Sgt. Major Plumley, a gruff Sam Elliott-type who mows down his enemies with a revolver while the rest of his men pack automatics, and Gibson himself, who helps tug on the heartstrings during quiet moments of reflection.",6.0,Anonymous,History
All that Military power and so little Mil-Intelligence. Just Courage.,This was an EXCELLENT Movie. As hard to watch at times as Saving Private Ryan. Harder for me remembering friends who went over.I've heard of this story but never read about it. It  so hard to comprehend what happened. Not just to the 7th as the first to Fight but for all 58000+ who died and those who were wounded and survived with so many kinds of scars.The brutality and reality of war had to be close to the real thing. Gut wrenching and shocking but they handled it well. It doesn't need to be more real. The messages were all clear.  Including how inept their command and intelligence structure were. NO ONE Was truly prepared except the Vets who went. And they went in anyway. Think about it.Mel should be nominated for Best Actor. The Movie should be for best picture. Best Director as well. There were way too many good supporting performances to pick just one.I vividly remember the Draft Lottery in High School.  I was lucky and drew a high number.  But I can't count how many times I've wondered what may have happened with a lower number. It angers me still to know how some in our country treated those young men and women returning alive. Shame is the only word kind word that comes to mind.A movie worth seeing if you have a strong stomach. Whatever events were altered for the Cinema can't overshadow the final result. A powerful movie you won't forget.,10.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting war movie,"This movie tells the story of the 'first' major battle between US and Vietnamese troops in the Vietnam war. It's an interesting movie. The amount of cheese and hollywood clich√© is so rich, they have to be kidding. It has an ironic feel to it, much like Starship Trooper. Scene after scene is so full of hilarious gems... The best bit with the movie is the large amount of fighting. Sometimes the story is not coherent, and the same scene - americans firing perfect shots at advancing vietnamese, who fall down en masse - is repeated over and over again. But at others times it's an excellent war movie. One especially perverse aspect I enjoyed is the almost pornographic exposure of wounded persons, complete with sentimental music. They even whisper some 'perfect' last words... Another funny thing is watching Mel Gibson whacking everyone loudly on the helmets, adding his fatherly touch as leader of the american soldiers. The real advantage of the movie is that it actually tells the story about a battle. It is a 'clean' battle. That's refreshing. The typical american Vietnam movie is usually about dope smoking soldiers performing atrocities. In movies like 'Platoon' and ""Full Metal Jacket' the directors could not care less about the overall military aspect of what's happening. The overall picture told in ""We Were Soldiers"" is that the american military goal was really void of strategy - ""kill the enemy"", what a laugh - and that the tactics involved an outrageous amount of risk taking, both with lives and with the possibility of disaster for the operation. In the end, the americans pull it off. They do indeed manage to make the Vietnamese body count high. Mel Gibson then raises a tiny, tiny american flag.. if it had been a big one, someone in the theater might get offended, I guess.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A VERY GOOD MOVIE. A GREAT FILM.,"The movie was very powerful.Ok, where do I start.I finally saw a movie to motivate me to write a movie review on IMDB. I took a loooong flight just to watch the movie and it did not disappoint! Mel is as impressive as always and the rest of the cast did a great job as well, particularly Sam Elliott. Well so many great things have been said about the movie, and I can't think of anything negative to mention so I can't relate to those who did (if you have seen the movie, you'll know that most of the negative reviews here are bullsh*t).Anyway, I want to point out the scene where Mel was leaving his home. That entire scene was eerily effective, I could really feel the impending danger he will face every hair on my body was rising! I liked the way the camera panned very quickly when he turned to face the road, as if Mel said ""this is really sad but I have work to do"". I think that entire scene was very very well set up. And when the action started, the tension never stopped! I now really have to read the book because I find the tactical warfare very interesting.Anyway, I saw something interesting while watching the movie. There's this teenager sitting beside me, and I was really sorry for him, because he probably didn't know what he came in for. When the war action started, his eyes were really popped out! I swear to god I could have picked them with ease! His arms were gripping the armrest so hard and half his body slightly leaning forward. He was difficult not to notice even by the side of your eyesight because he looked shocked as hell. When I tried to quickly look at him (just to see if he's still breathing), he got embarrassed and leaned back to his chair. Five mins. later he was back in the same position. He was probably around 16 or 17 yrs. old so I realize that age might not be the right age to see it.What really amazes me is how the movie was able to convey the chaos and horror of the war when it actually they didn't seem to use too many CGI-effects. I look so much like the REAL THING!Definitely now on top of my list of war movies.And I have seen A LOT.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A 'real' war movie,"This is definitely not in the same league as 'Platoon' and 'Apocalypse Now'. But I must say this is a very good effort by Randall Wallace at portraying the brutalities and uselessness of war. Unlike most Vietnam movies, neither does this one try to prove who/what was right/wrong nor does it try glorifying the American army's endeavour in Vietnam. This is a 'real' story about soldiers who are plunged into a war they are not quite sure why they are fighting.If you are the sort who likes 'real' war movies (not the Rambo kind), then this one is a 'must-see'. The best part I liked about this movie is the balance it maintains by showing the happenings on the battlefield as well as in the lives of their families back home(showing lesser known facts like the strange method of informing families about the death of their kin).Brilliant performances from Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper and good performances in general from the rest of the cast.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A poignant and compelling film.,"I sat down to see this expecting something similar to FMJ or Born on the Fourth of July. What I got was a compelling and truthful portrait of the opening stages of the US involvement in the Vietnam War.The film was a tour de force of what families go through while their men are away and what those men themselves experience during war. Something as an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, I can all too readily relate to.Perhaps it skirted, if not clich√©, then sentimentalism at times and lacked the blacker than black humour that most soldiers possess. However the film remains an excellent portrayal at a keypoint in modern US history and a fitting testament to those who, if they weren't motivated by the patriotism Hollywood would have us believe, were certainly motivated to be there for their friends.If there is one major disappointment in the film, it's the total lack of mention of then Lt. Rick Rescorla, a legend in the 7th Cav, a hero who sadly gave his life on 9/11 and the soldier made famous by the Life magazine photo that adorns the cover of most published versions of We Were Soldiers Once and Young.He was, of course, one among many whose stories were not told, but it seems a shame that so iconic a figure from the battle of Ia Drang is totally absent and leaves Gibson and Wallace open once again to accusations of Anglophobia.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A re run of the Vietnam war- and this time the US of A wins!,"The bravest soldiers ever- they are all AmericanThe worst shots ever- they just happen to all be VietnameseThe best shots ever- they are all Americans as wellThe most caring, kindest hearted soldiers ever...erm, let me think, oh yeah, AmericansI just watched this on TV- the bayonet charge near the end was my trigger to write this- this is as biased and crass as any western movie that was made in the early sixties- it lacks any shade or colour. Mel Gibson should be ashamed of himself- it is trite. And the battle scenes are appalling. Everyone is firing automatic weapons- yet everyone is able to stand up and take pot shots at each other from 50 metres.

Mixed feelings,"We Were Soldiers is not for the squeamish.  It ranks up there with Saving Private Ryan for realistically showing the brutality of war.  I was moved almost beyond description by the ordeal these 390-odd US Army Air Cav soldiers endured at the hands of thousands of Viet Cong troops.  It is as close to Hell as one could get on earth--a charnel house of horrors, where death is sudden and swift.  Mel Gibson and Sam Elliot lead a group of green recruits into the Valley Of Death on an impossible mission in the early days of our involvement in Vietnam.Based on actual events in 1965, this was the first major involvement of US troops and North Vietnamese regulars.  The writing, directing, and acting are first rate, and the battle scenes are too real for comfort.  What really makes the mind reel is that after the slaughter depicted in this film, Mel's character Lt. Col. Hal Moore goes back to the valley of death for more than 200 days.  The American dead are listed on 3 East of the Vietnam Memorial Wall.  I stood at attention and cried when the names of the fallen were listed at the end of the film.

Lives up to its reputation,"We Were Soldiers is one of the better war films I have seen. This says a lot, since there have been many memorable films in this genre recently. The production team managed to unify around its central objective and more or less perfectly execute what they had intended - to bring a particular battle to the screen in as realistic a manner as possible. The film is told from the point of view of those who wrote the book upon which it is based - definitely from an American perspective - but more importantly from the perspective of a soldier. Soldiers in this film are depicted as duty and honor bound people trying to do a job, follow through with a commitment, and to keep themselves and each other alive.The film tells the story of the first major offensive of what would later become known as the Viet Nam war. The action takes place in the Ia Drang (later referred to as The Valley of Death), and is brutal and relentless. Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper lead a fine ensemble cast - nobody slips up whatsoever. The stars - and there are many recognizable faces here - disappear into their characters such that you will forget who they are. Clearly, all of the participants in this film believed whole-heartedly in what they were doing.Unlike many films of this genre, We Were Soldiers does not obsess upon heroism, on political commentary and/or on right or wrong. Since these issues are largely irrelevant in the 'on the ground' situation of the soldier at war, the perspective is appropriate and refreshing. The film borders on grotesque with its frequent and graphic violence. But its subject is one that should never be soft-pedaled. War is violent, grotesque and excessive by its very nature. Anything short of disgust would have sold the subject short.An important point, however, is that condemning war is in no way a condemnation of the brave persons who participate in it. Participation in war sacrifices not just time, energy, and at least a part of one's life, but also a piece of an individual's humanity. Regardless of the politics and all of the rest of the armchair ""participation"" many of us may indulge in, what touched me most about this film was knowing that itaccomplished its one simple and important goal - to truthfully tell the story of those who lived and died in Ia Drang without a lot of embellishment, romance, or panache. What a great and honorable purpose.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Irresistibly watchable,"Well, it is Mel all right; he started getting gung-ho with whitBraveheart (1995)hand has been gearing up ever since. The only problem I have with this movie is I cannot figure out what he has to say even when he tells you. With the probable exception ofAll Quiet on the Western Front (1930), most war movies just use war as a backdrop to their main purpose as inApocalypse Now (1979)(an updatedHeart of Darkness (1993)). This movie has the look and feel of an updated ""Green Berets"" Pluck out John Wayne and plugin Mel.We know the base story is of the stand-off of the NVA at Ia Drang in November 1965 against overwhelming odds, with a little help of superior technology. The uniforms and equipment look pretty authentic. The terrain was well done also; it could be the real thing as much as California. Not all of Vietnam is a swamp.Even though there is a lot of action (more phosphorus than C4) this is not just a shootemup movie. They also focused on the wives back home, showing how they had to cope with the situation. There were also some cursory sub-stories as a combat photographer getting more than he expected.I have the same conundrum as others do that has not been there. The Vietnam I was in (67-68) had a few firefights, but most of the time it was our spies against their spies and there was no front. When we tangled both sides lost an even average of 15% but if you could find them and drop something on them you got your 15% from a safe distance. I was in the special reactionaries and trained for just the situation this movie depicts. I was the RTO and was supposed to fight out and retake the base to not let the NVA get a foothold. However, it never came.One thing you can say about this movie is that you will get involved and almost forget that it is a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Well done battle film,"I am not a Gibson fan. He often appears in contrived plots and trite themes, but he is one of the best actors of this age. Here, he gives a superior performance, which, of course, also means the other actors also gave superior performances, and the direction and editing was superb.The story is about a battle at the beginning of U.S. involvement in Viet Nam. The story is nonjudgmental, and goes out of its way to be neutral. It is obviously anti-war, and depicts higher ups in a poor light, but the poor light is justified by being accurate, and well depicted in a way we can understand.It is a different style of war film. It has elements of the old war film, in which we see some camaraderie among soldiers in an isolated situation, along with the families at home who wait for news, and it has elements of the new war film, in which we see some of the politics involved in decisions higher up.It is high in action, and not many dull moments. We begin with the introduction of characters, the training, and the family lives of the soldiers, then we get into high gear with combat, and the combat is brutal. One officer leads his men into an ill advised chase of an enemy scout to capture him (his men must've been wondering why they couldn't have been told to shoot the enemy in the leg to capture him) and get cut off.We really see most characters come and go, but the film does follow 5 Americans in battle pretty well, one of them who does leave this world. One of the five is a reporter who makes the film a little weaker. By any definition, he is a moron, going into the heat of battle with no adequate explanation, except for his inner feeling of superiority. Without this character, the film could've ranked a 10 instead of a 9. But if he was there, he was there.Well done war film that takes no sides.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Even though I served there and detested the terrorist, aggressive actions of the communist north I have always known the enemy were people. They were someones sons and daughters. This movie shows in some respects how war affects the many who do not serve. If all people of the world felt as I do now, there would be no more wars. Unfortunately such is not the case. Sam Elliot is excellent as the hard nosed old Sergeant who has seen too much war in his lifetime but is not about to give up fighting the good fight. Mel Gibson does a fine job portraying the leaders of this band of men who first confronted the NVA. Great supporting cast.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Best Scene Fell to the Cutting Room Floor,"I was shocked to view the DVD version of the film and see that the single most important event of the story had been cut from the film, but was presented to the DVD audience as an add-on.The scene, a Saigon debriefing of Col. Hal Moore by a senior Johnson Administration official, amply demonstrated the chasm of willful ignorance that set official Washington into a state of gridlock.The subject remains topical.  A review of today's headlines will reveal similarities in thinking. Take, for example, the following loaded question from a political fundraising letter I recently tossed in the trash: ""Should the U.S. have invaded Iraq alone or must we get U.N. permission to defend ourselves?"".  This question omits 1)did we need to invade Iraq to defend ourselves, 2)might someone who opposes war in general, oppose it regardless of whether the U.N. grants some nation a license to start a ""police action"", 3)would the invasion be justified to prevent a future attack upon us, 4)would the invasion be justified if it led to a free Iraq, without any threat against us, or 5)was the invasion justified to put one war criminal (Saddam) in custody, 12 years after his last war crime?  By my count, there are 7 sides to the question and not just 2. (Hopefully readers will think of a few more!).Vietnam was terribly polarizing to our country, precisely because the war demanded we choose one side or the other, shut down our brains, and ignore every possible subtopic that might alter the terms of the debate. This film abundantly demonstrates that the war's participants did not view any part of it as a 2-sided question...but then, official Washington wasn't there to participate, and had the luxury of simplicity.",10.0,Anonymous,History

We Were Embarrassing,"I had very low expectations when I rented this movie and why shouldn't I? This is the same guy who directed Man in the Iron Mask (also wrote it as well) and gave us historical monstrosities like Pearl Harbor and Braveheart.We Were Soldiers is a sorry film filled to the brim with cliches and inept directing. None of the characters we feel empathy or pity for (thanks to some horrible dialogue and poor acting) and their utter reliance on the fact they are supposed to be based on real characters makes it look cheap. They could have done a lot better. One of the most annoying habits in the movie has to be Wallace's handling of ""dramatic"" scenes.

A Movie that Depicts Real Events,"I for one am someone who was inspired to read the book ""We were Soldiers Once and Young"" after seeing this movie. WWS is about a distinct event that actually happened. SGM Plumley was a soldier's soldier, with five combat jumps in three wars and an astounding three combat infantry badges. LTC Moore was the sort of leader who could keep his head and lead his troops through the worst of battle. People who complain of clich√©s in this movie might as well complain that people in 18th century movies wear three-cornered hats.To those looking for an anti-war message, it is there. When Moore goes to Division headquarters and gets his mission, he asks about projected enemy in his area of operations. The staff officer standing next to the general says ""a manageable number."" To this Moore responds with words to the effect of ""which means you have no idea."" It turns out that Moore's battalion gets dropped on top of a vastly larger enemy force (if I remember correctly, they get dropped right next to an NVA brigade). Ordinarily, it order to assure success in attack, you want to have three times the numbers of your enemy. In this case, the ratio was 4:1 going the other way. Then the battle is about how artillery and air support makes up the difference in numbers.The obvious criticism here is that the command was fumbling around in the dark. At the end of the movie, the names of the 70+ men who died are prominently displayed on the screen. A military mind is not treasonous and will not disrespect its superiors, but it will let facts speak for themselves.The next comment is only tangentially related to this movie. However, many voices here have taken the opportunity to vent their views on Vietnam, so I feel compelled to put things in a broader historical context.There was a war that did not take place between 1945 and the fall of the Berlin wall. It would have been called WWIII. The Soviet Union and the US stood eye-to-eye for 40+ years, but did not blink. It was an ideological conflict with an evil that meant death to 50+ million people in communist countries in this century. It was conflict with a system that vastly constrained freedom. Fortunately for the world, the US finally prevailed. The struggle fought between communism and the west was fought in a variety of ways: in public relations, in sports, in propaganda, and in a series of proxy wars. In Korea, Greece, Vietnam, Afghanistan and a variety of smaller stages, East contested with West. To the people caught up in these local conflicts, these wars were absolute tragedies. However, in the grand scheme of things, these conflicts pale to insignificance when compared to the 500,000,000 who would have died in WWIII.",,Anonymous,History
still flashing back,"A Loud Seven For one startling second, Mel Gibson as Hal Moore seemingly transforms into John Wayne during the celluloid version of the battle of Ia Drang in Randall Wallace's new film We Were Soldiers. The transformation is physical as well as metaphysical. Gibson doesn't merely bring back memories of Wayne, for that second he looks and sounds like the Wayne of World War Two flicks. No problem with that. The problem lies with looking and sounding like the Wayne fighting man of Viet Nam rather than the Wayne warrior of Iwo Jima. That  Duke in Ia Drang imagery brings to mind Wayne's clumsy, wrong headed direction of his own Viet Nam film/fiasco, The Green Berets. Maybe Mel's helmet is the problem. Throughout the film Gibson/Moore barks indecipherable orders from underneath a General Patton, G.I Joe helmet that looks like a refugee from a Bill Mauldin cartoon. We Were Soldiers relentlessly seems like an uncomfortable synthesis of WW2 films and Viet Nam films. In the language of cinema, Soldiers more closely resembles Saving Private Ryan or Guadalcanal Diary than it resembles Platoon or Full Metal Jacket. Certainly the battle of Ia Drang portrayed in We Were Soldiers deserves commemoration.  Ia Drang, fought in November of 1965 is often described as the first `conventional' battle of the Viet Nam war. Conventional apparently means, the way John Wayne or John Ford of George Patton would fight it, man to man with charges, sieges, fistfights and bayonets. The battle was so `conventional' and `productive' that General Westmoreland came to the brilliant realization that kill ratio would be a great method to keep score during the war, after all we killed nine times as many `of dem as dey killed ah us'. Using this scorekeeping method, we kept winning the war until 58,000 American citizens died and we left town and built a Wall. Nam remains a bewildering, enigma of startling sound and fury significance. In that regard, portraying war as hell rather than heck, chaos rather than order, We Were Soldiers succeeds. Soldiers is the most violent, bloodsoaked, burn blistered movie that I have ever seen with one image after another that I want to remove from my working memory. Even after a week, they  still remain. When, if, you see the movie, you'll know what I mean. Anyone seeking an ultra-violent reminder of pre 66 American military arrogance mixed with the remains of World War Two gung ho heroism directed by the guy who gave us The Man in the Iron Mask should go see We Were Soldiers particularly those who value cinema as a source of both headache and heartache. For all others, find a metaphoric helmet and put it over your sensitivities before entering the theater or do whatever else you would do when confronting a movie that I would rate as a very loud 7.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Intense battlefield re-enactment,"A Randall Wallace film, starring Mel Gibson. Its plot focuses on Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Gibson) and his battalion of soldiers, who were chosen to be trained as air cavalry in the Vietnam War, using helicopters to land troopers right in the midst of combat. The film focuses on their training and their first major battle.What the film gets right is its realism. The book the film is based upon, We Were Soldiers Once... And Young by Hal Moore and Joseph L. Galloway, set out to set the record straight in terms of what happened in Vietnam. And I do believe that this film reflects that. Its battle scenes are a chaotic mess, yet there's enough storytelling magic happening that you can follow what's happening even through the silver screen. I also like the fact that the Vietnamese soldiers are given a few scenes without demonizing them in any way.That being said, the battle scenes are a chaotic mess. That's very much the point, but they're also so long that you quickly become exhausted. The film tries to give you some breathing room by occasionally focusing on the wives of the soldiers back home, but those scenes are so depressing and oppressive that they merely enhance the exhaustion you're already experiencing.Then again, it's war movie. A realistic war movie. Its point is not to make you feel good. There are war movies that will leave you feeling good and pumped. This is not one of them. It was never meant to be one of them. Its point is to drive in the fact that in a war people will die for absolutely arbitrary reasons. They will die because someone far above them decided that they should.A good film.

We Were Excellent.,"From the trailers, this looked like just another war movie starring Mel Gibson. At first glance, I thought it was just a generic war flick. How wrong I was.I'm glad I'm not one of those people who shuns movies just because of lack of interest. That is how I got to loving movies like the Matrix and Desperado. This movie caught my eye, because Mel Gibson is great in everything he's in, but again, this looked like another war movie that wasn't as deep as its older brothers.We Were Soldiers separates itself from Mel's other War flicks. While Braveheart and the Patriot focus on one soldier and his life (along with several battle scenes), We Were Soldiers focuses on the lives of many soldiers, their families, even one of the Viet Cong soldiers, as their lives are affected in a deadly battle.This film takes place in the Vietnam War, the only war we ever officially lost. The first half hour revolves around training the troops... basically, the exposition. Soon after, they fall into battle. This battle makes up most of the movie. This isn't necessarily bad. For people who like seeing blood and guts, you will love this movie. Those who want to see some story, you will also love this movie. In fact, the acting was done so well in We Were Soldiers, that I nearly burst into tears in the end in sympathy for a Viet Cong soldier.That's another reason why this movie is so great. While some movies portray the ""other side"" to be barbaric and want to spill our guts, We Were Soldiers actually gives the Viet Cong soldiers feelings. Even the leader, who was shouting out orders to kill us all... Our leader was doing the exact same thing. However, we only see the Viet Cong leader being barbaric because they are the ""antagonists"". That, I highly disagree with.If you should see this movie, keep in mind that the antagonists are NOT the Viet Cong, but the war itself. This movie, as generic and unoriginal as the trailers made it seem, was one-of-a-kind, and if you have not seen it yet, make it a point to. It pays tribute to all the fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons who died in 'Nam. Braveheart and the Patriot are better, but this one should not be looked down upon.

A Different Take on the Depiction of the Vietnam War (for the US),"It's no secret that the Vietnam War is one of the most embarrassing points in US history, and the media produced about it highlight that, with satirical and cynical pieces being produced about it for the next couple decades after it ended. In a way, satirical depictions of the Vietnam War became a bit of a cliche. Now enter We Were Soldiers - one of the few Vietnam War films that plays its depiction of the war straight. There seem to be mixed reactions about this film, many praising its accuracy in the depiction of the battle it shows and many criticizing it for glorifying American involvement in the war.This film is clear in that it is not glorifying the US deciding to become involved in Vietnam. It's surprising that people came away from this film not realizing that since We Were Soldiers has a number of scenes which frame American Cold War arrogance in a critical way, and illustrating how useless the coming American efforts will be. The NVA is humanized and is meant to be felt sympathetic towards, they aren't a fanatical mindless mob of villains. Sure, it doesn't go as in-depth with them as it tries to with the American soldiers, but aside from Mel Gibson's character, most of his men he fights alongside with are forgettable to the point where the only way they can be identified after they die is when their wives find out.It's needless to say that We Were Soldiers excels at depicting, as accurately as possible, the first battle between the NVA and the US military. Its weakest point comes from the scenes of the soldiers' wives. Those scenes seem to only serve as padding as they add very little except to inform the audience that one of the characters we were supposed to care about died. The worst scene takes place near the beginning where the film clumsily attempts to acknowledge the issue of civil rights at the time in the most frustrating, misguided, pandering way possible. These scenes do this film a disservice.We Were Soldiers doesn't really take much time to establish its characters which wouldn't be a big deal if their deaths weren't treated as semi-large events. Luckily, the film doesn't dwell too much on that aspect and continues doing what it does best, which is showing the battle.The depiction of the battle itself is, not only well-done, but also conveys a really good idea of where everything is happening. The sense of location where everything is happening is shown organically and comprehensively to such a degree that I feel it might have been done as well as a film like Gettysburg.Most of the visual effects were done extraordinarily well. The only real issue I had with the effects was with the initial flight of the helicopters where the computer generated helicopters are starting to look a bit dated, but it isn't intrusive and doesn't take away from the experience and atmosphere of the film.We Were Soldiers is not pro-American propaganda regarding the Vietnam War and there is nothing to suggest that it is that way. It captures a moment in time when the US was arrogant and naive enough to believe the things the characters in this film believe and seeing that this was at the beginning of the conflict-proper, US opinion was a world different from what it was years after the events of this film took place. Yet, this film is still critical, with more subtle irony and no satire. It is unfortunately hindered by its half-baked homefront scenes and lack of character development aside from Mel Gibson's character, but as a film which uses the accurate depiction of the first major battle between NVA and US soldiers as its centerpiece, it does exceptionally well.",7.0,Anonymous,History

An eye-opener...,"As I am only 23 and from England, the Vietnam War passed me by with me learning very little knowledge about the events that took place there and the huge amount of human loss that was endured. I was only just informed about the events of 'The Valley of Death' by friend in the car on the way to the cinema who happens to be interested in war history. As he was filling me in on what I needed to know, I became more convinced that I would not enjoy this film as I find war films difficult to stomach at the best of times. But I am glad I did. If the courage and valour of the American soldiers is even 10% of what was portrayed on the screen then I am truly amazed and inspired. Mel Gibson was outstanding as Col. Moore, a man who understood the futility of his orders but would prepare his men and take care of them the best he could. Chris Klein was also excellent, showing he has more acting ability in him than just what we see in American Pie. Madeleine Stowe was also perfect as the devoted wife to Col. Moore and to all the other soldiers and their wives. In terms of historical accuracy(often where cinematic re-enactments fall on their faces)I am not sure if it was correct, as I am not entirely sure as I mentioned earlier that I do not have a huge knowledge of this particular conflict, but my friend told me it was pretty accurate and also that Col. Moore was an advisor on how the combat took place during shooting but if it was then this was a brilliant piece of film making and has encouraged me to watch more films of the same genre.",8.0,Anonymous,History

He's regular army!I thought the filming location for the battle could've been better chosen. It looked like the hills of Virginia. I wished the Scottish hymn sung three to four times were not played as much. To me, it was a little overdone...ok a lot overdone.All in all, I'd definitely see it again- not like Titanic or Black Hawk Down, where I did enjoy those movies but I'll never ever have any desire to see them again. Go see it. I think you'll like it. Then, READ THE BOOK!7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
POWERFUL,"This movie is very powerful. Funny, when it was release in theaters, I had no need to see it. To me it was another war movie like the others and it was getting kinda annoying. So when it was release on DVD, I decided to pick it up. That had to be the best decision I have made. This movie is powerful and moving from the beginning to the end. Mel Gibson once again proves to me to be one of the greatest actors. Sam Elliot is great and had me laughing at times as Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley. "" Sergeant Savage: Beautiful day, Sergeant Major! Sergeant Major Basil Plumley: What are you, the f**king weatherman now?""Randall Wallace has also proving that he is dedicated with telling the horror and heroic stories of war. Not to spoil it for anyone but two sequences had me either on the edge of my seat or gave me chills. When Mel Gibson says goodbye to his family and go off to war had me speechless. Esp. when he stands waiting for the bus and some of the soldiers meet up with him. One of these guys is Sam Elliot. You knew they didn't want to get on the bus and didnt want to go over to Vietnam. Such scenes like this gets one choked up and gave me chills. I have seen many Vietnam movies, ""Full Metal Jacket"" was one of my favorites, well ""We Were Soldiers has taken that place now. Not to mention the music. My god...Nick Glennie-Smith composed a chilling yet heroic score. I def. recommend this movie for anyone. It is pretty gory but I'm sure the Vietnam war was just guys slapping each other around.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best Vietnam War movies ever!,"We were soldiers is a compelling story of the true events that happened in the Ia Drang Valley in 1965. Lt.Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) commands a battalion sent into the jungles of Vietnam in the first major battle of the Vietnam War. Before departing for Vietnam, he delivers a promise to his soldiers and thief families that "" I will leave no man behind... Dead or alive, we will all come home together.""I believe that this stands beside Platoon as one of the greatest if not the greatest Vietnam War movies of all time. This movie had the potential to be one of the greatest war movies of all time. Mel Gibson gives a very powerful performance and should have deserved an Oscar and same with the film. The ending to the movie is phenomenal and the battle scenes are well performed and superbly executed. This film also shows the battles not only on the battle front but also on the home front. Madeline Stowe and Keri Russel also give powerful performances and show how the war also affects the families. Overall, this movie is very moving and will keep you entertained from start to finish. From it's heart pounding action sequences to it's humorous elements courtesy of Sam Elliot and it's emotional scenes. This is a movie that anyone who loves action movies and anyone who is looking for an amazing movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Incredible, horrible.","I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to write, quite honestly. I'm not an American, I've never met a ""'Nam Vet"" (at least, not that I know of), so by rights this film should do nothing for me.Quite the opposite...It should be mentioned that this is an extremely graphic film. There is lots of blood, lots of death, lots of burnt soldiers. It is also extremely harrowing. The scenes towards the middle of the film, when the wives are receiving the dreaded telegrams, are more emotionally powerful than any I've ever seen before in a film.I'd read many of the reviews on this site before I saw the film. It's interesting - and quite worrying, in a way - that many of the veterans are saying ""this is a realistic film"". If so, I can honestly say thank god I've never experienced war.",10.0,Anonymous,History
War Movie with Emotion and Story,"I can honestly say I was surprised by the movie We Were Soldiers. We Were Soldiers stars Mel Gibson as a military man leading a group of platoons in the Vietnam War. The movie focuses on the combat of Vietnam and delivers some really good action scenes, but also brings emotion and love to the table. Mel Gibson brings an average performance, compared to other roles he has played, but still gets the job done, but who stole the show in my opinion was the wives of the soldiers. They played a huge role and they were as close as the soldiers were and that shows a lot. They delivered each other's telegrams when they had to find out their husbands were dead. It is just loyalty and friendship the audience should appreciate.The beginning on the movie shows the soldiers in training and with their families. This gave the audience time to know the soldiers and fall in love with their characters. One soldier had a newborn baby then left to fight. Character development was strong in the beginning while action and battle carried out till the end. The character that Mel Gibson played was certainly interesting with his devotion to the army and God. After seeing Passion of The Christ I did think it was weird seeing Mel Gibson praise the man he would later slaughter in one of his movies, but that's just a side note. Gibson's character is a leader and he motivates his squad giving a great speech before they deploy. He promises no man will be left behind and as I'm sure that promise cannot be kept it would still make me feel batter as a soldier. He talks about how soldiers are family and Gibson just naturally plays the role. The only problem I had with him was he showed little emotion and seemed like a statue, even during battle. It didn't seem human, how can a man just not react? He always kept his composer. I'm sure some people thought it was a god thing but I did not like it.I also loved Gibson's second hand man, forgive me for not knowing characters names because there are so many of them and I only saw the movie once. Anyway, the old guy with the pistol, he was great. While he showed little emotion his seriousness brought a laugh here and there, intimidation, and a veteran presence. He was an old school guy who preferred the old school way. I liked how the movie had little Easter eggs, for example, he says he prefers the pistol to the new M16 and Gibson says something like, ""how do you know the enemy will be that close."" Then later in the movie he shoots people down with his pistol from close range.There were definitely many problems with this movie, the main one being the length. This movie was two hours and twenty minutes. After about an hour and a half I thought the movie would be wrapping up but instead it introduced a new character and kept on going. The new character was the camera man and he took pictures of the carnage of Vietnam, His character was definitely important and needed, but he came in too late. He had such a presence and brought a different attitude and tone to the movie it just got under used.Other problems were too much use of slow motion and too many jumps and surprises with deaths. A soldier would be walking and then he would be dead. That effect to start a battle isn't bad but it was overused. Final seconds of a soldier's life were cheesy with their last words and their reactions. ""Tell my wife I love her"" works but it didn't work where it was used.I give the movie credit for sticking really well to the time period. Introducing the M16 rifle and the use of Napalm are small parts of the movie with an impact. People who love history and the military would appreciate that and the movie does a good job of knowing its facts and doing the research.Overall, We Were Soldiers was not a bad movie, but it was not fantastic either. I have seen better war movies and I have seen worse. Acting was a little shaky but strong overall; the story dragged a little bit and was too long but still memorable. I would watch it again and buy it to see again. Watch it with a bunch of your guy friends to enjoy a manly movie that women can still enjoy and maybe even cry to. We Were Soldiers is a good time but does not get the WillyT Seal of Approval.",6.0,Anonymous,History
This is a horrible film,"We Were Soldiers drags out every cliche' in the book. Randall Wallace, the cinematic genius who wrote Pearl Harbor Braveheart and directed Leonardo DiCaprio as two characters in The Man in the Iron Mask, brings us his masterpiece. This is worse than Pearl Harbor even. Bad acting, the combat scenes were really not all that well done compared to both Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down. The movie tries to be different by showing the soldiers at home before they leave for combat. Woo hoo, and for character development, we see that they have kids, cute kids who ask them questions about war. When Mel's daughter asks him what war is, he explains ""sometimes bad guys do bad things and America has to stop them."" Yes, I know that is not verbaitim, but it exemplifies the film's simplistic attitude. I was waiting for Mel to pick up an American flag and kill the general with it, Patriot style. Speaking of which, this film makes the Patriot look like the most subtle film ever made about warfare. Another thing that Wallace pretends to do is show both sides of the war by cutting in a couple scenes of the Vietnamese and showing that one of their killed soldiers has a girlfriend! Whaoh, that is groundbreaking cinema! Wallace shows his real attitude about showing both sides in a scene with Gibson and Chris Klein in a church. They kneel and pray, and Gibson prays for both sides. But at the end he throws in ""and god, what I said about both sides...disregard that, help us kick their asses."" Or something like that. I mean, what the hell? This is a movie that claims to honor the memory of the men who died in Vietnam. How exactly does it do that? By showing them get ripped apart and shot, but not by making them into flesh and blood human beings. one guy actually dies saying ""at least I died for my country."" How so? This is Nam, you died in a war we lost and that we should never have been involved in. And at least twice, a dying character tells a fellow soldier ""tell my wife...I loved her."" More ludicrous still is the scene when the photographer picks up a gun. Oh wait, it gets more ludicrous when he starts taking pictures...one of the cheesiest montages ever is supposed to display the devestation of the battle. This is a cliched, lame, poorly written and directed film that wants you to believe it is important.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Hits close to home....,"""We Were Soldiers"" hit close to home because my dad and his friend Donald were in this very same battle.

He volunteered to enlist in the Army because there was practically nothing waiting for him there...My dad was stationed with the 1st Cavalry. The ""Valley of Death"" was where he fought his first major battle and lived. I'll never forget the scenes in this movie because my dad didn't have to be alive and well today.

Vietnam 'simulator',"It's clear from many of the reviewers who were there, that they feel We Were Soldiers is authentic in many respects to the soldier's experience at that stage of the Vietnam War. As a mid-30s Brit living in London, whose biggest daily hardship is an overcrowded tube, I know I'd be on shaky ground tackling those aspects of this movie. But it's not a documentary - it's a movie and on some level it is intended to be both an artistic artefact and a piece of entertainment, and is not above criticism as either. What intrigues me is what it says about Gibson, because ostensibly although it is not about Gibson (it's about 'the men') Gibson's presence is a transcendent factor. Somewhere along the line this handsome, cheekboned 'Australian' matin√©e idol has become a chunky, stoic and troubled American who is increasingly marching to a different drum to mainstream Hollywood. 'Braveheart' could be said to be the turning point (another Wallace collaboration) where Gibson also wanted to showing the graphic slaughter of a 'real' battle, but which took on the entire historical context of the Scottish Wars of Independence in an a flagrantly unauthentic manner. With 'We Were Soldiers' the obsession with battle accuracy is maintained and the historical/political context almost entirely dispensed with. This might be unsettling, for those who think soldiers must always be thinking why they are being sent somewhere to do something, but the case Gibson makes (basically through 2 hours of cinematic attrition) is that soldiers are thinking of staying alive and/or through obeying orders. There is in some way an attempt to encapsulate the entire 'Vietnam experience' in two hours; reckless battle tactics, unprepared men, hostile terrain, a disciplined committed enemy, reliance on increasingly indiscriminate air support and of course, the role of 'the media' which is depicted with a conspicuous lack of sympathy near the end of the film. But the visual experience is of a maelstrom, once the battle begins, and after a while it is wearing. There is no character identification really outside the two leads and the graphic brutality is instructive without being revealing or, to be nakedly honest, that entertaining. It becomes more of a simulator than a film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"A well done war movie, very emotional, heart breaking, a 10","This is a true story of the 7th Calvary, sent into the Vietnam conflict. Well trained but outnumbered, the group is sent into a battle lost before it was fought.  Of  approximately 400 American soldiers, 25% were lost to Vietnamese fire.  Trained and dropped by helicopter into the center stage of enemy territory, outnumbered by thousands they fought with courage and heroism led by men who were genuine leaders. The odds against them, some will die and some will live but none will ever forget the experience of 3 fighting days.  Three stories in one, the American soldiers in battle, the second, families left at home and the stresses of personal loss and 3rd an insight into the Vietnamese strategies.  I found it to be an excellent movie, I own it among other war movies and feel my money and my time have been well spent with this well acted story.  I only buy movies that measure up to a 10 for my collection and this is one of them.The names of those lost is this battle are engraved on the Vietnam Wall in Washington, D.C.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Imperfect, but relatively effective","If you are an aficionado of war movies, you've certainly seen it done better than this, but We Were Soldiers has it's moments. It's hard to cite any individual thing that I didn't like about the movie, but it just doesn't seem to all come together quite right. There are numerous moments that feel desperately clich√©. Some of the writing is downright horrible. We don't really get to know any of the characters very well. The battles rarely carry any real suspense, save for the scenes of the few soldiers trapped in behind enemy lines. The whole movie has this air of sentimentality to it that just doesn't work. The makers also opted to include numerous scenes of the North Vietnamese soldiers. Clearly the filmmakers were attempting to add some humanity to the enemy, but they weren't very effective. The scenes felt tacked on, and didn't really add anything to the experience other than serving the minor purpose of allowing the audience to formulate that Gibson's character was anticipating the enemy's actions so we know we are supposed to be in awe of his leadership. It's a lot of things like that which just made the movie feel like it was spoon-feeding every step of the way. All in all, it's not a horrible movie. But, it probably could have been great, and it falls well short of that mark. It is a relatively generic war movie, and fans of the genre will probably be satisfied. However, it certainly isn't a great piece of film-making.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Intense Firefight,"I didn't really get excited about this when it first came out, I had just seen 'Black Hawk Down' and was quite shocked with the intense exchange there. I thought the this new film was just jumping on the bandwagon. I do like Mel Gibson, always have. His 'Braveheart' is the best thing to happen to Scotland, since 'Ring of bright water'. I digress, 'When we were soldiers' tells a very important story, it's amazing how history repeats itself and sad how we forget our mistakes. I have no military experience, maybe that's one reason why I'm still alive at 47years. Go see this movie you will definitely come away with more of an understanding of WAR.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Few shortcomings,"I was positively surprised by this. While not always pleasant, this is well-done throughout, and great for almost the entire duration. The plot is really good, and never gets boring. The pacing is solid. The acting is invariably powerful. The characters, if not as interesting or engaging as they could be, are well-written. An awful lot of the way, this is credible. The action is well-done. The FX are incredible. The editing and cinematography are excellent, no exceptions. The use of slow-motion is effective in each case. There are some beautifully cut sequences herein. There is considerable violence, gore and disturbing content. This is evidently very authentic, but it does seem to give up trying for that near the end, and adds to the list of Hollywood moments, otherwise so short that it could almost be completely ignored, and introduces a deus ex machina(for those unaware, that's when you discover that you've written yourself into a corner, and decides to just throw in something that had not been built towards and which isn't necessarily even a little likely or plausible) of about the same level as Saving Private Ryan... the difference being that I felt I got more out of watching that than this, and what it all comes down to is that I doubt I'll miss owning this, as it only aired on TV, as opposed to aforementioned title, which I'm glad to be able to borrow from my father. It should be noted that this does show the Viet Cong without particularly demonizing or dehumanizing them. It is, however, clear who the film-makers were intending to support and honor. I recommend this to fans of war movies, and/or of the people involved(Randall Wallace ought to direct more often). 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Predictable but very impactful nonetheless,"War is nothing like it used to be. The act of military aggression has transformed over the years, but the end result has usually remained the same. No matter what, innocent lives will be lost and casualties will be had on both sides of the combatants. The worst part, is that it's basically people being pitted against each other and being convinced their side is right vs the other. All this because the higher ups in their respective governments either cannot stay out of each other's business, or because they cannot come to an agreement on a specific issue. It's truly unfortunate when countries just can't get along. There's always someone stirring the pot and messing things up. For the Vietnam war, it was seen as a necessary intervention to prevent the spread of communism, while others felt it wasn't anyone's business to get involved.The plot about this film is specifically about the battle of Ia Drang, which took roughly three days. Writing and directing was handled by Randall Wallace, adapting this from a book based on the accounts of two soldiers in this film. The soldiers were Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper), one being a Lieutenant Colonel and other being a photographer. Together, they meet at which the setting takes place and they both take away things from it they never forgot. Randall Wallace was also the writer to Braveheart (1995), The Man in the Iron Mask (1998) and Pearl Harbor (2001). Probably what's the most unique about this feature is the story line and the way it is shown. Other war films tend to show characters as they progress through the war from beginning to end. Here though, it's only for three days. That's it.What's more interesting though is how much happens in three days So much happens in that short time span and viewers also get to see just how quickly a life can be lost. Predictability is probably the only downside to this film. Like any story, characters are introduced at beginning, For this movie, by actors Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliott, Chris Klein, Ryan Hurst, Jon Hamm, Clark Gregg, Josh Daugherty, Jsu Garcia and Brian Tee. However, since this is a war film, it should be known that not all the characters introduced will live to the end. Mind you this was just list of the actors from the US side. The same is also portrayed for those who fought on the opposing side. Each person had at least someone who was thinking about them. Madeleine Stowe, Keri Russell and Simbi Kali play those kinds of roles - the veteran's wife.The realism to this film is another huge positive. Much of the production looks like the effects were all practical which can be tough to pull off. Here though it looks good. Whether it be the explosions, gunfire or hand to hand combat, it is a very intense to watch. The sounds will really immerse the audience in the setting. Even when people are talking to each other on the battlefield, it's not the easiest to hear what's being said. It makes sense though because there would be a lot of noise and chaos happening all at once. There's also burns and blood squibs depicted on screen, some of which are not pleasant looking at all. If anything it just shows how serious war is, no matter how much it's fun to play on a video game. In real life, it is by no means a fun experience, there are no cheat codes.All around the camerawork is visually accurate looking too. Managed by Dean Semler, the footage shot captures the carnage and atmosphere of those fateful days. Semler also worked on Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981), Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985), The Three Musketeers (1993), Eye See You (2002) and xXx (2002). Lastly the musical score composed by Nick Glennie-Smith was an interesting work. The score has a mix of thumping drums and music box like tunes that give the viewing an eerie and horror like sound that accompanies the bloody violence on screen. It's effectively left out though for certain scenes to maintain their realism too. Smith also composed for The Rock (1996), Home Alone 3 (1997), The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride (1998) and Highlander: Endgame (2000).Predictability is the only aspect to this picture experienced viewers will see coming a mile away. Despite that though, the acting, camerawork, realism, practical effects and narrative are a sobering reminder of the casualties of war, no matter how glorified it may seem.",8.0,Anonymous,History
BRAVEHEART Meets THE GREEN BERETS,"Does anyone remember BRAVEHEART ? It starred Mel Gibson who also directed and was scripted by Randall Wallace . The film contains over 200 errors . Does anyone remember THE GREEN BERETS ? That`s the John Wayne western where the Duke saves a homestead called Vietnam from a bunch of injuns from the commie tribe . If you watch WE WERE SOLDIERS you can`t help but be reminded of these two films .First of all what`s with that Scottish lament that`s played three times in the movie , four if you count the end credits ? I mean what`s the connection between Scotland and `Nam ? Maybe Wallace is using it in the vain hope that because BRAVEHEART was bombarded - Undeservedly I might add - with several Oscars then so might this film ? Whatever reason it`s included it really jars . Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne and I was expecting him to say something like "" They`ll never take our freedom - The hell they will "" and it`s impossible not to notice other similarities with THE GREEN BERETS like the subplot of a journalist picking up a gun and turning into a warrior and Moore telling the journalist about guilt in a scene almost identical to the one seen in the Wayne movieWhen not reminding the audience of other movies WWS also fails to stand on its own legs , it`s based on real events in 1965 but seems to lack an integrity needed to do the story justice , it never feels like 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place probably because it was filmed in America not Asia . Hal Moore might have brushed up on the French experience in Indo-China but if that`s the case then he was unique because the American military went out of their way not to read up on the French Indo-China war , indeed when asked about the previous conflict Westmoreland replied  he had nothing to learn from the French "" Who haven`t won a war since the days of Napoleon "" so I was confused as to the portrayal of the NVA in this movie , when in 1965 the American high command , brimming with hubris held the North Vietnamese and VC in contempt . It`s like history has been rewritten in order to show the rice farmers of Vietnam are superlative warriors . They are , but very few Americans believed this in the mid 1960sThere`s a couple of other things that confused me like how the wives back home get telegrams telling them their husbands are dead ? No bodies are shown being flown back to base and no one on screen is seen referring to who`s been killed in the La Drang valley . Likewise we`re not seen reinforcements arrive on screen so how do we suddenly see the Americans out number the NVA ? I put these down as directorial/ editing blunders on the part of Wallace who doesn`t strike me as much of a director , and his biggest problem seems to be communicating the horror of the battle . Take the scene where the American burned to a crisp is flown away screaming "" Tell my wife I love her "" . This should have an emotional impact similar to THAT death scene in PLATOON but here there`s no impact . In fact I found the scene cliched and patronising , and he`s not the only character to mouth the words "" Tell my wife ... "" while mutilated or dying , I counted at least two other characters use the phrase . Did characters actually say this at the battle ? I`ve no idea but since Randall Wallace wrote the script I do have reservationsI sat in shocked awe watching APOCALYPSE NOW , PLATOON and THE KILLING FIELDS made my eyes water , I laughed at FULL METAL JACKET , I kept looking at my watch with THE DEER HUNTER , and after seeing WE WERE SOLDIERS I felt totally patronised",4.0,Anonymous,History
Very Favorable,"Having been a war movie buff since a child, `To Hell and Back', `Attack' (one of the most underrated movies, but at the top of the list of best war films) I have to say, `We Were Soldiers is one of the, if not the best Vietnam movies made. They stayed with original uniforms for that era, and showed the pride the members of the Armed forces possessed at that time.I feel the script was well written, the actors did a more than superb job, and the special effects were excellent.This is a very hard-hitting movie, which will bring back a lot of memories for many Veterans, good and bad.It should be required viewing in every American High School, to show what the last generation of true heroes were like, how they hurt, cried, yet got the job done under extreme conditions. Something sadly missing in today's youth.The war was wrong, we shouldn't have been there in the first place, Johnson was a egoist of the first rate, and the brass had their collective heads up in dark moist places most of the time, but if the politicians and upper staff realized that this wasn't their average line war, maybe, just maybe, there wouldn't be so many names on that Black Marble Wall In Washington.The effects of the Taxi/Telegrams scenes were heartbreaking.Overall, I recommend viewing this movie.",,Anonymous,History

"75% real, 25% Hollywood but outstanding for being realistic!","As far as I am aware, this film is the first and only film to make any attempt whatsoever to reflect what fighting in Vietnam was like, and how we fought.

There was none of the standard Hollywood venom that characterizes the vast majority of Hollywood films set in Vietnam.  There were some things that were pretty ridiculous, like an NVA soldier walking up to Mel Gibson without firing his weapon, like a dieing soldier saying something like he was glad to give his life for his country, like the setting looking little like Vietnam.

Incredible,"When I first heard that the movie would be coming out I said ""Well here is another Vietnam flick which goes from realistic to people becoming heroes by defeating armies alone"" but boy I was wrong! It humanized all characters and you felt as though the unexpected was out to grab you. The movie took you to all kinds of perspectives, the Vietnamese, the war at home, and off course the front from the American soldiers. It was a movie which covered it all and everything you had to see was shown, the brutality, the horrors, the bonds of friends, and the loss of life. It leaves you with a really new image of the war and you actually sit there and ask yourself how could men have possibly survived with such scenes running through their minds. I would say the film is the closest thing to perfectly depicting those scenes but we all acknowledge that true images of war cannot possibly be shown on the big screen.

We Were Cheesy and Unbelievably Cliched,"It's amazing how Randall Wallace just can't avoid creating a scene, in a script or behind the camera, without some element of cheese in it. This movie is no exception. Like his last directing effort, Man in the Iron Mask, We Were Soldiers pretends the audience are morons and riddles the entire movie with cliches and horribly concieved cheesy drama that puts even the most ridiculously contrived real-life-event TV movies to shame.Yes, this movie is different from previous Vietnam war movies. The American soldiers aren't portrayed as violent grunts with no regard for life. They aren't protrayed as men who are scarred for life from the violence, the death, and the trauma of the war. This movie is really all about Mel Gibson and his ability to spout comically bad dialogue while maintaining a straight face and of course, the innocence of America... sort of like that last disaster he wrote, Pearl Harbor.Could this movie have done better? I thought so. If Wallace would put his ego aside, and tone down the overabundant melodramatic scenes, Soliders could've scored big for me. Too bad that's all wishful thinking. The movie is bad, forgettable and our vets deserve better.4/10",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Clich√©d, Over-Dramatised and Very Over-Rated","In a year that saw the second instalment of the 'Lord Of The Rings' trilogy open, 'Chicago' burn the screens with raw carnal energy (i.e. Catherine Zeta Jones' breasts) and fanboys of the world unite with the arrival of the holy trinity that was 'Spiderman', 'Star Wars: Episode II - Attack Of The Clones' and 'Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets', it's fair to say that any cinematic endeavour that planned to face off against this line up would have to make a stellar impression.Unfortunately, 'We Were Soldiers' fails to live up to such standards. Given the calibre of talent (Gibson, Stowe, Kinnear, Elliot) on display here, we would have expected something with more resonance than the final product offers.The picture, though having some good points to fall back on, does little more than to offer a very clich√©d story with moments that make you slap your head rather than tug your heartstrings. One moment when, the night before he heads off to battle, Moore is praying with his children and his youngest asks him `Daddy, what's war?' is enough to make you poke your eye out on principle. The visceral equivalent of dipping you in honey before throwing you to the ants.The direction offered is not well suited to the material at hand. Instead of showing a level of restraint offered by other war movies, Wallace chooses to shove your face into every gory detail. It even stretches so far as to showing each one of the soldier's wives as they find out that their husband is coming back in a box. Whilst war movies have always had a tendency to offer the message that war is hell, there is always a sneaking suspicion that maybe some people had their fingers crossed when they said it with this.The main selling point for this movie seemed to be that it would show the conflict from both sides. Upon watching the film and seeing the single reference to a Vietnamese soldier writing to his wife, it looks as though this angle was added more as an afterthought when someone decided that they couldn't see the screen for all the Stars and Stripes that were in the way.Ironically enough, the most interesting character of the movie was not a soldier at all, but a photographer played by Barry Pepper. Instead, little attention is given to him and the focus is pointed towards the soldiers, to show the camaraderie between the men fighting and their wives back home. By leaving Pepper as part of the background noise, you find yourself so swamped by the gung-ho fighting spirit before you've even seen the battlefield, that as soon as the shooting starts, the audience wants to turn away out of boredom, rather than horror.This picture marks the first effort for Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson since their incredibly well received 1995 offering, 'Braveheart'. So keen were they to recapture the past glory, they even brought back several members of the team that made 'Braveheart' what it was. Though comparisons between these two films are not really fair, with the kind of success that the first expedition yielded, it's hard not to wonder if the bar was set a little too high to for this film to jump.",,Anonymous,History
A good step towards depicting the reality of war but not far enough,"This movie delivers the message ""not even the winner wins any battle"" very effectively. In addition, it is more realistic and showing more of the psychology of war, bereavement and fear than most American war movies do, creating a multi-dimensional picture of a sequence of events at wartime. Still, if psychology of war is the main issue (instead of the plot which is very simple in this case) it could have been a lot better if the movie had shown much more of the Vietnamese soldiers' psychology and understanding of the war. The way the Vietnamese commander is depicted is very shallow and stereotypical. In addition, there are some unrealistic happenings in the movie. First of all, a trained soldier, especially a commander of an infantry unit (Lt. Co. Hal Moore) would NEVER face enemy machine gun fire attack standing upright (with a handgun in his hand). Everyone MUST lie down in that situation to minimize risk of injury; if you join the army you learn that on the first week. I know it looks a lot more heroic and brave on the screen standing that way but doing that is plain stupid and irresponsible, an equivalent of playing Russian roulette. Second, if an infantry unit expects enemy attack waiting in a ditch, soldiers should not stand at whispering distance to each other. The defendants must keep at least 4-5 meters distance between themselves on the defense line, otherwise a single hand grenade may kill several of them at once. Again, that is probably a compromise movie makers made to create a more appealing outcome. To sum up, reality of war is a lot less romantic than most war movies, and still less romantic than this more realistic war movie; but I suppose people do not want to see reality of war in the raw because they are more inclined to enjoy a movie that reinforces their beliefs and stereotypes and which satisfies their romantic hero images and illusions. After all, movie makers want to make money, and I must admit they made an OK compromise on this one. One must keep in mind that this is still not a documentary, though.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Finally a war movie that properly depicts a battle.,"My father is a Vietnam vet. He rarely talks about Vietnam, and when he does, he talks about boot camp or his training. He won't ever talk about the battlefield. So I knew this film had to be decent because he loves it. He only likes three war films that I know of, this one, Saving Private Ryan, and Band of Brothers. Here's why this movie is amazing. 1. The movie is about an incredibly important part of history and shows how gruesome the first attack was in Vietnam. It also shows how, once again, France got us into a war that they couldn't handle. 2. It's incredibly realistic. My father thought that one scene might have been too influenced by Hollywood, until he found the actual footage of the battle. In one scene the Vietnamese soldiers just charge in aggressively and are being shot at close range by U.S. soldiers. It all looks more John Wayne then anything at first. But as the movie showed us, there was a reporter there filming the events that took place. His footage is available online. Sure enough, it shows Vietnamese soldiers doing an all out charge at the U.S. soldiers and looks just like the scene depicted in the movie. The movie showed how grueling war can be and how one quick decision can be fatal. 3. Sam Elliot. I was blown away by his take on Sgt. Plumley. Amazing. He played the part of the grumpy and pessimistic... but tough sargeant. It was almost as if they had hired a drill sargeant to do his part. 4. The movie depicts perfectly the sacrifice that the soldiers and families give up. It demonstrates that the war wasn't just in Vietnam, but it was also carried over here on the backs of soldiers and bared by the families and wives of these very soldiers. No soldier was cast as a major hero nor as some major action superstar. They were cast as soldiers, plain and simple. The movie asked for no glory, no praise, just for you to listen. As one Vietnam vet said, ""This is our story"". 5. The music to the movie was great, especially since it was performed by the military's own.I recommend seeing this film. It's not a ""feel-good"" movie or a movie made for pure pleasure. It's made to show the story of the soldiers. It isn't meant to push a political belief nor to protest anyone. It tells a story, an amazing and true one at that.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Here's why it's a 7 out of 10.,"The movie is essentially good. Great characters and battle scenes are found in this film. I feel as though most people will enjoy it. If you like war movies, you will find this movie worthy to sit down and view. The only problem I see with this film is that it feels like a combination of good scenes and lines from other films. The apolitical analysis of war in this film does not stand out from many modern war movies. The characters in this movie seem to speak dialogue that they would only speak when coming home from a war (or analyzing it when they became older men), not in the middle of it. That's not to say that most movies pull that kind of wording on the big screen, but this film felt a little forced (and sometimes cheesy).

The Battle of the La Drang Valley,"Three years after Operation Chopper, on November 14th, 1965, in the La Drang Valley (The Valley of Death), the first real battle between American and North Vietnamese soldiers took place. US forces were led by Lt. Colonel Hal Moore. That battle is encapsulated onto film as the main focal point in the film, We Were Soldiers (2002).Mel Gibson plays Lt. Colonel Hal Moore, who becomes the first man to lead an attack against the North Vietnamese in the early years of the American involvement in the Vietnam War. As he fights on the battlefield, his wife (Madeleine Stowe), takes on just as much of a serious roll as her husband has in the war effort, by being the one, who helps grieving wives deal with the death of their husbands back home. This is a film that tackles the brutality of war, contrasted with trying to make sense of it all on the battlefield, along with dealing with the horror back home.The film is directed by Randall Wallace, who wrote Braveheart (1995), so he worked with Mel Gibson before and he actually manages to make Mel's character multi-faceted. Mel's Hal Moore is a good man, a family man and he takes care of the men under his command. He is the one who makes clear that he will leave no man behind, dead or alive. He's as tough as any of Mel's other characters from his movies, but also seems to be a fairly hip and mellow guy. It's evident everywhere, from giving his helicopter pilot, Major Bruce Crandall (Greg Kinnear), a beer, right out of his pocket, to spending time with one of his men in the church, to having to explain to his five year old daughter, what war is.Sam Elliot, plays Sgt. Major Basil Plumley and does a really good job in this film. He is completely different than what we are used to. It is interesting, because he is clean cut, clean shaven, no cowboy hat. He even doesn't have the mustache. It looks nothing like the Sam Elliot we are used to and it is a big departure for him. He has some of the best lines in the movie and none of the soldiers cross him at all.The film does not hold back from the action, horror and brutality found in war. Wallace directs the film with an energy that utilizes well crafted action scenes, while using classic film techniques, such as, the slow motion battlefield shots, utilizing the helicopter scenes as a sign of power or (fake) blood splashing onto on the camera lens. That last one is usually something that was an accident, but always seems to be jarring, because it feels like you are there, like the blood splashed on you.They also try to humanize the film by getting into what the North Vietnamese are thinking. The state of mind they are in. It is a point of view much more prevalent in modern war films, even though the idea has been seen as far back as All Quiet on the Western Front (1930).The most eye-opening moment, is when the news crews, via helicopter, show up as soon as the battle is over, jumping out to immediately interview the dirty, bleeding, battle-ridden soldiers. This was interesting, because it gives us an advanced lesson on the power of the press and how technology upgrades spread information sharing evermore speedy to an already shrinking world. It also is a commentary on the invasiveness of the press. Remember, Vietnam was the first war broadcasted on television.7.4 (C+ MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Review Of ""We Were Soldiers""","Randall Wallace's ""We Were Soldiers"" tells the story of the events that surrounded the first major battle of the Vietnam War. The film stars Mel Gibson, Barry Pepper, and Greg Kinnear. First off, the greatest aspect of this film is the really strong lead performances from Mel Gibson - He really shines in this role. Another impressive performance in the film is Sam Elliott's portrayal of Sergeant Major Basil L. Plumley. His character has some of the most memorable lines of dialogue in the film which are often crass and caustic. Another very memorable aspect of the film is it's intensely realistic use of special effects. The film uses special effects to simulate what the actual Battle Of Ia Drang was like. Some of the special effects are really engaging and compelling while other special effects are grotesque and grisly, but either way it helps to ground this film in realism. While a lot of the performances in the film were noteworthy, there were some that were. . .not. I'm not going to say which ones fell flat, but there were some moments when actors delivered their lines in a really unsuitable way. These moments don't really take away from the film's overall appeal, but. . .their just bad. All in all, I felt that ""We Were Soldiers"" was a fairly impressive film that crafted a very believable simulation of the first battle of the Vietnam War.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Intense and touching, with decent characters.","My biggest complaint about the film ""Blackhawk Down"" was that the characters were never really developed, so it was hard for me to get emotional about their struggle. Just the opposite is true in ""We Were Soldiers"". Usually, the infantrymen in Viet Nam films are nameless faceless extras, but here many of the 'grunts' get a decent back-story just like the 'leaders' do to build on, and it helps when viewing the movie. When you care about the characters, it's a much more enjoyable experience even when the scenes are as brutal and graphic as they are here. Mel Gibson as the leader Hal Moore, borderlines on over-the-top, but as the film went on I began to accept it as accurate because 1) the real Hal Moore was a consultant during filming and 2) I bet over-the-top was mandatory when dealing with the many intense situations these soldiers and their families were faced with. Sam Elliot as an old crusty sargent was great and should be recognized at award time. In the middle of battle he tells all the young soldiers ""Any of you call me grandfather and I'll kill ya."" Greg Kinear is also very good as an arrogant helicopter pilot, who backs up his boasts when it counts. Good, not great performances are put in by Chris Kline and Barry Peppar. Madeline Stowe is adequate as the wife of Hal Moore who takes on the role of leader of the wives left behind.As I mentioned earlier the battle scenes are extremely graphic and disturbing, but never gratuitous. Randall Wallace who had double duty as both writer and director, never glorifies the violence, whether it's Americans or the Vietnamese. The 'days-long' battle portrayed here was the first major one of the war for the U.S. and took place in 1965, so it was refreshing not too see a lot of the drug-use and anti-war rhetoric that took place as the war went on, as shown in Apocalypse Now, and Full Metal Jacket. I was born in 1962 so naturally I have no real recollection of Viet Nam, but looking at a lot of the comments from other IMDB users that were there; they have positive things to say about the movie, and that's probably the best compliment Mr. Gibson and Mr. Wallace could hope to receive. 9 of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A riveting, compelling war drama","We Were Soldiers is an intense drama set during the vastness of the Vietnam War. The story does not only focus on the grave depiction of this war, but also focuses on the lives of the American soldiers. The audience is able to realize that lots of these men who fought bravely were fathers to their children and husbands to their wives. They were willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of their country and fight for a nation they could be proud of. Mel Gibson is one of those soldiers (Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore) who must also leave his life behind and lead these young soldiers into the heart of doom. Writer/director Randall Wallace does a wonderful job at bringing the devastation of war and the emotion of soldiers to an even match and turns the film into an amazing portrait of the American spirit. He doesn't just make us absorb the harshness of war in which there is a good and an evil. Wallace makes us feel sorry not just for the American soldiers, but also for the enemy soldiers who are also sacrificing their lives for the good of their country. We realize that it is not their choice to fight in this war and are made to believe that it is a matter of duty and honor. Earlier in the film, Moore describes the soldiers as ""young boys"" who are being shed into a hellacious mixture of death and agony. This line allows the audience to feel proud for these young soldiers who fought for their nation. Moore also makes a promise that he will bring every man under his command home (dead or alive) ""so help him God"". We learn from this line at the end of the movie that Moore was indeed a man of his word and would die to see that these young boys made it home. Randall Wallace tells of the story of 7th company with such effectiveness and power that the audience must shed a tear at the end. Indeed, Wallace has improved himself ever since he wrote the disastrous screenplay for Pearl Harbor. I would not be surprised if this film was not recognized at the end of the year as one of the best films of the year.Lenny's Grade: ***1/2",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Contains too many war cliches to be easily enjoyed, but the battle scenes are quite good.","Randall Wallace, screenwriter of the great Braveheart, fair The Man In the Iron Mask and the horrible Pearl Harbor makes his directorial debut (I think) in this Vietnam war film that takes a different approach to the Vietnam war film- showing the first real battle over there back in late 1965.  Mel Gibson, who once directed and starred in Wallace's Braveheart, stars as Col. Moore, who is chosen to lead the 1st and 7th Cavalry divison of the army into the ""Valley of Death"" in Vietnam danger zone.  Other supporting characters include Greg Kinnear as a smart and efficient pilot with a knickname which would be censored here, Chris Klein who is always with a clean shave and little if no dirt during the battle scenes and honestly looks too womanly to be in such a army, and Barry Pepper as a war journalist dropped during the battle and witnesses first hand the horror that ensues.There are too many cliches to be considered totally realistic and in the early scenes, while interesting and even amusing, make Gibson seem a little softer than he should appear.  Yet, for those in the mood for a different war picture that eerily tries to balance 40's and 50's like corniness with graphic war violence and gives a good story in the mix won't be dissapointed.

A Salute To Heroes.,"Not too many movies are made about the time America grew up and lost its soul, so when I saw how much flak this movie was catching, I HAD to find out why. The true story of Ia Drang is more harrowing than even this movie managed to depict, and those watching this and belittling it, and the actions of a few hundred men in fighting a battle few people knew or cared about until recently is the proof that America's Innocence died in 1965.Personal thoughts on the Viet Nam war notwithstanding, this IS the era that America turned from care-free and innocent to cynical and selfish. The decade that started with Kennedy and the Camelot Administration and ended with Watergate, Kent State, the Chicago Convention, and Altamont were the years that Americans should mourn more than any in their history. We went from ""Can-Do"" to ""Screw You"", and this was the main reason.While most people alive today weren't even born at the time the events in this movie took place, their prejudices and mind-sets are those instilled by the last ""innocent"" generation (their parents usually) ..... and those who howl most and roll their eyes at ""yet ANOTHER Viet Nam movie"" would also do well to remember that what they are really peeved about is not that another movie has been made about a war, but that a movie has been made that points out just what was lost to America and the world during this conflict.Until the events depicted here took place, Viet Nam was just another place where America was deploying troops. The days surrounding these events and the subsequent distress-call of ""Broken Arrow"" brought home to the America and the world just how real the conflict was and how savage savage it would become.Having said all that, I was actually prepared to hate this movie just on account of who was in it and how much I disliked their more recent disastrous forays into the big-screen.Looking at the cast list, I was half-expecting this to be another garbage, high-budget movie whose cast was only there for their box-office appeal (Titanic, Braveheart, Signs, Vanilla Sky, etc.) and this was one of the reasons I resisted watching it.I was impressed with the choices for the main players - Sam Elliot as a tough old Sergeant-Major was quite a treat, and Mel Gibson has always been better in action-flicks. Seeing actors one usually doesn't associate with action/war movies  wearing uniforms is something of a shock, and at first I thought that they would appear out of their depth, but Greg Kinnear gave a good performance as Major Crandall - I've always thought helicopter-pilots were a little unzipped anyway, and I found his performance to be the most believable of all.There were moments that the movie didn't really need, and the syrup was laid on a little thick at the beginning, but all that aside, I enjoyed this flick.",,Anonymous,History

Massacre,"Basically, everything about this motion picture is very strong. When it comes to the visuals and the sounds, you can see where the big budget went. But however competent the package is, and however violent certain scenes are, it is the story told that makes ""We Were Soldiers"" as gripping, engaging, horrifying, devastating and thought-provoking as it, indeed, is. Or, to be more exact, not necessarily the story itself, but the way it is told, the way things are put together and organized, which is what good directing does.The main characters are, obviously, American soldiers about to go to the Vietnam War on a mission, and the story told in the film is seen through their eyes. Mostly, that is, for certain parts of the story are seen through the eyes of their opponent. The movie does not work in the simple concept of black and white, what it does use, however, and to an undeniable effect, is contrast.It is one thing to be able to have a sense of humor in a story as serious as this, it is another thing to be able to have the jokes amplify the horror and catch the audience off guard. Where there is levity in ""We Were Soldiers"", it isn't misplaced, it comes across as natural. Jokes and horrors seem incompatible, but the ones here do work together, and the combination they create makes it harder to see what's coming. Anything can happen at any time.This movie looks good and sounds good, and as for the story, it is a trap. It isn't entitled ""We Were Soldiers"" for no reason. Through this movie, they tell you who they were, where they were sent and what happened there, and how there is a line between what happens there and what gets out for the public to know. More importantly, possibly, it's about how there is a line between what such missions are to the soldiers who are sent on them, and how the ones sending them there see such things, and how the two may be far from each other, how they may be extremely different.And again, the visuals and the sounds do their job well, only words like ""entertaining"", ""exciting"" or ""impressive"" would be wrong to describe this picture. Because of what and how it tells, it will not amuse you. It will have your attention, and horrify you, and then it will haunt you. Few other war movies will be able to scare you after this.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A harrowing, realistic war movie with intelligence, but peppered with bad edits","Much was talked about this movie when it first came out, with the obvious comparisons made to Mel Gibson's other historical epic Braveheart, and those made me steer clear of the movie for a good while, although now I find myself wondering why after seeing it this weekend.It rivals Saving Private Ryan for the realism and gore factor, bringing the devastation and personal pain involved in war right at you without flinching.Gibson is strong in this role, but plays it at quite a lower key than he did in Braveheart, and it works really well. He really is a great actor, sure you can question some of his decisions and roles, but he can really pull off an emotional scene at both ends of the spectrum, and he has to show them all.The film certainly shows how harrowing the first assault of the Vietnam war really was, and how utterly pointless it was. It was amazing to see the courage and strength of the young men involved, and then being shown the flip side with the cowardice and idiocy of the suits in charge and their disregard for the lives of the soldiers.Although the movie concentrates on the US Soldiers it does turn to the Vietnamese Commander and show the similarities between them and their belief and love for their soldiers.Something that strikes me about many of the US historical movies is their blatant disregard for history, and their total belief in the American way above all else. The US won World War II by themselves, they managed to break the hold of the German Submarines by finding and cracking their code machine and they leapt into action and poured destruction on the Japanese after Pearl Harbour.None of this is seen in this movie, yes there is a strong American belief, but in this movie it's much more real. The belief is there, but it's from the soldiers who really believe in their Country and what they are fighting for, a feeling that was present in the real world before this war, and has struggled through since.It is a great war movie, it's also a very moving and harrowing one, showing what the Soldiers went through for their country and how their officials, and indeed their people, failed them.However it's not all good. The movie seems to have many swift cuts which are suited to the battle scenes, but not in transitions, and it begins to have the feel that there are portions of the movie edited out. This is certainly backed in the continuity of the story and how some crucial background and key scenes just seem to be raced through giving you the barest of information before heading off to another battle.That really harms the movie for me, and it's a shame because there is so much of this movie which is really, really good.",7.0,Anonymous,History
the untold story of the early years of Vietnam,"This is a solid war movie, and I enjoy watching it once a month. Well, given the fact that I am a Huey junkie, the chopper scenes certainly help. A friend of mine commented, ""Well, it's strange, the soundtrack to the movie is tribal in nature, and there's no memorable Sixties' tunes, like in other Nam movies."" I explained to him that WWS to place in 1965, about a year or two before the huge appearance of the anti-war movement, and certainly predating the hippie movement, so these elements weren't meant to appear.A lot of it is fictionalized, but then again, so were many aspects of Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan (some of the only worthwhile modern war movies in about the last twenty years). We Were Soldiers tells the rather un-hip story of the early Vietnam years, so, I must state again, that this is why you don't hear any tunes from the Rolling Stones, The Doors, or Zeppelin. That's 1968 onward... I guess... and WWS does a commendable job.The uniforms are right on target with the 1965-66 timeframe. The choppers used featured equipment and weapons that wouldn't appear until a year or two later, but that's OK. The combat scenes capture the essence of the fighting, and thankfully no retarded cuts or zooms were used. However, we don't see a single M14 rifle (the precursor to the M-16, which is seen all over the place in WWS), as most of the troops would have been using them as the M16 wasn't fully deployed to units at that time. But the best thing I can say is that the characters of 2LT Geoghan (or whoever), SGM Plumley, and SGT Savage look incredibly like their real-life counterparts, as far as i could tell in the photo section of the novel. That kind of accuracy is commendable. The true-to-life events, such as the airstrike, are well done.I do have some gripes though... having served in the Army (1996-2001), there are some shortcomings that I am able to spot. There is not enough development given to make enough of the supporting characters memorable. This worked in Black Hawk Down, but not here. Plenty of faces appear beyond the top and second-billed characters, but something was missing. I would have liked to see more of Too Tall (the other pilot), Godbolt (the black dude), Jimmy Nakawama (got burned bad) and CPT Nadal (""we have an American Platoon... OUT THERE!""). They're mentioned plenty of times, and they function to give what I call their ""partner character"" some depth, but they themselves either appear, disappear, or don't have enough lines. Also, the sound is not terribly well-mixed as some of the dialogue is muffled, and the editing is about average. Some key scenes take place in near darkness, so knowing who's who as well as the emotional impact is missed.One thing that really irks me is.... the lack... no, the absence of the portrayal of black soldiers. PFC Godbolt is Geoghan's partner character, but he doesn't get a single line. He looks like a nice guy, throws a grenade, gets shot, dies. Obviously, black soldiers made up quite a bit of the Army in 1965 (and even now.... almost pointless to say) but there's no representation of them (I Don't MEAN ""THEM"" IN A BAD WAY, OK??) except for Godbolt's wife back home. The Asian soldier, Jiimmy Naki-something, appears, for like a split second in the beginning, then runs into Joe Galloway (I cant remember the guys name) during the attack. The he gets wounded. He's about the only minority who gets a line. Both he and Godbolt were real people...hmmmm.... The voice-over narration is used very spottily, and this coulda been polished up. Finally, there is a mention of ""losing a boatload of draftees is a bad week"": the draft wasn't in effect until 1969.Nevertheless, WWS is a solid war movie that tells the lesser-known era of the Vietnam involvement. Yeah, everyone knows about the hippies, the peace signs on the soldier's helmets, the out of reg uniforms, the negative attitude, but these are staples of Nam movies that take place later in the war. I wouldn't mind seeing a movie made that deals with the later years of the war (say, 1972). Plus Madeline Stowe does a good job in as supporting role. Plus she looks real cute when she does that flinch/double take when the cab guy arrives at her door.On par with BHD or SPR? No. But it is on the level of Platoon, Glory, and Hamburger Hill. 7 of 10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Absolutely one of Mel Gibson's greatest works. A true piece of American history that we shall remember forever and honor those that fell.,"The trials and tribulations of the men on the battlefields in Vietnam can never be forgotten. We must always honor those men who served, fought, and died on every battlefield in the world and must never forget why they did it. I can't imagine anyone reading this movie less than 10 stars. Every American citizen should watch this movie so they made more appreciate what these men did to preserve freedom in the world. Every history teacher in the country, whether it be American history or world history should show this movie in its entirety to his or her class, essays should be written, and the cause effect of this war, and every other war should be openly discussed in every classroom. We're here in America often take for granted what it took to make this great nation the best place in the world anyone could ever want to be a citizen of
so I challenge you to get 10 people to watch this movie and challenge those 10 to find another 10 and so on... Infinitum.From America's Revolutionary war right down to our men and women in uniform who are currently deployed and stationed all around the world and every single boot that's been on the ground in between. We owe it to them to pass along these stories. Our youth needs to fully understand what it took To make America so great and so safe.We here in America that are more luxurious and comfortable life than any other place on earth. We are truly a free people. We set an example for the world on what it looks like to truly be free. Everyone in the world would rather live here because they see how fortunate we are. I think the good Lord every single day that I was born in this country and have such a fantastic life and future. If you live in America, the only thing holding you back, is you because of every single manner woman who has served in uniform. Whether they served abroad or right here at home. No matter what the uniform or branch of military or fire fighter or police. I think there's some politicians in Washington that aught to watch this movie so they may understand how better to serve the American people rather than serve themselves. So many politicians in Washington DC today just don't get it. And that goes right down through state governments, cities, and counties. United we stand...
if you put yourself even in the shoes of the families that stay behind and worry about their loved ones on the battlefields of the world or on the streets of our great nation, you will truly understand the cost of our freedom.Imagine seeing a dear loved one off to there great position of responsibility and wondering if that's the last time you'll ever see them. It must truly be nerve-racking and heart wrenching. Though the risk they take is so very very high and they two know the price they might have to pay, they put on their uniforms pull themselves up by their booth heels say goodbye their loved ones as if it was the last time they'll ever speak and go to work/war.I invited you to have a discussion with everyone, you know, and all of your family about ancestors you may have had have been out there some of which may have never come home, contact the family member that has served this country, talk with them. Tell them how much you appreciate them and their sacrifice and how proud you are of them. Most of all Thank them From the very bottom of your heart. Honor them Every single chance that you get. Ask them to tell the people they stand shoulder to shoulder with to pass on your gratitude.Many, who made it home will never forget the men and women around them who fell serving this country. So offer them, comfort and compassion, and remind them that you also honor every single life lost in their presence.Despite all they've been through, if called all upon again, and God willing if they were able, they would gladly do it again and again and again and again for you.If this country can spend an entire month honoring ""pride"" I see no reason why we shouldn't spend the entire year honoring what's really important. They say the war united a country, we've had enough wars, we've sacrificed enough of our national treasure (American lives) already. All we need to do is open a true history book or watch a movie as great as this. There are many other great war movies out there. This one is absolutely in the top 10 for accuracy and the ability to let us see through their eyes. This is so much more than just a movie like so many others. It's less than two hours, surely you can spare two hours so that your eyes may be opened. Your heart will be full of compassion, sorrow, laughter, and most of all pride in America and what she stands for. After you watch this movie, you will see the American flag in all her glory and understand how much more it is than just a piece of cloth was pretty colors on it. After seeing this movie, your heart will fill with anger and rage. When you see someone burn the flag or disgrace our servicemen and women.The next time, you see someone in uniform, standing in line to buy food at the very least you should thank them for their service and if you can afford it by their meal.I have bought hundreds of meals all over this country for them and it wasn't near enough in my heart. We can all do so much more. Now go watch the damn movie and enjoy it, you can thank me later.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Decent war movie but it doesn't do anything new,"I was curious about this movie because it's one of the more ""recent"" Vietnam movies so I wanted to see if it brought anything new to the table that the classic movies did not.The movie opens with a French patrol in Vietnam in 1954, the final year of the First Indochina war. The French patrol is overrun by the Viet Minh forces and the commander order to ""kill all they send, and they will stop coming"". We fast forward 11 years when the United States is fighting the Vietnam War. Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) arrives with his family and is very dedicated to training his troops in preparation to be sent to battle. He will be leading a newly created air cavalry unit (flying troops and supplies in with helicopters) into the Ia Drang Valley. Moore only has 395 men at his disposal and soon learn that the enemy has much more men. Vastly outnumbered, will the astounding leadership qualities and stubborn determination of Moore be enough to survive the coming onslaught?Overall I enjoyed this movie, but not tremendously. The war action was very good, the acting and portrayal of the characters was decent and at times it gave me the feeling of being in the heat of the battle. But it started really slow, the first 40 minutes were not very interesting and although it did setup some story arcs, overall it could be much shorter or be made more exciting. In my opinion they tried to hard with focusing on the families of the soldiers. I understand that they wanted to show how the women left behind would react to the bad news but it didn't work for me, I think they should have stayed with the battle the whole movie.And where most classic Vietnam movies focus on the insanity of war and the dehumanization, this movie sometimes looks like a commercial to join the army. There were a bit to many ""I'm glad I died for my country"" moments and it lacked emotional torment of the characters. On the other hand they did a fine job showing the Vietnam troops as real people and not as nameless monsters.Overall it is a decent movie but it doesn't do anything new and doesn't hold a candle to the classic Vietnam movies like Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Religious and Right Wing Propaganda,"So many people have taken shots at Platoon and Born On the Fourth of July among other calling them ""leftist propaganda film."" Now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie. To me this movie is very imposing on certain religious beliefs and on its political views.The acting and writing was a little to clich√©d for my liking. Mel Gibson seems to like to play in these unnecessary violent films and proves it once again by teaming up with his partner Randall Wallace for yet another one. Throughout this movie there was this garbage prototypical ""Just tell my family I love them"" or ""Tell Ronny to pray before hoe goes to bed"" lines. The was so overloaded with this garbage retread lines that I felt like I had to vomit. How about that scene were Gibson's wife goes to do her laundry and this ""no colors"" applies to what to put in the washing machine. Its in the mid-sixties was she some how stuck under a rock not noticing the racism around her. Another scene is were Gibson's daughter asks him what war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter.The directing displayed this all perfectly. The countless scenes of Gibson and his family or soldiers praying. I'm fine with showing that once or twice but after a while I wonder if the movie is trying to shove something into my head. How many scenes with the American flag at its finest hour were shot with the melodramatic music on. The director also makes it seem like we won some sort of victory in Vietnam. What exactly was won their. The cinematography was the worst of it with the slowed down scenes see the American flag in the distance scenes spread throughout. I love America but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do.This may seem like a rant and maybe it is but I cannot stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they will agree with anything their country does look bad. This movie to me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects. To me it says if your not Christian your wrong. Would God or Jesus want people to kill I don't think so. To me this movie was offensive. At first this movie was funny with the countless clich√©s and overacted scenes but then when I looked at what this movie was trying to say or not say it was really frustrating to watch. I guess though it is my fault that I chose to watch this movie. I hope no one takes this comment offensively because I am not criticizing religion or patriotism but some of the narrow minded people who are so into both and discount everyone else.If you want a real depiction of the Vietnam war watch Platoon, Born On the Fourth of July, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter or The Killing Fields. Even Full Metal Jacket which I absolutely hated was a better depiction. I have read a quote that in context says a true patriot does not go with everything the government or country does but questions it when its wrong. A real patriot loves their country too much to see it do bad things.",1.0,Anonymous,History
simply wonderful,"We Were Soldiers is quite possibly the greatest war movie ever.  This titles isn't given out lightly considering all the great movies that have been made (Platoon, Hamburger Hill, Saving Private Ryan).  No movie I have seen has devled so deep into the emotion of war.  It mixes the intese action scenes with the back home emotion of lost loved ones, in such away that it leaves you breathless.Were Were Soldiers shows us the first battle in the Vietnam War, before the country boycotted it, before we knew we couldn't possibly win the war, back to when our professional soldiers went into the with hope and honor. Because of this we are given a totally different perspective than any other Vietnam War movie, and a perspective that you need to see.This movie is incredibly emotional, and incredibly accurate (see Lt. Col. Moore's comments on the special features).  This is a must see.",,Anonymous,History
"Presented less like a Viet Nam movie, but more like WW2","This film reminded me the film ""Tora, Tora, Tora!"" rather than the other Viet Nam movies that I have seen.  In ""We were Soldiers"" they actualy let you see the war from both sides.  Rather than the NVA as a group of silhouettes relentlessly advancing with seamingly no agenda, you watch as the officers plan the attacks as their soldiers write in their journals and think of their families.  You see the other side of the battle where they were scared but still attacked for their country.I think that showing both sides of the battle makes you realize that they were not shooting faceless people but rather husbands, sons, fathers, and that they would rather be home and happy just like anyone else, but that circumstances placed them in a situation to where they had to fight or die like their counterparts.  Then watching the American soldier's wives after their husbands died makes you wonder if the NVA wives were told in a similar manor.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Mel Gibson takes his savage depiction of warfare to Vietnam,"Mel Gibson did not direct this film, but his production company made the film and he served as producer, so his fingerprints are all over this film, once again bringing his savage depiction of war to the big screen in much the same way he did with ""Braveheart"" and ""Hacksaw Ridge."" Randall Wallace was the writer and director of the film and had previously worked with Gibson as screenwriter on ""Braveheart"" and is currently working with Gibson again on his new film ""The Passion of the Christ: Resurrection."" With ""We Were Soldiers,"" Wallace and Gibson tell the true story of Lt. Col. Hal Moore in the first major US engagement with the North Vietnamese Army at the Battle of Ia Drang. Some of the events and characters were compressed for dramatic purposes, but the film is largely true to the real-life battle. The film beings with a Gibson and family living on an army base putting together a new unit for a mission overseas, entering into the first conflict of the Vietnam War, just as French forces were pulling out. Much time in this first part of the film is spent establishing the characters, two standouts being a grim Sam Elliott as Gibson's second in command and Greg Kinnear as a brash Cavalry helicopter pilot nicknamed Snakeshit, showing the men with their families, and introducing the various character dynamics while on base, but once they hit the fields of battle in Vietnam, the film is an unrelentingly brutal battle that makes up a majority of the film. Wallace does a masterful job of filming the battle scenes, especially when it comes to clearly defining the action and geography of the battlefield, which is no small feat given the scope of this battle and the many fronts needing to be shown, both in the air and on ground. The slow motion battle scenes lack the elegance of a Sam Peckinpah film, but are more in line with the straightforward brutality of Samuel Fuller or Gibson's own depiction of war. The battle scenes here are not your typical war film depictions when it comes to now shying away from showing the horrors of war. Even compared to Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" this is an especially brutal war film that is best compared to Gibson's own ""Hacksaw Ridge."" As with Hacksaw, although the film does not shy away from a savage depiction of war, it's not at all an anti-war film and is instead a celebration of the US military and the men who serve. The film does not really go into the politics of the Vietnam war, which was probably for the best and would have undercut the film's celebration of these soldiers. After rewatching ""We Were Soldiers,"" and something I wonder about after watching most films directed by Gibson, is if it's more something about his own nature in wanting to show on-screen depiction of extreme violence. Even with his film about the Mayans, Gibson managed to steer the story into one that was wildly brutal and violent. Gibson may just be a disturbed individual, but he's a hell of a filmmaker. On the downside for this film, when it cuts away from the battlefield to the wives back home, it comes to a corny maudlin grinding halt. Gibson's wife in the film, Madeline Stowe, takes it upon herself to deliver the notification letters to the wives of men killed in action instead of the faceless military men delivering the grim news. This homefront story in itself, focusing on the impact of war on the families back home, would have been a worth story to tell in and of it's own, but this subplot is given short shrift and feels more just tacked on as some sort of way to illustrate the human impact of war, but it's not given enough time to be fully explored, especially when it's clear that the filmmakers were much more focused on the battle elements of the film. Overall, ""We Were Soldier"" is amongst the most powerful and frightening depictions of war ever committed to the screen, while at the same time celebrates and honors the military and the men who make up that fighting force, without any commentary on the war itself. Keri Russell, Chris Klein, Barry Pepper, and John Hamm also appear in the film. INTERESTING FACT: One of the real-life officers who survived the battle was Lieutenant Rick Rescorla. He died in the 9/11 attacks, while employed as Head of Security for Morgan Stanley, while making sure all of the company's employees had gotten out of the World Trade Center, which they did, and is in keeping with the brothers in arms type of heroism depicted in ""We Were Soldiers.""",9.0,Anonymous,History
Tall Order,"It's not easy bringing a realistic war to the big screen. One must manage to weave a story around the severed limbs and crushed skulls of combat, a tall order that only a few films have brilliantly accomplished.WE WERE SOLDIERS accomplishes it, too, but not as well as predecessors like BLACK HAWK DOWN and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Director Randall Wallace gets full marks for realism (you'll cringe at the charred flesh and gushing extremities), but it all feels like a distraction from the story rather than an integral part of it. And although all ""real war"" films are out of necessity chaotic and confusing, Wallace doesn't give the audience enough chances to catch its breath.Like RYAN and BLACK HAWK, the biggest virtue of WE WERE SOLDIERS is its human side. The scenes with Madeleine Stowe and her friend touring the neighborhood back home to deliver death notices are touching and sobering. Mel Gibson's character, a lieutenant colonel of strong faith called on to participate in something so awful, is deep and intriguing. The bond between Gibson's comes across as sincere and pure.In fact, it's probably fair to say WE WERE SOLDIERS is strongest off the battlefield. It's a relatively good film, but it's a tad hollow as it falls short of greatness.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A gem of a war film,"We Were Soldiers reteamed Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace after working on Braveheart and I personally think it was a better film then the Scottish set epic.We Were Soldiers told the story of the first major battle the American Army were a part of. The strenghts of the film were it's focus on the preparation before deployment and focus on battle tactics as commanders react to events on the field with Hal Moore (Gibson) and the North Vietnamese commander (Don Duong) playing a deadly game of chess. It's great for history and military nerds. Unlike Braveheart Wallace did try to be more balance with the Vietnamese soldiers being protrayed as men fighting for their country or have families back home. It was also a brutal depiction of war: Wallace and his team went to great effort to show how horrible warfare can be and the types of injuries soldiers can suffers.There were some problems. Except for Gibson, Sam Elliott, and Barry Pepper most of the American cast blended together when on the battlefield. The action on the homefront was so sugary and sappy it could you diabetes.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Violence Overdone, But Still A Solid War Movie","Although still a solid war movie, it wasn't up to my expectations, although it's still a ""keeper"" in my collection. With the cast, and hype of this film at the time of its release, I excepted something more, something akin to Saving Private Ryan.....but it wasn't to be. Even though the latter is known for its graphic violence, it's this film that I thought the violence was overdone, not SPR. The action here doesn't start for 40 minutes, but when it does it loud, it's heavy and it's continuous over most of the next 95 minutes.Shorter periods of the violent scenes would have made this much better, maybe even an ""excellent"" film.""We Were Soldiers"" had things I appreciated that are rare in today's action films: 1 - a pro-military film concerning a Viet Nam war battle; 2- fairly tame language. This is not pro-Viet Nam War. Hollywood would never do that, but at least it shows the soldiers in a solid, valiant light. It's also refreshing to see good references to God and prayer. Mel Gibson's character here is a decent Catholic. Greg Kinnear is solid, too, as the helicopter pilot and Madeline Stowe had a memorable scene delivering message of war deaths to their spouses. That was touching stuff. But, mostly, this is an action film and the battle scenes are gruesome at times, particularly near the end of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Slow to start, but ultimately a good war movie","We Were Soldiers is a good war movie. It's focused on a single battle--the Battle of Ia Drang, which happened in 1965--and most of the movie is just that one battle. It does a really good job at showing both the American and North Vietnamese commanders focusing on tactics as the battle progresses, instead of turning into a convoluted, hard-to-follow eyesore like a lot of movie battles do.Really, a lot of the trouble with this movie is how long it takes to get going. I think it would have been fine to cut the first half hour of this movie down to ten or fifteen minutes.Other than that, the only thing in this movie I would have gotten rid of is the scene where the wives are handing out the letters to the newly widowed. I get why that scene was in the movie; it was to help humanize the people who died. I feel that most of the people who'd be drawn to a movie like this wouldn't need that explained to them though, because presumably 99% of the people watching this are adults who've already learned empathy.The actual core of the movie, the battle, is really good, though. This isn't necessarily the most intellectual of Vietnam War movies. It's not going to really challenge your conception of what the war was about the same way Platoon or Apocalypse Now did. However, it will entertain you, and I think most viewers will be impressed with how well done the battle sequences are.",7.0,Anonymous,History

very bad film,"I am not one for writing reviews, But I do when a film is particularly bad or good imho.This one was particularly bad, it is a ""gung ho"" ""america rules the world"" ""america saves the world"" type of film.  It does not address the true causes of the Vietnam war: The western world ignoring president Diem's brutal facshist dictatorship and most importantly the US support of the dictator. Leading to the South Viet Cong formation and fight for freedom against a brutal government. The US supplying forces to help the Dictator, Diem. Then the Coup of 1963, leading to the assassination of Diem.  By now the US government run by Kennedy began to sit up and take notice, Kennedy knew these people were oppressed and as a result of the coup he was going to pull all his troops out of Vietnam and let them get on with it.  But the US generals who wanted a war decided then to assassinate Kennedy on the day before Kennedy's announcement to the nation that he was going to withdraw from Vietnam.  He was replaced by Johnson who declared to the nation the exact opposite that he would be sending more troops to South Vietnam.It was as usual the USA who caused this war, the vietnamese were fighting for freedom in their own country.  So when I hear lines in this film like ""Lord forgive our enemies heathen prayers and let us blow them all to hell"" and ""the spread of communism must be wiped out""  I just get annoyed that people watching this film are not being told the truth about why this all happened in the first place.  And just exactly what is wrong with being Buddhist?Also on top of that the film is NOT entertaining (because it is a graphic/explicit film about a brutal battle).  It is NOT educational (because it based on a lie and deception).  It serves very little purpose (it does touch on the futility of war but not enough) It is very badly scripted, with some really corny lines.  It is very boring for a lot of the time.  The ""stepford wives"" of the soldiers are also so pathetic.This film is definately ""walk out"" material, but I don't walk out of films cos I want to see the whole tragic thing so I can offer other people my views on it.  If you go to see this one and you feel like walking out, trust me you will not miss anything important you will only miss more of the same.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,History
Mostly good war movie despite being too long and having a tendency towards sentimentality,"When Lt Col Hal Moore is drafted back in to lead a new platoon of men he didn't know that he would lead them into the first major battle of the Americans' entry into the Vietnam war. This is the story of that battle where the unit was dropped into the middle of the action, mere miles from the main base camp of the enemy and was immediately attacked by a prepared enemy who had a better knowledge of the terrain.Although I have seen many Vietnam movies, I would certainly claim no understanding or knowledge of individual battles or tactics and to be honest, the main interest I have in battles of the period would focus on the military action in my own country of the time because I think it is important to know your own culture and understanding who you are. However I am interesting and will certainly always appreciate a war film that tells it like it is and isn't just a gung-ho, flag waving glorification of death. Looking at the cast list for this film though, made me think that perhaps it would be the latter and thus I didn't bother with it in the cinema. Having now seen the film for myself I must admit that I was partly wrong because the film is not all glorification but the mix of trying to do too much perhaps weakens it and does make it tend towards this at times.In some ways the film succeeds because it is interesting in the way it focuses on one particular battle and does convincingly capture the horror of death during war ¬ñ it is impossible to watch this and not be moved by the sheer waste of life it shows. Indeed the director is at pains to make sure we see the impact back home, even to the detriment of the film as I understood the loss without seeing crying families. The director also seems to be making great efforts to cover all bases and present the whole picture in some regards but yet fails in others; so we have balanced views of the enemies and the dialogue is clear of ethnic insults and lingo but yet at the same time we never seem anything that would condemn the war ¬ñ hence we have no friendly fire incidents or really any deaths that are less than noble. This is a weakness of the film ¬ñ it can't help but slightly glorify or sugar coat the total product; hence the start and end lack the emotional impact of the battle scenes and although the film is about the loss of life and waste of youth, it still hits a ""noble"" and ""worthy"" note that some may feel undermines the message the rest of it seems to be putting out.Even though this is my gut reaction, I know I'm being a little unfair because, when portraying real men who died younger than me, then why not give them the dignity they deserve, but it is a difficult mix to carry off and, while good, I'm not sure the film totally managed to do it. The cast have the hardest job and many of them don't do anything beyond the predictable. Gibson is all very heroic, noble and courageous and he does the job but the rest of his men are a lot less effective in pigeon-hole roles. Elliot is good but obvious as a gruff Sgt-Major, Kinnear is a heroic fly-boy, Klein is the young father and so on. The women have less material to work with and are left with the histrionics to deliver ¬ñ Stowe is the lead in a collection of good but mostly unnecessary performances. While none of them really have strong characters to work with, the majority do enough to pass muster in this film and I was pleased that Gibson was a lot more human than Braveheart suggested he would be.Overall this is a solid war movie that manages to mix the horror with the nobility of war ¬ñ a difficult trick to pull off and unfortunately a mix that will niggle sections of the audience who came for flagwaving and got depressing reality and vice versa those that came for gritty horror and got too much sentimentality. The cast are better than the names involved would suggest, even if they don't have much to do and some do have ""movie soldier"" dialogue to deliver in unconvincing ways (eg ""I'm glad to...die....for...my...country"") but it is still worth seeing even if there are better Vietnam movies.",,Anonymous,History

Sure looks right to me,"Many Viet vets laud this film for an accurate portrayal of what fighting in Vietnam was like. It also shows the impact that the war had on the wives waiting back home. The movie had an emotional impact on me which was unexpected; in that way it is the rare war movie that shows both sides; the Vietnamese were/are just people, with the same fears and motivations that we have. I remember the shoddy reception that the typical soldier got returning home from this awful war. It had become so politicized that very little appreciation was shown to them. Whether the war is just or not, soldiers that fight it bleed and die, supposedly for their country. The battle screenplay, effects and intensity are among the best I've seen.

Decent Vietnam War Film - We Were Soldiers,"I have seen all of the Vietnam films. This film is similar to Go Tell The Spartans (starring Burt Lancaster), but with many more bells and whistles. It also shows the war from the viewpoint of the spouses back home; an area not covered by Go Tell the Spartans.Although I was a Vietnam Vet, I do not pretend that I know anything about combat in Vietnam, except for second-hand information. I was in intelligence and security, which was probably the biggest misnomer in the Army. Intel was an expert on second-hand information and used it as first-hand information on several occasions.The casting of the film is very good. Although, I did not think there was much chemistry between Mel Gibson and Madeline Stowe; and certainly not in the same league as the passion in Last of the Mohicans.American soldiers did not lose either the Korean or Vietnam wars; American political and military leaders did. And I am not talking about the boots on the ground; I am talking about REMFS sitting in their air-conditioned offices in Saigon, the Pentagon, and various other administrative places.A decent Vietnam War Film.The cinematography is very well done, and the battle sequences are accurately brutal.

Maybe the fine film Saving Private Ryan was further back in the American consciousness to make it more 'popular' but this should have been a more 'successful' movie.At least with the D-Day landings one could understand the reason for the fight - what on earth were these soldiers being flown in here for? A graphically realistic series of battle scenes that maybe we have all become hardened to on screen nowadays and, lets face it, unless one has actually been there it is never going to be recreated just how it was but this was pretty close I am sure.Congratulations to those involved with the film, what a waste of life it was and a good portrayal of the senselessness, the horrors and the people left at home.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Some flaws but well made.,"There were some awkward transitions that took place when the battles were occurring and when they cut back to the women back home who received the letters from the government about their husbands being killed (but those ended up being pretty good scenes). The movie also came across as way too religious but I get that it was significant for many at that time in American history and remains significant to many to this day, it was just too much in my face with multiple characters. Other than that, I liked how the movie was directed and it got emotional at a few times for sure. While this was an offensive, brutal, and ethnocentric war on the U. S.'s part, I still respect those and the loved ones of those who died as a result of it and this war changed the country forever. Pretty good movies have been made about this war, but not sure it was entirely worth the cost since it was horrible for both sides (the American people and the people of Vietnam).

Best War Movie I've ever seen!!,"Awesome movie!!  This movie doesn't just show you the war, it drops you in the middle of it!! This movie is not for everyone, because the battle scenes are never ending.  Besides the battle scenes, there are other scenes which involve the wives of the men whom are involved in the war. For this reason, you may get away with calling it a partial Chic Flix in order to persuade your wife or girlfriend to watch it.My suggestion is to shove this movie into you DVD or video player, raise the volume, and just sit back and enjoy (if you can) all of the explosions, scenery, and carnage this fine movie has to offer (that sounds weird). This an extremely exciting, well acted film and should have been noticed at Oscar time.

Could have been better,"""We Were Soldiers"" was entertaining and instructive but ultimately less satisfying than it might have been. In a way, I prefer pure fiction to movies based on true stories because fiction is fiction. No one implies it actually happened (except the producers of ""Fargo""). With movies based on true stories one must always wonder what actually happened and what was changed in the name of dramatic license. I suspect things in ""We Were Soldiers"" were changed to (A) play up the involvement of the soldiers' wives and (B) to emphasize the whole honorable soldier image. For example, when Lt. Col. Moore exchanges salutes with the Huey pilot at the end of the battle. Maybe it happened. But I doubt it. A similar scenario played out for real during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in World War II. Commander Ernest E. Evans, captain of the USS Johnston, was wounded and conning his damaged ship by standing on the fantail shouting orders to men steering the ship by hand. He looked up and saw the captain of another damaged American ship, a man he knew. And he waved. If they ever make a movie about the Battle of Leyte Gulf (and I hope they do) they'll probably have Evans salute. But I digress. ""We Were Soldiers"" suffers from the Hollywood version of heroism and honor, which must nowadays include graphic violence a la ""Saving Private Ryan."" I have mixed feelings about this form of realism. It illustrates the hell of battle much better than the no-blood war movies I grew up with. And that's a service. However, I think it's deliberately overdone in many cases as movie makers see it as an audience-pleaser. An early version of battle realism in the movies occurs in the 1968 film ""Anzio."" Little or no blood is visible in the movie until Corporal Rabinoff (played by Peter Falk) is killed, at which point the blood gushes from his neck. It works as realism, and it works cinematically because it comes as such a shock. The same goes for profanity. The 1968 movie ""Bullitt"" is almost profanity-free until the end when Steve McQueen says ""Bulls***!"" to Robert Vaughn. The line is 10 times more effective because so little profanity has preceded it.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The best war film in the past few years,"This is best film on the Vietnam War that I have ever seen. Mel Gibson does extremely well as a commanding officer and father of five seeing the omens stack up one by one.  With support from war movie vet Sam Elliot, they put on two of the best performances in this film.  I liked Sam Elliot's dead-on and somewhat hilarious retorts to the other cast members.  Chris Klein, Greg Kinnear, Barry Pepper, Madeline Stowe, and Keri Russell rounded out a great cast that were all affected by the first major skirmish of the Vietnam War. What made this movie especially good and at some points hard to watch was the method of chosen storytelling.  The story wasn't limited to the American combatants.  It told the story from the Vietnamese point of view of the North Vietnamese army as well as the wives of the American troops.  This was another film to show that war is hell for every side.  It is reminiscent of ""Braveheart"", ""The Patriot"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""Enemy At The Gates"".  The cinematography, choreographed violence, and make-up effects made this biopic of the 7th Cavalry Division all the more unsettling and effective.  Randall Wallace made a film that should always be looked at as one of the most patriotic films of all time.  This is the best war film to have come out since ""Saving Private Ryan"" and I give it a 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,History
A little too sappy/patriotic to be a great film.,"This is not a horrible film by any means.  There are a lot of gripping, visceral battle scenes, and the film does make an effort to try and show the Viet Cong as humans, although, it achieves this only towards the end, (towards the beginning, the VC are portrayed as the same ol' stereotypical Yellow Menace -- commander barking out stilted, harsh commands, et al).The thing that makes the movie unsatisfactory for me is undue sappiness and an overly religious and patriotic tone.  Unlike ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""The Thin Red Line"", which both try and make attempts at showing the gritty, painful life and experience from the eyes of a soldier during a war without covering it with unnecessary sentimentality, ""We Were Soldiers"" has a more ""idealized"" view.  Even though the movie does an good job of displaying the futility of the Vietnam War, and shows some of the more graphic violence that accompanied it, the acting by the leads and much of the script has an ""over-the-top"" nationalism attached to it that made me squirm in my seat more than watching a artillery soldier getting burnt to a crisp by napalm. Scenes such as the ""prayer scene"" in the chapel that Gibson has with Chris Klein as they pray for Kleins new-born baby were relatively unnecessary, in my opinion. It only served to give an excuse for schmaltz later on in the film and pound us over the head with fact that Gibson's character is so great and kind-hearted and the ideal God-fearing soldier of the U-S-of-A. It was like a big, loud alarm for you to realize that ""Hey something is gonna happen to this kid that will make you sad and weepy. Take note!"" Also, Klein's character, who is supposed to be a tragic figure, for some reason did not feel tragic enough to me. I think the major reason is that Chris Klein simply is not the right actor for this part. He is completely unconvincing, and lets face it, he is not a very good actor. I am sad to say he resides in the same league as Keanu Reeves when it comes to acting skill. Barry Pepper would have been a much better choice in that role, seeing as how miniscule his actual part is and is pretty much wasted.Mel Gibson does an adequate job, but his style and mannerisms don't necessarily translate well into this type of roll.  He does the crazy little ""look over to the side"" move he perfected in Lethal Weapon, while he speaks. This is a bit disconcerting, and is not befitting behavior for a battle-hardened veteran.  His emotional display at the end of the movie is also fairly hard to believe.  On the other hand, when Gibson is actually on the battlefield commanding the battle, he is thoroughly convincing, and that is where he shines!  He is at once valiant, courageous, strategic and compassionate.  The battle scenes display Mel's true talents as an actor. The non-battle segments of the film are better left forgotten. (For example, the above mentioned chapel scene, and the scene where Mel has to explain to his baby daughter what a war is made me cringe).Finally, I just wanted to add that I had a helluva time trying to understand what Sam Elliot was saying throughout the movie.  His drawl was so thick, that it sounded like he made the film with a mouthful of marbles.  It would have served the film well to provide subtitles just for Elliot's lines. Even though his role as the tough-as-nails drill sergeant was a tad stereotypical, he played it about as well as anybody could short of Clint Eastwood.  I just wish the director had tried to get more intelligible takes of his scenes!  I'd also like to give a big thumbs up once again to Barry Pepper, for his great, albeit small, performance in this film as a military reporter caught on the battlefield.  But the little overlay ""montage"" scene where he is taking various photos on the field was way cheesy and completely out of place. That was a real sore-spot for me.  I can't state enough how much that montage completely stunk, and is a clear sign of bad direction.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The harsh reality of Hollywood.,"Many good films have been made about the American/Vietnamese conflict from the sensationalistic and unpretentious ""Apocalypse Now"" to many serious minded documentaries about the harsh reality of the war. ""We Were Soldiers"" is not one of them. A pretentious retelling of the first major American engagement with the Vietnamese on the battlefield (circa 1965), the film is one contrived, obvious, and fabricated scene after another from crying because you lived and your men  didn't (a success for a field commander) to coming home unannounced (yeah, right) to a feeble attempt to honor the Vietnamese warriors, etc. etc. etc. This flick is blatant commercialism under the guise of patriotism and a poor tribute to the fighting men and women who sacrificed during the Vietnam conflict. The only thing sadder than the mentality behind ""We Were Soldiers"" is the mentality that supported it at the box office and in critical reviews. (C-)",4.0,Anonymous,History

An honest movie,"I would like to start with saying that i really liked this movie. It's more honest than other Mel Gibson movies I've seen like the patriot,(worthless piece of junk) and Braveheart (ok movie). It was honest in the way it described the things that caused the defeat in Vietnam. It's not as good as the classic ""Apocalypse Now"" but almost an equal to ""Full Metall Jacket"". It wouldn't have hurt with some more scenes showing the warcrimes committed by U.S.A.But thats probably never going to happen so I can't complain. If you like war movies with lots of explosions and mass killing this movie is ideal for you. If you are like me and wants to see a movie with a good story, it's also a fairly good movie.I'll give it 7/10This mark could have been higher if Mel Gibson wouldn't have played the leading role.

Merciless and simply unforgiving.,"A fine and acceptable account of the first major battle in Vietnam between the N.V.A. and the U.S. forces in the Ia Drang Valley, as known as ""The Valley of Death"". The movie is well-cast with Mel Gibson, Chris Klein, and Sam Elliott who portray the high-ranking members of the seventh Air Calvary division who lead the unit of four hundred men into the area, nearly walk into a major bushwhack (or ambush), and discover their counterpart have more troops (2,000 to be exact). Plus, it shows some scenes where the wives of the soldiers (Madeline Stowe and Keri Russell among them) who were or weren't prepared to deal with the fact that their loved ones might not come back alive. That's how war is - merciless and simply unforgiving.Writer/Director Randall Wallace, who in directing his second film here, has the tough task of handling the scenes, and he shows no problems in doing so. The movie has a small mix of Samuel Fuller, Sam Peckinpah, and Oliver Stone. And there's a couple of nice touches at the movie. The first one being Gibson character writing to a widow of a dead NV soldier and the second one decading this movie to those who died in the fight.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Something old, something new, something borrowed...","I've got mixed feelings about this one.I've never been in a war so I appreciate the efforts made here to help a relatively privileged population understand its horrors.I was torn while watching it, because I realize there's a money-making motive here.  The movie is big and bang-filled to pack people in seats. There's a duel going in this movie between the desire to reveal the fear and pain of war, and the studio push to turn a huge profit.  Unfortunately, I'm afraid this movie will be judged in the coming weeks based on its box-office earnings rather than its substance.  In other words, I think the message may be muted somewhat by a desire to develop the Hollywood themes in the story.It's the first Vietnam movie I've seen (or rather, that I can remember)that makes an attempt to show the Vietnamese- North, South, or otherwise- as humans rather than 'yellow demons.'  It's been about 27 years since the 'war' 'ended', which I guess is far enough removed for this kind of movie to come out and be accepted by a larger audience.Unfortunately, there's a rampant resurgence of the ""I'm tough on 'em but I love 'em"" officer archetype.  I've not read the book the movie's based on, and I've never met Lt. Col. Moore or Sergeant Major Plumley, so I don't know.... maybe they are/were really like that.  Still, in this movie, its not novel; it's John Wayne.  Say yer prayers and then say yer prayers.In all, this movie is no classic as far as I can tell (only one day after seeing it) but it's not bad.  It tells the story well, and makes a superficial attempt at seeing both sides of the issue.  What I would really love to see is a film that takes that idea one or two steps further. Might be a couple of years off yet, though.  I don't know if Hollywood's understanding of America is ready for it.Oh!  Something old... done, Something new... covered, Something borrowed... done that too, Something blue:  Mel Gibson's eyes in the night scenes.  I swear they've been enhanced to make him look more heroic/boyish/pure. Those scenes don't have much else that's vibrantly colourful, except for his eyes. Hmmm.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Really touched me.,"This film really touched me. Being the son of a combat Vietnam veteran, this film really opened my eyes. There are a lot of stories my father will not tell me about his tour in Vietnam, and due to this film I now understand why. I will not try to justify this war, not will I try to say it is a war that is above any other war, but what I will say is the men who fought in this war deserve to me remembered.I love my father, and I love movies also. Movies tend to get the facts incorrect, but seem to convey the emotion correctly.

"Wonderful story, but badly directed","If you ever want to compare and contrast two movies of similar content for differences in direction, watch ""We Were Soldiers"" and ""Black Hawk Down"". Randall Wallace is so out of his depth in trying to convey dimension and depth to both the story and the characters that it's often painful to watch. The cliched and stereotypical scenes in the movie scream of amateurish direction. (Two scenes in particular: the wives' get-together with the ""Whites Only"" reference to the laundromat, and the ""Tell my wife I love her"" line so badly delivered that I laughed in spite of myself.)Keep in mind: I love war movies. I do not love them for their action. I don't even love them for the strategy and intelligence depicted in the arena of conflict. I love them because, when they're done correctly, these films show us the sacrifice and unreasonable commitment soldiers bring to the aforementioned arena. I genuinely feel for the soldiers when I see just what they are subjected to in combat. ""Black Hawk Down"" left me wanting to know more about the brave rangers. ""Patton"" left me wanting to learn more about the courage of General Patton's army. ""We Were Soldiers"" almost didn't do that because of inept directing. Randall Wallace needs to hone his craft before he takes on such projects.See WWS, but see BHD first.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Daddy, what is a good movie? Not this one, honey.","This movie truly is a huge disappointment.The first 45 minutes or so are awful and riddled with dreadful dialogue. When the movie finally shifts to the battle, it really doesn't click either. The characters are all cardboard and clich√©d. Pardon the pun, but you can start picking off the guys who are going to die in battle minutes after we are introduced to them.Who knew that the John Wayne-esquire protagonist would make a comeback? There he is, Mel Gibson, standing tall, ignoring bullets whizzing by, nonchalantly knocking off enemy soldiers as if they were mere nuisances.And there's even a ridiculous deus ex machina moment in this film that is laughable.The women in this movie are mere decorations and even in those scenes, you can predict what's going to happen. And Madeleine Stowe had to pick this film not to shed her clothes, which would have been a small bonus.I realize the need to make a film that honors those who fought and died valiantly in this battle. But this film is not the one to do that. I don't mind that the film never questions why we were in Vietnam or whether we should have been there.This film - like ""Black Hawk Down"" - wants to simply tell the story of the battle and those who participated in it. But surely not every soldier who fought was a clich√© from almost every war picture that was ever made. The only character missing was that young, late teen-age soldier, nicknamed with the state he hails from, sitting in the trenches looking at the picture of his childhood sweetheart Betsy, telling his buddies that when he returns stateside, he's going to go back to the farm and raise a family with her and then...wham! - a sniper's bullet slams into his skull. And his buddies get really angry now because this time the bad guys killed Wisconsin.And in case you were wondering whether Randall Wallace has gotten over his penchant for slow-motion, fear not. This movie's got plenty of those shots, too, in case the audience was just too dumb to realize the significance of the moment.If you want to see a good movie about the early days of Vietnam, rent ""Go Tell the Spartans,"" starring Burt Lancaster.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Better Times Than These.,"Totally ignored and under-rated in 2002, ""We Were Soldiers"" was one of the top 10 films of yet another excellent cinematic year. The conflict in Vietnam is looming and the U.S. is about to get involved in some heavy combat and casualties are imminent. Mel Gibson leads the very first group of some 400 American men into a hot zone where 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers are waiting. What follows are intense fire fights and the realizations of love, devotion, admiration and friendship for all Americans involved. While there have been several excellent films on the topic of Vietnam, ""We Were Soldiers"" is different from the others in the way it shows the emotional battles occurring back home in the states of those who are waiting for their husbands, fathers, brothers and uncles to come home. Madeleine Stowe, as Gibson's wife, is solid as she always is as the primary woman struggling with the events taking place overseas. A strong cast which includes Keri Russell, Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliott, Barry Pepper and Chris Klein completes the strong film. Randall Wallace (who wrote the screenplays for the amazing ""Braveheart"" and the disappointing ""Pearl Harbor"") shows an uncanny knack as a film director. He uses an odd Frank Capra-styled way of telling a story that is highly dramatic and highly life affirming at the same time. ""We Were Soldiers"" is an excellent film that should be embraced, especially in this chaotic time when other events overshadow the world of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,History

"Could have been a truly great movie, but sadly it wasn't.","I went to the bookstore to look through the book this movie was based on. In the prologue, the author criticized Hollywood for screwing up all movies about Vietnam and for not telling how war really is.  Hollywood did not do justice once again ironically this time to this very book.After watching the movie, all I could say to myself is, ""Come on, that didn't happen...""  This is sad because there are many Americans and viewers around the world who also demand not to be insulted by how Hollywood often likes to.  Even sadder is that there are others who are prone to believe that the film really depicts reality... that American soldiers do shoot like Rambo... that the enemy just packs up and leaves seeing defeat... that the Americans clearly won this battle.It always felt all throughout the film wanted to stay truer to the book and thus to the events that transpired.  But after all it is a product of Hollywood which we all know is motivated by profit.  That means, the script has to be padded with action, explosions, and moments of patriotism.  The fudged-up story confuses fact and fiction and denies all of us the valuable lessons that the brief, brutal, tragic events in the small patch of land in Vietnam could have offered.  The decisions to compromise integrity made the difference between a truly great film and a mediocre Vietnam flick.However, I felt ""We Were Soldiers"" shined in the opening sequence.  I always thought that the beachhead opening scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" could never be topped.  True, it was filled with action, scale, and immediacy. In ""We Were Soldiers"" though, the opening sequence in less than two minutes strikes right in your face the savageness and absurdity of war.

we were soldiers,"Film Review:This film Starring Mel Gibson as Lt Col. Moore, Madeleine Stowe as his wife Julie, and Sam Elliot as Sgt. MaJ. Plumley, is set in 1964. The Plot and theme of this film are both about War; however, the plot is about the survival of a combat unit in one of the first battles in the conflict of Vietnam. The theme centers on the brother hood and unity of the soldiers of this conflict, as they fight for victory and survival against over whelming odds. This film shows much more than a traditional film in the war genre. It depicts the soldiers as individuals with everyday struggles and that of the families they leave behind while fighting. (Wallace, 2002)This film is unique in my opinion, because it is the first war film that I have seen that tells the story of soldier's on both sides of the conflict, as men, details the fear, anger and frustration felt on both sides, while providing the audience with a realistic view from the objective point of view. The closes up shots on the faces depict the feelings of the actor's without need for voice over narration or explanation. The lighting and special effects of the film add a sense of realism, where the action and the effects flow together well. This is not a typical war film where the simple objective is to blow up as many things as possible. When Lt Col Moore and Sgt Plumley are talking about the possibility of defeat, the hard-nosed sgt. Tells the Col. That he will win when he says the col is no comparison to General Custer, This sets the tone for a shift in the action, where the US soldiers start to overcome the odds of defeat. (Wallace, 2002) In the end scenes where, Col. Nguyen Huu An is speaking to one of his Vietnamese soldiers' while they are collecting bodies it is apparent to me that this is a message that regardless of what side your on in a conflict, it is sometimes forgotten that before they were solders, they were simply men with families. (Wallace, 2002)This film also does an excellent job of telling the story of the families the men leave behind, as well as addressing the issue of racism, as it existed in 1964. One of the most memorable characters of this film besides Col Moore, is that of reporter Joe Galloway, who put himself in harm's way to document the heroism of the men that fought, the use of still photography in the film, to represent the pictures he took, sends a very silent yet powerful message to the viewer. (Wallace, 2002) This film may have some resemblances to Apocalypse now, as it is also a war film set in the same period. However, it definitely does not tell the powerful story of men and the brother hood of soldiers as this film does.ReferencesWallace, R. (Director). (2002).

Be warned...,"WE WERE SOLDIERS is not the kind of movie I feel comfortable saying ""I enjoyed"" or ""I liked.""  But I'm not sure that's the reaction one is supposed to have upon seeing it.  GLORY and BRAVEHEART took us to the middle of the battlefield like never before.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN showed us the frenzied chaos of modern warfare with new and brutal realism. WE WERE SOLDIERS may end up being the film that some claim goes too far in portraying the unspeakable horror of war.  I attended a screening that consisted largely of Vietnam veterans and their wives.  Several attendees excused themselves suddenly during the battlefield scenes which make up more than half of the movie.  Many watched through covered faces and teary eyes. But when the credits began to roll, not a soul moved.  Not one.  It was only when the lights came up that the audience responded with brief applause before getting up to leave.  And I am sure I am not the only one who left the theatre with a sickening knot in my stomach.The story of WE WERE SOLDIERS is thin at best.  After an introduction to the major characters, all are thrown into the hell of battle, either the physical hell of Vietnam or the mental anguish of waiting on the homefront for news one hopes never comes.  For the rest of the movie, it becomes about one thing: which characters will stay alive?  Which, I realize, is part of the point in a movie like this, because that's what it became about for the soldiers: staying alive.  Not how they got there, not whether or not they should have been there, not how they felt about being there-- just staying alive.  And the battlefield scenes are the most horrific I have ever seen, previously cited examples included. They are gory, they are long, they are brutally relentless.  Again, I understand that is perhaps part of the point, part of the lesson about war.  But that is a hard thing to ask of a theatre full of people who have paid 8 dollars apiece to see a movie that doesn't look especially violent based on the trailer.In the end, I can't say I ""enjoyed"" WE WERE SOLDIERS.  I can't say I ""liked"" it.  What I can say is that, for the first time, I may have some tiny, infinitesimal, ultimately meaningless fraction of a notion of what my father-in-law went through in Vietnam, and why he's never spoken a word about it to anyone.  And that, perhaps, is a much more important thing to be able to say.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Sad, brutal-yet a very well-made war picture...","I was reluctant to see ""We Were Soldiers"" at first because I thought it was just another bloody war picture about heroism like ""Saving Private Ryan."" More than six years after its release, for the heck of it, I lent a copy from my local library. This movie is much more than about heroism and patriotism. For the first time I saw in a war film, the story focuses not only on the battlefield, but also on the men's families and wives, as they face fear of the knock on the door from a cabbie, telling them that their husband died in combat. This added a great deal of emotion to the characters of the film. I don't feel just sorry for the soldiers receiving gruesome deaths, but for their wives and children that they'll never see again. In a sense, this makes the film an anti-war picture. There maybe courageous acts and bravery in war, but it always comes with a heavy price.The lead and supporting actors were all diligent in their roles. Mel Gibson is not the typical action hero that I had expected from ""The Patriot"" or the ""Lethal Weapons"". He's a man in a hellish war in which he focuses not just on his own survival, but also for his men. I rank his performance in this as one of his best. I'm disappointed that he didn't at least a golden globe nomination in 2002.Director Randall Wallace, who helped Mel with ""Braveheart"", is wonderful as a director. He captures some intense and brutal battle scenes that are amazing, yet at times hard to watch (particularly with the napalm sequence). Dean Semler's photography is sweeping, plastering beautiful surroundings that are swamped by war. Nick Glennie-Smith's score has a triumphant sound, but at the same time is haunting. This develops a grim mood for the film. And lastly, I was thoroughly impressed with the sound effects editors. From what I saw on a documentary, all the gunshots and explosions were recorded after filming. They did a hell of a job making the audio fit the video.

The shooting location kinda ruined this for me,"""We Were Soldiers"" has the reputation of getting the Vietnam war right in the eyes of the veterans. So I was expecting a realistic battle. That I got, and I was pleased to see the Vietcong side as well, which you never see. I also loved Barry Pepper's character, even though he's on film for maybe 20% of the movie. It felt right. But what didn't and ruined the movie for me is the shooting location. They shot this in California; I didn't know that before watching it. But immediately I thought ""I feel in a temperate climate somewhere in Europe or North America, not in South-East Asia"". The trees are wrong, the grasses are wrong, the dried creeks are wrong.

One of the worst movies of the year,"That is a lofty title, and I plan on backing it up point by point.1:  The performances were weak at best:  Mel Gibson was decidedly wooden as he portrayed Lt. Col. Moore.  I understand that this role is hard to play, the character itself is rife with cliches, but a performance based exclusively on cliches is below Gibson (I blame the writer/direcotr, more on that later.)  Madeline Stowe was terrible.  Did she receive a copy of this script before the day they shot it?  She flubbed lines, made unnatural facial movements (these really got me,) and all and all stunk up the joint. You know when Felicity is acting circles around you something is terribly wrong.  As for the younger actors, Barry Pepper was good as a journalist, and Marc Blucas was fine, but he and Chris Kline ended up being inconsequential.  Also, the Amy Tan inspired all-women sit ins were dreadfully acted.2:  The script was a series of unnecessary monologues:  Mel Gibson's character is ridiculously saintly.  He gives a very special speech to his men, his kid, his wife, his men again, another one of his kids, his wife again, a journalist, his men again... it goes on.  It felt totally unnatural, and the unnecessary speeches took momentum away from the more interesting scenes.3:  The cinematography was lazy:  Blood on the camera on half a dozen occasions.  If this was on purpose this camera man needs to be shot.  if not... well... perhaps film school is the answer.  Also, shots were oddly out of focus, mislit, and just poorly done.  Greg Toland where are you, deep focus would have been nice, hell, any focus would have been nice.4:  There was no consistant tone:  The film jumped around, cut out of scenes at emotional moments, and had no consistancy at all.  The tone fo the film towards the start felt almost comic, and then suddenly it tried to be Saving private Ryan, then it flashed back to America for 15 minutes, and then didn't return.  We had battle scenes that felt out of place, and no consistant style shown at all.  This felt like a high school production in that sense.5:  The music was ridiculous:  Ugh, I know the 7th batallion theme is an Irish war song, but could they have found a less legubrious version. Honestly, I was laughing every time they played it.  Plus, the cliche ridden score felt disjointed as it jumped from 1950's war music, to sweeping emotional faire.  It was just poorly done.6:  The montages:  There were almost a dozen random montages that killed any momentum the movie had (often very little.)  my favorite was the Barry Pepper camera one, it really cracked me up.  It looked like something me and my friends would put together on my computer.  Layer 1, actor jumping up and down in front of a blue screen with a camera.  Layer 2, black and white photos.  Layer 3, stock footage of fire.  I AM NOT KIDDING!  THEY CUED STOCK FOOTAGE!!!  The production values were low all around, but that was pathetic.7:  Blatant and unnecessary deviations from the text:  For a movie that tauted itself as based on true events, perhaps they should have stuck to true events.  Moore was not on the front lines leading his troops over a hill.  He, like any officer following protocol, was behind his troops as he led them into battle (a battle that hardly resembled the finale.)  That was just one of a number of instances where the filmmakers ignored the truth for no apparent reason, as the dramatic tension was not increased their way.I think i covered most of my complaints, although I have more.  This was a poor film, and I cannot recommend it.  See Blackhawk Down, a far superior film, hell, see Rollerball, it at least doesn't pretend to be good.  This is Spike Friedman signing out.

Arguably the best war movie ever made,"We were soldiers is the war movie to see if you are looking for perfection. The uniforms (as far as I can tell) are perfect. Placement of the ribbons, badges, and insignia all seem to be correct. And the characters are realistic. Take Sgt. Major Plumley for example. Here is a man who has had more than his share of combat, a real tough nail...what kind of a guy is he? A hardass.Most of the camera angles are excellent, but as in saving private ryan, one or two of the scenes has blood splatter on the camera. This was probably done on purpose though, for more of a news type feel to the movie. The movie is not without flaws though. For one; I think it should have been a little longer. The scenes having to do with the wives covered the humanistic side of the movie, but while they were there, they weren't long enough. But that is just my opinion. The combat scenes were spectacular. The napalm actually looked and acted realistically. And that vietnamese incendiary grenade looked quite realistic. But that scene where the Sgt. is dying and he tells someone hes glad he could die for his country. Nah, I would be very dissapointed. I would rather make the vietnamese die for there country.My conclusion: War is ugly, but unlike the truth is violence can solve just about anything...Raja---OK Army NG",,Anonymous,History
"A cliched, but good war film","Let me start with the problem scenes in this film.  There the scene where the white lady says that the local laundromat is for white clothes only. Then the other ladies tell her that it means that only white people can go there.  Was that a joke or was it meant to be serious?  They also try to show war is bad by humanizing the enemy.  Barry Pepper's character throwing down the gun was a crappy scene.The good things were Sam Elliott and Mel Gibson.  I like how Mel just keeps walking around the battle not worrying about getting shot.  Sam Elliott saying he'll kill any mother that calls him grandpa.  I also liked the religious slant on the film.  A good war movie, very graphic.  The end was a cheap way to try to scare you and it sucked.  6/10  but hey, it's Mel Gibson",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Unoriginal, badly written and directed wannabe star vehicle","Randall Wallace should stay away from Hollywood. Having written the not-too-bad screenplay for Gibson's ""Braveheart"", he felt the need to assault our senses of good taste by giving us ""The Man In The Iron Mask"", the script for ""Pearl Harbor"" and now, this piece of unmemorable if time-passing, overly-stylised pap. The opening half-hour is appallingly mishandled, with Gibson looking uncomfortable and saggy, and the dialogue becoming increasingly corny. Shephard growls his way into Vietnam, and the 'training camp' looks, literally, like a walk in the park compared to Joel Schumacher's gritty ""Tigerland"". Once we enter the war, things do pick up, mainly because there is hardly any dialogue, and that which we do hear is thankfully drowned out by the fantastic sound effects. A hearty attempt is made at showing some sort of Vietnamese perspective, but we still have a long way to go before we can safely say that we are being un-biased in our depiction of war in cinema. There are some cringeworthy moments in terms of the direction (including two appalling montage-attempts that look like commercial spoofs), but these are countered by some stunning visuals, notably the silhouetted Vietnamese soldiers closing in on two Yankee heroes. A special mention must go to the lack of anything new happening in the performances. Gibson gives perhaps his worst judged performance of his career, Shephard is an entertaining cliche, Kinnear does his smarmy thing and Pepper does not attempt to break any new ground either. Stowe, however, does her best with a poor role, lending it dignity and passion when it doesn't really deserve it. It seems as if ""based on a true story"" is now an excuse to go overboard on overly-patriotic, melodramatic glorified history, and ""We Were Soldiers"" proves to be another case of that very annoying Hollywood symptom (although the superior ""Black Hawk Down"" did not suffer as badly)",6.0,Anonymous,History
"The ""Saving Private Ryan"" of Vietnam","When Steven Spielberg released Saving Private Ryan in 1998, it set the new standard for epic war films. We Were Soldiers uses some of those same effects/devices to tell a compelling Vietnam War story.For a basic plot summary, We Were Soldiers tells the story of one of the first Vietnam battles. It follows the First Battalion, 7th Cavalry division through their training, deployment, and improbably ""victory"" (depending on your perspective) in that seminal battle.Strangely, this film doesn't stand out much on its own accord (it doesn't do anything all that original). However, it does enough things right to make for a very enjoyable, emotional experience.Mel Gibson shines as the lead actor, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, whose primary goal is to bring ""his boys"" back to the mainland alive. In fact, this is one of the best roles I've ever seen Gibson in, far better than the action-hero roles he often fancies himself in. The other members of the battalion are also well-cast and peppered with great actors.However, this film is at its best when it tugs at your heartstrings, which it does frequently. Whether it is the physical toughness of the soldiers in the field, or the mental grit of their wives/families back home, this movie really ""gets"" the emotions of that time period. Plus, it really does a good job of foreshadowing the rest of the drawn-out conflict.Thus, whereas First Blood is best in my book at examining the mental torments of 'Nam, We Were Soldiers touches on those same emotions but also adds the epic battle scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,History
good flick,"this movie was incredibly graphic. I really thought it was well made. It grabbed your attention with it's intense surreal battle scenes. However, this film is not without it's flaws. Namely, the biggest flaw is when they interrupt the grim intense and surreal battle scenes to cut to the reactions of the wives getting their telegrams about their dead. Who cares? As if they could get these telegrams out so fast that it could happen at the same time. Basically every single scene with the wives of the soldiers in it, every single scene, was worthless and could have been cut from the movie as it only constituted about ten mintues of film. It was very distracting.On the other hand, the characters, basically all of them, were very one dimensional. I didn't find this so distracting as the wife thing, but it bears mentioning. Hal Moore (Gibson)is the model person, it is almost ridiculous, but fortunately for the movie his shallowness is only contained in the first few minutes of the film. Once the action moves to Ia Dang, Gibson brings remarkable depth to an unremarkable character.Aside from the lack of depth, the obligatory wife scenes, and anything that has to do with chris klein, this movie was great.

As did Saving Private Ryan (1998), Soldiers shows the atrocity in war early on yet unlike many other films, the key to bringing Soldiers to life is the fact that the atrocities of war do not fade and we as an audience are plunged into an era of horror as well as honor.While Gibson's performance is not his best, it is the stunning cinematography and dialogue that makes the film a worthwhile one. Barry Pepper and Chris Klein have stirring performances and powerful dialogue.

The Finest combat film ever.,"Fair warning. If you are the least bit squeamish about combat scenes, pass on this film. This contains some of the most graphic and realistic scenes since the beach landing in Saving Private Ryan. Once the fighting starts, it is non-stop and horrific, and anyone who thinks combat is in any way glorious or heroic will walk away with an altered attitude. The portrayals are realistic and true, thanks to the technical advise of both the authors, and the performances are human and identifiable. Young men who are thrown into combat, young wives and families who are horrified to learn their husbands and fathers are gone. The ""illusion of the first time"" is perfect, and from the very beginning you are drawn into the story as if you are observing it unfold. Both Stowe and Gibson give Oscar worthy performances, as does Elliot and the rest of the cast. This is one for your collection, and definitely a film any young man with dreams of being a combat hero ought to see before heading to the enlistment office.

"A Somber, Walloping War Drama","1 November 2014. Some people might refer to Saving Private Ryan (1998) as one the great classic war films, especially its extended opening scene of the landing on Normandy Beach on D-Day. Others might refer to Black Hawk Down (2001) for its extended failed military mission in Somalia as one of the most gripping battle action films. Still others would cite Apocalypse Now (1979) as the most intense, personal, surrealistic war movie. Other films that people would laud loudly about would include The Hurt Locker (2008)or Dr. Strangelove (1964) for their cynical look at war, Jarhead (2005) for its immersive, ambient experience of long moments of war.We Were Soldiers, however, is an unabashed look at the terror and fearsome pain and emotional ripping apart of familial bonds and the heat and sorrow and fear and honor and courage of the individual and team effort of battle. Regardless of how might believe, feel of President Obama's reluctance to continue American commitment to Iraq or Afghanistan, even Syria, this movie is a must see before one should reflect on the realities of war and its impact. Perhaps the closest this movie might come or a movie to compare We Were Soldiers to might be the epic Civil War movie Gettysberg (1993). We Were Soldiers is presented in a non-glorified way with an inclusionary experience of the wives of many of the soldiers as well. We see glimpses of the Vietnamese soldier themselves.The only small weaknesses of this movie might be its imbalance of primarily focusing on the American military experience with a significant but still token view of the emotive backdrop of the Vietnamese and one scene where there is an attempt to local lost American soldiers on the field of battle that doesn't seem quite realistic and perhaps even fool-hearty as well as omission of some of the more graphic hand to hand combat images while at the same time including the bloody bullets ripping through bodies themselves. But none of these weaknesses detract from the overall greatest of this movie.In sum We Were Soldiers seems to reflect some of the best, if not the best directorial, scripted, and filmed movie about the awfulness of war in a human and compassionate but somber way.",9.0,Anonymous,History
gritty but schmaltzy,"This movie had all the ingredients to be a great war movie.

Heck, the movie even surprised me a couple of times, using clever misdirection, and the under use of Chris Klein. (thank god, that line ""Don't worry sir..."" could be the worst preview line of all time it was so badly acted) However the movie tried to use the soldiers' wives as the conduit to our emotions. Talk about a terrible failure. Not only did this move drag the watcher out of the movie flow, it made the action on the field seem fake, and not quite as important. Not only that, the cut scenes were placed badly, trying to be full of suspense, but just ending up being aggravating.

We Were Soldiers Once...and Maudlin,"This movie opens with the words:  ""This is the true story...""  Were it not for these words, I would be ready to dismiss the sentimentality, brutality, and ultimately the victory of Lt Gen Hal Moore as a Hollywood contrivance. The fact is that Moore walks this earth, these events did happen, and men died horribly on a far-off battlefield at the behest of their misguided countrymen.The movie is based on journalist Joe Galloway's and Moore's account of their involvement in a 1965 battle in North Vietnam.  It was refreshing and enlightening to see how a battle actually plays out, with attention to terrain, timing, numbers, artillery and air support, communication, transport, and carnage.  The usual war film structure--character and plot development, firefight, more development, firefight, epiphany, firefight, resolution--is abandoned in favour of initial development, then a continuous firefight serving as the backdrop for several well-rounded characters: Moore (Mel Gibson), Galloway (Barry Pepper), Lt Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein), and Maj Bruce 'Snakeshit' Crandall (Greg Kinnear).We Were Soldiers is also tribute to the heroism, intellect, and compassion of Moore.  And if at times the movie's Moore is saccharin-sweet, as when he prays with his children, comforts a new father in his ranks, or pays his respects to the widow of an enemy soldier, I can forgive the movie because I suspect much of this rings true with the living, breathing, death-dealing Moore of real life.  While Gibson's portrayal lacks the charisma of Crowe's Maximus (Gladiator), Neeson's Schindler (Schindler's List), or even Gibson's Wallace (Braveheart), I was nevertheless moved.Seven out of ten.",7.0,Anonymous,History

So, why another conventional one?Maybe if that film would have had the bravery to tell that particular story from a more creative, a more daring perspective.

Decent,"I didn't expect much from ""We Were Soldiers"" since it was made at a time when Hollywood was encouraged to promote the US army(post 11.9). American patriotism is noticeable but they don't push it too far. A nice surprise which is sadly not exploited enough since it brings balance to all that Americana is that we get to see the other side, the Vietnamese commanders, planning and thinking how to defeat the American invaders, so this is not one of those ""kill the f....ng useless yellowskins"" type of movies.It tries to be as partial as possible and for the most parts succeeds. The problem is the acting. It doesn't stand out, no particularly good performances, which is about the only big downside since the movie could really use a more personal and dramatic touch. There are maybe just one to many characters in here to fully explore them. But considering that most of the time everyone is fighting for their lives I can understand this.Instead the movie really comes through in the effects department, displaying some truly spectacular visual effects and makeup(the scene where Joe Galloway picks up the burnt soldier by the legs is one of the most disgusting and disturbing things I have ever seen).The end result is a solid war movie taking place in an abnormally unrealistic ""Vietnamese"" surrounding that simply doesn't have anything new to tell, quite the opposite, it becomes a victim of a recycled formula from which we, the viewers, know exactly what to expect and therefore ""We Were Soldiers"" never really stood a chance at anything, even the American box office. 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
WWS's American Historical Review reviewer strongly recommends it.,"I wrote the February 2003 review of this film for the scholarly/professional review journal American History Review (when they were still reviewing films).While drafting my review, I interviewed by telephone both General Moore and Joe Galloway, and I called them back to ask them to read them my final draft and ask them to correct any factual errors. They did not attempt to change my opinions of the film, and I wouldn't have let them.(I should add that Joe Galloway has a very moving interview the Americans At War series put on YouTube, and he mentions Pvt. Jimmy Nakayama.)For copyright reasons, I can't reprint here the last paragraph of my AHR review, but I can say that I said and believe that EVERY ADULT American SHOULD SEE THIS FILM, before joining the military or ever sending our young people off to war.It should also be noted for historical accuracy that Mrs. (Julia) Moore did not actually deliver the death telegrams herself - a powerful dramatic device in the film, to be sure - but when she found out they had indeed been delivered by cab drivers, she personally visited and consoled every family she could locate. As Madeleine Stowe so well portrays her in the film, she is a great lady.Even though the film premiered at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, it is hardly a recruiting film as some here have claimed. It is traumatically honest about the horror of war and its human cost (especially to the military community).It should have received a bevy of Oscars - which would have been on the eve of our invasion of Iraq - and if it had, I think more Americans would have questioned that war and our leaders' determination to start it.The Army fully supported the filming, and there was a memorial service in the Ft. Benning chapel before filming during which the veterans - especially Ernie Savage, I've been told - expressed their desire to all the members of the film company that the film be truthful, that they ""get it right."" And they did.The Pentagon may have since questioned itself for supporting the film: it is as anti-war as it is pro-military.WWS is equal to the other great war films Battleground (about GIs in the Battle of the Bulge) and Attack! (starring Jack Palance and real-life war hero Eddie Albert playing his demoralized, cowardly commander), and it far surpasses the likes of Saving Private Ryan.Lou Coatney",10.0,Anonymous,History

It¬¥s about one of the very first missions of the USA army in Vietnam, where they had pretty more difficulty fighting the vietcongs than they had expected..... The big problem with this movie is that there¬¥s too much Hollywood and USA-patriotism in it. In that way, the picture you get by watching this isn¬¥t the good picture. Everything is seen, as usual, from the American point of view. On top of that, I couldn¬¥t see Mel Gibson as a Vietnam soldier.

There are some things I have to say in defense of this movie: it has great action and sounds. On top of that, they use new camera techniques I¬¥ve never seen in a war movie, which is pretty great to watch. So, in sum, if you want to see a movie which is quite simple, has a lot of action and good camera shots, you should watch this movie.

Black Hawk Down is a great war movie but that does not live up to this or Saving Private Ryan. This movie like Platoon did showed the atrocities of the Vietnam War and showed them well.This film is about the 7th Calvary stuck in ""the Death Valley"" with thousands of North Vietnamese soldiers surrounding them and their struggle to get out of harm's way.The acting is what blew me away about the film. Mel Gibson gives his strongest performance since Braveheart. Barry Pepper as the photojournalist gave me a few tears with his realistic portrayal.Overall, this is a true war film with a heart. I could not stop watching the movie and its intense battles. There were some tear jerking scenes helped along with a masterful score by Nick Glenne-Smith. I rate this film a 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Enjoyed the movie, ... but","I can't understand why a movie of this caliber, wasn't shot at a location that more closely represents the highlands of Vietnam. The sight of 200 year-old oak trees really took a lot of the realism out of the film for me. I know its expensive to film outside the US but in a war film, it's critical. Somehow I don't think Saving Private Ryan would have had the same impact on me if they had filmed the invasion sequence along the coast of California.",6.0,Anonymous,History
""" If you are heartless and without Compassion, this story will mean little to You ""","The Viet-Nam War was not about one man, nor of the 58,000 we lost or even the Million America killed, it was more. The movie is called "" We Were Soldiers "" and it depicts the true story as recalled by Lt. Col. Harold Moore and Joseph L. Galloway. The Viet-Nam conflicted had already been waging between the French Government and the Vietnamese people, before it became a U.S. problem. In 1965, in a place called 'The Valley of Death' a company of French soldiers were ambushed and massacred in that valley. In that same year, Lt. Col.Hal Moore, Sgt.Maj.Basil Plumley (Sam Elliott) and Maj.Crandall (Greg Kinnear) and his men are given the task of going to Viet-Nam and assessing the military capacity, veracity and fortitude of the Viet-Cong soldier. Despite being a Veteran combat soldier, Moore and his skilled Air Calvary arrive in Landing Zone Ray and are immediately engaged by a highly seasoned and well disciplined armed force. For the next three days, Moore and his men are attacked, surrounded and nearly wiped out by veteran commander Lt. Nguyen Huu An (Duong Don) who proves an intelligent and worthy opponent for the American Commander. Barry Pepper plays Joe Galloway a courageous Photographer who captures the dark, dramatic action and all it's savage brutality on film. This film is a solid well-acted and beautifully choreographed action film which displays both sides of the battle with gut-wrenching reality. Be prepared for War at it's most horrendous. The heart of this movie is the fact the director includes not only the war-zone at it's most bestial, but the heart-ripping sorrow of the Women who loved one's are being butchered while they receive a telegram informing them of their loss. This is not a film for the faint heart, but for anyone who's brave enough for a Real movie of the Viet-Nam War. *****",10.0,Anonymous,History
Nothing special,"Vietnam War films have always tried to capture the horrors of war, especially the personal horror of those involved.We Were Soldiers was somewhat of an enigma. On the one hand, it tried to be anti-war like most, if not all, Vietnam War films. However, at the same time, it was stupidly 'patriotic' to the point where it becomes just another pretentious American tripe. It was also extremely biased. Whereas films like Platoon showed the atrocities committed by both sides, We Were Soldiers has every American soldier with a halo above his head.Filled with cheesy lines and silly American gung-ho attitude, it's hard to take this film seriously and as a result, its message comes across very weakly (not that its message is very well developed or anything new). A highly predictable ending doesn't help things either.The scenes of Gibson's wife (played by Madeleine Stowe) back home, as an attempt to show the affects of the war on the families of the soldiers, were poor, underdeveloped and a bore.On the other hand, the fighting is strong and exhilarating. The battle of tactics between Mel Gibson and the Vietnamese leader was very interesting.A watchable film with one or two good performances, but nothing special.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Very gripping and intense depiction of war,"I was just born right before the Vietnam ""conflict"" started, so of course I have no personal recollection of events. But my mom's 1st cousin was a chopper pilot there, and my husband's Uncle also served in combat there. So I grew up hearing bits and pieces - although neither man would ever discuss it in detail.So I was very interested to see what I have heard to be a realistic account of one of the battles of Vietnam. Like Saving Private Ryan, and Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers left me with an awe and respect for all those men and women who have fought and died to give us all the freedoms we enjoy.I think what has always bothered me, is how I heard these Vietnam vets were treated that returned home. I heard my mother-in-law share how her brother was spat upon, called baby-killer and other horrible names. These were young men (boys, really) that had no choice but to go when they were drafted. It was ""kill or be killed"". At least since then, it appears the country has learned a lesson how to better treat returning soldiers from the Iraq war, irregardless of people's view of the war.What I like about this movie is that it appears they were purposely trying to avoid political commentary. Every film about Vietnam, from The Green Berets to Apocalypse Now, seems to have a political ax to grind. Lost in all the political rhetoric of these past films have been the men who actually fought and died. This film is a tribute to the courage of the men who fought and who died there. They were soldiers and they acted like it. One can argue all day long about whether we had any business in Vietnam. But I was pleased and moved to see a film honoring the too often forgotten or politicized soldiers. Those veterans deserve this honor. Thank you to all Vietnam veterans who have suffered greatly with so little thanks from our country.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Should have been like this...,"Here is a script.US President decides to kick some Commie a*se and sends loads of new troops into Nam. Pan to US Military Base where soldiers are being trained. Introduce diverse characters like Commanding Officer who is getting to middle age and not really sure he wants to be sent into battle again, but doesn't have a choice because he has to keep up appearances as well as think of his pension. Meanwhile, his wife of 20 years is having an affair with a young black lieutenant and neglects the kids. His Sergeant Major is a closet homosexual who vents his frustrations upon the new recruits he has to train. Several other soldiers wander round the perimeter, each with their own particular ghosts ¬ñ drugs, debts, relationship issues, fears and doubts.Send this bunch to Vietnam (minus the cheating wife who in the absence of the men tries to become Top Lady by bullying the other women into submission) before anybody really knew what or where it was. Headquarters mount a botched operation deep into hostile territory, based on outmoded tactics, hopelessly bungled intelligence and endemic ignorance of the enemy.Soldiers land in the jungle where ANV is waiting for them to let fly with all they've got. The raw US troops follow the tactical handbook that was written for a different war, a different place and a different enemy, and end up totally confused and badly positioned. Try to do their best in the ensuing chaos by seeking cover and lying low. Commanding Officer recovers from shock, slowly realises that this is a major balls-up and phones base to get his troops extracted ¬ñ permission denied. Fearsome AVN attacks follow one another during several days and nights, and by observing them the position of their base becomes clear. US artillery and air power is called in and coolly blasts the AVN headquarters to smithereens whilst the ground troops lick their wounds in their foxholes. AVN hurts badly, breaks off combat and retreats further into jungle. US choppers fly in and evacuate dead, wounded and survivors. Reporter who tries to take pictures of the bodies is beaten up out of sight.Back to base, later. Group of survivors from this ordeal get together and think about lost comrades. CO's wife weeps for dead black lover. One poor veteran OD's himself later that night. Commanding officer is mental wreck, drinks too much and hits wife who runs off with frightened kiddies.Cut to bright daylight scene where hundreds of dapper new US troops are waiting on airfield tarmac, embarking on planes to take them to Vietnam. Shards of patriotic speech by General are lost in the wind and noise. Commanding Officer watches from distance with bottle of whiskey in one hand and army revolver in other.

Didn't live up to the hype...,"I was so excited to see this movie. The trailer looked awesome. The reviews that the studio put on the ads made it seem fantastic, like another ""Braveheart"" or at the very least a ""Saving Private Ryan."" After all, Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson were both involved, and ""Braveheart,"" which they also worked on, is the most fantastic movie ever.This movie let me down. The battle scenes were decent, but the movie was a lot of fluff. There was nothing of substance. Sure, families are upset when a soldier dies, I know that, I'm not stupid. There is no need to dedicate half an hour of this movie to the wives walking door-to-door delivering telegrams to families of soldiers that died.I'm not saying the movie was horrible. It was a little better than an average movie, but with the hype and anticipation for it, it was a let down. There were too many characters to keep track of and to care about all of them (just like in ""Black Hawk Down""), so when one dies (I won't say who) you don't feel much for them. It doesn't have as big of a dramatic impact as the makers intended.If you saw this movie, I hope you didn't shell out 9 bucks for it.

"worth watching, but not particularly meaningful.","When I first heard about this movie my first thought was that Mel Gibson had made a big mistake here. Why star in yet another Vietnam war movie when so many had been done before? Not only that but, add to a genre already littered with great, great movies.Many people will totally disagree with me on this point but I feel that enough movies have been made about this war. I don't disagree with the overriding themes and lessons contained within movies which continue to be made about it - I just feel that most of the good films made already cover the various aspects of that war and that by continuing to make more movies about it in some way dilutes the effect they can potentially have.That aside I did enjoy this movie. It was visually impressive, certainly bringing the horror of the war and violence directly to the audience, and the action scenes (of which thankfully there were plenty) were all executed expertly.Mel Gibson's performance was fine, as was Sam Elliot's - even though his character is downgraded to little more than a ""tough as nails sergeant"" stereotype - and the look of the movie seemed to work well overall.It was the glossy parts of the movie (more akin to early Bruckheimer efforts) I found most dissatisfying.  Especially the Barry Pepper ""photography"" scene which I thought didn't fit in at all with the rest of the movie and, whilst well intended, ended up coming across tacky.The difficulty Randall Wallace faces here is that it is an action movie first and foremost and, as I've already said, when he concentrates on that the result is above average however when he tries to delve into moments of moral and human examination They just come off looking trite.  Especially when the onscreen ratio is overwhelming action 99% - moral message 1%Overall, whilst not as good as Black Hawk Down, well worth watching, but not particularly meaningful. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Square-jawed officers who weep at carnage and fresh-faced GIs who die too young,"Released in 2002, ""We Were Soldiers"" stars Mel Gibson as Col. Hal Moore who leads the first major battle between Americans and the North Vietnamese Army in The Battle of Ia Drang Valley over four days in mid-November, 1965. Sam Elliott costars as the seasoned NCO and Barry Pepper as a bold photographer while Madeleine Stowe appears as the Colonel's wife. Greg Kinnear is also on hand as a helicopter pilot while Keri Russell plays a soldier's wife.The movie is based on the book ""We Were Soldiers Once¬Ö and Young"" by Col. Moore and the aforementioned photographer, Joe Galloway. As such, ""We Were Soldiers"" is a straight-forward realistic depiction of the battle and the first film depiction where Moore claimed ""Hollywood finally got it right."" This reminds me of something someone I know who fought in Nam said: All the other films about the war from the late 70s to late 80s didn't strike him as the way it really was, but after seeing ""We Were Soldiers"" he said, ""That's the way it was.""Be that as it may, it doesn't make it as good as 1986' ""Platoon"" or 1979's ""Apocalypse Now."" The former is so great because the platoon in the story is a microcosm of many platoons and their experiences throughout the war, which might come across as ""too much"" because the filmmakers only have about 2 hours to tell the story and they have to jam a whole year of experiences into that time frame. Incredibly, ""Platoon"" fleshes-out no less than a dozen memorable characters with its grunt's-eye view of the conflict while telling a compelling story. By contrast, ""We Were Soldiers"" only presents about four memorable characters during the battle and, while it's a solid war flick, it simply isn't as compelling.As for ""Apocalypse Now,"" it's useless to compare the two because (1.) the original version of ""Apocalypse Now"" (as opposed to the horribly flawed ""Redux"") is a downright cinematic masterpiece; (2.) it's way more than just a war movie; and (3.) its theme is deeper than the conventional and patriotic portrayal of the realistic ""We Were Soldiers."" If you're not familiar with the theme of ""Apocalypse Now,"" it's basically this: Capt. Willard (Sheen) comes face-to-face with two Colonels during his mission up the river to assassinate the rogue Col. Kurtz. Both of the colonel's names start with 'K,' which is no accident. Col. Kilgore (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle and even feeds off it. The fact that he's a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning."" War is just another day to him so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there's no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he's part of the system and plays the game of war. Col. Kurtz (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It's horror itself and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can't have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard.""We Were Soldiers"" instead opts for a simple portrayal of the first major battle of the infamous war and the bravery & horror thereof. The story essentially proposes the question: What would happen if you drop 400 American soldiers into a valley crawling with 4000 soldiers of the NVA? The fighting is presented realistically, brutally and relatively coherently given the chaos of the intense conflict. Col. Moore truly loves his men and Gibson carries the movie with the peripheral help of Elliot and Barry Pepper. On top of this, the movie gives quite a bit of time to North Vietnamese side of the story, which enhances the story.Some people have rolled their eyes at the Morro Bay locations of central coastal, California, but if you look at Galloway's real-life pics of the battle they chose a great stand-in for the grassy valley. I guess people don't realize that Vietnam isn't all conventionally tropical jungle.The film runs a little overlong at 2 hours and 18 minutes and was shot in Morro Bay, Pasadena and Fort Hunter Liggett, California; as well as Fort Benning and Columbus, Georgia.GRADE: B- (6.5/10 Stars)",6.0,Anonymous,History

It actually hurts to watch this movie in certain moments.This movie is all the way up there with Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, The Deer Hunter and Platoon, with one big plus point: it is not politically motivated! It is shameful that the academy didn't find this film worthy of even one Oscar Nomination (I could think of at least 6 categories where it should have won an Oscar)...

I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it's a great story about the first time the Air Cav went in to action.What I thought was very interesting, was the way the film shows both sides of the battle.  What was going on from both perspectives.  I don't remember any other ...Nam movies doing that.  Maybe I haven't seen them all, but the ones I have, never showed what was going on in the tunnels during the battles.It was a positive movie about the War.  It didn't come out with all the BS that happened during the late 60'S.  It showed how these guys fought alongside each other.  Not against each other.It always seems to be the goal of every ...Nam film that comes out. Hollywood gives us pictures of American Troops against each other.  There is a little pushing and shoving between American pilots, but I got the feeling from this movie that We still thought We were going to win the War.It wasn't the kind of Vietnam War movie that ends leaving you wondering, ""What the Hell was that?""  There's a real story here and not a bunch of the depressing Hollywood liberal crap that they insist on putting in all of the films about this war.  This one stands above that.I felt proud about what these men did in that portion of the war.  I was too young to know what was going on back in the mid 60'S and early 70'S, but I am not unaware of what went on during those times now.  I was in a theatre that had some 25 year olds or teenagers in it.  They laughed at some points of this film and don't have a clue about history.  This war is old to them and they won't see what we do, until movies about our current campaign against terrorism comes out in the next year or so.Sure it's a graphic film, but what war flick isn't?

Read the book?  Don't bother watching the movie.,"Gen. Moore did an astounding job of documenting the battle in the Ia Drang. He gathered a lot of testimony from others who were there, and collated it all in the book ""We Were Soldiers Once... And Young.""  After reading this book, I should have known that the film would let me down.  Gen. Moore is proud that the movie is more accurate than almost any other previously released.  While that may be true, I feel that it has been butchered by the editing process.  The movie runs long already, but it needs to be a lot longer to really get the feel for it.  The deleted scenes that make it to the 'Special Features' section of the DVD add much to the film, and should be watched.  Even with these scenes, only a few characters are developed, and there is very little impact made to the viewer.  After experiencing both the book and the movie, I keep wondering if the benefits of awareness generated by Hollywood marketing outweigh the blood money made from creating an inadequate historical representation.  I guess if the movie helps people to understand the soldiers' position in war, then the benefits do outweigh the negatives.Bless all of our soldiers who have fought and died for us!",6.0,Anonymous,History
10 out of 10,"I have given this movie a 10 out of 10, not so much for it's entrainment value but because it says something very important about what it means to serve your country in the military. I'm the child of a career marine who served two tours of duty in Viet Nam. As someone who grew up living on bases I can tell you it says something very important. It seems that too many war movies display just the horror of war but fail to understand the human toll, on the servicemen and their families. My own father was very much like the character that Mel Gibson played in the movie. He saw himself as more than just a professional but as someone who was honorably serving his country. My own experience was going to a high school where almost all the student's fathers were serving overseas in Vietnam. On average once a week the principal would come down and ask the teacher to step out. This was followed by the teacher asking one of my classmates to accompany the principal down to the office to be met by their mother to find out that dad had been killed in action. There was always a feeling of the the heart stopping when the principal came to the door. I can appreciate the scene in the movie where the cab driver comes to the door to deliver the sad news. Excuse me for digressing, but the point that I'm trying to make is this movie really does come close to what it's really like to be a serviceman and what the families of servicemen have to endure. With the death toll in Iraq and Afghanistan over 5000, this movie is a real reminder of what the word sacrifice means.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"In addition to being historically interesting, is still a good war tape. ""We Were Soldiers"" is a reasonable work, whose speech adds nothing to the the Vietnam war subject","The heyday of Vietnam War movies was in the 1980s. Great modern classics like ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Platoon"" were made during this time. The intention was to try to face this embarrassing American intervention in a poor and distant Asian country where thousands of Americans were killed for free. These films about Vietnam became true catharsis for the soul of the nation, which from them began to better understand all the events that led the country to the worst military and political defeat in its history. After the boom in films about Vietnam, there was a very long period when no more productions were made about that conflict. Maybe that's why there was such a surprise when Mel Gibson announced this ""We Were Soldiers"", a script that returned to the jungles of Vietnam once again.The film, written and directed by Randall Wallace (screenwriter of the epic ""Braveheart"") and starring Australian Mel Gibson, is yet another film to return to the inevitable genre. ""We Were Soldiers"" recounts the Battle of Ia Drang, the first major engagement between US and North Vietnamese forces. Or rather, delve into the nearly 40 hours in which a group of 400 elite US soldiers were surrounded by a troop of 2,000 Vietnamese, on a hill adjacent to a field considered strategic for landing military helicopters. The basic situation generated in the plot - a small group of US soldiers is surrounded by thousands of enemies - already brings ""We Were Soldiers"" closer to the most successful war film of the 2001 season, ""Black Hawk Down"", by Ridley Scott. But that's just the beginning. The two films are actually twins. Both give little space to psychological action, preferring to show the carnage in a raw and impactful way. The pair also come to the exact same conclusion: when war is being fought, you're not fighting exactly for a country or a flag, but for yourself.Incidentally, it is necessary to point out a trend in contemporary films that try to denounce the sub-human condition of war. After Steven Spielberg ushered in cinematic ultraviolence in the opening of ""Saving Private Ryan"" in 1998, everyone decided to do the same - or worse. If the viewer has a weak stomach, therefore, it is better to stay away from ""We Were Soldiers"". The violence, in this case, borders on the grotesque. Although it doesn't have the hallucinatory montage of Ridley Scott's work and uses sound brilliantly, almost putting the viewer in the middle of the battle, the film exaggerates the rawness of some sequences.The traditional pride propagated in this type of film, of course, also shows up, although it is well disguised. The true subtext of the work seems to be a critique of US foreign policy. We Were Soldiers condemns US politicians and bureaucrats. He accuses them of arrogance and strategic blindness, when he shows them sending inexperienced troops to the front, who are unaware of the complicated geography of the territory. The objective of the film seems to be this: to show that the succession of mistakes that would lead to the North American defeat could already be perceived from the beginning of the conflict. Because not everything is perfect, US soldiers are always described as good guys, faithful to their wives, always willing to sacrifice for their closest colleague. So much kindness is nauseating, but that's exactly what the American viewer likes to hear: our people are still the best, our soldiers were all heroes and only lost the war because of the stupidity of politicians. The simplification of causes and consequences, after all, is the rule that prevails in Hollywood.Based on the book ""We Were Soldiers Once... and Young"", written by Colonel Hal Moore and journalist Joseph L. Galloway, the film was only partially faithful to the book and historical events. The final part, which shows a heroic attack by the Americans under Colonel Hal Moore that destroyed the reserve North Vietnamese regiment, ending the battle as an American victory (a fact the director noted in his commentary). Indeed, no heroic late-combat attacks are described in the book and the North Vietnamese forces were not destroyed. Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Huu An, the North Vietnamese commander, did not visit the X-Ray landing zone at the end of the battle, with fighting in the area continuing for another day after the withdrawal of Hal Moore's men at ZPH Albany. Despite differences from the book and changes from the actual story of the battle, Colonel Hal Moore claimed in a documentary included in the video versions that the film was the first ""to get it right"" with regards to the Vietnam War.On the other hand, Wallace's camera doesn't commit Ridley Scott's sin either. The experienced director of Blade Runner photographed the people of Somalia, in the neurotic ""Black Hawk in Danger"", as a bunch of hungry or corrupt ignorant people, the typical herd ready to be shot. Wallace's Vietnamese, on the other hand, fight an ethical war (does that exist?), fight only for survival and - surprise - they also have wives waiting at home. Anyway, the little time on the big screen given to Asians already testifies against the impartiality of the work. The undesirable pride resides in this detail, the imbalance of the script, which practically only focuses on the Vietnamese when they are at the front. Trying to make an effort to reflect like ""before Americans or Vietnamese, soldiers are always young people who didn't choose to be there fighting"", the film manages to propose several moments of interesting humanist observation, almost through the reflective bias of Behind the Red Line. Also drinking from the type of post-Platoon hyper-realistic staging (but, especially, after Saving Private Ryan, and why not say, post-Braveheart, a film in which director Wallace was the screenwriter), the film manages to stage some scenes absolutely impressive battle scenes, where it hits the viewer in full in order to make the act of war something deeply disgusting and desperate (recalling the realism of a Kippur, by Amos Gitai). The spectacle of cinema serves to show how much fear and loss of conscience lie behind the so-called ""patriotic heroism"".It is true that he is not such a dislocated character as the soundtrack, the slow motion and the heroic close-ups already indicate a whole other bias in the film. Even so, in the end, after such a parade of suffering and despair, it was to be expected less faith from the filmmaker himself in the figure of his hero. This one, however, proves unshakable. It's as if the film were telling us: ""War is wrong, it's absurd for men, and it's perfectly normal to feel fear and despair in it, which annuls everyone's humanity, but if you're going to be in that situation, nothing better than with a true colonel-hero of the brave American Army"". It is through him that an ending like ""the war ended a lot of people, but at least families like this man's can be proud of the hero they have at home"". In the same way that the well-worn characterization of the press as a bunch of vultures trying to live on the carrion of sacrificed soldier-heroes seems absolutely unnecessary. These patriotic passages and simplifications certainly take away much of the strength and even the seriousness of the highly poignant attempt at denunciation that the film raises (and especially strong due to the way in which it is often filmed). But if it is difficult to take it seriously, it is also not a reason for not recognizing its merits, and not taking advantage of some beautiful ideas, such as the portrait of the women who stayed at home in the ritual of receiving telegrams notifying the deaths of their husbands. Despite the melodramatic tone in some scenes, it is this type of idea that allows Wallace's film to achieve a minimum of permanence.The film lacks (and the ending is the biggest index of this) is the courage (or, pragmatically speaking, the practical impossibility as a Hollywood product) to take all that is intuited and felt here and there until the last consequences. Yes, because despite all this contextualization, this attempt to give scenic space to the ""two sides"", this condemnation of war, there is still in the film the presence of the ""Great American Hero"", of the common man-who-becomes -in-hero, the ultimate example of the ideal of courage above fear. This same classic model that was so oppressive in the cinema of the 1940s (when it could be John Wayne or Gary Cooper) as in the 1980s (Stallone or Chuck Norris), all of this is here in the character of Mel Gibson, who with his kindness, courage and unshakable correction, it clashes with everything else that is staged. Perfect as a family man, as a tutor, as a friend, as a superior, as a soldier, as an opponent, as a strategic mind, he is a true model of a human being who makes, by comparison, the others around him a bunch of weak and insufficient.With a budget of 75 million dollars, the film barely made 20 million at the American box office when it was released, proving two things: audiences were tired of the Vietnam theme and they really didn't want to receive a real ""moral lesson"" from an actor like Mel Gibson. Even so, here's the tip, because the film, in addition to being historically interesting, is still a good war tape. One gets the feeling that ""We Were Soldiers"" is a reasonable work at best, whose speech adds absolutely nothing to what we already know about Vietnam. It lacked charisma and energy - something that exists in the stupid ""Black Hawk Down"", no matter how absurd it commits - to unearth the film from the mass grave. No pun intended.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Supposed to be authentic?,"Mainly, this movie tries heavily to cash in on American patriotism. If you're into John Wayne like heroism and macho militarism this is definitely your flick. Should you expect a critical and reflective war movie ¬ñ be prepared.WWS is based on Moore's and Galloway's account of the Ia Drang battle, a book that is definitely worth a read. The movie is not true to the book, though. The script takes the main storyline, cannibalizes it by shuffling around some historical facts and anecdotes, pumps it up with clich√©s and macho gestures and adds some dramatic fiction for good measure including an ending, that manages to even depict the Americans as some sort of winners. This can hardly be called accurate. Then again, surely there even are people who regard Cecil B. DeMille's Ten Commandments as an authentic depiction of the Old Testament.The cinematography furthers the fictionalization of the battle by use of overly dramatized and effect loaded images. Still, the photography and the effects are good. Acting is mostly okay, apart from Gibsons rendition of Moore, which at times is almost hilariously grim and heroic.All in all a solid war-action flick with some but loose ties to a true story ¬ñ there are better ones. 2/10 for failed effort.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Inadequate film for its time,"Had We Were Soldiers been made 10 years or even 5 years ago it would have really resonated with me. But after Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Enemy at the Gates, and Black Hawk Down this movie really does not reveal much about war or human reactions to it. Instead it is an amalgam of the bloodiest scenes current technology will allow and gratuituous family time scenes which add little to the drama.I will admit that in spite of this that watching the film did affect me, but I believe that it had more to do with sitting directly behind a Vietnam Vet who throughout the film would turn to his wife and remark about how he remembered this or that and next to a West Point cadet who was told early on that the average life span of a 2nd Lt. in Vietnam was 15 minutes and was now watching that statistic come to life. But the film did not affect me, the serviceman's reactions to the film did.If you like Gibson and want to see him in a war film see Gallipoli, he was younger, less arrogant and seemed to care more about the soldier's experience. I like Gibson, but his actions at the West Point showing of the film definitely hinted that he was more interested in the box office success of the war film and less about the soldiers' story. I hope I am wrong about him and his attitudes, but I fear that I'm not.Not a bad war movie, but there are so many better.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Awesome movie about real men,"As an American I was touched by this movie and the courage of the men portrayed. The real Colonel Moore was present for the filming of the movie and was adamant about the movie portraying events as true to life as possible.  His wife really did hand out the Western Union telegrams to the other wives because the US Army at the time had not foreseen the eventual escalation of U.S. dead.  For the non-americans this movie offended, I can only say proudly this was an American movie about American heroes in what most Americans feel like was a tragic war that we wanted no part of. This movie was needed to give insight into the realities of the Vietnam War. I have 4 Vietnam War veterans in my family. All four saw combat either in the Marines or Army. Only one ever saw any drug use and he worked side by side with with a group known then simply as ""The Company"".   This movie is excellent and should be a must-see for every American Teenager. Mel may be an Aussie, but I would like to proudly point out he was born in New York.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Loved it,"""We Were Soldiers"" was not bad, earning a 7/10. The acting, particularly by Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper, brought authenticity to the soldiers' experiences. The music provided an emotional backdrop, and the casting felt fitting for its portrayal of real-life characters. Cinematography effectively captured the intensity of battle, while Randall Wallace's directing delivered a sense of realism. The writing portrayed the horrors and camaraderie of war well, but at times, it veered into clich√© territory. Its strength lies in its respectful depiction of soldiers' sacrifices and the harrowing battles they faced, yet it occasionally relied on conventional war film tropes, which might be seen as a weakness. Overall, 'We Were Soldiers' is a commendable war film that pays tribute to the valor of those who served but doesn't entirely break free from genre conventions.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Leadership 101,"Awesome film. I was skeptical of Mel Gibson playing an American hero at first---that is, until I saw the movie. Arguably, the best parts of the movie are when young officers are being trained as leaders not just officers by the moral centre of the movie, Lt. Colonel Hal Moore, who is played by Mel Gibson. There are two very good speeches in the film: No one gets left behind, and second, Using Helicopters in War. Moore's leadership in battle is also captivating as he exhorts his men to keep their composure under fire in numerous scenes. Truly an inspirational film of what it means to be a real leader in this age of anti-heroes. If you're feeling down and discouraged and are in need of an emotional lift, this is the film to see.",10.0,Anonymous,History
We Were Soldiers,"Mel Gibson (""Col. Moore"") takes charge of training for, and then execution of, a perilous operation in the Vietnamese highlands in 1965. We know from the start of the film how difficult that task is going to be - the previous French troops met with ruthless treatment at the hands of the N. V. A. And so ""Moore"" and his motivational deputy ""Crandall"" (Greg Kinnear) know that they are going to have their work cut out for them. Their mission is to combat an enemy with overwhelming superiority of numbers and try to capture and hold a mountain. Needless to say, their hosts are none too keen on that a plan and what ensues is a brutally depicted, bloody and gory, series of well photographed combat scenes that test the mettle of both sides as the body count mounts. There is a poignant angle added too, as back home we see the colonel's wife ""Julie"" (Madeleine Stowe) take responsibility for delivery of the letters that are sent to the families on the base intimating bad - even tragic - news to those left behind. Sam Elliott adds well some stoic discipline as ""Sgt. Maj. Plumley"" and Chris Klein's portrayal of the recent father ""Lt. Geoghegan"" also contributes a strong human angle to this story. Sadly, though, this is all way too long and though certainly potent at the start, that is washed away in a sea of repetition. What makes us sit up and take notice at the start becomes much less effective; the pyrotechnics lose their impressiveness a bit and to be honest, Gibson just hasn't the on-screen presence to carry this for 2¬º hours. It does emphasise just how modern - airborne, usually - warfare can provide smaller groups with greater superiority and as an example of the ghastliness and futility of war it is a worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,History
a breathtaking movie,"The biggest complaint about war movies is that they focus only on the battle, or violence and never on the circumstances surrounding it. Not so with this movie. ""We Were Soldiers"" is a super movie. The writers and director did an outstanding job of creating multiple plots and keeping them all together so that they help to make the film, as much as be a part of it.The were some great turns from actors who don't normally take part in this type of genre. Chris Klein, Kerri Russel, Barry Pepper, and the immortal Sam Elliot all put in great performances. Mel Gibson was great, as was to be expected. But it was really nice to see Greg Kinnear get a major action role. He puts in an electrifying performance as a helicopter pilot.The movie did a great job of making the battle real - creating feelings within myself as if i was on the battlefield. Overall, I rated it a 9/10. It probably won't win any awards, but it's a truly great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History

One more propaganda film..,"It is funny how in recent years, when one is leaving the cinema after having watched yet another Hollywood war movie, one gets the impression that the US army are a bunch of heroes who are always fighting for a good cause. No true criticism of the military seems to be allowed these days.One reason is probably because the army is so forthcoming in lending equipment to filmmakers but this of course makes prostitutes out of directors and producers, who are no longer free to make a judgment and draw the right conclusions. I fully understand that the US public is hungry for patriotic material to satisfy the feelings of national pride that are so strong these days. However, this can never be a reason for not viewing one`s own shortcomings in a critical light! To me, ""The Deer Hunter"" with Robert De Niro was what I would consider a really great (anti)war movie.The final scenes where the hunter decides to NOT shoot the deer, conveys the message ""live and let live"" instead of unloading all this b******t pathos when soldiers are saluting each other in the end..(this has almost become standard in most recent war movies). Where are the REAL humans in these films?

For fascists only,"You'd think that after ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" and ""Platoon,"" Hollywood had outgrown Vietnam War movies such as ""We Were Soldiers"" -- which resembles John Wayne's ""Green Berets"" and other simplistic, warmongering movies.""We Were Soldiers"" shows a nearly all-white cast of soldiers who are the straightest group of patriots ever in a platoon; hardly anyone smokes, let along does drugs or questions authority.Mel Gibson's heroic performance is preposterous. That this movie is based on a true story doesn't make him or it seem realistic. The women are overly made-up Barbie dolls. What a waste of the talent of Madeleine Stowe, who was so wonderful in ""Short Cuts.""There's no hint that the war was one of greatest moral and political debacles in U.S. history.

Great war action,"Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) is a proponent of the new Air Cavalry strategy. He's a smart insightful soldier who forms an elite force combining ground forces with helicopters. The war in Vietnam is in its opening stages. The movie starts with their formation back in the States. It climaxes when in 1965, Moore and his men engage the much larger North Vietnamese force in a small battlefield in the first battle of its kind.Based on Moore's book, the action is compelling and realistic. The home front story doesn't detract from the action. It's important to see Moore's home life. The battle doesn't demonize the enemy, and shows as much as reasonably expected of the opposition. There is a few characters that is allowed to have compelling story lines. Even though the battlefield can be confusing, the movie never is.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The battle in this film is so graphic that when i saw it in theaters i without lying can say i almost felt i was there. The acting was spectacular and portrayed the real life characters perfectly.

A Subterfuge of Political Correctness,"I enjoyed the resolve of Mel Gibson's character in this film and the fact that it celebrates one of the great U.S. victories in the field before the traitorous demonstrators ""back home"" took it upon themselves to put the handcuffs on our freedom fighters.  (They are squarely to blame for the fall of South Vietnam to the bloody Communists.)  Getting back to the film, I gave it 8 stars, but I was disappointed by the undercurrent of political correctness.  Three major instances stick out like a sore thumb, but remain unaddressed by others.  First, we have the united colors of Benetton represented in Moore's outfit, concerning which Moore gives a speech!  Was this historically accurate?  I doubt it.  Second, Barry Pepper's character plays a reporter who is disgusted by war.  I am a big fan of Barry's, but this character only succeeds in having us question the entire premise of this film.  His presence leaves us confused about who the real heroes are. Third, the NVA are presented with a human touch, as if they are morally equivalent to Joe Soldier.  This is ridiculous and sickening.  The North Vietnamese Army was the weapon of an evil Communist regime that would overrun South Vietnam, killing, raping, and torturing its kind inhabitants. Do we present Hitler's SS in a similar light?  Of course not, that would be anathema to the Hollywood Left.  Overall, this film is a good flag-waving epic marred by a few disturbing and utterly curious elements.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Rip-off For War Veterans,"When describing his hopes for the film ""Full Metal Jacket,"" (based on his war novel ""The Short-Timers""), author and Vietnam War veteran Gustav Hasford said, ""I didn't want to make another film that veterans are just going to go see and go, 'Oh wow, we've been ripped off again.'"" That description fits ""We Were Soldiers"" to a T. The film has no flexibility, or even a purpose to it. One long cliche full of time killing action and glory speeches. Mel Gibson's cheezy accent will make you chuckle, though. This film takes an utterly true story and cliches the life out of it. A script compiled of every worn out battle trick ever. ""We Were Soldiers"" almost unintentionally brings disrespect to war veterans. You can definitely afford to miss this screen garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,History

One of the More Accurate Vietnam War Movies,"Despite all of the complaining, and some it justified, you can't hide the fact that this is definitely one of the more accurate Vietnam war films based on a real-life battle. Yes, the climactic battle scene is pure Hollywood, and I myself was very disappointed by it, but overall the events as they are portrayed in the film follow the book quite nicely. As another reviewer pointed out, it could have been one of the all-time great war films, but it fell a bit short. I do disagree with reviewers who try to paint this film as pro-American propaganda and revisionist. It is simply a Vietnam war film about the bond between a commander and his men in the field, and it was very well done in that aspect. I don't remember a whole lot of dialogue in the script about who was right and who was wrong, or why we were there. It was all about survival in the face of a determined enemy. I also don't agree with the reviewer who stated that the LZ Albany ambush was avoided in order to paint a one-sided version of the battle, because that was a separate event that didn't involve Colonel Moore or his men. Involving other units would have meant a much bigger film in scope, even though I still think that it could have been handled well. The battle scenes were some of the best filmed. However, as I stated earlier, Hollywood inevitably stepped in right near the end, and that is why the film was flawed. A more realistic climax and ending would have been much better, and still satisfying. Hopefully, some day in the future a filmmaker will avoid Hollywood clich√©s and finally get it 100% right.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Relevant, necessary, and well-done among war movies","Oh boy, where do I begin?I guess the place to start is to talk war. War movies have been quite a ""fad"" lately, though I hope the reason for them is deeper than the word ""fad"" suggests. Still, the movies have for the most part been about World War II, a war in which there was at least a good sense of duty and of good versus evil. (The one major exception in recent war movies is Black Hawk Down, but even in Desert Storm, there was a fair sense of purpose.)Vietnam, however, was a whole different ballgame. The war was poorly justified, patriotism was all but extinct, and the only thing possibly more horrid than the bloody massacres of battle was the treatment of soldiers upon their return. In terms of cultural effect, Vietnam was quite the antithesis of those other wars.""We Were Soldiers"" does justice in describing this war, particularly in its earlier stages, better than any other film I've seen. It makes no bones about the fact that the entire situation was ill-advised, yet instead of pointing fingers in blame, it points out the heroes, the few whose characters shone through despite the situations, and it remembers the fallen. Though it takes place early in the war, before the counterculture and its so-called ""peace movements"" had been well-established, it still touches on the societal mistreatments that America was soon to bestow upon the very men it called to duty.I really don't feel I can describe the film in enough detail. Perhaps its ambiguity in areas are what make it such a strong testimony of our most ambiguous war. Still, I think I can safely say that the film contains many of the best points of other recent war movies. It tells a true story with as much reverence as Black Hawk Down. It relates the men at war to the people they left at home as well... rather, far better than Pearl Harbor (and without any Michael-Bay Camp, either). Perhaps most significantly, it prods at the questions of war itself as good as Saving Private Ryan.As for the cast... Mel continues to amaze with the same vein of acting as in Braveheart and The Patriot. He plays a man of many parts, and does so well... There's not a moment at home that you forget he's a soldier, nor a moment in the field you forget he's a husband and father. C'mon, it's Mel at his best, need I say more?Greg Kinnear again proves what an underrated actor he is. (I'm still mad that he didn't get an Oscar nod for his role in As Good As It Gets, though he was better IMO than Helen Hunt and ol' Jack, both of whom won trophies for their parts.) The guy could be an actor with body language alone. He can give a million lines of speech by a single stare, and when he does speak, he makes it count. I only wish he'd had more screen time.Chris Klein is never the greatest of actor, but one that can hold his own, and this is probably his best role yet.Sam Elliot played the tough guy, the man of few words who only takes orders from men who give good ones. It was a bit too much of the stereotypical old, grizzled soldier IMO, but he pulls it off great. Reminded me so much of Lee Marvin (a la Dirty Dozen) in this flick. (BTW, Hulk fans, I am now looking quite forward to his portrayal as Thunderbolt Ross.)The rest of the cast, Barry Pepper, the wives, the other soldiers, were also well cast. There were no holes in the performances. Really, the film was seamless as a whole. If there are any major points for complaint, I didn't catch them. A warning, though: Bring kleenex if you're often brought to tears by a film, and be quick to turn your head in some parts if you've got a soft stomach.Thumbs up. An eleven on a scale of ten.

The Definitive Vietnam Combat Story,"Unfortunately, ""We Were Soldiers"" followed ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Blackhawk Down.""  Otherwise, it would have enjoyed more than its mostly-ignored 5-6 month theater run before being released in video. Apparently the public had overdosed on realistic depictions of combat and war stories based on real events and people. This is the only reason I can imagine for the ""so-what?"" public reaction to this fine film.  First of all, Nam vets -- especially helicopter vets -- unanimously consider this to be the truest rendering of their war. Second, it's Mel Gibson's finest work; his delivery of Col. Moore's words, and the anguish reflected in his face following this watershed battle, move many of us to tears.  There are numerous other notable performances.  The inclusion of war's impact on wives and children made the women's roles significant, rather than cameos.  Furthermore, the depiction of the NVA as (1) highly motivated and well led and (2) as human beings with families presents a more balanced view of war.  Finally, the political messages are subtly delivered and do not detract from the main purpose of the movie, which is to tell the story of war.

I figured with Robin Williams in it, that it would be more a comedy sort of, but my wife turned it off during the part of the young troops in the truck headed for the front.This movie, ""We Were Soldiers...And Young"" fits in with what I know, what I experienced, and my feelings since. People have to remember, it was a movie, not a full blown documentary. You want a documentary, turn to PBS, you want a movie, turn to Hollywood. But as a movie, it should be seen today, by all.

The Most Vivid and Accurate Vietnam Film Ever!,"I have read the book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young and for Randall Wallace (Braveheart and The Patriot) to make this movie so close to the details of the book was remarkable. I recently heard an interview with Hal Moore (Mel Gibson's character), and he said that the movie made him remember that war so vividly because of its accuracy. He also said that Mel Gibson reminded him of himself so much in the movie. Hal Moore actually took Mel Gibson around to all the grave sites of his men and introduced Mel to every single one of the men that came home in a body bag. This movie disspells all the myths about Vietnam being a war for insane villainous soldiers, instead it looked at the true soldier of this war and showed the spirit and brotherhood that binded them together. Not to forget an incredible cast of newcomers and experienced actors. This film pays tribute to all the men that risked their lives for a war that was not fought for our flag or for our country. This war turned out to be a war for each other. Now the tagline on Black Hawk Down, ""Leave No Man Behind"", was emphasized much more in We Were Soldiers, because Hal Moore and Basil Plumley did not leave any man behind.

"I hate patriotism, war, violence, and ignorant comments, but I admire courage and leadership, which is what the film portrays.","Great commanders in history led from the front, and suffered thesame hardships as their soldiers, such as Alexander andCaesar...Moore was such a man. This film is about bravery andleadership in the face of abhorrent violence and fear. Thats it. Wesee it also from both sides, refreshingly, although the Vietnamesecommander was more of a tactician; probably the Vietnamesesaw the value in keeping such adept commanders alive, plus hehad the advantage of sheer numbers. We see the courage andfear also of the families left behind, and are reminded poignantlythat the Vietnamese were human, when we see the photograph ofthe brave bayonet charger's wife, and the respect the Vietnamesecommander showed for the ""enemy"" by leaving the small raggedAmerican flag behind. The image of the small dirty ragged flag ona tree stump foretells the doom and humiliation the Americans willeventually suffer, after years of meaningless slaughter. TheAmericans lost the war but killed 40 times men than they lost; thisis a tribute to the bravery and commitment of the Vietnamese. We see Moore standing tall and vulnerable because at that stagehe didn't care whether he lived or died, as he had lost so many ofhis men and felt severe guilt; like Alexander, pure luck kept himalive. After his honest prayer with the young soldier in the chapel,he adds a surprising comment about the Vietnamese having noGod etc; he remembers that he has to remain detached, or hecould never be an effective leader.",8.0,Anonymous,History

time for another american 'incident'?,"Yet another propaganda movie from hollywood. Is it time for the us to attack Iraq and they need more patriotism? This crappy movie, with shallow characters, stereotype view of women and total lack of self-criticism is really awful (and will probably win an oscar or two). You get to see how 'a man of his word'(gibson) leads his troops and his fine white christian family (stowe with kids).The movie claims to add a new dimension, showing what the women where thinking. This is done in about 10 minutes. They talk about their pregnancy, laundry (yes they do mention the racial problems with 3-4 sentences here) and their worry for their brave brave heroes who are ready to sacrifice everything (as every man should) for their country.Something the director ""forgets"" is that the war in Vietnam was ethnic cleansing. This is never mentioned, maybe it should? Maybe these ""heroes"" who fought for their country without thought where as wrong as the ss troops killing other ethnic groups without thought, ready to sacrifice all for their country?",1.0,Anonymous,History
A tribute to the American soldier,"This film reinforces a lesson that the current generation of Americans have forgotten. Specifically, war will always be with us and someone had better be good at it. Those who have never served believe that war is absurd and we can all be friends with a group hug; the truth couldn't be more different. The 1965 battle of the Ia Drang Valley was, by the standards of heroism, equal to the Alamo. Without ruining the film for you, suffice it to say a handful of American soldiers from the First Cavalry (Airmobile) are surrounded by thousands of North Vietnamese Regulars. Like all American soldiers, they are a disciplined lot, fight as they have been trained and they mean to win. The crucible of combat brings out the best in them. Thankfully, ""We Were Soldiers"" also illustrates the valor of the UH-1 helicopter pilots who were such an integral part of the Airmobile operations. The rest of us may be grateful that those who would attempt to put us to the sword will have to face men like these. There are a few errors, but not many. For instance, taxis didn't deliver death messages at Fort Benning. An Army chaplain and an officer came as a team to deliver the message. Likewise, reporters didn't just jump on a chopper and head for the front. There's a little more to it than that. But Hollywood has always played fast and loose with the facts and it's unlikely that anyone would take this seriously. Sooner or later, some knuckle head will refer to this as an anti-war movie. It's not. It's just a war movie. And a damned good one.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Intensity and Balance,"This is the story of the Battle of Ia Drang in Vietnam-- a 3-day battle at LZ (landing zone) X-Ray in which a little over 400 American soldiers faced 2000 of the men of the Army of North Vietnam and eked out a narrow victory. Terrible lessons were learned from this battle: the North Vietnamese learned that they could stand up to superior American firepower (helicopters, M-16s, artillery), and the Americans learned that one American with same could kill a significantly larger number of the enemy. This led to the ""meat-grinder"" theory of the war which caused so many American casualties, and an even greater number of Vietnamese deaths.Basing his movie very firmly on Gen. Hal Moore's and Joe Galloway's book ""We Were Soldiers Once and Young,"" Randall Wallace has produced what I think is the very finest movie on the Vietnam War ever.  In fact, I think it is even superior to the much ballyhooed Private Ryan.  The battle scenes are intense, relentless-- and these are balanced by looks back at the homefront where the wives left behind at Fort Benning are having to cope with the loss of their men.  There is a lot seen from the perspective of the North Vietnamese as well.  This is very unusual and quite refreshing in a war picture.All the performances are good-- no exceptions.  Sam Elliot's Sgt. Major Plumley is a gruff delight as he plays the ultimate career soldier.  Barry Pepper turns in a strong performance as the journalist Joe Galloway. As for Mel Gibson-- well, this may be the best performance he has ever given. Subtly underplaying his role as (then) Lt. Colonel Hal Moore, he still embodies leadership and experience, devotion to home, duty and his men.  And at the end of the battle it is through his eyes that you experience all the pain the loss of so many of his men has brought him.",10.0,Anonymous,History

That is what a true leader does in battle. The movie was by far the best war movie I have ever seen. As a member of the military myself I appreciate the lengths that Wallace as well as all the others guys went through to make this as real as possible.

Good movie if taken at face value.,"As a Canadian who has had many friends fight and some die in Vietnam, I am told that this movie was somewhat representative of what went on in Vietnam in the early months of fighting. This illustrates the American surprise at the caliber of fighting forces that the North Vietnamese possessed and it sent a message to the North Vietnamese that the Americans possessed some mechanical advantages they had not yet encountered when having to contend with helicopters and planes. The movie was not perfect and does not rate as high as Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down or even We Were Soldiers, but the message is sent clearly to the viewer and the graphic nature of hostilities is displayed throughout the battle.

A remarkably authentic portrayal of a war badly misunderstood,"As an individual who served stateside surrounded by much of the upheaval caused by individuals blindly and violently protesting our involvement in this war, I see much of the war in this film as was related to me through the eyes of comrades (primarily marines) who were actually there.Like many of his recent films, Mel Gibson pays close attention to the details of his craft. In this film he lifts the audience to understand the nobility of soldiers as expressed in their dedication to each other in the times of extremis. Clearly, as with all other wars, military leaders in Vietnam badly misjudged the quantity, quality and tactics of their opposition. Col Hal Moore received his orders and lead his men into the near disaster that they found themselves in. It is only through their dedication to each other (helicopter pilots included) that they were able to prevail in this most difficult engagement.This movie and its actors exquisitely capture the spirit of these men.

The dollar sign beats the bullet here,"I have never seen source material butchered this badly and disrespectfully as it was in this movie. If you read the book which was written by Gen. Hal Moore himself and chronicles his first hand experience with this particular battle and other soldier's stories from another battle taking place almost immediately after this one. I would like to point out that about 80% of the events in the movie are completely historically false, and merely sought to ""Hollywoodize"" the movie. Scenes where Mel Gibson is charging across the battlefield are complete BS! If Hal Moore had really done that he would have either been 1) killed promptly or if he had somehow survived 2) courtmarshaled immediately after the battle for abandoning his duties as a general. A general's place is at his command post commanding his troops. Hal Moore rarely left his post, but I guess Mel Gibson doesn't really give a damn, he just wants to act all dramatic.There were some good things about this movie, while once again not keeping in the line with the book, the stories involving the army wives were somewhat intriguing, but since the fates of their husbands were for the large part completely ""fictional"" affairs, they fell flat for me. My suggestion is, if you want to get inside the head of a soldier, a commander, and a worried spouse at home during Vietnam, read the book ""We Were Soldiers Once and Young"", if you don't want that, and you just want to see Mel Gibson in another mindless action movie, see this film.",1.0,Anonymous,History

His spirit and beliefs held them together during a crucial battle that tested all he was and showed what men are capable of with a firm belief in their leader and God.  It is brutal, but that is what war is.  It also gives a good view of the other side and how, inspite of politics, each had their beliefs and values to their country and their men.  Mel Gibson's character stated he would be first on the field and the last off - that no man be left behind.  He lived up to that, and for that, deserves the deepest respect of us all.

one of the best vietnam movies. period.,"As a former member of the US Army and a Drill Sergeant I saw much in the movie that seemed dead on accurate. I've seen comments here complaining about cliche`s, missing character development, and inaccurate terrain. Read the book is the first thing I'll say. Second, if you haven't been in the military and haven't seen combat then characterize your comments that way if you think something doesn't look real or is a cliche. I was blown away by how much they got right.But was the movie entertaining? Yes, it was nonstop action and one situation after another where you are thinking ""no way, people actually lived through that"".Lack of character development - how in the world can you say that? The beginning was your character development to get you interested in the characters. The scene where Snake#### pulls his revolver on the medivac pilot was character development (during the scene that caused his reaction I thought to myself ""man I would deck that medivac pilot next time I saw him""). Did they do it they way you liked? Maybe not, but not liking their character development isn't the same as none at all...I'm curious what cliche`s people are complaining about? The only one I might agree to is the image of the senior leaders standing tall as bullets whiz by. Did it happen that way? I don't know but if it did they were lucky eh? Otherwise, what else?

Negative reviewers just don't get it!,"I've seen lots of complaints about the use of war movie cliches, unnecessary heart-string tugging, etc.  The problem with this short-sightedness is the fact that the human condition IS a cliche.  It's sad that some people find it boring that yet another GI falls on a grenade or announces the birth of his child only to die very soon afterward.  One can be assured that many GI's have experienced these circumstances.  This was war, and these things happened.  Just because it's been portrayed before and ruins a film student's idea of great cinema, does not make it a bad film.The early years of the Vietnam war were a time of innocence.  It was generally thought that to allow the spread of communism was a threat to democracy in America and the rest of the free world.  It was noble to fight communism as a defense of our way of life.  At this point, America believed in the fight.  If Vietnam had been granted the right to self-rule after the end of WWII, this war would not have happened.  This movie gives us an idea of the American mindset of the time and the very brave men who fought in this early phase of the war.  Fast- forward to 1969 and the soldiers, as well as America, have a very different perspective.  There should be no comparisons to Platoon or Full Metal Jacket.Last but not least, no one has a right to comment on ""realism"" in a war movie unless they have been in battle themselves.

A Review,"I was skeptical at my first glance of ""We Were Soldiers"". I like Mel Gibson and Chris Klein, but after the disastrous ""Pearl Harbor"" I really wondered if I would enjoy writer/director Randall Wallace's film. I am happy to say, despite the sketchy, at times cliche filled dialogue, ""Soldiers"" is an excellent film.The movie gains unique ground dramatically when we are shown the soldiers of the film as family men, complete with wives and children. This unique little precursor to the war area of the film gave each of the major characters ample personality, something recent war films (like ""Black Hawk Down"") did not give.In fact, I have never felt such an emotional connection to the characters in a war film since ""Saving Private Ryan"".""Soldiers"" is a very powerful film, although no as powerful as ""Ryan"".Gibson, Kinnear, Klein, as well as Stowe and Russell, give excellent performances and the direction is well done. the only fault in the film lies in the dialogue, which is noticeably awkward at times.Overall, this is an excellent war film that deserves a spot right next to ""Ryan"" on your shelve. **** (out of four)",10.0,Anonymous,History

Sam Elliot is great also as I can name at least two Sergeant-Majors like him in personality if not in physical stature. The scenes from Ft. Benning made it personal to me cause I know those streets, this movie has to be used in various Army training courses in the future along with ""Black Hawk Down"".This movie brings the realness of battle and a ill-prepared war to life. During the movie Gibson tries to explain what war is, and he comes close, but it's simply the struggle of one gang/nation/clan/group of people/tyrant or whoever you want to say struggling with a like force or party for the purpose of imposing one's will on a population or territory, whether for the good or for the bad and what's good to you may be bad to the other and vice-versa.The North Vietnamese are portrayed honorably as Wallace did the Japanese in ""Pearl Harbor"". To me the battle scenes are graphic though not as bad as ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""BHD"". The story does show the horror of Willie Pete, and if the do-gooders of the world want something really bad banned from existence like land mines and napalm, then this is what should be banned as it's a terrible and disfiguring substance.The movie pays homage to those who took part in the Vietnam struggle and it's cause, it's too bad the leadership of that day did not understand how to do the business of war as was evident by Gibson's character being requested to go battle then taking men he had been training away from his unit and then when in the heat of battle requesting him to give a briefing back at the rear somewhere. Some men's name's should be spoken with shame and disgust. MacArthur, Patton, Marshall, Roosevelt, etc. surely rolled in their graves over how this war was conducted. Of course the same kind of leadership was present when ""BHD"" occurred too.Worth seeing just on the historical insight it provides.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Excellent, very moving film","This movie is just unbelievable.  The filmography, the makeup, the action, the drama, and the characters are just so awesome.  This is the best war movie yet.  The fear and terror of war that is presented to you is very moving, and many cried while in the theater.  Some of the events that take place are shocking and you would never have guessed that it would have happened that way.  This is a must see movie.

"The movie brought back so many memories, a great sadness that so many brave soldiers were not thanked.","The movie is not for the faint of heart, but it is an accurate account of the events as we lived them.  This movie is especially timely after Sept. 11th.  A great reminder that the military should be allowed to do what it is paid to do.  The Country doesn't have to agree, but we do have to treat our soldiers with respect, they are doing what we have asked of them.

Inspiring dramatization of a true story. A case study of great leadership.,"The movie centers around the events that transpired at la Drang Valley (""The Valley of Death"") in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam in 1965. The battle at Landing Zone (LZ) X-Ray was the first significant engagement between U.S. forces and North Vietnamese Regulars (NVA). Approximately 400 members of the 7th Regiment, 1st Calvary Division (Custer's Regiment) found themselves confronting 2000 highly motivated  NVA regulars who were battle hardened from the French-Indochina War. It was the early days of Air Cavalry when the helicopter assumed its troop carrying, combat role.Mel Gibson played the role of LTC Hal Moore and Sam Elliot the role of his Sergeant Major. Both were magnificient. Gibson turns in another sterling performance worthy of an oscar. As a veteran, I was particularly impressed by Elliot's performance as a Sergeant Major. He captured the attitude and demeanor of the senior NCO perfectly. All of the performances were an outstanding and inspiring portrayal of courage and dedication to duty. Like the movie ""Gettysburg"", ""We Were Soldiers"" is a case study in leadership.The film also focuses on the families of the men who fought there and the effects of war on those serving at the home front. Similarly, it focuses on the human side of the enemy and acknowledges their bravey and suffering as well. This film is a ""must see"" and will, no doubt, gather a great deal of attention at the Academy Awards.",10.0,Anonymous,History

What the hell were they thinking?,"Actually, I don't even know where to start¬Ö This is without any doubts one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen.. I had great expectations, I was looking forward to see this movie, damn' I even checked the IMDB ratingThe movie starts with the ordinary `We are proud American soldiers ready to die for our country' crap. Every soldier is a hero, a perfect husband and a loving father with a great family living in a nice house. The first 45 minutes are a serious version of The Truman Show. And yes¬Ö you'll see crying children asking daddie `What is war?'.. and yes you'll see the badass old veteran being harsh against the young soldiers.. and yes surprisingly you'll also see a young soldier that is deeply in love with his wife and wonders if ""the war is right or not""..Unfortunately the first 45 minutes are the best part of the movie. It seems that after the soldiers arrive in Vietnam, the director stopped using the manuscript and started to improvise the whole movie. The rest of the movie is a huge and brutal orgy in the exchange of fire between Americans and Vietcong. The problem is that the war part of the movie is so crappy made that sometimes I couldn't believe my eyes that none of the people involved in the movie, said `Guys, this is bad¬Ö!'.The most annoying thing is probably how unrealistic the fire fights actually are. Most of the Vietcong soldiers have one mission ¬ñ to run towards the Americans and start shooting only within 10 meter range. It's like playing a badly programmed computer game with non-existent enemy AI. Another annoying thing is that classical `Rambo-syndrome'. The `less important' American soldiers are dying all over the place. The bullets are hitting the ground just a few inches from the main characters but are they hiding and taking cover? Of course not¬Ö They standing in the middle of the action and kill every bad guy they spot..Don't expect the unexpected in this film. Every time a soldier tries to go back and pick up a wounded team mate, he will die. Every time someone dies, he will always have enough time to say `Tell my wife I love her' before he closes his eyes. The list of complains could go on foreverAnd I probably shouldn't even mention the incident with the photographer's camera which first is shot out of his hands and later magically picked up hanging on a tree.

Old fashioned and modern at the same time,"This very good Vietnam war movie about the first major conflict between North Vietnamese and U.S. troops is old fashioned in some ways and modern in some ways. It turns out to have the best aspects of being both old fashioned and modern.It's old fashioned in it's patriotic heroism of the characters and that the soldiers are too good looking. Chris Klein plays a brave hero, Greg Kinnear a brave helicopter pilot and of course Mel Gibson is the religious and dedicated Colonel in charge. Watching this movie in 2014 again it's quite amusing to see Jon Hamm and Taylor Momsen in a supporting roles. There is no political agenda here about being in a wrong war etc. It's about the heroism of the soldiers not whether they were on the right side or not.It's modern in the realism of the well choreographed battle scenes and graphic injuries. But it's not as gross as Saving Private Ryan. Also it's sympathetic and unbiased towards both sides Vietnamese and U.S. It actually is quite a clear depiction of the overall battle instead of a confusing mess that some war movies are. There is a good setup of characters prior to the battle and you can clearly see who lives and dies.There are some faults. The filming location & vegetation didn't look like Vietnam at all. Couldn't they have planted some more suitable trees here and there? Poor Madeline Stowe as the dutiful military wife, probably the most beautiful actress of her generation did something to her lips that made her look strange for a few movies. Thank goodness the cosmetic procedures have settled down since. And what is wrong with that crazy long hair? It's a good solid war movie that's moving without being preachy and exciting without being too violent.",10.0,Anonymous,History
mel gibson at his absolute best,"Mel Gibson has had a fairly distinguished career in war films, Gallipoli, Braveheart, The Patriot, and recently, We Were Soldiers.  This film is right on so many levels.  I felt the men's emotions, which are often left out in the past Vietnam ""classics"".  These soldiers were portrayed as heroic, rather than stoned, cruel, and violent, as they are portrayed in many other movies in the past.  These men truly have something on their minds rather than who should be ""fragged"" next.  In my opinion, this may be Mel Gibson's best movie ever, and one of the best Vietnam movies of all time.  It was much better than Platoon, a movie whose characters I could have cared less about.  We Were Soldiers was not only one of the best Vietnam movies ever made, it is easily one of the top ten war movies since 1990.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Moore, as played by Mel Gibson, holds off an attack by several thousand North Vietnamese.

Graphic war scenes but inert story,"This fact based drama stars Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore. He has gathered a force of 400 troopers and with aerial support they land in the Ia Drang Valley of north Vietnam in November 1965. It is the first major battle of the Vietnam War.The US 7th Air Cavalry are surrounded by over 2000 enemy soldiers and they engage in a bloody battle to break through the North Vietnamese lines.Back home the loved ones of the soldiers get news of what has been taking place. Moore needs to live up to the promise to his soldiers. ""I will leave no man behind...dead or alive. We will all come home together.""Randall Wallace who wrote Braveheart reunited with Mel Gibson for We Were Soldiers. This time Wallace also directs and the war scenes are directly influenced by Saving Private Ryan. It is bloody and graphic.However the story is pedestrian. When the action shifts to the family back home it becomes saccharine and even frankly silly as Moore's wife delivers letters to soldiers wives telling them that their husbands have died.The big explosions are done well. The story even if it is true does not compare with Platoon or Apocalypse Now. The characters are two dimensional, they are stock characters that could had arrived from any multitude of war films.Ironically, Gibson directed a better war film with Hacksaw Ridge.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Outstanding movie,"This movie is easily near the top of my list of favorites. Having been through some of it myself, I can tell you this movie is used in US military training as an example of leadership. Until you've sat in a theatre with 350 other people, all in BDUs, who are holding back tears at the end of the movie and who feel, to a man, the importance of the events and people depicted, you have not fully experienced the full effect of this film. If you haven't already done so, I strongly suggest you go out and by General Moore's book ""We Were Soldiers Once... and Young"" and get it straight from the men that were on the ground in the La Drang Valley. This movie is unique in that one of their stated goals was to get it as right as possible and never sacrifice realism for artistic license. If you haven't watched it, rent it. Be warned that it is realistic, and therefore bloody. If you have watched it, read the book, you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,History
We Were the Brave Soldiers Who Walked Through The Valley of Death,"This is one hell of a great movie. This movie should be shown to history classes in schools and colleges--minus a few curse words. It shows how real, rough and deadly war is. Gibson has really outdone himself in this one. I can't imagine this not getting an academy award. But even if they elites do decide to blackball or ignore this one--which I don't think they be able to do--considering it's already done over 40.8 million in only it's first 10 days. And the word will spread about what a great movie this is. I have yet to speak to anyone whose seen the movie who didn't like it. It's a shame Hollywood can't make more great and accurate movies about History like this one. Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, and even down to the who played the coward were great in their roles. Kinnear was so good as Crandell and deserves an Oscar for best supporting actor. The women who played the wives were great in their roles as well.

"Excellent, Must See","This is easily the best motion picture I've seen in a long time. To anyone who has never truly understood the phrase `War is Hell', this movie will explain it to you. In Saving Private Ryan, Hollywood used a lot of gore in the opening scenes, more for shock value than for plot. The blood in this movie is obviously a fire engine red paint. This movie doesn't need or want shock value. Several scenes are like watching friends run through a hailstorm of high velocity razor blades, and in the end you truly understand the price of freedom. As you read this, understand that our country is once again at war. Freedom only accepts one coin as payment, and the price is indeed high. I won't tell you who lives and who doesn't, but I will tell you that the movie ends with the names of the men who died defending us.

Granted, maybe there were a few men like the ones in Platoon, but if so, they were an extremely small (almost microscopic) minority. This film has a great cast, a good script (although too much artistic licensing went into it), sympathetic characters, incredible combat sequences, and is almost 100% historically accurate. It's a true masterpiece (which would make it the opposite of the God-awful monstrosity Platoon). Not one of the top 10 movies ever, but probably one of the top 50 (in my opinion).

Perhaps a classic,"Let us not forget that at some level, this is a great action flick: it promises action, delivers action, some of the most harrowing action ever captured on film. The action is clear, understandable, chaotic and unpredictable...... and magnificently filmed. The cinematography is aptly beautiful, without the (arguably) annoyingly self-conscious beauties of Thin Red Line, but still beautiful (e.g. whenever helicopters took to the sky).Over and beyond, this is a very moving, very sad film. The loyalty of the men to each other is deep and meaningful. They were mostly conscripts; Vietnam was not even a big war yet in the American consciousness (1965). One can already sense the ambiguities and pitfalls of the disgraceful policy and horrible tragedy Vietnam would eventually become. The only cause these soldiers truly understood was the personal need to fight so as to defend each other in extremely perilous circumstances which they neither comprehended nor had chosen. They were soldiers.  Magnificent film.Mel Gibson gives the performance of his life and more so than by just avoiding the Mel Gibson star turn and for once creating character. Greg Kinnear shows potential as a wonderful action hero. Chris Kline is quietly strong and touching. The music score is magnificent and ingeniously integrated with the actual sounds of the film narrative... yes it is calculated to pull at your heart-strings, and it does...... masterfully.This is a must-see film, one that could become a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"""Duty, Honor, and Country"" are no longer mere words, but a manner of life to many a fine person.","In a very timely and appropriate manner, Randall Wallace, in collaboration with Mel Gibson has once again (Bravehart) reinforced a deep and profound sense of ""Duty, Honor, and Country"" to the American people. This film depicts the very real idealism of some who served during the tumultuous Vietnam War, and their commitment to their oneness as a unit, as a cadre, and as brothers under fire. Not merely content to demonstrate this strength of being amongst combatants, this film shows with clarity and heart wrenching dignity, the steadfast love of the wives for their men who fought and for many, did not return. Truly an inspiring movie that does not glorify the concept of war, but the character of the men and women who are asked to engage an enemy on the battlefield and do so with unfailing devotion.",10.0,Anonymous,History
We Were Cliched and Written Poorly,"This movie reeks of cliches and historical fantasy. Mel Gibson hams it up as the good Christian colonel who loves his men like his own sons, and apparently is untouchable by bullets or scratches despite wandering into heavy firefights. We also have several other characters like a young father, a grumpy stern CO, the outcast soldier, and so on. You know, typical cliched characters you'd have seen in previous war movies (the absolute worst has to come from Wallace's poor portrayal of Blacks). As a result of this, I felt no pity for them. They weren't believable so how I can show emotion, I ask you?The basic plot behind the movie is this... American soldiers are sent mindlessly into a valley for no explainable reason so they can fight X-number of NVA. They are indeed outnumbered and so the contest of wits between Mel Gibson's blue eyes versus the NV leader begins. I'm pretty sure Wallace was trying to get this whole setup out of the way as quickly as possible so he can really bring WAR onto the big screen. Now when I say he brings it, he really brings war. His production crew must have had a field day trying to drum up every possible way a soldier can die in that battle. The firefights themselves were pretty decent and accurate portrayals although some of the scenes in the movie were questionable and downright obscene (the search for the missing platoon was fictitious and how the Americans drove the NVA from the hills was also fictitious).No only was the movie cliched, and poorly written, but I should also add We Were Boring. Check the History Channel and see the interviews of the REAL soldiers (they didn't like the Hollywood-ized version either) from that battle to get the REAL events of the battle, or read the book.Thumbs down.",1.0,Anonymous,History
2nd Best Vietnam Movie Ever,"I don't know why I can't give this film a ""10"". There is simply nothing wrong with this film . It's loosely based on history of Lt.

It is true that their first mission was to be dropped into the ""Valley of Death"", not knowing that 365 men were being sent straight into a full division of 4,000 North Vietnamese troops. It is a story so well written, that it captures sentimentality, heroisn, brutality, and survival in perfect order. Mel Gibson is stupendous as Col. Smith. And Sam Eliot is, well, Sam Eliot. Painstaking casting, with each supporting actor adding his own personality and enhancing the film. Brilliant direction and camera work.

We Are Shameful (2023),"Check this out, a nerdy Vietcong carrying AK-47 fixed with bayonet charges toward the CO, Col. Moore (Mel Gibson), while nobody is aware, guess what? That VC chooses not to fire point-blank at the CO, instead he keeps shouting and running into the enemies like a ninja with death wish, hoping to stab the CO at the back. Are we to believe it really happens in a real battle? Anyway, next thing you know is the colonel turns around with a lightning reflex and just blows the VC ninja clown brains out, with one freaking shot. This hilarious scene is an insult to anyone who has a brain cell, thus warrants the movie one solid star.In short, a timely propaganda movie for kick-starting the invasion of Afghanistan in 2002. Like what Col. Moore explains to his little daughter in the movie, the US soldiers are going to kill the 'enemies' who kill other people in another country over some twelve thousand miles away. And who is actually defending their home country? Right. Now after twenty years, the superheros have retreated from Afghanistan like Saigon in the Vietnam War, Taliban is now ruling their own country. What have we learned? Probably nothing.

The goodbye's to their wives wasn't over done and scenes where the women receive their telegrams is justifiably a tear jerker.Finally, I appreciate the films theme of being a thank you to vietnam vets, in that it didn't portray them as druggies and baby killers, but as true patriots that loved their fellow soldier.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One Of My Favourite Mel Gibson Performances,"We Were Soldiers (2002)Plot In A Paragraph: Focusing on the Battle of Ia Drang on November 14, 1965. It is based on the book We Were Soldiers Once¬Ö And Young by Lieutenant General (Ret.) Hal Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway, both of whom were at the battle.This is quite simply one of my favourite war movies, Gibson's performance is the core of the movie, and is one of his best performances. I love his reaction to a certain characters death, almost no words except ""He died keeping my promise"" and pure raw emotion. Chris Klein gives the performance of his career, Sam Elliot is his usual brilliant self, uttering fine great dialogue, whilst Madeline Stowe, Greg Kinnear Barry Pepper and Kerri Russell all of stellar support. There are some strong female performances featured here, not commonly found in a war movie!! This is brilliantly shot, directed and scored.It does have a few clich√© moments, but it's hard to criticise a movie for something so little, when it gets so much right.For some reason, audiences didn't flock to this one, it only grossed $78 million at the domestic box office, to end 2002 as the 34th highest grossing movie of the year. Which for a Gibson led movie, was pretty low for the time.Gibson is truly a great actor, and hopefully he can sort his personal problems and demons out, because as we all know Hollywood loves comebacks.",8.0,Anonymous,History
We Were Soldiers,"We Were Soldiers is an action pack movie that is a little different from most war movies. Instead of focusing on just the battles surrounding two ermines of different countries, We Were Soldiers focus on all aspect of the war. The main theme concentrates on the toll that war takes on not only the solders of both sides, but also the families the solders are attached to. The movie describes the first major battle of the Vietnam War and how it affected the soldiers and their families.Lt. Col. Hal Moore is call up to take charge of a new plan developed by the United States. This new plan will allow troops to be flown in and out of battle quickly by helicopters. Lt. Moore embraces this challenge and trains his men hard so they will be prepared for battle. Once training was finished, the men headed to a battle zone that was called The Valley of Death. This battle became the first major battle in a war known as the Vietnam War. The movie concentrates not on just the battle itself, but how the soldiers and their families were affected by war. The fighting scenes focus on how the solders on both side felts as fierce fighting was going on with each other. At times they were brave and other time they became scared to death. While this intense battle is going on, the wife's back on the home front are also taking a beating by hearing about the death of their husbands. At this time Julie Moore (Lt. Moore wife) takes charge in contacting the other wife's once their husbands have been killed. Julie Moore stays strong throughout the whole time and kept the other wife's together and helps them with their problems.Lt. Moore and his men are out number five to one by the Vietnam solders, so they are hanging on to their lines by a thread. Maj. Bruce Crandall is one of the helicopter pilots who put his own life at risk in order to help the solders on the ground survive. Maj. Crandall provides courage for the other pilots as they continue to bring in supply and more solders. Without the support of these pilots, the ground troops would not have survived.The movie special sound affect and lighting enhances the overall quality of this film. The fighting scenes produce bullets flying by and explosions in the back ground that gives you a feeling as being part of the movie. Scenes where the solders are laying in pitch darkness give you a feeling of uncertainty just as the solders would feel.Over all I believe We Were Solders is an excellent movie that just does not detail the issues of war, but it demonstrates all effect of war and the people it hurts. Other movies such as Rambo mainly isolates on the action packed fighting scenes and does not give much detail on anything else. We Were Solders show how much courage the solders of both side gave in order to make their countries proud. At the end of this historic battle, both sides realize the death and destruction this war is going to cause.",8.0,Anonymous,History
We Were Swamped With Horrible Movies After 9/11 (*NO SPOILERS*),"This being one of them. Honestly, if this is your interpretation of a good film, there are two possible answers: 1) You have never seen a good film or 2) You are dumb. There's really no way around this, and I'm sorry if you happen to be dumb (and extra sorry if you've never seen a good film). No, I'm not saying every film must be a Fellini masterpiece - not at all. There are plenty of terrific popcorn flicks. However, this is not one of them. Aside from probably realistic action sequences (I can't say, I've never been in a war), this film fails on all levels. The script is embarrassingly lousy, the acting (with minor exceptions) amateurish, and the film seemingly goes out of its way to depict a true story inaccurately. If I'm wrong, please correct me, but I'm gonna take a stab at this and say... Opposed to what the film would have you believe, not every American, whom this story concerned, was a wholly good and moral person. I mean, for god's sake, all people have faults. If you're going to so painstakingly try to present this as a true story, at least attempt to portray these people as real human beings. But like I said, there can be wonderful popcorn flicks. However, nothing in this film comes off as sincere. It all comes off as forced and cheesy (but not in the enjoyable campy Star Wars manner). This makes the film wholly unenjoyable, even at a mindless level, unless ALL you want is to see lots of people get shot. And if that's all you really want out of a film, well, there's nothing I can really say to you except ""don't breed."" Skip this one. If you want a Vietnam War film, go with Platoon, Apocalypse Now, or Full Metal Jacket. If you want an action film with lots of violence, go with Battle Royale, The Matrix Reloaded, or virtually any anime.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Moving Tribute To Vietnam Vets.,"I found this film to be a very moving tribute to those who laid their lives on the line for the USA and, infact, the overall fight against communism in the 1960's and 1970's in Vietnam. Many, many, aspects can be put into the equation of trying to understand the Vietnam war. I thought the film dealt with several of these very well. I was impressed with how it focused not just on the men, but also their families at home. The comradeship in such a situation, but also the death, injury and destruction, brings home the horror of the Vietnam conflict. I hope this film inspires the American population today to give thanks to those who fought for them during that dark time. I strongly recommend you see this film, especially if you are interested in the conflict - or even if you know little about it. A word of warning though - the violence is very graphic (more so than Saving Private Ryan, for example).",10.0,Anonymous,History
Puts a very human face on Vietnam...,"I was surprised when I viewed We Were Soldiers.  I went in expecting a flag-waving, purely American epic like Randall Wallace's previous film, Pearl Harbor.  This was not the case.  Wallace's screenplay and direction show the emotion and determination of both the American troops and the Vietnamese.  These men on both sides believed in what they were fighting for.  I also liked the character development in the first third of the film. By getting to know these characters in their personal lives we as the audience feel for them on the battlefield.  This movie, unlike other recent war films such as Black Hawk Down, gives the audience characters that they actually care about.  Although the action was not as horrific and fast-paced as other recent films in this genre, We Were Soldiers compensates by giving us a real story with real characters.  This film is the best Vietnam war movie since Platoon, the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan, and the best movie so far in 2002.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Fan-Flippin-Tastic!,"This is one the greatest war movies I have ever seen!!!  Second only to Saving Private Ryan in my opinion.  It is a wonderful story of both the actual first American battle of the Vietnam war and the soldiers who fought it.  It wasgraphic, as the modern war film often is, but I don't think it was overdone. Just a portrayal of the event it is depicting.  I am not much of a sappy guy....but I REALLY cried at the end.   I HIGHLY recommend watching this film.Steve Stroud",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Crude, pompous, ridiculous and the worst movie of the year","Please remove the pen or keyboard from Randall Wallace's hands so that he may never make us endure his awful excuse of screenwriting. He got away with Braveheart thanks to Mel Gibson directing but since then has revealed himself to be as crude as the worst of them.  Mr Wallace needs to look at 1) learning to write subtext, 2) learning to avoid exposition, and 3) research the historical facts you're writing about.  Furthermore, as a director, for god's sake give the audience some credit and avoid the corny sentiment.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Outstanding,"Having watched all those other movies that people try to compare it to, I believe is grossly unfair. Saving Private Ryan is not what I would call a classical war movie (except for the end). This is a great example of what battle looks like and the directors did a great job in portraying a BATTLE not a political agenda. This has to be among one of the top 5 war movies I've ever seen. It isn't about 1.5 hours of training and 45 minutes of war (such as Full Metal Jacket) or a platoon running around looking for something to do (Platoon) or a Ranger Squad looking for one guy (Saving Private Ryan). This is a GREAT film about the grotesque consequences of war with the inept intervention of politicians and congressmen. Great film, with round characters and great story line. Then again, why does the storyline matter, it really happened this way, why change the events that man had to go through for a ""better"" film. And it seems that the only reason Europeans didn't like this movie as much as Saving Private Ryan is probably because it doesn't have the U.S saving Europe from tyrannical idiots, again! Watch this movie if at all possible, great flick.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Engaging, factual and engrossing!  Excellent drama.","700+ people have taken the time to review this before me so i won't delve into the plot. Obviously a war film, Vietnam war. Just spent an engrossing 5 hours watching this. The film is only just over 2 hours, but i had to go out to do some shopping, in between the ironing and pause it whenever my daughter entered the room (not advisable for U18's). After the first 10 min, it had me hooked, and did not let go until the credits started rolling! Non biased, tried to tell it from both sides about the capture of a specific landmark. Absolutely not a bad accompaniment to the dreaded ironing chore. Now i am supposed to make up 10 lines to complete this review so here goes the filler. Mel is an utterly believable soldier as is his wife. Credit the cast and direction, I have watched many a film where i remember during the film that these are just acting, and this is just pretend.

Trouble sleeping,"I find that people describing Mel Gibson as the ""hero"" in this one, in the mold of John Wayne is just wrong. This movie in my eyes had no heroes and it made me sick to the stomach, which I haven't felt in a long long time. Both sides are depicted as men fighting in a war that in itself only meant something to one side, the Vietnamese, but where everyone fights because they have to, to survive. In a normal warmovie, say Germany vs. US in WWII, we don't see the face of the enemy, but only the Hurrah!!! Brave, Brave American soldierrrrr. This movie shows that both sides in a war have families, and that they are all human. Wars are fought because ""clever men"" covet one thing or another, be it land, oil or in a current case to get a war named after him because someone stole his fathers thunder.I have just watched this movie, and am now going home to meditate to rid my mind of the gore which seemed all to realistic to me.

A great book/story... an average movie.,"Just saw this movie in a sneak preview and wasn't expecting much as I sat in the theater.  Randall Wallace is an average screenwriter/filmmaker at best. The ""Pearl Harbor"" screenplay bordered on silly and ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" was a dull Muskateer popcorn flick.""We Were Soldiers,"" based on the excellent book by Col. Hal Moore, etc. about the first major battle of the Vietnam War (Nov. 1965), is another average war movie that rests on cliche, tin-ear dialog and ham-fisted, patriotism.  The movie tries so hard to be ""great"" and ""powerful"" that instead of presenting this amazing story and earning your respect and admiration -- as all truly great films do; the filmmaker demands and tries to force that respect -- he fails.The battle scenes are graphic, but not realistic.  In nearly every shot of battle the viewer can ""see-the-man-behind-the-curtain"" and spot the hollywood-ism of it all.  Where Spielberg/Hanks suceeded with ""SPR"" and ""Band of Brothers,"" Wallace just gets by.  The blood effects in the film look obviously fake, it's too purple/orange and flows like Karo syrup, pulling the viewer out of the movie.  The pacing is uneven and emotional moments wasted when they are followed by confusing editing/pacing.  Scenes of the ""commanders"" in Saigon fall from the sky it seems and add nothing but on-the-nose exposition.""We Were Soldiers"" Is a missed opportunity from start to finish and it's a shame Wallace didn't have the chops to give the story the film treatment it deserves.  Go rent/watch ""Platoon"" instead.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Greatest war movie in a while!,"I first must say that I am a big Mel Gibson fan. I really have enjoyed his other movies and was expecting to enjoy this one, even though I'd heard good and bad about it. I went into the theater and was shocked at how good it was. This was a topic that has been avoided for far too long and Vietnam should be brought up. We should not shed light on the corrupt politics that needlessly slaughtered 58,000 boys for no lasting gain, but on the bravery and courage of the men who fought. These boys fought because their country asked them to, and they did it bravely and honorably. The movie is the best yet which shows the story of the men who fought and died against almost impossible odds for the sake of their country. I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
An old-fashioned war movie with all the strengths and failings of the genre.,"We Were Soldiers is based on the true story of the first major battle between American units and the North Vietnamese army. Mel Gibson plays Col. Hal Moore, the man tasked with leading the 7th Air Cavalry. This was the first battalion created to implement the new helicopter strategy that would become the signature of the war. These tactics are still in use today, as witness by Black Hawk Down for instance. The movie was written and directed by Randall Wallace. While not as stylish as some directors he tells his story simply and coherently. Wallace includes some unique touches.  We actually meet the North Vietnamese and while we don't really get to know him or his men, at least we get some sense of them as soldiers.Wallace does make some mistakes.  The soldier's wives somehow don't come across.  Part of the problem is their costuming.  Their hairstyles and clothing are too-too early sixties. They look like east village drag queens having a retro party rather than concerned army wives. Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore. Stowe is a fine actress but something weird happens with her character. For some reason, just as the character should become more vivid she begins to fade. I don't think this is Stowe's fault. I tend to think Wallace was more interested in the battles than he was in the home front and the soldier's wives suffered for it.In the end, one's feelings about We Were Soldiers is defined by how one feels about Hollywood war movies.  Because it is a star driven film we have the pleasure of a great Gibson performance and Elliot's Sergeant Plumley. We pretty much know who's going to die and how.  The conventions help us make sense of a difficult battle that is presented very close to the way it actually happened. The downside to this is that, as close to the facts as the move is, it doesn't feel all that real. You experience it as a smart, thoughtful action movie instead of getting the sense of intense horrifying reality that you got from Black Hawk Down. If you're bothered by the idea of war as entertainment, you will have some trouble with We Were Soldiers. As for me, I enjoyed it and give it a hearty recommendation",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great movie,"I just found time to watch this great movie and I have to say that is is one of the absolutely best war movies I have ever seen. The acting of Mel Gibson as Col. Moore is just superb and in my opinion more than worthy of some kind of reward, be it a Oscar or other reward. This movie gives you two hours of totally draining action where heroism of the soldiers and the outstanding military leadership of Col. Moore is the center point that leaves you really thinking about the individual in such a horrible situation. Great movie, great acting, a must see for all war movie fans.",,Anonymous,History
solid,"great acting, based on a true story, no nonsense straight to the point and lots of action. Mel Gibson plays real life war hero Col.Moore in the war against Vietnam and it displays one major battle. The real time movie is about 3 days total. The combat is very graphical and about as close to feeling real as movie can get, which is quite good. The acting is sincere especially by Gibson and his character looked just as heroic as his real life character who in reality has about 20 war medals. My favorite scene is Gibson showing his acting chops at the end and saying ""why did my men have to die, and im still alive""? Spoken like a true hero, go watch this especially if your a military member or history junkie. In my opinion, it's better than black hawk down, just because the elements are more accurate to certain events.",9.0,Anonymous,History
It's about time....,"It's about time a war movie like ""We were soldiers"" was made.

Chillingly Realistic Presentation,"This movie is the most realistic war movie that I've ever seen. If you're a vet you'll relate to many of the scenes portrayed in this movie.

Non vets won't have a clue as to what I'm referring to; they haven't been there. This movie will make you both laugh and cry in about equal doses. Mr.Gibson has done an outstanding job of portraying a horrific battle in an unpopular war. Seldom does a movie portray the camaraderie that develops between men in military units that transcends both family and friends as does this one. I don't care about how many war pictures you readers have seen, this one will get and hold your attention right from the ""get go"". I've never seen our (and their) soldiers portrayed more nobly.

Maybe they should go back and finish the job.If this is meant to be a Vietnam movie for the younger generation, there is not even one clue about why the Americans were fighting. And did they won?

One of the best movies I've seen in a long while.,"I'm a fan of Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott and I expected to like this movie because they were in it. What I didn't expect was how much I would like the movie, or how much it would move me. It was one of the best movies that I've seen in a long while. I was born in 1964 and grew up watching the Vietnam war on TV, but until I saw this movie that's mostly all the war was to me, some images on TV and some pages in a history book. I hope people see this film and come away being as proud of the vietnam veterans as I am, and as interested in learning more about this controversial war. Whether you approved of the politics behind this war or not, no one should downplay the courage of the men (and women) who fought in this war while most of us stayed home in our snug little beds. The way the vietnam veterans have been treated since they returned home is disgraceful. It's time they were shown some respect. I've read other user comments that decry the patriotism shown in this movie. What I want to know is, what's wrong with being patriotic? The makers of this film and all the actors involved should be proud of the way this movie made me feel. I saw many people crying (as I was myself) at this moving tribute to the men who fought and died in the Ia Drang Valley during those three days in 1965. I hope this movie helps bring some closure to the vietnam veterans and their families and to the families who lost loved ones in this war.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent - shame they changed the ending though,Just had to comment on the previous write up. This is an excellent film however the ending differs greatly from the book which was written by the American journalist Joe Galloway who was there on the ground throughout the battle. In true movie-world tradition the ending was changed to show the Americans winning when in fact they were bailed out by other American troops who were also then attacked and took seriously heavy casualties. Why can't films based on the truth keep to the truth?As to the film itself it covers the historical changing of the American army from World War 2 equipment and tactics to the new M16 and helicopter based infantry. Covering the first major battle of the American involvement in the Vietnam war it shows the guts and horror of close quarter battle in overwhelming circumstances. To the films credit it also covers the difficulty of the wives left at home being notified of the deaths of friends and loved ones by telegram.,9.0,Anonymous,History
A violent but well executed 'nam pic.,"""I will be the first to set foot on the filed, and I will be the last to step off, and I will leave no man behind."" So declares Lt. Hal Moore played by Mel Gibson the day before he and his outfit set off across the Pacific for the front lines of Vietnam. Easily the highlight line of the movie, it would be easy enough to see this as the kind of cheesy bravado that romanticizes war heroes, but We Were Soldiers gets away with it by being everything but romantic. There are moments where the images of blood alone may be enough to summon misty eyes.The movie doesn't bring anything new to the genre, but it is a visually genuine and visceral depiction of battle and survival. The American invasion of Communist Vietnam is something that to this day, virtually nobody is proud of so. All the better it is that the film has no political bias or stance on the conflict. It even does something to the contrary. The Vietcong ""charlie"" are not bad guys, they are merely soldiers fighting for their homeland.The firefighting is quite exhausting but it is the individual moments in-between the bullets that lift We Were Soldiers out of the chaos. Director Randall Wallace adds a curious scoring touch laying ""Sgt. Mackenzie."" (a Scottish WWI ballad), over the first moments of the final assault.The irony is that this is a song about the will to die for country; not a compatible motif with 'nam,Regardless of its political correctness, the words end up being less important than the somber and haunting tone of the melody. Our characters are not fighting for country, they are fighting for each other, and to get home to their loved ones.Every now and then, Wallace cuts from the front lines back to America to focus on Moore's Wife and the wives of his comrades. Day to day they live in fear of receiving a certain letter from the government regarding their husbands. The impact of these scenes on the picture is rather minimal, but it serves to remind us of what is really at stake, while showcasing one of Madaline Stowe's better performances. She barely has to say a word, you can read the vulnerability in her eyes.True to his word, Hal Moore is the first to step off the field, and there is a good shot of his boot coming of the grass and into the chopper that will take him back to the home of the brave. The final sequences are heavy on unspoken melodrama, over emphasizing the loss of life. The film doesn't rely on our knowledge of the history to add to the tragedy. It is a story about brothers and comrades who fought together and died together.",8.0,Anonymous,History

For that I can only thank God.The details of the movie were even worse in the book. It's a heartbreaking story but it needed to be told.

Understand Before You Criticize,"I'm amazed at how so many people who obviously consider themselves liberal and open minded are criticizing We Were Soldiers--a movie that really let's the viewer walk in another's shoes (pardon the cliche) . . .We Were Soldiers conjures emotions and memories strong enough to build fifty thousand reviews.  From experience and fist hand accounts, We Were Soldiers accurately depicts life on base and on the front.   For those of us too young to have fought, but old enough to remember, powerful and painful images persist.  Be ready to relive pain.Sometimes my dad still pulls out the picture of his flight class, and calls the names of the men who died in the war as if asking them to suddenly appear.  I dare any of you who criticize the vets or the nation that fought that war to ask a vet to pull out his class picture and show you the men who died.I hope one day you'll shake with their fear.  I hope one day you'll appreciate their sacrifice for your arrogance, and realize that without the US the ""Lingue France"" of Paris would be Russian.  Do you not realize that the Killing Fields of Cambodia were a direct result of the world's unwillingness to confront communism?  Such arrogant ignorance once cost the world millions of lives (see, for example, Why Communism Kills by Schwartz) and such ignorant criticism will cost the world millions more one day.War is an ugly thing--uglier still is the man who criticizes his defenders; the selfish, cowardly man-child who has no cause greater than himself.  If there's nothing you'll die for, you may surely one day die for nothing.I remember little from my young days living on Air Force bases in the early 1970s.  I do remember wondering when my dad would come home.  I do remember ""those cars"" with an officer and a priest (I remember specifically that my mom couldn't look at them), and I do remember some kids not coming to class anymore.  I thank God I didn't know what those cars were for, and for not understanding why my friend Jimmy suddenly left the base.As for cliches, perhaps lines are used in so many war movies because they are really used--there are only so many ways to express the horror and pain of suddenly loosing a friend, or realizing you're about to die.  What will you miss my liberal friends?  Your dolphin?Ask any soldier--every unit has at least one nut just like the ""I am proud to die for my country"" idiot.  And, as that child on a military base, I can recall asking my dad what a war was.  Although I think like many of you that the laundry reference was shallow and could have been done much better, it did serve to illustrate how racism largely died in the military long ago. It is amazing to me how liberal civilians have succeeded in keeping it around so long.We Were Soldiers demonstrates Vietnam in a new and refreshing way--soldiers were not butchers of civilians or drug-addicts.  They were human.  They had ideals.  They feared.  They were heros.  Many still fight that war, and this movie (and review) is for them.",,Anonymous,History

the best of its kind?,"the Vietnam War is one of those least understood in my home country of UK I think. This film will not assist us to greater understanding of the politics but you will not come away from watching it without a greater understanding of the men who fought it. When I first knew of its release I viewed Mel Gibson's employment as nothing but a ploy to rake in viewer's, fearing he would be a little john wayne-ish in the part of Hal Moore. I actually feel this is his finest performance to date. Films like platoon, hamburger hill and the boys from company c all have their own merits, whereas maybe green berets lacks any at all. We were soldiers stands head and shoulders above any of them in its representation of combat, its brutality, the comradeship it brings about and the effects upon those back home. I am not known for my moist eyes during films but I certainly felt myself weep for those wives left behind and what they had to endure. Hal Moore was a superb combat leader, of that there can be no doubt.

Like Home Movies ...,"I grew up in the 1960s in the Fort Benning area where this movie was actually filmed.  As a former Army Brat and as a career Army officer, I must salute the director for the attention to detail in bringing Hal Moore's story to the silver screen.The uniforms of that era were exact ... right down to specific items of the soldier's uniforms such as camouflage covers and canvas field gear  which are now obsolete and getting harder to find.It was like home movies for me to see a film featuring base houses in a section known as ""Colonel's Row"" where I once knew people that actually lived there; in addition to other scenery from my childhhood in Georgia. Many of my childhood friends had Dads assigned to the 11th Air Assault which was renamed the 7th Cavalry.The one event that actually occurred and was omitted from the movie was the massive fly-over that took place prior to that unit's departure.  Many of the men assigned to that unit lived in houses just outside of Ft Benning. One afternoon prior to their departure, there was a massive fly-over where the skys over those suburban neighborhoods were black with army helicopters from Ft Benning.  For some of those soldiers it would be the last time that they would see their own homes from an aerial perspective.The emotion shown of having the news of a soldier's death being delivered to his widow by a taxi driver was deeply realistic.  My own father had been killed in Viet Nam in 1964, one year prior to Hal Moore and his outfit being sent forward.  I remember when a cab driver pulled into our driveway with a telegram and my mother going ballistic!  She called the base, asked to speak to the 2-star general and totally chewed him out for being so cold hearted.Overall I think this was an excellent movie.  It not only focused upon the battle, but also had a focus upon the military families that too often has been overlooked by Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,History

One of the best,"I was a young helicopter pilot in Vietnam, and this movie is the first Vietnam movie I've seen that's not leftist anti-vet propaganda, with an overdose of whining soldiers and crazed officers. Instead, it turned out to be the best war movie I've seen, for at least two reasons: (1) it's a rare factual account (like Patton) - the events and people are real, and therefore are far more compelling than any imaginary story could ever be, and (2) the movie's realism - it accurately depicts what it was like to be a soldier and a helicopter pilot in battle in Vietnam, complete with having to put up with some of the cowards in the rear who never got their uniforms dirty.  I can't find the words to respond to those who obviously never flew over or fought in Vietnam who claim to know the vegetation and scenery well enough to be critical of the movie in that regard.No movie can ever possibly recreate in a viewer the true intensity of the fear of taking fire and how to function in battle over extended periods of time spite of it, but that's all it lacked. The movie also helps explain why men don't normally talk of such battles, because the movie makes it so easy to see why words would fail them.Since the film is about the ultimate sacrifice each man depicted in the movie knew he may have to make, it also rightfully and poignantly shows what it was like for his also very real family waiting and hoping he would come home.  And what it was like to arrive home and open the door and look at your wife again, a day you weren't sure would ever happen.  Those who trivialize those scenes as Hollywood sappiness just don't understand, and have never been there.  If anything, the movie is not dramatic enough.At a fundamental level the movie is really about what it's like to fight for your country on any of history's fearsome battlefields, and how important it is to have smart and courageous battlefield leadership, and the difference one man can make.  No movie I've seen has done that better.  Indeed, that is no doubt why the movie took the time to show the human face of the North Vietnamese soldiers, and to show that they too had courage and families who missed them.Those who have written to bash the US and this movie have apparently failed to appreciate that the movie is really about the heroism of their own nation's soldiers who have with similar bravery and sacrifice fought for their country, as the movie made no claim that the valor depicted was unique to the American military of the 1960's.   I think few battlefield veterans of any nation would think this a poor movie.   A 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Take this movie for what it is, a war movie.","I have read a lot of the other comments posted here and I have come to the conclusion that some of you people just don't get it. This was based on a book written by Col. Harold Moore. The dialogue, although not word for word, cannot be called cliche because these are the types of things that the colonel and others heard during the war. If you are sitting there dying in your buddy's arms, then what pray tell would say?? I think that we all would want our wives to know that they were the last person on our minds and that we felt that our last words should be, ""Tell my wife that I love her.""The movie wasn't made to break any new artistic ground, it was made to accurately portray the lives of a generation of soldiers that have either been vilified by Hollywood or worse yet, ignored. Col. Moore has said that he liked the way that the movie has turned out and quite frankly that's the most important opinion to me. To hell with your cliches, that's what went down.Overall, I felt that this was quite possibly the best war movie that I have ever seen. I came into this movie thinking that the scenes with the families would bring down the movie but I have to say that the film makers balanced these parts perfectly with the action sequences. Just a tremendous movie that really makes you proud of the true heroes of the sixties, the American Soldier.",,Anonymous,History
Avoid at all costs.,"1/10It seems like everyone's trying to cash in on the war movies ever since Saving Private Ryan first came out. Movies like Black Hawk Down, and more specifically, We Were Soldiers. I guess no one really believes that war movies do in fact need a plot like all other movies. Yep, just throw in a bunch of people, some gunfire, blood and guts with people's limbs blowing off. Throw in some bagpipes on top of that. And there you have it, a war movie. Nothing new. Avoid at all costs, and go rent Saving Private Ryan instead.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Not just a violent shoot em up war drama,"Not an emotional sort but this film hit me right between the eyes. Born in 65, this film kept nudging my conscience on how many wasted lives, good lives put through the grinder. In addition to very well done combat scenes reflective elements of the families who sacrifice in silence of not knowing what is happening to their loved ones in harms way. Its easy for those with no blood in the game to not understand but this film at least attempts give those who don't live in a military family the anxiety and loss they live with everyday. I really hope the hawks who press the on buttons for our war machines really watch this film if only to remind them of early warning signs of one our countries greatest follies and who really does pay the ultimate price. Well done Mel Gibson.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Touching, emotional, graphic and gritty","One of the most moving movie experiences I've ever had.  I was mesmerized (and exhausted) by this film. I was just young enough to miss having to go to Vietnam, but not so young that I didn't oppose the war at that time. This film transcends the politics of the age and focuses on the sacrifices that were made for this country by our young fighting men.  I thought Mel Gibson was fantastic.  He has risen to be an actor that draws you in and keeps you into his performance.  His face alone speaks volumes in many scenes.  I wanted to see this movie so I could again experience, at least through a film (as in Saving Private Ryan), the horrors of war, so I could gain a grain of understanding of how horrible it must have been to be in situations as illustrated by this film.  An ordinary looking beautiful sunny day turns into a nightmare within just a few moments.  The movie is graphic, grizzly, and exhausting.  I had tears streaming down my face by the end of the movie, just for knowing that this type of horror went on then, and is still going on around the world.  I thought that the quote offered by the North Vietnamese commander at the end of the movie was quite profound and sadly, quite true.  This is not an ordinary movie, if you're looking simply to have a good time and be entertained, don't go.  This movie has a deeper message than simple entertainment, and some of the scenes are truly horrifying.  I give it a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Gibson ¬ñ who produced as well ¬ñ stars as Lt. Col. Hal Moore of the 7th Calvary US Army who led his brigade into one of the most difficult battles of Vietnam in 1965 in this hamstrung adaptation of Moore's recollection with arcane dialogue and stiff direction from his collaborator Randall Wallace (his debut behind the camera) hobbles a noble effort.",,Anonymous,History
ho hum dorky Vietnam blech,"Randall Wallace made one fun movie that was blown out of proportion and pushed him into an ego happy land on par with Leonardo DiCaprio. Braveheart was popcorn munching heaven. Everything since then has been a steady drivel of nothing¬ólike coffee grounds forced, FORCED from the bottom of the pot to make an unwilling cuppa. This movie is bland on so many levels it's a shame. I think it was about 20 minutes into it when the helicopters that look like knock off plastic hueys on a blue screen do little aerials that I realized money here would have been better spent on advancing technology for turning ducks into toaster ovens. From there it just sort of goes down hill. Lessee... we've got the obligatory 5 seconds of screen time for the token black guy who just looks confused (seriously, do any of you know how MANY black people really fought in the Vietnam war? Jeepers), the obligatory shaky, gritty camera shots when the battle gets wicky wild; the reverb echo effects just before the big big oh no mortars fall; friendly fire; blood blood everywhere; grim face shots of our lead actor; young faces going into battle; battle screams¬ódang, we have a veritable A-list A-team here¬óand yet... this movie just kills itself. It's like Disney doing a porno¬óevery shot in between is crystal clear and filled with¬ó'we know not the evil we do' sentimentality. It's saccharine, it's silly, it's not worth your while. If you want a good war movie¬ógo for broke with Full Metal Jacket, Thin Red Line, or Dr. Strangelove. However, if you're in the market for lackluster string sections sound-tracking slow-motion montages of sucky images with poor poor poor poor adobe premiere flame effects... why, your cattle car stops here! Watch as Mel Gibson takes another lofty glance at that mountain over th'ar; see minority groups squabble and then make ends meet; witness Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson reconcile their bigotry in Braveheart (if you don't know what I'm talking about, then perhaps you should read more) by attempting rationalizations from the enemy perspective (gee, they're almost human!); C-class emotional drama... the list of daunting accomplishments goes on. 4 / 10 for this sludge fest. It gets 4 for actually accomplishing what I think it set out to do: show lot's of people being killed, make shallow stabs at moral messages, parade around with American imperialism, and make some money.As an addendum (and quoting another post I made) Just because a film is about human tragedy (american and/or otherwise) doesn't mean we should exempt it from criticism on its (lack of) artistic merit as a film. Furthermore, why bother making a film that relies so heavily on its source material that it has fans raving, ""well you can't understand unless you've read the book, otherwise you'll never understand."" This is as idiotic as the faith defense. I shouldn't have to read the book! It's a movie! If I wanted to read the book, then I would have read the book! People make films because they're a fundamentally different medium from the written word. It takes guts (though often with very poor results) to turn a book into a screenplay. While the source material might be ""good"" in its own right, it in no way excuses the film for falling flat.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Brings back a lot of memories,"Mel Gibson is no John Wayne, and this is not ""The Green Berets."" And while the humanity of the leaders and the brutality of the war in Vietnam come through in both films, this film is so very different.Fierce in its intensity and as graphically accurate as a film can be, the movie is serious fare and not for the lighthearted. For those of us who were there, in country, this film is a savage reminder of the stupidity of politicians trying to legislate a war. From the early war scenes of the French in Indo-China, to the (in retrospect) prophetic statement of the Vietnamese commander at the end of the film, the story is cast in a very historical light.That this is a new kind of war, with new troops, new weapons, and new tactics does not escape Gibson's character. Thus, the film shows that not only in the field but back home, as Madeleine Stowe's character remarks, ""the Army wasn't prepared for this.""Early on, we meet Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) as a family man, but also as a professional soldier. And, we meet Sgt Major Plumley (Sam Elliot) as the grizzled old warrior. Together, they know that it will be a tough job to get these kids trained and to keep (in as much as it might be possible) these youngsters from getting killed. Barry Pepper is outstanding in his role as a news photographer who hops a ride to the battle.Even in ""Soldiers"" the life of those ""who sit and wait"" is not well developed -- which can be explained given that the story is primarily of the story of those who have gone off to fight. Thus, we never get to really know Madeleine Stowe's character (Julie Moore) very well. Still, we do get an insight into her life as a take charge of the situation military spouse in the mid 60's. Additionally, the gathering of the wives, the sharing of their stories, and lives, is an added dimension that so many war films overlook. The naivety of many of us who were not from the segregated South is tastefully revealed and well played out.The scene of a group of newspaper journalists and photographers arriving via helicopter after the fighting was typical of media of the day, and (in my humble opinion) not far removed from some of their antics today. After over three days of fighting, killing, and dying --the cleaned and pressed press corp comes in asking their usual repertoire of insensitive, if not stupid, questions. Sadly, this is one of the many accurate scenes in the film.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Excellent film but bring the tissues,"This movie has everything for movie lovers, both male and female. The men will love all the blood and guts and the women will be brought to tears from all the emotional scenes of husbands going off to war, babies being born and raised that you know are about to become fatherless. I had to leave the theater at one point when the Col's wife was going to all the widow's houses. Every teen ager (and young adult too, for that matter) needs to see this film to realize what it was really like in Vietnam. Most of them do not have a clue. Mel Gibson was first-rate in his portrayal of Lt. Col. Moore, who is sent, under-manned, in to what he is sure is a suicide mission. I went in to this not expecting much but was surprised, despite the wrenching emotion dragged out of me, that it was a very well-made film. I am NOT a fan of Chris Klein and thought, oh, no, not him again, he can't act, but his character is appropriately understated, not flagged out as - HEY EVERYBODY - HERE IS A BIG STAR - PAY ATTENTION TO THIS CHARACTER as most filmmakers do. Sam Elliott did an excellent job playing Mel Gibson's right hand man, Greg Kinnear also turned in a solid performance as the unfailing helicopter pilot. Everyone involved in this movie should be very proud to have been a part of it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Very Powerful,"I have just finished one of the most powerful emotional experiences of my life.  I had the opportunity to watch a preview of this movie with approximately 1500 other cadets.  Also seated with us were three of the stars of the movie (Mel Gibson, Madeline Stowe, and Chris Klein), approximately forty generals representing some of the highest ranking officers in the Army, and several retired Army officers and soldiers, who were present for the events depicted in the film.The movie itself is an incredibly realistic depiction of warfare.  It is not only bloody, but it conveys the terror that a soldier would feel fighting outnumbered, surrounded, far-from safety, against an enemy that moves in swarms by day and by stealth at night.  At no time is the destruction glorified in any way.  In fact, its true impact is shown both on the other soldiers in the battle as well as the families left at home.Watching this movie, I could empathize with the characters in a way that was stronger than any other movie that I have ever seen.  Throughout the movie, I could only think about how I could be in the same situation as these soldiers.  In about a year, I will have graduated, gotten married, nearly completed the standard infantry schooling, and be getting ready to take command of my first platoon.  Though the events depicted in the movie took place in a war that ended about thirty years ago, it is not hard to imagine me being in a similar situation in a very short time.  Technology has changed, but the basics remain the same.As sat there, trying to imagine how I would react if thrust into such a chaotic situation, how my fiance would react if something happened to me, I was awe-struck by the courage and determination demonstrated by the soldiers that were there.  When the movie was over and the lights had come back on, I turned around and looked people that lived through the events just depicted on the screen.  Standing less than five feet from me were some true heroes. People that did what their country asked selflessly.  I have to say that by the end of the movie, I was as close to tears as I have ever come by any movie, a feeling shared by many of my fellow cadets.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Success!,"I saw an interview with General Hal Moore yesterday and he stated that he wished for two things to come out of this movie: 1- That we hate war and 2- That we love the American warrior.

This movie is a work of success in all aspects.As the son of a Viet Nam War hero who participated in the battle at Ia Drang Valley, the battle so eloquently depicted by this movie, I am excited to say that finally a movie is made that depicts our warriors for what they were: brave heroes who went out to do what their country asked them to do.As far as war is concerned, this movie makes no excuses.  War, in all of it's bloody and gory splendor, is clearly depicted so that we can at least minutely and ever so remotely feel what our brave troopers went through.We owe a debt of gratitude to our soldiers and the movie ""We Were Soldiers"" is a perfect start!

I Get Goosebumps Every Time I Remember Hal Moore Recounting This Incredible Story,I remember seeing Hal Moore on television recounting the battle. It gives me shivers and makes me proud to be an American when I remember his recounting of the facts of that fateful battle. He is a true American hero and he freely gives credit to all who served under him...those that lived and those that died. I remember when he was speaking of a machine gunner in his unit that fought on and on long after being wounded...tears welled up on his eyes and he referred to him as a true hero. His actions saved countless lives; so did Moore's. If it wasn't for his battle strategy the U.S. would've been defeated. We surely need more commanders of his ilk. I've never seen the movie; never even knew they made one based on Hal Moore's account of that battle. I will make a point of renting it and letting everyone know what a true hero Moore and his men are.,,Anonymous,History
Patriotic nonsense,"I wouldn't normally comment on a film I hated, but this film really offended me. I Honestly believe it was only made for ""gun-nuts"" and young teenagers with an unhealthy obsession for explosions and military activity. There is pretty much no plot, except for Mel gloriously defeating ""the enemy"" in slow motion. There is no attempt to deal with the politics of War let alone the Vietnam situation, just simple US soldiers = good guys, everyone else = bad guys. Honestly I think this film was made as a military advert to aid recruitment. The characters are hardly even introduced before we are expected to be caring about their battles.Mel has made some great films in Signs and Braveheart so why did he touch this script. It must have been some guilt trip or favor. Compared to Platoon , Thin Red Line, Paths to Glory or Full Metal Jacket this film looks like empty hollow trash.Once again The Vietnam War is being portrayed as an American tragedy, not a Vietnamese one. Is Mel out to single-handedly rewrite history?",1.0,Anonymous,History
A soldier's complex existence,"A soldier has ingrained into them the importance of fulfilling their mission and effectively executing the responsibilities assigned to them. What they aren't prepared for is the grief that follows a job well done, the echoing horror that is the reward for success. That is what this film beautifully yet tragically displays. There is valor in being a good soldier, but it unquestionably comes with nightmare that shadows the rest of your life.This is a masterpiece, a brilliant execution of production, casting, scoring, and writing. It does a fantastic job of showing the layers of war, the heroic nature of a good soldier, and the incredibly high price of war.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"We Few, We Silent Few","During the Vietnam War, American troops led by Lieutenant Colonel (Lt. Col.) Harold Moore, Hal, (Mel Gibson) fought a three day battle against the North Vietnamese. The Lt. Col. Regiment was soon named 'The 7th Air Calvary/1st battalion. Now the men of the 7th Calvary are fighting in what will be known as The Valley of Death. Three days and two nights of none stop fighting over this valley costs both sides dearly. During the battle, Hal Moore makes some incredible things happen. He is able to keep many of his own troops alive while suffering major loses. The Americans after three days and two nights of not sleeping, make a desperate charge on the Vietnamese base. The Vietnamese are prepared for this and they are ready to kill every last one of Hal Moore's troops.""We Were Soldiers"" is based on a book called ""We Were Soldiers¬ÖOnce"" written by Hal Moore. The battle in The Valley of Death is one of the major battles fought by the Americans in the Vietnam War. One of the great things about Hal Moore is when he is delivering a speech to his men before they are shipped off to Vietnam; he says that he will bring everyone home dead or alive. This film shows the hardship and objectives of each fighting force. The Vietnamese are fighting for land and freedom from the French while the Americans are fighting to help keep Vietnam under French rule.I believe that We Were Soldiers is a great movie depicting what happened at a battle that many people do not know about. I am really impressed on how Mel Gibson got the military rank right along with the corresponding symbols. Viewing the battle from both sides gives you a perspective of how each side is thinking for the battle. Some of the fight I did not like because it would show a Vietnamese officer telling his troops what to do, then a second later it show Hal Moore telling his troops to defend that position.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Powerful, Stirring Movie","I just saw a preview of ""We Were Soldiers"" and wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to recommend it.  Aside from an amazingly realistic and often graphic telling of America's first bloody battle in Vietnam, Randall Wallace delivers a well-balanced perspective on the people and emotions involved in what would become one of the most trying periods in America's history.This movie is definitely not for the squeamish as it contains some extremely powerful battle scenes, but shining through many of those are beautiful illustrations of self sacrifice and the ever-present sentiment of leaving no one behind (see also `Black Hawk Down').Mel Gibson gives an outstanding performance as Lt. Colonel Harold Moore. I know that the passion that this officer had for his family, his country, and his men is not unique amongst those who serve our country, but it is so refreshing to see honor and virtue exalted.  Harold Moore IV was apparently at the screening I saw, and I only hope that his generation grows up in the image of his great-grandfather.There's not enough space to give the entire cast the credit they are due, but definitely worth mentioning are Madeleine Stowe as Moore's wife, Sam Elliott as Sergeant Major Basil Plumley, Chris Klein as Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, and Barry Pepper as Joe Galloway.  Each one of these performers brings his / her character to life in a way that you wish you knew the real individuals.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Forget the hype, the build-up, the critics. it's a good war movie, and on a par with the new 'measuring rod' of Saving Private Ryan.You don't have to agree with me. It's far and away better than Pearl Harbor, that's for sure! There is a stark, horrifying reality and pain in the scenes of battle and death in this film and as a jaded war film buff, that takes some doing, I can tell you. The acting is realistic, because it is not 'acted' but simply given realism by the tension of the moment. As for the ending, I know it was 'hollywoodized' but it still works. I was touched by the closing, and felt this was a good and 'sincere' effort to tell a story as well as make some serious money. I give it a 9/10.",,Anonymous,History
excellent in every way,"I found this piece to really bring out the best in film making. The entire flow of the film made me think the editing was slow and yet full of detail. Little motions in everything, the prayer with his children and his daughter's toes wiggling as they didn't reach the ground were great. The lighting in each scene when artificial felt thought out quite convincingly and the outer scenes were scouted perfectly.The characters were scripted well and they felt entertaining, as this was not a documentary but a based on fact fictionary. Being in the military can be quite boring and then entirely too exciting in the worst ways, and this was very visceral and realistic.I thin each actor was ground out a good character and they were properly cast. The costumes were great, the vietcong were determined, and it was a pleasure to ride through the era in this film.I didn't mention the soundtrack and audio effects, maybe because they were on point, bird sounds added in, slight points here and there with great coverage in the gaps with the music.The end.

That my men... that my men died and I didn't.,"We Were Soldiers is about the story of the first major battle of the American phase of the Vietnam War and the soldiers on both sides that fought it. We Were Soldiers was one of my favorite war films growing up and still is one of my favorites. Director, Randall Wallace, takes you into this gritty, realist war film. What stands with the directing style of, We Were Soldiers, is the use of a steadicam affectively for action sequence. When you watch this film you get right into the middle of the action, seeing all the detail and emotions. I like the film grain; it adds to the grittiness of war. The performances in We Were Soldiers are great and succeeds with giving the characters life. It's always bad in films characters are so flat and lifeless because of the acting and character development. You get none of that in this film. Mel Gibson leads in We Were Soldiers and this by far one of his best performances of his career. The emotion you feel from beginning to end from Gibson is astounding. From the very beginning you see that he cares about being a parent, husband, & soldier. By the end of this film Mel Gibson has my eyes tearing up because of how much he loves his country and soldiers. The only tiny problem with this film is that it falls to little war movie clich√©s, but that didn't bother me. We Were Soldiers comes highly recommended for those who love war films.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Realistic Tribute to All Affected by Vietnam,"There are many people writing reviews who are willing to make claims that this movie is ""realistic"" or ""hogwash"" or whatever. As someone who did not fight in the Ia Drang Valley, my first question would be-- how would you know? I will say this movie seemed pretty realistic to me, and Hal Moore and Joe Galloway, the writers of the book and participants in the battle seemed satisfied with it, so I bet you it is pretty real. And already, this is a big plus for this movie.What I think might be off-putting to some people is that fact that the movie has some big stars--Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot, Greg Kinnear-- that we have seen a million times before. If the actors had been anonymous, I suspect that the movie would have seemed more ""realistic."" Gibson in fact does his Georgia drawl pretty well, but loses it every so often in one of his ""Braveheart"" moments of pathos.Similarly, the musical score has a Scottish lament that seems bizarre for this movie. Are we still doing ""Braveheart""?On the upside however, we get corroboration from the participants that the war scenes are pretty real, and they are BRILLIANTLY choreographed. Ever since Saving Private Ryan, these movies have gotten A LOT more graphic. We Were Soldiers has some utterly gruesome scenes in it that are probably quite true to life. Again, this is a big plus, since we don't want to remember the fighting as anything but something very ugly.Also, unlike some other Vietnam films, there are some believable moments involving two parties not often heard from: the soldiers' wives and the enemy. Hal Moore's wife delivers death telegrams to the other vets' wives so that they don't have to receive them from the Yellow Cab company. I have no doubt that this was true, and the scenes are NOT melodramatic, they are heartbreaking.Similarly, one of the best characters of the movie is General An of the NVA. He is again terrifically believable as the sanguine commander of the enemy forces, and we see him as a clever, thoughtful and even compassionate commander heartbroken about the state of his country but willing to do what it takes to defend it. The mental duel that he has with Colonel Moore (Mel Gibson) also provides a terrific subplot.On balance, this movie is really worth it. In making a Vietnam movie that really tries to tell the story realistically, we get an excellent tribute not just to the US Vets, but also to everyone affected, even the Vietnamese foe. It is a tough movie to watch, but it is also perhaps the healthiest response to Vietnam that I have ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Unique Vietnam War Movie,"Okay, let's leave out that one of my favorite movies, Braveheart, comes from the Gibson/Wallace team. This is still a good flick. Every Vietnam War movie I've seen before this one seems to have some angle, some statement to be made. Just like Job's friends, when we see something that doesn't make sense, it's human nature to put out our own take on it to try to reconcile what we have experienced. Yet, this is one of the few movies that hesitates to carry that burden. It doesn't overtly accuse the politicians, the press or the military for Vietnam's ultimate failure. It tells a story from a Lt. Colonel's perspective, not coming from some frightened kid's coming-of-age perspective and not with some leftist ideological blinders like Born on the Fourth of July, or Platoon, or--shudder--Apocalypse Now. It's told by a man who understands battle, the killing, and the maiming. It's told to pay tribute to men who answered their country's call to go and fight.And men they were. They were men with families and friends. They were men who risked seeing their children grow up because of their willingness to go fight. As a father, that hits home. Few war movies pause to address the internal conflict a soldier must face prior to deployment and the turmoil it creates with those who love them. Fewer still recognize faith and religion's impact on the whole equation. It only adds depth to their characters and makes them more real. Man is a spiritual being, and far too often, that fact is overlooked for telling a story or to keep from making people ""uncomfortable.""There are some intense moments and very graphic violence. The casual viewer may overlook one scene where a guy is struck by phosphorous. But burning phosphorous is like little chunks of the sun and it won't stop burning for anything. The aftermath where his buddy helps him still chills me because I know a little about what has to happen for him to survive. On the whole, the gore is significant and extensive. Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan are comparably tame by some measures. So unless you *live* for that sort of thing, you may come away with a queasy stomach.I watched this during the second Persian Gulf War, so the ramifications of soldiers dying hit with much more force. Consider this when you make your movie choices. You may want a comedy or a classic instead of this, considering.",,Anonymous,History

There is almost no dialogue in the entire movie, just a series of monologue speeches, and most of those are preachy.Parts of the movie are wasted setting up situations where the audience is supposed to worry that Mel Gibson's character will die.

"A really good, but not quite great film about the vietnam conflict","We were soldiers once....and young.  That is the title of the book from which this well made film was adapted. Mel Gibson and Sam Elliot are excellent, as is the whole cast, and the battle is intense, horrifying and appropriately unpleasant (war after all isn't fun).  I can not however give it a 10. The handling, or maybe mishandling of the women at home makes me hesitant.  There seems a falsness to their scenes for the most part.  Not all of it, but most of the women and their interactions with one another all seem forced. It is no fault of the actresses, who seem to take the material they have been given just about as far as it can go.  Like I said though, not all of the women's scenes feel strained (watch closely the second letter delivery which is nicely acted and remarkably touching).The movie does not let one view the action at too great a distance. This is no John Wayne war movie, all heroics and patriotism without much reflection on the conflict being portrayed.  This movie isn't about flagwaving, which is shocking considering Randall Wallace, the films writer and director, also wrote the worthless and pathetic Pearl Harbor. There is however alot to be said for good direction.  And Wallace here demonstrates some more discretion with cheesy manipulative tactics than the director of Pearl Harbor demonstrated. It is there, mostly in some questionable shot composition, but still present. Note to all future film-makers making war pictures, placing key actors in scenes with conspicuously placed U.S. flaggs almost always seems contrived. What is really interesting about this vietnam war film is that it almost completely sidesteps politics.  We see that politics are going to play a role in landing Lt. Col. Moore (the Gibson character)and his men in a really tight spot. Moore knows this is going to cost lives, maybe even his own but he is a soldier, he will do his best to achieve his objective and reduce the loss of life of his men.  Also in leaving the politics out of it and also showing both sides of fight we realize, as we watch, that both sides really aren't that different, that ultimately the men on either side are fighting for the same reason. The viewer also notices that all of the combatants, except for Gibson and Elliot, are young, barely one over thirty.  And I think for americans that is such a key difference from WWII and the Vietnam conflict.  Young, young men went to fight in Vietnam.  It is a fact that even the main character, Moore, finds hard to get over.  ""I look at the men and all I see are my boys."" The film can't dwell on the disillusionment that grew as the conflict lengthened, however it shows how the seeds were planted. The movie's thesis is that a soldier doesn't fight for country, for ideas, for abstracts, but that the soldier fights for the man next to them, for thier platoon, their family. It is the same message as that in Black Hawk Down, and I think the same message that you might find the film Platoon.

It succeeds by abandoning the politics of so many other Vietnam films and simply focusing on the experiences of the men in the moment.  This was the tack taken by ""Black Hawk Down"", but by putting a clearer face on the enemy and by making the film about the way the battle changed the men, this film is actually better.Mel Gibson gives a solid performance at Lt. Col. Moore and Sam Elliot is excellent as his second in command, a battle hardend Sargent Major who knows how to act in a fight.  The other performances are all blended together nicely, and the action is intense and horrifying.  War is not glorified in this picture, nor is America.  The stark scene at the end of the film of the Vietnam Memorial drives home the point that this film was about and for those wen in the Valley of Death.  Writer/Director Randall Wallace deserves credit for creating a moving picture of the first real battle of the Vietnam War, and in so doing earns a bit of forgiveness for writing ""Pearl Harbor"". All in all, an important movie that pulls no punches emotionally.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Riveting - with a lot of heart,I have seen WE WERE SOLDIERS and I wholeheartedly recommend this film.Randy Wallace enables us to know these men from the get go and the last half of the movie takes us so deep into the action that I had to turn away from the screen on more than one occasion.You cannot help but shed tears when you realize the sacrifices and commitment of these soldiers and their families.Gibson's performance is as intense as in Braveheart.I sincerely hope moviegoers will see this picture and understand that Vietnam's soldiers are entitled to be remembered as heroes which I feel is incredibly overdue.,10.0,Anonymous,History
Saddening war movie.,"I have read the comments page for the movie THE PATRIOT, and I cannot help but notice that all of the negative disparaging remarks are made from most people living outside the United States who have the balls to complain about the film's patriotic nature. The WE WERE SOLDIERS comment page is not much different. There are many people who have the balls to come right out and say that this movie is utter trash. This movie is anything but.The film is very graphic and has a very disturbing sense to it. You all can say what you want about this movie, but I think it is great. There are some very gruesome segments which made me cringe and think to myself how much I never want to experience the horrors of war. And if you thought BLACK HAWK DOWN was a graphic movie, this movie is far worse. The only difference is that this movie takes it's time in developing a story before rushing into the battle.The cast is all-star: Mel Gibson, Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, Chris Klein, Barry Pepper, Madeline Stowe, and many others. There is a most shocking scene between Barry Pepper while he is trying to rescue a fellow soldier who has been badly burned. So, trust me, this movie is not for the weak of stomach. This movie is not really worthy of an Oscar award, but it is worth your time. If you enjoy this movie (which I don't see how anyone would be able to seriously be able to watch it in happy glee) but if you like it as a war movie, then you might want to check out WINDTALKERS. I recommend that you check this one out.WE WERE SOLDIERS gets 5/5.",,Anonymous,History

Overall this movie deserved my awesome review they played their role very well some died for their country they knew they was going to war and they fought for our country the US may have lost a lot due to war but came out stronger and beat them in Vietnam Mel Gibson played at L.

Objective study of the Vietnam Conflict,"While carrying the burden of being a big budget Hollywood production this movie manages to provide a different perspective to norm on the conflict in Vietnam.

A Masterpiece war movie but everyone should be talking about Barry Pepper's incredible performance!!!! My Fave War Film.,"""We were soldiers"" is an emotional & raw piece of Vietnam drama with an excellent ensemble cast giving it dramatic weight & the one who glows the brightest is the ridiculously underrated but extremely talented BARRY PEPPER as real life photographer Joe Galloway!!!This is my all-time favourite War film.The underrated Barry Pepper actually gives my all-time favorite performance from an actor.....Ever!!!Everyone goes on about Steven Spielberg's Classic Saving Private Ryan, & it's great don't get me wrong, but in my opinion We Were Soldiers beats it hands down!!! I found Ryan abit too dreary & depressing, yes war isn't nice or fun but the realism was too downbeat & sad, just like WW2 was. We Were Soldiers is realistic & gritty but for some reason, maybe its the sunny hot setting, it isn't too dreary or depressing in my opinion. Both great war films & both Classic's.First off in this great cast we have Mel Gibson giving his greatest performance in my opinion as troubled family man & warrior Col. Hal Moore, a man who has seen his fair share of horror on the battlefield & Gibson is superb!!! Moore has the tough job of leaving his troops into danger as this is the beginning of America's involvement with the Vietnam war in the 1960's & there's a weighty atmosphere of fear & sadness that hangs over the movie & in Moores eyes.The cast is filled out with many known actors & faces with Sam Elliott & Greg Kinnear & Chris Klein & Desmond Harrington & on the wives side back at home we have Madaleine Stowe as Moore's worried wife & is fantastic in her role & a sweet Keri Russell & both have a horrible job of taking telegrams from the army to hand out to the wives & families of the killed soldiers & those scenes are heavy & very sad.The cast is truly fantastic but best of all during all this horror, chaos & sadness is the powerhouse performance from Barry Pepper (possibly the most underrated actor in Cinema history?) Who portrays Joe Galloway a photographer who is taking pictures of the horror the men see & sending them back home so the people can see what's going on & that it's not all heroic but savage & disturbing. Pepper is amazing as he completely captured the fear & sadness in his eyes that we see the battles unfold from, he is us the audience & we see the real horror of the war through his weary eyes!!! He even starts the film by telling the story from it's troubled start & it's truly Pepper's raw & emotional performance that stayed with me all through the movie & after it ended!!!! Joe Galloway was a real man & what happened did happen & he has the photos to prove it. Galloway gets put in some horrific situations that are the standout scenes of the movie like the napalm bomb sequence where wrong co-ordinates end with alot of their own soldiers getting burned alive & Galloway has to help an extremely wounded soldier whose flesh is literally sliding off of his legs & it's horrible to watch & Pepper delivers all that horror in his eyes!!! Pepper is Outstanding & should've gotten some sort of an award for his performance!!! Galloway is the most likeable character too & this part cemented Barry Pepper as one of my all time top 5 favourite actors!!!!We also see this messy war from both sides with the Vietnamese & their troubles & their losses too & that is really touching to be honest as the whole war was such a horrible mess. Too many casualties & deaths & for what????The music is extremely moving & builds that lump in you throat & the movie directed with grit & ferocious realism & i know when it comes to War films everyone always goes on about Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, yes it's good but too long & Depressing in my opinion but again BARRY PEPPER stole that show too as the talented sniper Private Jackson, but to me ""We Were Soldiers"" is the best war fim in my opinion.""We Were Soldiers"" is all based on truth, it's characters were real & the battles & sadness was all real & chaotic messiness of it all is captured here on film properly!!!Even the real vets said ""They Finally Got It Right""

Realism on celluloid at last!,"I have watched many films about 'Nam but this has to be the best. Sentimental, I know, but this adds to the whole feel of the movie. I have to admit I was in tears for most of the second half because this movie tells it like it is and makes you realise the futility of war (however necessary it is deemed at the time). The courage of men under fire and the feeling of brotherhood (or sisterhood when relating the side of the wives and family) is bang on. Having served my country I think this is the most accurate depiction I have seen about how men and women cope with the shear stress and emotion of the theatre of war. The script, however corny and weak it is at times, pulls you along and you feel both sympathy and anger at the same time, not necessarily towards either side.",,Anonymous,History
"Stimulating, for a 1st grader","This has to be one of the worst movies about war ever made. Pure sentimental claptrap. However, there are so many bad things about this movie, I feel I will forget something. Let us begin with Mel Gibson and his accent. What part of the country he is supposed to be from, I am not sure. Then there is the geography of Vietnam, which looks a lot like Central Texas. I swear I saw numerous Texas Live Oaks. I don't want to be too picky here, but Vietnam (any tropical country) does not resemble this terrain at all. Then you have the NVA troops that all like to run right up to our American boys without firing their weapons. Our boys shoot them as they run with their AK 47's in hand. Now that is just bad training. If the NVA had only known how to actually fire a weapon, they might have won this war. Hey, wait a minute, they did win this war. Other acting performance were shallow and undeveloped.Look, it is no shock why this film is accepted. It is told on about a 2nd grade level and is crammed full of patriotic and military pride.

True heroes,"I just recently was able to view We Were Soldiers and have watched it twice again. I have seen very few moved that have brought tears to my eyes but this one had me reaching for the tissue box over and over again. The realism was well researched and portrayed. This movie not only told the real story about war but it also displayed what a real hero is. Every soldier on that battle field was a real hero. They didn't go there seeking fame or even recognition, but to just do their jobs as soldiers. The soldier going into battle knowing full well that he may not come out displays the kind of bravery that you won't see on a baseball or football field.

Apparently some of us don't.I also wonder if not everyone realizes that this movie is based on a book about a REAL battle in a REAL war with characters based on REAL people who died.  Of course, it has been fictionalized and dramatized, but isn't it trivializing the deaths of these young men to even refer to their celluloid depictions as ""cliches?""  What we see may be just a movie, but a whole lot of American soldiers died for what some might say was no good reason. Nothing will change that.

Worst Movie of the Year so far,"I was hoping that this movie would deliver the goods.  All it delivered was corny and sappy.

If I hear that dang line one more time, I will throw up!!  What's the deal with Sam Houson?  Everytime somebody said good morning to him, he'd just say ""What the hell do you know about good morning.""  THAT made me IRATE!  And what about how Mel Gibson too a CAB to his house!!  He couldn't just call his WIFE ahead of time and LET HER KNOW!?  She could have given him a RIDE!  That was way off base.  Mel Gibson prayed TOO MUCH!  What's worse, is that his prayers were supposedly from the top of his head, yet the sounded as if they WERE FROM A BOOK!!! This movie totally rips off THE GREEN BERETS with John Wayne.

This is quite possibly the greatest film I will ever see. Only a soldier can know what it's like to willfully remove himself from the warmth,love and comfort of his family to a sinful, deadly world of war. Colonel Moore dressed himself that night in his battle fatigues, kissed his children goodbye, and walked away from his family, not knowing if he would ever return again. If this doesn't make a grown man's heart buckle, I don't know what would. How many of us would do that exact same thing and not have tears flowing down our cheek? Then, if that wasn't enough, how many of us would take up a leadership position knowing full well that many of your men would not be returning to their families?

As a film that covers the first major battle of Vietnam, it seems to offer an unbiased view (after all, the sentiment against the Vietnam war didn't exist yet in the U.S.).The battle scenes are compelling to say the least. And, the combatants on both sides are depicted well. It's a testament to the spirit of a fighter (whether or not you agree with the fight itself).Madeleine Stowe does a great job as the wife. Mel does a good performance of what is clearly a smart man. I got goosebumps during some of her later scenes as well as some of the battle scenes.

The Best Vietnam Movie,"Movies about the Vietnam War were all the rage in the late '70s and '80s, however, there have been very few movies about the war made since then. The Vietnam movies of the 1980's were almost all anti-war and played on many of the misconceptions, lies, and half-truths about the American soldier in Vietnam. We Were Soldiers is not your common Vietnam movie. Instead of depicting the American soldier as a savage, ruthless killer of women and children, it does a good job of focusing on the valor and bravery of the American soldier in Vietnam. If you like action-packed war movies, this is just the movie for you. The movie takes place in the battle of the Ia Drang Valley in November of 1965, where a small company of American soldiers clashed with nearly 2000 NVA regulars in the first major battle of American involvement in Vietnam. The film is based on the book ""We Were Soldier once and Young"" and follows the characters of Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and Joe Galloway, the author of the book. Without giving too much away, the entire 80% of the movie is bitter fighting in the valley, and 20% depicts the wives and loved ones of the men fighting in the battle and how they deal with the stress and strain of losing their loved ones.

This film does exactly that, it's full of characters who are more or less caricatures of what great examples of american men should be, with their wives and kids. And this is exactly why this film doesn't work well for non-americans, also, partly because of what was the real deal with Vietnam war. This is why it's nowhere close to Saving Private Ryan, because SPR wasn't about heroes but about regular americans who actually felt like human beings with their own characteristics and differences going to and suffering in war. SPR pulls you right in with them and even shows its characters' faults without trying to make them look superior, and so it's a universally liked film. We were soldiers does the opposite, it shows just enough violence and action with multiple slow mo shots and sentimental music and nicely acted drama with their families to boost up feelings for a very specific group of people in the whole world, or just the USA.",3.0,Anonymous,History

It's as if, at long last, Hollywood has offered the Heroes' Welcome to these brave men.A movie worth seeing, if only to remind ourselves not to let such disdain for necessary evils happen again.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Film Worth Watching,"This film surprised me because I did not realize it was about the very beginning of our involvement in Vietnam, and it begins with the French being massacred in 1954. We move up in time to 1964 and 1965. Barry Pepper is particularly memorable as a non-combat soldier carrying a camera, taking photographs. It's beautiful to see the black & white shots he's taken in contrast to the fighting behind him in color. The scene with him at the end talking to Mel Gibson is moving and realistic. Gibson's eyes fill with tears because he feels he should have died having lost so many men, and he asks Pepper to write about what happened here in this valley, the la Drang Valley, The Valley of Death.Another lovely quality to this film is showing the Vietnamese side of the battle, and their Commander making decisions. We see a dead Vietnamese soldier's diary showing a photograph of his wife and pages written in Vietnamese. This is a thoughtful remembrance for all the men who died in Vietnam, not just French and Americans.This has star quality all over it. The music is uneven sometimes, and I feel it could have been a 10 star film had a stronger musical score been developed. However there's plenty of pathos, sad and terrible battle scenes, and the painful delivery of letters to the wives of dead soldiers back in the States. Definitely a film worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Gripping and Accurate,"OK, I admit that I am a war movie buff, now that I have that out of the way.This should be a movie that everyone should see. Vietnam so damaged America and the American military that it took over a decade to erase the cancer. This movie portrays the 'best' part of the war for American troops who initially brought high ideals and expectations to battle. Reality however over a 3 day span, changed that forever. If you are looking for a movie that will allow you to experience emotions that very few movies can bring out, watch this movie, it has similar impact to Saving Private Ryan, or Black Hawk Down. I you have ever questioned the moral existence of soldiers, watch this movie. You will support them wholeheartedly, and pray we never send them out again.Usual steller portrayals by Mel and Sam. But the most powerful performances belong to the wifes left at home.",9.0,Anonymous,History
We Were Trying Too Hard To Be Different,"I consider We Were Soldiers an okay film at best. It conveys a simple message, and we understand the gist of the first major battle between the U.S. and North Vietnam. However, as it goes into details, that's when things start to go awry and near borderline tedium and boredom. My main problem lies with Randall Wallace's approach into making this film. Aside some shoddy directing, the script was mediocre. Unlike previous Vietnam War movie attempts, Wallace gets rid of all the negative aspects of the war (refreshing change), and fills the movie with good Christians and loving fathers versus a determined enemy composed of mostly cannon fodder. I liked how he portrayed the NV leader as a strategist, and a bit of human emotion (he is defending his homeland from the American invasion) but can Wallace do better than letting the NV soldiers run mindlessly towards blazing M-16s? Another question, what's the deal with the tacked on fictitious scenes towards the finale? Is this supposed to be more patriotic and dramatic? Hardly. The acting was average at best. It's difficult to deliver good characters with solid development, and recount the events of a major battle all under 2 hours, but it CAN be done. See Glory for a prime example. We Were Soldiers, falls a couple of steps short however. BUT, I can pardon that because like Black Hawk Down, this movie was made to only tell you about the La Drang battle and not provide characters to remember.Of course, all of these questions are a matter of personal preference with war movies. You either feel moved by tear-jerking scenes, or you can be joes like me that simply don't buy it (especially those who've read the novel). For me, I say again that this movie was okay, but certainly not great and certainly no Oscar contender.7/10",1.0,Anonymous,History

The lyrics to the true song by country duo Big & Rich...,"On November 8, 1965, during Operation Hump in War Zone D in South Vietnam, the 173rd Airborne Brigade were ambushed by over 1200 Viet Cong guerrillas. 48 American soldiers and over 400 of the enemy lost their lives on that fateful day.The country duo, Big & Rich, wrote and performed a wonderful song relating to this film, which appears on their album, Comin' To Your City. The title is, ""THE 8TH OF November.""-- The songwriters stated, ""This is a true story about a man we are honored to know. His name is Niles Harris of Deadwood, SD. He is one of just four of the thirty men from his 2nd Platoon of Charlie Company who survived when over 1200 Vietcong ambushed the 173rd Airborne Brigade. Every word of that song had to say so much. This song is one of the biggest things we've been a part of and one of the most enlightening.""The lyrics go like this:Said goodbye to his momma as he left South Dakota to fight for the red, white and blue. He was 19 and green, with a new M-16, just doing what he had to do. He was dropped in the jungle where the choppers would rumble with the smell of napalm in the air. And the sergeant said...look up ahead, like a dark evil cloud, 1200 came down on him, and 29 more. They fought for their lives but most of them died in the 173rd Airborne.Chorus:On the 8th of November the angels were crying as they carried his brothers away. With the fire raining down, and the hell all around, there were few men left standing that day. Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky, 1965, the 8th of November.Now he's 58, and his pony tail's gray, but the battle still plays in his head. He limps when he walks, but he's strong when he talks, about the shrapnel they left in his leg. He puts on a gray suit over his Airborne tattoo, and he ties it on one time a year. And remembers the fallen as he orders a tall one, and swallows it down with his tears.Chorus:Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky, 1965. On the 8th of November, the angels were crying as they carried his brothers away. With the fire raining down, and the hell all around, there were few men left standing that day.Chorus:Said goodbye to his momma as he left South Dakota to fight for the red, white and blue.

We Were Soldiers Definitely,"I have to definitely have to recommend this movie.  Having been an avid Vietnam War movie fanatic in the 1980's Vietnam War films such as Full Metal Jacket, Hanoi Hilton which portrayed the grittier side of the war, this was a change of pace.  Col. Hal Moore's WE WERE SOLDIERS shows the human side of the soldiers and their families and what they all went through during this time.  I also have note the performance of Sam Elliot, as Sgt.Major Plumley, this made it worth watching.  I should leave out Mel Gibson's role of Col. Hal Moore.

"Sadly Underrated. Best Vietnam Film Since the War, Itself","As I write this, the weighted score for this movie is 6.9, and I find that unbelievable.Every other Vietnam film I've seen (Full Metal Jacket, Good Morning Vietnam, Platoon, etc.) has painted the Vietnam war to be a messy, failed ""police operation,"" the US government to be a bunch of overstretched bureaucrats, and of course, war itself to be hell. Yeah, we get it. Thanks. How about something that actually honors those that fought and gave their lives for the ideals of our great country? Besides this movie, no other film I've seen has done so. This is the story the world missed when we heard about Vietnam, and it's time the stories of our veterans were respected. We Were Soldiers is the story of the first US troops that landed in Vietnam and of their leader. The film is an amazingly close and personal account of our first encounter on Vietnam soil, and it's beautifully and methodically executed. It makes the viewer feel the strategic tension of the first hours of operation from a commander's viewpoint, and from the soldiers' viewpoints.Looking over the demographic spread of voters, I'm glad to see 45+ years voting this so highly. I'm glad that the generation that remembers our country during the war, itself, considers this film so highly. The rest of us should too.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Mel Gibson war movie.,"The whole movie is based around the battle which apparently started the Vietnam war (so a worthy subject to dramatise). Its a war movie with the usual Gibson sentiment, but despite the occasional Americana its very good. The battle scenes are amazing, with some originality thrown in for a change, not just old hat war stuff. Brilliantly filmed as you would imagine, and the CGI effects are kept to an apparent minimum (clearly they are there otherwise there would be a massive drop in the extras available in Hollywood).There is at least an attempt to explain why the war happened, although it is far from satisfactory. There is even an attempt to show that the ""enemy"" really aren't any different from US. The script is not Oscar worthy, but at least its not the usual cliches we associate with war movies. The cliches are there, but they are few and far between. The story has no massive surprises as its not that kind of film. Its about the battle. People die, people survive. Its more about the sensation of war that is forced upon you.I confess to watching this with the intent of not liking it. I generally don't like Americans doing war movies. This surprised me however by being a good movie. Gibson's performance is very much Braveheart with a gun, but as a starting block, there are worst characters to imitate. The biggest problem is that you leave wondering just how much of the story is true. It is after all an American film about war, based on a novel (We Were Soldiers Once...And Young) by an American guy who was in the battle, released at a time when America is at a war of sorts and needs something positive to lift them.A good movie which would have been great accept for my own cynicism.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Gentlemen, prepare to defend yourselves","We Were Soldiers is a 2002 war film based on the book We Were Soldiers Once... and Young about the Battle of Ia Drang, the first major battle involving the United States during the Vietnam war.As far as movies depicting war goes, I believe this is one of the top films in the genre. It builds up just enough to care about the characters and then throws them in the fire leaving little time to catch a breath. The action is fast paced with some very good special effects that make the entire battle look realistic with several cringe worthy moments.

One interesting thing to note is that if you get this film on DVD, definitely watch the deleted scenes, in particular the debriefing of Col. Moore by Gen.

It was based on a book of the first account of U.S. troops fighting in Vietnam and I have to think it's pretty realistic.

Gripping from start to finish.,"I loved this movie so much, that I watched it 5 times in 2 days.I loved this movie for so many different reasons. It was gripping, real, emotionally hard from start to finish. 
The first 30 minutes, you learn about the characters & their families. 
You learn the true emotional struggles they & their families faced both before, during and after. 
What I personally found hard was that you fall for some of the characters only to find many of them killed in battle. Obviously many babies were born to soldiers who never get to know them or watch them grow up.My favourite scene would have to be, (without a doubt) the final farewell party where two of the soldiers mimed along to two songs. Greg Kinnear mimed the first song.
 
The second song -
""Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me"" Song by Mel Carter was the most beautiful, sexy but one of the saddest, because the soldiers & their wives were all lovingly kissing, caressing & saying goodbye to each other prior to the Soldiers leaving for the battle. All of them knowing that this could be the last night & time they ever see each other again. 
Sadly, for many it was... broke my heart!HELP PLEASE!!
If anyone can help identify a particular soldier/actor for me, I'd be very grateful.

I suspect the making of this film is part of the process which brought Mel Gibson back to his faith in God. This movie is not for children, but every young adult in America should see it to understand more about what their fathers went through in Vietnam.

Nothing New,"There have been many realistic war movies in recent years.  This is just another one.

C'mon.At the film's climax, Moore orders his men to fix bayonettes and charge the enemy.  Only that never happened.  In other words, the climax of this supposedly true film was invented.

One of among the best,"I'd put this movie right in the middle between Deer Hunter and Black Hawk Down. That's because it includes a view of the social side back home, like seen in Deer Hunter and it shows the utter carnage of war, like in Black Hawk Down. This movie ties well together those two different sides, it shows the suffering at home and on the battlefield. It shows also at least a little bit the side of the enemy, which is something you don't really see often. This movie doesn't make war look cool, like sadly some other American Vietnam movies do, nor does it take away from the ""real"" feeling. While watching you'll see soldiers die left and right, getting hit by bullets, burnt by fire and it all seems very real and horrifying and you can feel the loss. To follow the structure and progress of the battle is not all too easy, but I believe that it isn't either when you are there, in fact if I'd been fighting in such a place I'd been surprised if I'd been able to make any much sense of it!A true war drama! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
A good movie and a realistic one,"I do not particularly enjoy watching movies of this genre. I originally remember seeing We were Soldiers at the cinema and saw it last night again, this time on DVD. Firstly, the filmmakers endeavoured to be authentic in the details and the attention to detail reveals the seriousness to portray the events that occurred and reflect them with an honesty. The second is that an effort was made to show both the North Vietnamese and the US during the battle, not just from the American point of view. It did not glorify war but was sufficiently graphic to reveal that war is indeed horrifying and to dissuade those of us who may never find ourselves in such circumstances of having an illusions of it being otherwise.Like Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan, it brings a gritty realism to film. I do not watch such films for 'entertainment'. They shock me sufficiently enough to recognise to a degree what the reality of war can be like. I say a degree, because unless any of us find ourselves physically living and experiencing such things, we will never comprehend what it is like, but in as much as is possible, I think that such films do accomplish this.Before I saw the movie I understand that it depicted real events and having seen the documentary on the DVD, I appreciate further the enormous effort made behind the scenes in the making of this film. I think that it dealt with the battle, the issues surrounding it, the men that fought and died in a respectful and realistic manner.Whether we agree on the larger issues of the Vietnam War, about Mel Gibson as an actor/director/person or the morality of war in general we should all be able to agree on one thing. This is that War is a horrifying fact of life in our world and that we should recognise the costs of it and respect those who sometimes find themselves fighting in it and dying in it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great film,"""We Were Soldiers"" is an excellent war movie and an excellent film, period. It is meticulously researched and based on a fine book of the same title. Read that book, and you will understand that A) the U.S. filming locations ARE realistic in portraying the Central Vietnam Highlands and that B) many of the ""corny"" or ""sentimental"" events of the film are straight from the actual battle and have been religiously incorporated into the movie. If WWS isn't clever and ironic enough for some viewers, well, Platoon wasn't very hip, clever or ironic, either, and this movie would serve as a good introduction to that film. Mel Gibson's performance here ranks with his passionate, zesty work in Braveheart. He is never anything less than convincing, and yet for a larger-than-life role, he never comes across as an invincible hero or a superstar. Frankly, I forgot that I was watching Mel Gibson and simply accepted him as Col. Hal Moore. One of the best movies of the year, if not the best movie of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best war films ever.,"I find it hard to believe the incredible amount of hostility to this movie and the many criticisms of it, most of which are either absurdly nit-picking or just plain false.It is easy to say, with the benefit of hindsight, that America's whole involvement in Vietnam was a huge mistake, but the victory of the North caused a tremendous amount of suffering, unhappiness and loss of freedom, and still does. I'm not going to comment on the politics or history of the war, because obviously a lot of other people know much more about these issues than I do. But as a piece of cinema, and as a comment on war in general, the film is superb.Certainly the battle scenes were some of the most gruesome ever filmed. Perhaps they were over the top, but surely they are more true than the old movies where everybody died cleanly, with a minimum of pain, and frequently had time to speak their last will and testament before they signed out by closing their eyes.What I loved was the human dimension. Some critics have complained about the depiction of men having babies just before they go to war and get killed, but the fact is that it happened. After all, these were young men, many of them were married, and it was the time of the baby boom. I loved the intercutting between the battle field and the women back home. Sure it was excessively emotional, but if you can't get emotional about the waste of lives in war, then I think you have a serious problem. It was also great to see them humanise the enemy, particularly in the bit about the man who was killed after writing a letter to his wife or girlfriend. Is this racist? Don't be absurd.Is it propaganda? Well, it seems that if you disagree with the views expressed in a book or film, it is propaganda, while if you agree, it is honest, probing, important, etc. I certainly didn't agree with all the opinions expressed in We Were Soldiers. I think the policy of sending men to their deaths in order to bring back the bodies of those already dead is insanity, and I don't believe the use of napalm is ever justified. But this movie is not in any sense propaganda. It is possibly unrealistic in the sense that it is dramatised, not documentary, but it is a very honest portrayal of real men and women trying to cope with a real, ghastly situation.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The Real 1st. Battle of Vietnam,"Excellent Movie!!! Vietnam and combat as it really was. I only have one problem with the story line as it is presented to the public. With all due respect to Lt. General Hal Moore and the brave soldiers of the 1st Air Cave that fought this battle; The Battle of the Ia Drang Valley was not the first battle of the Vietnam War. The first battle took place almost exactly 3 months earlier in I Corps on the Van Tuong peninsula... Throughout July 1965 evidence had accumulated showing a VC buildup in southern I Corps, especially south of Chu Lai. A deserter confirmed to interrogators that the 1st VC Regiment, consisting of the 60th and 80th Battalions, the 52nd VC Co., and a Co. of the 45th Weapons Battalion, had established a base in the Van Tuong village complex.Operation Starlite was the first offensive military action conducted by a purely U.S. military unit during the Vietnam War. Originally code named ""Satellite"", due to a loss of electricity, a clerk made a typing error when the plan was being typed up and Operation ""Starlite"" was born. D-Day was to be 18 August, 1965. Lt.Col. Bull Fisher's 2nd Bn., 4th Marines, were to be heli-lifted into pre-designated LZ's inland, Lt.Col. Muir's 3rdBn, 3rd Marines, minus ""Mike"" Company, were to make an amphibious Landing and LtCol. Bodley's, 3rd Bn, 7th Marines, designated the SLF, and were to remain in reserve.

-insert positive review title-,"To all the people who gave this movie negative reviews, I ask you- did you even watch this movie? If the answer to that is yes, I have to wonder exactly what rock you've been living under, that you have no idea how human beings work.Let's take a look at some of the criticism we've seen here:1- 'It's clich√©!' Some of the clich√©s cited- Hal Moore is too perfect, the Americans are all heroes, the housewives are all good little housewives.On Hal Moore being 'too perfect', don't be stupid. People like that actually exist. I know a few who come very close. I myself come pretty damn close, except I'm not married. The kids I devote my time to, pray with, and try to teach real-world concepts to are someone else's. If a real four-to-six-year-old child asked you what war was, what exactly would you tell her? If it's anything more specific and gruesome than what the movie said, I'd have to wonder about your judgment and rethink ever leaving a child that young in your care.Next, the Americans are all heroes. Yes, because charging off against orders, getting your platoon cut off from the main body of soldiers, and getting most of your men killed by running after obvious bait into an obvious trap is very heroic. And of course, we all look up to and idolize pilots who accidentally bomb their own lines and get their own soldiers killed or severely wounded.And yes, the above paragraph should be read with the heaviest infliction of sarcasm you can manage.And oh, my God, a movie that takes place in the 60s actually has housewives acting like they would in the 60s. How dare Hollywood. How dare they.2- 'Nobody says stupid things like 'tell my wife I love her' when they're dying!'Anyone saying this has obviously never thought they were going to die. As someone who has come close to dying - five times - I can tell you without embarrassment or shame that the only thought on my mind all five times was the fear that I didn't tell and show the dearest person to me (my little sister) how much I loved her. I wasn't thinking of how much it hurt, how scared I was, why I was in those situations. All I could think was 'Did I do enough to show Diana how much I love her? Does she know how much I owe her, how much I care about her, how grateful I am for all she's done for me?' And if what is nearest and dearest to a person is their country, I have no trouble believing that their sacrifice in said country's name would be uppermost in their mind. When we as human beings think we're about to die, our minds turn to the things that are most important to us. To a husband and father, that's likely his family. For me, it's my sister, who's the only person I actually think of as family. For a true dyed-in-the-wool patriot, that would most definitely be his country.3- 'It's pro-Vietnam!'No, it's not. It even comes right out and says, through the mouth of a Vietnamese soldier, that America going into Vietnam didn't change anything- it only made the body count higher. How is a movie that flat-out says a war did nothing but get a lot of people needlessly killed support said war?4- 'It pushes religion!'Religious people pray. Get over it.And please, take note of who leaves what kind of review here. I couldn't help but notice that not a single Vietnam vet who left a review for this movie had anything bad to say about it. Think- the people who fought in the war this movie depicts can only praise it. That tells you something.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A quite competent and watchable war drama,"WE WERE SOLDIERS **1/2Vietnam was a horrifying militaristic blunder.  American governmental officials thought the operation would be an efficient and effective strategy, only to discover resistance of the strongest kind under the guise of the Vietnamese Communist founder Ho Chi Minh.  After the first confrontations, America eventually joined the fray to eradicate the problems in Vietnam.  They were wrong.  In the movie, the Viet-Cong military leader opposed to Gibson's company said something along the lines of ¬ëthe Americans will think that they've won this war', something that held some gravity. Gibson plays a leader of a company that will land at la Drang and assess the problems.  The opening sequences focus more on the emotional build-up to the war through the eyes of the companies' wives and girlfriends and the grief that they carry that their loved ones will be going to war.The crux of the movie shows the horrific action involving the company landing in Vietnam and the Viet Cong that are protecting their mother land. The results were horrifying.  Needless deaths with little or no plan, with hundreds slaughtered after being surrounded by the Viet Cong.  The movie was sound, with it giving a good overall portrayal of the brutalities of war. However, after watching previous movies like Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line and Platoon the brilliant action sequences with bullets flying to all parts and the brutal kill shots now look a little more ordinary.One of the most emotional sequences of the movie involved Gibson's wife (played by Stowe).  A taxi would regularly come and go in the vicinity were the wives lived, which turned out to be the fateful taxi that would give the worst possible information that a member of the company had died.  The driver one day walks up to Stowe's house and looking rather grim, fidgets with an envelope.  Stowe awaits the news beginning to cry.  He announces that he's looking for Stowe because he wants to know where another woman lives.  The impact was tremendous.  She shouts at the forlorn man 'Did you know what you did to me then', before the man starts walking away apologetically.  He stops and almost in a whimper suggests that he doesn't like doing the job, but he's just trying to do it the best he can.  Stowe then takes on the responsibility by telling the man that all envelopes from that day forward would be delivered to her.  Moments like that in the movie will probably bring a tear to the eye.  Stowe's response, and the isolation of a man just trying to do a simple job in the worst circumstances.But if the emotional study was excellent, the war combat scenes were a little unbelievable.  Not in a sloppy way by no means, but for me something didn't click.  That may be my problem and not yours.  From the Patriot and Braveheart, I believed in Gibson's performance.  But I didn't believe in him much here.  As the movie progressed he got better and better, but the early damage whereby I thought he was going to break out into a ¬ëWhat Women Want' comic sketch set the tone.  Overall the film is worth a watch, but it didn't show me anything new.  Maybe it's because the impact of the aforementioned war films was so great because they were the first to show what war is truly like, and that any films after these would have to show something different and diverse otherwise I just take it for granted.",,Anonymous,History

excellent depiction but its lenght denied the rest of the story,"An outstanding example of the ineptitude of higher command and how the political nature of the war denied the American soldier the finest combat leaders possible. One Reviewer cites deviations from the actual story line that does not really detract from the authenticity of the whole endeavor. The effects of the Armys inability to properly inform next of kin was dramatically displayed. The emphasis was placed on the courage of the American soldier and the outstanding leadership displayed by all the officers involved in the units directly involved in the battle. Combat scenes very realistically portrayed the near hopelessness of the American situation, and how Army higher commands main concern was avoiding possible embarrassment. The only negative was the failure to demonstrate how the forces sent to relieve the surrounded Forces were decimated upon their return march back to the main base. The hubris of the subsequent command was discussed in the book, needlessly causing the death of hundreds of American soldiers. A good example of how ring knockers priority is not the soldier but their own personal advancement.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent War Movie,Reminiscent of a major Vietnam battle that is a true story with input from those who were there. What is not covered is another battle soon after that almost wiped out a whole battalion of Army soldiers. Many lives were lost all due to those politicians and their families & friends who refuse to serve but will sacrifice you and me in a heartbeat.Mel Gibson provides an excellent acting role as Lt. Col. Moore. One almost feels sorry for the Vietnamese as war raged on and on with no end in sight. One asks when is enough men and women sacrificed to realize the war must be halted?There were significant mistakes made by the Army leadership as shown in this movie.,10.0,Anonymous,History
Pity those that will never understand the courage of such men,"This movie has a soul.It shows respect for the American Soldier.  It isn't politically correct among many, including some of the posters here to do that it seems.Pity those who can't grasp the concept of men who believe there are things bigger than themselves and who bet their very lives on that belief.  The film accomplishes this tribute to the soldier by also giving due to the NVA Regular who fought with bravery. Nothing shows the nobility of a fighting man than by showing the quality and courage of his opponent. Like Colonel Moore says in his prayer however, he understands their humanity to a degree but wants them to die in battle and not his men.  That's compassion laced with a real world understanding of how things are.Men who throw themselves on grenades, who charge into enemy fire, who while wounded themselves risk themselves again to save a comrade are not Hollywood cliches.  There are countless citations of such acts made from Breed's Hill to the Sunni Triangle.  With the Sunni Triangle, it's happening as I type these words.Kinear did a fine job showing the humor that is so common among men in the military.  Sheppard caught the spirit of the professional Sgt. Major, Barry Pepper displays well a time when an American journalist saw that he was first an American and then a reporter.This movie captures the worth and nobility of the typical American soldier.By the way, the only reason we have a film industry that produce films from all perspectives is because the American soldier made it possible. And this holds true for every nation in the world where films are made that are not censored by their government.  Because if it wasn't for the United States and her soldiers, freedom wouldn't exist anywhere.Remember that when you eat your popcorn.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Nationalist propaganda,"""One more thing dear Lord, about our enemies, ignore their heathen prayers and help us blast those little b*****ds straight to hell.""""It's when some people, in another country or any country, try to take the lives of other people, and soldiers like your daddy, you know it's my job to go over there and stop them.""Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Moore (who served in the Korean War)""We visited 12 representative sites at which massacres were committed in 1950-51 by U.S. forces, or South Korean paramilitary and military units under the command of U.S. forces, meeting many of the survivors and receiving extensive, riveting testimony from more than two dozen witnesses. Several of these sites have only recently been revealed, including: (1) a rugged mountain location near Kwangju where reportedly a biological (mycotoxin T-2?) or chemical (gas or herbicide?) warfare agent (a ""whitish powder"" or mist sprayed from light planes) was used causing a dark skin discoloration prior to killing several hundred villagers in the fall of 1951, suggesting death from a type of hemorrhagic fever; (2) a newly discovered second Japanese mine near Kyongsang that served as a depository for hundreds of bodies; (3) the Jin Chi Ryung railroad tunnel near Chinju; and (4) the Wonbuk railroad tunnel near Masan."" (Revelations of US War Crimes in Korea, 2001).It is hard to empathize with Gibson's character from the start, as he appears to be blinded with nationalist sentiment. He fails to mature, in terms of his nationalist views, throughout the movie. However, I don't want to say the entire movie ""We Were Soldiers"" was meaningless propaganda. At the end, the movie offers a humane and insightful comment:""Such a tragedy... So this will become an American War.

Read the book first - then see the film - highly recommended,"A few hints at the content of the film (and not a book review):-Having read the book, and now just caught the film, I'm surprised by the amount of negative comments regarding the film.I suggest people read the book to understand that things were a lot different in 1965, to '67-'75 - I'm sure that Authors Lt Gen Harold Moore and Joseph L. Galloway did not exaggerate the gung ho sprit of the WWII and Korean veterans who took part in the fight at Ia Drang, nor the greenness showed by the 18-20 year olds, and whose lack of combat experience was reflected in either action or lack of it (and that goes for some of the first time Lieutenants).The leaders in this battle, the aircrews, and the ordinary infantry soldier (if there could be such a thing) did what they thought right, there was no thought of not following orders, nor of being in peek physical fitness, or not wanting to help your fellow soldier. The issues and feelings that later arose during the last 6 odd years of the Vietnam War, rightly, got a lot of people thinking, and that includes the soldier asked to go die for their country.But that was later.In 1965 America was still experiencing a growth and prosperity not seen since the turn of the century, and at this time people still went to church, aspired to have the perfect wife and family complete with picket fence around the yard and would un-questionably die for their country - this was reflected in the high standards expected of the US Army, and by the Majors and Generals asked to lead and set the standards during the early stages of the Vietnam War (please don't think I'm saying that the US army does not now have high standards - of course it does - high standards set, in part, due to the terrible price paid in Vietnam).Of course war is futile - a message that should be told as many times as possible, in as many different ways, maybe then we and our rulers/leaders/statesmen/stateswomen will listen.I highly recommend the film, because I highly recommend the power of the book - go read, go see.",,Anonymous,History

Delivers everything a war flick should contain,"I was really disappointed when I heard of the negative reviews this movie received because I did not find a single thing wrong with this movie, it has the perfect balance of combat, training, the soldiers getting to know each other and build their relationship's as comrades willing to take a bullet for each other, and the perfect balance of the characters personal lives and families. This movie has the best balance I have ever seen, the combat is unmatched in realism, but if you are not lucky enough to see this movie in 5.1 surround, than you are missing out on a lot, because this movie audio blasts from all directions, from the screams of the wounded, to the main characters giving out orders, to the napalm bombs blowing up and giving off that distinctive sound of fire like a whip, to the bullets brushing off the leaves of the trees, to the explosion of artillery, the sound amazingly surpasses the visuals. Another strength of this movie, is its accuracy, in this movie you don't see people smoking weed and constantly drinking alcohol, like many Vietnam war flicks like to make out how our troops were in Vietnam, to try to de rank them as human beens, like they were a bunch of animals, well no, this movie is accurate to the tee, except for some minimal unimportant stuff. Some of the best scenes of this movie were when it came to be night time, there were 2 nigh time scenes, number 1 was the platoon cutoff scene where bugum tells the sarge to request illumination, and the sarge agrees and right in front of theme no farther than 15 yards were the ARVN, in another, they wake up to see the ARVN walk by theme, they pretend to be dead, and then the sarge messes up and makes too much noise putting his gun on Semi-auto, because his safety was on, it was a close nerve-racking experience, for movie viewers, overall see the movie, its like 10 bucks and its worth a lot more than that, if the Vietnam war means a lot to you not for the history of the country, but for the history of the 58,000 who died for stupidness, and for the MIA who are still out there, and the remains that still lie out there in the uninhabited jungles, RIP brave souls, you will not be forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The start of Americanization of the Vietnam War,"This is a powerful movie in many aspects. The first is the dramatic war action where the combat deaths of thousands of men are depicted. It is brutal, savage and unforgiving, just as close quarter combat is. The second is the undercurrent of how the U. S. military made some colossal mistakes in its prosecution of the war. The battle being depicted is one where the new style of American cavalry, flying into combat on helicopters, is being developed. The third aspect is the home front, where the wives of the men in the unit are being notified of their deaths in combat by telegram delivered by a cabdriver.
Mel Gibson plays U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, the leader of a battalion being trained for air cavalry operations. He is also an academic and has studied the massacre of a French unit by the Viet Minh in 1954. He is determined to avoid the mistakes of the French, where they did not know the terrain and had no intelligence regarding the strength of the opposing forces.
When Moore's 400 man unit is dropped into an area where an American base has been attacked, the American commanders have no idea regarding the number of enemy forces in the area. When a soldier of the North Vietnamese Army is captured, he reveals that the immediate area is the base for a unit of over 4,000 men. Immediately understanding their predicament, Moore prepares his men for a major battle. The action is fierce, yet the Americans hold on, largely due to the American aerial firepower. Orders come down that make no sense to Moore and he ignores them.
This movie is based on the battle of Ia Trang Valley, the first major engagement between U. S. forces and those of North Vietnam. In terms of casualties, it was an American victory, as nearly 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers were killed. Yet, it was a learning experience for the North Vietnamese commanders, from that point they realized that they must proceed with caution in engaging in a major battle with U. S. forces. The ability of American commanders to call in devastating air strikes meant that anything approaching a siege was suicide.
This movie also depicts what was one of the primary U. S. tactics. Occupy a region, engage in a firefight, hold it for awhile and then pull out. It was not a war where both sides moved forces along a front in order to expand the territory that they controlled. The ending is powerful as it shows Moore walking up to the section of the Vietnam Memorial wall where the names of the fallen of his unit are etched in stone.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Lousy movie,"Like another viewer has said, it is indeed difficult to write 10 lines on this garbage.The story may be true or not, this movie was bad. Lame, despite all the fireworks. The music? So boring! Sentimental schmaltz stuff of the worst degree, creating NO atmosphere whatsoever, only seconding the sorry pictures.By judging from the battle scenes, I expected that at least say 250 out of the 396 or so have died. Instead there were only 71 dead as we learn at the end. Sorry, but I had to laugh, the battle pictures we've been shown by the director seem not correspond to this relatively low casualty count. And of course we never learn how many enemy men were mowed down. This battle has only one side...Another idiotic scene: One of the first guys (some Lieutenant) coming in with the first wave spots an enemy scout and immediately runs after him for into unknown enemy territory, but not only for a few meters but he keeps on chasing and chasing until finally the men draw fire. Worst of all, he drags all his men with him!! I mean how stupid a military leader can you possibly be?? Again, this may be a true incidence or not, but if a soldier behaves so stupidly, he doesn't deserve any better than getting whacked. I only felt pity for the poor fellows who had to follow their ""leader"" and got mostly killed in the process as well.What happened to Madeleine Stowe?? Did she see a plastic surgeon to get her lips siliconed? Not sure, but she looked terribly bad here, suddenly has grown old in her face. And I do not believe that this was due to the ""burdened"" role she had to perform here. Her character was to forget about anyway, like all the other clich√© soldier babes who looked all so good and shiny of course... All BS for me. The only one credible character in this sorry flick was the UPI photographer (Pepper?), the sharpshooter from Private Ryan. I really like the guy, he has a good intensity on screen.I could go on ranting some more, but I could only repeat what other viewers have said already. I rate this crap a 2 out of 10. I give it 2 only because some (not all!) of the battle scenes seemed credible enough, especially the one night attack where the soldier says he can ""smell 'em"" and they light up the forest and indeed the enemy is right at them already.Hamburger Hill is the much, much more touching and engaging film.",2.0,Anonymous,History

"Explosive, both in action and characterisations.","On Sunday November 14th, Lt. Col. Hal Moore {Mel Gibson} and his 400 strong regiment touched down at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley, Vietnam. Surrounded by around 2000 North Vietnamese soldiers who were well trained and well versed with the terrain, Moore's troopers fought for 56 hours. It was a bloody and brutal battle that was the first major engagement of the Vietnam War. It was ""The Valley Of Death"" in more ways than one.Directed by Randall Wallace, We Were Soldiers is based on the book ""We Were Soldiers Once¬Ö And Young"" by Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway. As always when a War film comes out you get the usual statements trundled out. Things such as ""the most realistic yet"" and ""finally a film to tell it as it was,"" both of which were applied to Wallace's movie. If they happen to be true I have no idea, what with not being a combat veteran myself. What I do know is that personally, We Were Soldiers hits many many high points in its running time of 138 minutes.After a crucial 30 minute build up of the characters, the film switches to the landing of the ""boys"" in Vietnam. From here the action never lets up, with Wallace and his team stunningly recreating the brutality and harshness of this bloody engagement. But crucially the action does not detract from its characters, having been engaged with them at the start of the film, the makers ensure that we stay with these men throughout the battle. Also of note is that the film shows the Vietnamese side of the battle, the fair treatment of both sides a most rewarding thing to see in a War film. There's brilliant cut aways to the Women and families at home, themselves fighting a battle to not lose their minds as their men fight in some faraway land. The emotional aspect significantly racked up high as the dreaded telegrams start being delivered by nameless, faceless yellow cab drivers.The men of the cast are uniformly strong, particularly Gibson, Sam Elliott, Greg Kinnear, Barry Pepper & Ryan Hurst. While Madeleine Stowe & Keri Russell deliver heartfelt and believable turns on the Women's side. Dean Semler's cinematography is done justice by the new High Definition age and Nick Glennie-Smith's score is just a wonderful, emotive arrangement that taps into the psyche of the viewer. It's looking like it is a divisive film now, certainly in the context of Vietnam War films. So with that it is in danger of becoming the forgotten ""Nam"" movie. Which would be a crying shame for this is a tip top dramatisation of an horrific historical event. Point made, nobody forgotten, great great film. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

I remember watching a round screen with a magnifier (RCA)showing clips from Korea. I remember watching a 25"" color newsbroadcast showing 1-2 hour old clips from Vietnam. I remember watching live action on CNN as laser-guided ordinance selectively destroyed pieces of Iraq.

"I support ""We Were Soldiers"" as the best of the Viet Nam movies.","My late husband, a West Point graduate, was in VN in 1965 as an adviser to the South Vietnamese Army. He received 2 Bronze Medals with the V device as well as the Purple Heart, the Combat Infantryman's Badge & several awards from the VN government. He cared deeply for the Vietnamese people with whom he lived that year, and was proud to have served. He was there just before this battle occurred.When the movies about Viet Nam started coming out, he was horrified by the way they depicted the war & he refused to see most of them. ""We Were Soldiers"" was made after his death in 2001. I went to see it alone because I had the feeling this one would be different. It was, & I cried when it was over because Sam wasn't there to see it with me. That was the Army he knew, not the Army of ""Platoon"". Among other criticisms,he said he never saw drugs being used AT ALL during his year there.I have a friend who served with Col. Moore (later to become a General) & he has talked with him about the movie & the book from which it was made. Moore said the the movie was at least 85% factual, the way it really was. And Joe Galloway, the reporter, also has said that it was well-done. He has been back to VN in the last few years and actually met with the officer who was leading the North Vietnamese they were fighting. They shook hands & the General said to Galloway ""I'm glad I did not kill you.""As for people thinking that ""Platoon"" is THE factual movie on that sad war, yes Oliver Stone was there. When the movie was seen by the veteran who was Stone's Company Commander at the time, he was enraged. (This comes from an American Legion Magazine). He called Stone & asked ""Where the ""bleep"" did you get all that stuff you put in the movie? It's not fair to misrepresent our guys that way."" Stone's reply was that he took dramatic license.In closing, I'll just say that I have not spoken with a single VN vet who was not supportive of ""We Were Soldiers"". A wonderful movie, and it's based on the truth.... no ""dramatic license"" needed",,Anonymous,History

Excellent,"Excellent movie I thought, better than Black Hawk Down - better setup, more context.  A few things I have read about this movie - Galloway and Moore would not sell the story to Hollywood for quite a while, they wanted to be sure the story was treated with the proper respect, not turned into an anti-war screed, so they only sold the rights to Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson when they were convinced the story would be told accurately.  The dialog is what was actually said, those who call it a cliche, what should they have done, change it to reflect someone elses idea of what would sound realistic?The movie is really about the code of honor among the men, the sacrafice they made, it makes no judgement about the merits of the war, those that complain about that definitely miss the point.  And of course, its about the American side, yes it treats American deaths with more feeling than NV deaths.  But there is some view of the other side, presented in a balanced manner.  Good job by Gibson, probably helps that he played a compelling character, and nice supporting role for Sam Eliot.  8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
War movie with a simple plot,"I have not too much to say about this movie because I felt the movie didn't have to much to say. It's the depiction of a combat held in Vietnam by Hal Moore's company.

I stick to ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" (in that order) as my favorite war movies. Now those are movies that say a lot.The thing that kept me from rating this movie with a 7 was the technical achievement of it. The sound is superb and the whole photography is amazing.As with ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" the level of realism of ""We were soldiers"" is a little bit over the edge.

A Vietnam Movie That Wasn't Needed,"I've always said that the best Vietnam movies were made in the 80's and this crud helped prove my point. This was some ra-ra soldier superhero crap to put a better spin on the Vietnam War. Our heroes of note were Mel Gibson with gross overacting to play an American soldier, and Sam Elliott who was so tough that even death was afraid of him. These two bigger than life characters stood tall when everyone else ducked as though the bullets were too afraid to touch them. They stomped around the battlefield like maestros of an orchestra and they were duly rewarded for it. Mel Gibson got plenty of slo-mo hero shots while Sam Elliott called General Custer a p***y because it made him sound tough.""We Were Soldiers"" is a pointless piece devoid of any depth that wants us to believe that a few heavily outmanned and out-armed soldiers with the help of God and timely airstrikes were able to overrun the enemy. It was a whirlwind of action with everything happening almost instantaneously: charges into battle, airstrikes, even the official death notices came next day. All the slow-motion, heroic music, and explosives did nothing to help this movie. In the end this was a weak ode to the fallen soldiers of Vietnam.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"maybe worse than ""the patriot""","Well I never liked Braveheart much, and very much disliked The Patriot. This film was sort of the next in the series I guess. Credit to the special effects- fairly realistic I would imagine. The story was true, I guess, so can't be criticised. But the film was difficult to watch, it view of the war was very much skewed- no disrespect to the American casualties -but a lot of Vietnamese died as well, the film only half made an effort to show this. I felt that dealing with religion in the film was out of place -and badly done. Also, dealing with racism was done rather too obviously, with an apparently spontaneous speech from one of the wives. All in all, too many speeches -every time a soldier spoke, it was a profound statement -and the american flag perhaps featured too much for the international audience. Considering the main character was also the books author, I was a bit doubtful about the films accuracy because he (Mel Gibson) was some sort of superhero in the film. It would have been better if someone else told the story. Not a classic by any means.",,Anonymous,History
Great Film of an Important Historical Battle,"There are few 'war' films that get nearly everything perfect and manage to encompass so many perspectives so powerfully. This is one of them and it is one of the best historical accounts of a moment of the Vietnam War.The combat scenes in the film are incredibly realistic. It shows the real chaos, confusion, desolation, isolation, hope and despair of close combat. Unlike most 'war' films, the vast majority of screen-time is dedicated to the actual battle. Every minute of the action is realistic, dense, frenetic, perfectly edited and enthralling. No other film before or since achieves this level of intensity, realism and horror of combat and for such a sustained amount of screen-time. I'd guess that over 70% of the film time is dedicated to the battle and combat which is the absolute best aspect of the movie.The movie also effectively dramatizes the 'chess-under-pressure' decision-making from both the American and North Vietnam generals. Furthermore, we are not provided a one-dimensional, sneaky and faceless 'enemy' hiding in the bush and shooting from the tree-lines. The North Vietnamese army is respectfully depicted as a worthy, dedicated, intelligent and cunning fighting force.The story of the wives back home is very effective and moving as well, at least once the 'telegrams' start coming in. Also, the little CGI that is used is very well done and unnoticeable... it doesn't stand out as CGI or detract in anyway.Of course, Mel Gibson and Sam Eliot were great. Greg Kinear is excellent too. Madeline Stow is fine but what's going on with those lips?The only aspect of the film that I wasn't crazy about was a few moments of moral grandstanding that seemed forced and unnecessary. A little too much 'spelling-it-out' for the audience instead of just letting us see for ourselves- which is so much more effective. Some of the 'character development' scenes felt obligatory and formulaic so that the audience would connect more when they died later. Many of the scenes that were not part of battle just felt like material added on for contrast to the fighting. Nothing bad but not as inspired or done nearly as well as any of the scenes on the actual battlefield. The Battle is the real star and story of this film. All else feels a little superfluous and formulaic in contrast to the fighting but gratefully, there is not much 'all else'.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, but it's a Vietnam movie, nothing we haven't seen before.  Mel Gibson pulls off a good performance as well as the other cast members.  This is a bloody movie though, so this movie isn't for everyone.  In the first 5 minutes you see a lot of blood, shooting and what not, but I guess that is to be expected with a war movie.  Anyhow, there isn't a whole lot that I can say about this movie.  There really wasn't anything in the film that I didn't like, but there also wasn't any thing that really stuck out as great. It's a good movie and if you like war movies, then you'll probably like this one.  But if you are just a so-so war-movie fan (like myself) then you'll probably think it was just ""OK"".  Anyhow, I hope you enjoy the movie, and thank for reading.-Chris",8.0,Anonymous,History
Didn't age very well,"I remember watching this movie as a teenager and how much I loved it. After rewatching it today I saw many flaws that derogated it's quality.Firstly there's a long intro into characters' lives that's not really profound except seeing how much they love their service and the country, no character development whatsoever and when they die later on you can't really care..Then we jump into the war zone where everything is happening so fast that we never actually see what is it that guys are fighting for. They just keep running into each other several times without hesitation or plan. But, there's more than enough time for everyone to say something inspiring while dying: I don't mind dying for my country, tell my wife I love her etc. These things are just annoying for me.Thirdly Mel Gibson is undestroyable and yet human and gentle mythical commander. He does it all; talks on the phone, giving orders back and forth, killing Vietkongs and he still finds the time to pee on their artillery tubes which work perfectly after that..
Just an average movie which I don't want to watch again.",5.0,Anonymous,History
can't help it,"despite I was entertained and amused... i give this film a very low rating, because they still can't leave the clich√©s out of movies,why... why?????the good : the action of course, very nice done... people who says it's to brutal I think the real thing must be much much much worse. the original approach, the enemy point of view, the wives point of view.the bad: almost everything else... so many over-clich√©d cinematographic things we've already seen a 10000000 times make me sick. it was a good thing to see the Vietnam point of view, but that could be much better , realistic and not in a clich√© way. same for some death scene's. and also the action is maybe its best point and very realistic. I thought the Vietnam soldiers were a bit to silly portrayed I mean, running into machine guns by the hundreds without shooting themselves even if they are in a 2 yard range of the enemy...OK I was'nt there, but I don't think Vietnam soldiers were that bad :-)the ugly: the Mel Gibson character. though I like Gibson as an actor. he was just playing a crybaby commander... I mean, he's crying all the time.. wtf?? surely I can imagine a commander isn't very happy when he's men getting slaughtered by the dozens. but I can't imagine a commander of his rank is actually crying about it in front of his man... I mean imagine, you're a soldier in the most fearsome battle of your career, you are totally outnumbers and you have severe losses... and what is the commander doing? he's crying like a baby for it... I would not be so motivated anymore as well my fellow comrades",,Anonymous,History
A Sobering Meditation On War,"The title of the memoir that inspired this film, `We Were Soldiers Once...And Young,' written by Lt. General Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway, says much about what this film ultimately conveys, as in a few words it addresses the state of being of the individuals, as well as the country, which so soon would be embroiled in one of the most controversial wars in the history of America.  `We Were Soldiers,' adapted for the screen and directed by Randall Wallace, is an uncompromising look at war and the commitment of those who wage it.  It's a true story told realistically, and moreover, in terms that are humanistic rather than political, which succeeds in making it a riveting drama that is both absorbing and emotionally involving.It's November, 1965; some 400 American troops-- the 7th Cavalry-- led by Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), take the field at LZ X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, where they are quickly surrounded by over 2000 North Vietnamese soldiers.    The ensuing battle will last for three days, and it marks the first major confrontation between America and North Vietnam, a battle from which many, on both sides, will not walk away; and on hand to record it as it happens, is reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper).  Going in, Moore knows what they are up against, and he promises his men two things: That he will be the first to set foot on the field and the last to leave it; and he will bring every man back home with him, alive or dead-- no one will be left behind.  And it's a promise he keeps.With this film, Wallace succeeds where two other, recent depictions of historic battles, `Pearl Harbor' and `Black Hawk Down'-- both good films in their own right-- failed; and it's because he managed to achieve just the right balance between the rendering of the battle itself and the human element involved.  Of the two, `Pearl Harbor' is a close runner-up; the love story leading up to the battle was perhaps a bit extended, though ultimately engaging, whereas `Black Hawk Down' put the viewer in the battle, but was emotionally uninvolving.  Here, Wallace not only gives you a battle that is brilliantly staged and presented, but before he takes you there he makes sure you know those who are about to die, and the loved ones they are leaving behind.  War has many casualties, and they are not all on the battlefield; and beyond the realism of the fight, this is where Wallace makes his strongest statement, as during the three days of the battle he makes you privy to what the soldiers wives and families are going through at home, as well, waiting for the dreaded Western Union telegrams being delivered by cab drivers because the army wasn't prepared to deal with it.The film is effective because Wallace keeps the human element at the heart of the story while he presents a perspective to which the audience can relate on very personal terms.  In short, he gives you the `whole story,' that enables you to know the horror of the firefight, as well as the throat clenching terror of seeing a yellow cab drive up to the front of your house, knowing full well what it means.  This is a prime example of filmmaking and storytelling at it's best; and it's a commendable achievement by Wallace.Gibson is perfectly cast and does an excellent job of bringing Hal Moore to life with a convincing portrayal of a man dedicated to both his family and his life as a soldier.  Moore is focused and determined, and Gibson makes us realize that he knows the seriousness of what he is about to undertake, as well as the possible dire consequences thereof.  The real strength of the character, however, is in the fact that he is not some kind of superhero out to win the war single-handedly, but a man who lives and loves and feels like anyone else, who bleeds when he is cut and hurts when he loses one of his men.  A man who feels guilty that he is still living when his men die.  And it's all captured in Gibson's strong and credible performance.Besides Gibson, there are a number of exceptional supporting performances in this film, most notably, Madeleine Stowe, as Julie Moore, Hal's wife; Sam Elliott, as the gruff and seasoned veteran, Sergeant Major Basil Plumley; Greg Kinnear, as Major Bruce Crandall, the helicopter pilot with a memorable nickname; Chris Klein, as Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, a new father to whom Moore gives a perspective on the war that enables him to face the job he must do; Keri Russell, as Barbara Geoghegan, the young wife and new mother who must watch her husband go off to fulfill his destiny; and Pepper, turning in an extremely affecting performance as Joe Galloway.The supporting cast includes Ryan Hurst (Sergeant Savage), Mark McCracken (Ed `Too Tall' Freeman), Edwin Morrow (Willie), Jsu Garcia (Captain Nadal), Matt Mangum (Private Soprano), Brian Tee (Nakayama), Joseph Hieu (NVA Major), Don Duong (Ahn), Alan Dale (Westmoreland) and Simbi Khali (Alma).  A film like this goes far in demonstrating the power and effectiveness of the medium that created it; it will never, however, enable us to understand war, because war-- in all it's myriad manifestations-- is beyond human comprehension.  But it has always been with us and always will be, and a film that is well made and presented, a film like `We Were Soldiers,' is important because it lends a needed perspective that allows us to take a step back and consider the magnitude of our endeavors in these regards, and the price we must pay for freedom.  It leaves one with a sense of pride and patriotism, but tempered with a sobering concern for seeking altruistic alternatives.  It may be only a dream; but hopefully, it's one that someday all the people of the world will share.  9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History

We Were Soldiers,"this film focusing on one particular battle of The Vietnam War was really well done.it really puts you right in the middle of the action,and shows you just how hellish war really is.it paints the soldiers as real human beings,with feelings and emotions,not as gung-ho trigger happy psychos.there's no bravado here,no over the top flag waving patriotism.the movie shows a bit of The North Vietnamese perspective too.i liked the music.it's very somber and fitting.the acting was excellent by all.i thought the ending was very good,as well.all in,this is a very good war film that never really got the recognition It deserved.for me,We Were Soldiers is an 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
You're a soldier (H√ºsker D√º),"""We were soldiers"" is just another useless war movie about the Vietnam war and undoubtedly one of the worst war movies ever made. It contains an important number of faults. It's hard for me to believe that it's based on a true story because the story of the movie's got a Hollywood character and the vision of the Vietnam war remains very pedantic.Randal Wallace's movie also ranks among the most violent war movies ever made. The battle sequences are very impressive and bloody. Moreover, Wallace obviously wanted to stabilize his movie between the fight sequences at Vietnam and the sequences with soldiers' women who inform themselves of the news involving their husbands. It's a logical but shaky method.At last, an overwhelming music and a conventional end don't help matters. In the long run, ""we were soldiers"" is a very superficial war movie and by accumulating hackneyed topics and clich√©s linked to Vietnam war, it leaves indifferent and even creates boredom.

A very Good Movie,"I am very surprised at the number of people who can write that the battle scenes seem so fictional and try to compare with Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down or other war movies. Have any of you even been in the military to make such a comment? I have 20+ years (Navy SeaBees and Army Infantry) and feel most of the action was very good. As one reviewer puts ""The battle scenes did not show us anything new"". Should Wallace had made up unrealistic battles scenes. I think too many of you are wanting the special effects to rule the movie. I will agree that some of the dialogue is ""hammed"" up but maybe some of you critics should include a better line in your review. My guess is that most critics will be just that, critics but can offer so viable alternative as to what would be better. This section seems to becoming like sports talk radio.

It's a very brutal and at the same time a sad story.,This is a film that is based on a true story and that is way it's so brutal and so direct and it showes both the enemy and the us soldiers as humans. It portrays they enemy as humans and as whorthy adversarys and not only focuses on the americans. Of course it's patriotic on US behalf but it showes the family at home and it showes the NVA-soldiers aswell as human. So I do recommend you to see it on the big screen.,9.0,Anonymous,History
One of the worst war films I have seen,"I have a lot of respect for Mel Gibson and the other fine actors in this film. It's a good story that is presented horribly. The formula for this move is as follows: Patriotism --> War Movie clich√© --> vigorous and obvious tug at heart strings in overly dramatic dialog --> rinse, repeat.This movie just wouldn't stop trying to evoke feelings from me. It's like I could see a hand reach from the screen and try to manipulate me through it's cheesy script.I am a soldier (Marine actually) myself, and I don't want to take anything away from the soldiers who fought in Vietnam.

"Far, far, from realistic","It is really disturbing and a wonderful reflection of our modern society to think that people beleive this movie is a ""true"" or ""realistic"" account of the Vietnam war. In TRUTH this is the most cliched account of men in war possibly ever.Perhaps it is because we Americans feel the need to romantasize ourselves and sugar-coat the reality that our ""honorable"" intentions are not often honorable, that a movie that is so devoid of truth or honesty has an audience. WWS is just another example of how we are sentimental about our pasts. In being so sentimental we are also willing to forget certain details about events that may be a little too painful. It's fitting that this movie was written by the man who brought us Pearl Harbor, another vapid and nostalgic piece of crap.This movie is intolerably sappy. I laughed out loud as Mel and company threw around little gems like, ""Daddy, what's a war?"" ""Tell my wife I love her."" ""At least I died for my country."" I feel no remorse in saying that I laughed, why? Because this was a basicly a comedy and in no way was paying homage to Vietnam war vets.Please see Platoon instead. There is a reason why it won best film and WWS was overlooked. Platoon pays more respect to the soldiers of Vietnam by being honest.I would never reccomend this movie to anyone. 0 out of 10 stars.",,Anonymous,History
What All Films Should Do,"What all films should do, is tell a story.This story was a difficult one to tell.As an Englishman, Vietnam is not so much a part of my national identity as an Americans.This film, based on real life events, really bought home the horror of that pointless conflict.I say pointless, because I really believe that those young men fighting so bravely on both sides of the war, did not really understand why they were there.This film clearly shows that they were honorable and brave, and that they were lucky to have such an inspirational leader in Col. Moore.What it also shows is that politics are no replacement for tactics, and that soldiers should fight wars without political interference of the nature brought to bare in 1965.It has been a long time since I walked out of a theatre with tears openly rolling down my cheeks, but I am proud to say that this film was worth every tear.Well done to all concerned, and RIP all those brave young men who fell in The Valley of Death and beyond.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A good war movie,"I've seen a lot of war movies. But this is the first time I've been touch during the movie until it's end. We were soldiers gives us a clear picture of what really was happening when US forces moved into Vietnam. It should have been a glorious victory but the loss said spoke for it self. Mel Gibson as colonel Moore is more than excellent for the role. The pictures of soldiers burning in napalm are so rough that you almost feel the heat around your self. All though some of the Cinematography could have been better in some of the direct combat scenes. But it isn't that bad, so I'll give it 8/10 for all of it. If you haven't seen it.

Gripping and Gut wrenching,"We were soldiers has got to be one of the best war films, I have ever seen. Though it is extremely full of cliche's it still gets a powerful lesson in history across. The Ia Drang valley battle was one of the worst that the US has ever been involved. I'm very surprised that anyone survived it, even with an outstanding officer like Hal Moore (gibson). The film also portrayed the Viet Namese in a better light than in most other films about that war.Like I said the only problem I could find with this film is the many cliche's that appeared in it. The one that showed up in the film and has been absolutely done to death is the dying soldier lying on the field saying in a raspy voice: ""Tell my wife, I love her"" Actually the most common thing a dying soldier says is ""Tell my mother I love her"". Anyway as many cliche's as there are in the film, they don't even come close to taking away the power that this film had on many others in the audiences.I've seen some great films on Viet Nam but this one has ranks right under Platoon. Platoon shows the sphycological hell that American soldiers in Viet Nam went through in that time period and We Were Soldiers shows the courage that fighting men showed throughout the war.There is one thing that about We Were Soldiers that for me sets it apart from other films about Viet Nam. We Were Soldiers shows that soldiers returning from Viet Nam were given no parade or friendly welcome of any kind like the ones who returned from World Wars I and II. Infact, people who passed them in the streets ignored them entirely most of the time.Now we get to the performances. I personally was impressed by all who acted in this film. Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot, and Greg Kinnear all gave memorable performances. However, one actor who really outdid himself was Chris Klein. I've never much liked Chris Klein because I've always felt that he is just a 23 year old playing a teenager. This film he has really shown himself as a serious actor.Anyway great movie,",9.0,Anonymous,History

These kids (most of the soldiers were 18 to 20) did things, endured combat and performed tasks none of the critics can even really imagine.Of course there is pathos, but who can judge it. Who but those who were there can have a real say? The battle of the Ia Drang valley of November 65 was a sigificant confrontation that not that many folks know about.Hats off to you sky soldiers.",,Anonymous,History
Entertaining,"We Were Soldiers wasn't a bad movie. I actually enjoyed most of it.But it comes in third for my most favorite war movies (#1: BlackHawk Down, #2: Saving Private Ryan). I don't know why, but I didn'tenjoy it as much a my other favorites. Maybe it's because it's justanother war movie. Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryanhad a huge impact on me, those movies did something no othermovie has done before, and when they came out with this, it justdidn't have the same impact like the first ones did.Acting overall is good, story is good and the fight scenes are great,I wouldn't be surprised if this won a Oscar¬Æ or two.

A Good Movie; More Importantly- Historically Accurate,"A great criticism I have for current movies is that in an effort to be more marketable (or ""politically correct"") actual events from history will be modified or distorted at the expense of the real people who were involved with the real events (last year's ridiculous ""historical"" farce ""Pearl Harbor"" springs to mind); there are enough genuine heros with true stories to tell.  Colonel Moore's in ""Were Were Soldiers"" (based on his book ""We Were Soldiers Once, And Young"") is one of these.Before I continue, let me first say that I was a freshman in high school when the Paris Peace Treaty was signed in 1973, resulting in the withdrawal of all US troops from South Vietnam, and a junior when the North Vietnamese Army invaded and overran the unprotected South in 1975.  Since that time I have studied Indochinese history in great detail, and have earned Master's degrees in both Asian Studies (South and Southeast Asia concentration) and International Affairs from the University of Michigan and Columbia University.The movie itself is well photographed and exhibits great expertise with battlefield verisimilitude and special effects.  More importantly, the film for the most part leaves political issues aside and tries to show us what Moore and his troops experienced those November days in 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley, and like it or not, whatever your opinions may be on US involvement in Vietnam, Moore's small, well trained force fought off and defeated far larger number of North Vietnamese Regulars in what was the first head-to-head combat between American and the invading Vietnamese Communist forces.  That's what happened.The North Vietnamese had hoped to inflict a large amount of casualties to alter American public opinion (which was very much in favor of the introduction of US troops).  The surrounded US troops used artillery and air support to repel the attackers, and killed more than 1800 NVA troops (total US battle deaths were around 300, including part of the later battle not shown in the film).  That's what happened.What was very significant about this battle was that it convinced the North Vietnamese generals to never meet American troops ever again in a conventional battle situation on that scale, (and they didn't). It convinced the US strategists that the way to beat the North Vietnamese (and their South Vietnamese Viet Cong proxies) was to try to lure large units into battle using American ground forces as bait, so that artillery and air power could be brought to bear and inflict unacceptable casualties, diminishing the North's ability and ardor for occupying the South.  This strategy (known as ""attrition"") did not work; the North Vietnamese stayed away from large unit action (as mentioned above) and they also did not care how many soldiers they lost; it's well known that there are 58,000 names of US war dead on the monument in Washington, DC, but the North Vietnamese war dead number two million by their own estimates.""We Were Soldiers"" is not entirely free of anachronistic 2001-era moral pronouncements, however, as the scene referring to a racist ""White Only"" sign in a laundramat mentioned by an innocent officer's wife back at the base who thought it referred to the color of the fabrics permitted in the machines.  Had the scene ended with awkward looks, with the Black officer's wife present, it would have been a powerful moment.  The politically correct indignant speechifying, followed by the Black woman's pained, but Oh-so-noble reply was clumsy and dumb (discrimination against Blacks in North Carolina in 1965?! Imagine that!  Were these officer's wives supposed to be unaware of American history or the Civil Rights movement going on all around them?).  Some of the early scenes with Mel Gibson as the loving Daddy were a bit heavy handed too, I thought (""Daddy, what's a war?"" asks his daughter who could be type-cast for Cindy-Lou Who).  The movie goes out of it's way to be even-handed in its depiction of the North Vietnamese, and goes a little too far, in my opinion, but there is no denying that they were well trained, well disciplined and courageous in battle.  The real slaughter of that war was suffered by the South Vietnamese civilians at the hands of the NVA and Viet Cong, however, and most of whose commanders were apparently not as introspective as the defeated officer shown here.All in all standing alone as a movie it is bit gory, but exciting and entertaining.  As a ""war movie"" it is essentially accurate, and without the tiresome left-wing political overtones of ""Platoon"" ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Apocalypse Now"".  Too many people just don't know the real history of that time and place, but that November in 1965, that's what really happened.",8.0,Anonymous,History
It made be grateful,"I went in with the bias of having read the book.  And I loved the book.  The film is remarkably faithful to the story, and I was impressed by Wallace's restraint.  While visually very powerful, it could easily have employed more of the technological tricks so many directors are unable to resist.  Instead, he relies on strong performances from his cast, and knew the story was truly extraordinary and did not need embellishments.  Gibson is no Olivier, and there are other actors who could have done better.  But Gibson gave it his all, and he did a fine job.  I do think the film will likely miss with many who aren't familiar with the book.  The bravery of the men and the ferocity of the battle, while all true, are truly unbelievable.  And for those who are suspicious of movies celebrating the nobility and courage of American soldiers, this will be uncomfortable to view.  It didn't make me squirm...it made me proud.

"I would call this movie anti-war, but pro-soldier","This is an excellent, realistic depiction of the first major U.S. battle in Vietnam. Though it's more than that. This movie had two big things that I hadn't seen in a movie in about the Vietnam war before. First was the deep loyalty of the American soldiers for each other, and secondly, what the wives of these soldiers went through back home. These are both things common in WWII movies, but this is the first time I've really seen it in a Vietnam war movie. During this battle, it also was sure to show the Vietnam point of view as well. It showed how the battle played out like a chess game, colonels on both sides predicted each others moves. Mel Gibson's portrayal of Lt Colonel Hal Moore and Sam Elliot as Sergeant Major Plumley were both excellent. I think this was probably Greg Kinnear's finest performance ever as Major Crandall, the lead helicopter pilot. Madeleine Stowe as Julie Moore back home was very touching. And all of the supporting cast really turned in great performances, making for a very realistic movie. The battle scenes were incredible, but gut-wrenching to watch.
