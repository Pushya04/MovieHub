A Joyous Delight,"I haven't had so many laff-out-loud moments in a movie for a long time. There's about an even mix of verbal and visual gags in this 3rd installment of the Ice Age family saga, they're all fresh instead of hackneyed, and they all work. You wouldn't think a film set in the age of mammoths would be able to run a parody of the old ""red wire vs. blue wire"" time-bomb scenario, but they find an ingenious way to do it.Now those among you who haven't fallen prey to creationism are well aware that mammoths are very large mammals (and hence quite recent in geological time), while the last of the dinosaurs went extinct 65,000,000 years ago. So how does the plot explain their coexistence? Well, it seems that there's this entire hidden tropical world underneath the eponymous ice, and our heroes literally fall into it. (Don't overthink it.)Suddenly Manny the mammoth and his pregnant mate Ellie discover that they're not only not the largest creatures on Earth, as they'd thot, but actually pretty petite compared to the Mama T. Rex, who in turn has to look up to Dad. It's a classic tale of nature red in tooth and claw, except for nobody actually getting eaten. (Well, several critters are swallowed whole but subsequently disgorged, slimy with saliva but basically unhurt; family film, y'know.)The animation is terrific. Judging from the end credits, apparently the Astor beaver trade, long thot to be extinct, has experienced a renaissance in the animated-fur factories of California. Dino babies and mammal kids are ridiculously endearing. The 3-D is likewise terrific, well used where appropriate (especially in conveying a sense of scale for the underworld) but not overdone. The one carp I have is that 3-D simply does not lend itself to dissolves between scenes; I'm guessing the filmmakers figured this out themselves, as most of the time they used cuts.The characters, familiar now from the 2 previous films, are well acted with distinctive personalities, and the comic-relief possums have an expanded role. New to the cast is Scratte, a long-lashed female squirrel who, in a running subplot (including mini-cartoons to both start and end the flik), vies with the iconic acorn for the undying devotion of Scrat. As a devotee of the tango, I particularly appreciated their version of it. Also new is Buck, a bold, intrepid, 1-eyed buccaneer of a weasel, voiced by Simon Pegg with British accent in full flower.Really, it's amazing to realize how much stuff they managed to cram into barely an hour and a half. Never a dull moment, never a missed step. Why, then, does it not get my top rating? Not at all because, as a comedy, it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously. After all, Dogma was a comedy, and it maxed out on my rating scale. But Ice Age 3 wasn't quite an entire story, more a collection of loosely related parts. Every one of those parts was well done, tho; indeed, I'd gladly take any of them over the entire 2.5 hours of the noxious Transformers; sadly, this much better film probably won't do nearly as well at the box office. Too bad.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Enjoyable for kids and adults, but the concept starts to become old","--Some minor spoilers, skip the part that describes the plot if you don't want to know anything about it--Personally, I didn't like the second ""Ice Age"" movie that much. I thought it just wasn't original enough, and couldn't make an impact compared to the great original. So, since movies franchises often have the tendency to get worse with each sequel, I wasn't expecting very much of the third Ice Age movie ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"". But, I have to admit, it was quite entertaining and funny, with many jokes and funny situations. The change of location from the white ice world, the main characters inhabited in the first two films, to the lush and green jungle, also did the movie some good, because the optic is just different and more exciting. While the first Ice Age movie still remains unreached by either of the sequels, the third one considerably improves on the second one, with more humor, better action and interesting ideas.Manfred and Ellie, the two mammoths, are expecting a baby, and Manfred, who is really happy to become a father tries everything to make his wife more comfortable and happy. Meanwhile, the saber-toothed tiger Diego, has to deal with the fact, that he is not the youngest anymore, and that his instincts and reflexes are getting worse. He decides to leave his herd, because he feels his life is coming to an end. Sid, the sloth, wants to have children of his own, and when he discovers three abandoned eggs in a cave, he decides to take them with him. One morning, he realizes that three dinosaurs have hatched from the eggs, and to make matters worse their mother is already looking for them. She attacks Sid and her three babies and abducts them to her world, a large, lush and green jungle, that is located directly under the thick layer of ice. Manfred, Ellie, the two opossums Crash and Eddie, decide to save Sid and eventually meet up with Diego on the way again. They are then joined by the mad wannabe pirate Buck, a weasel, who lost his eye to a gigantic monster, named Rudy, that lives somewhere deep in the jungle. Sid, meanwhile, tries to convince the dinosaurs' mother, that he can provide more for the children than her, but eventually has to accept that children belong to their real mother. The squirrel Scrat, once again reunited with his precious nut, has to deal with an entirely new problem. A femme fatal squirrel, who uses her charm to take Scrat's nut away from him. Being a lot smarter and trickier than him, she gets to keep the nut for most of the time, but eventually falls in love with Scrat, after he saves her from deadly lava. But what is more important to Scrat, his nut or his new girlfriend?With so many animated movies flooding the market these days, it becomes quite hard to come up with new ideas. Talking animals certainly isn't one, but if the characters have enough history and emotion, it really doesn't matter. ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" really profits from a slightly new approach to the material, which includes some very obvious parodies. The new character of Buck was most definitely inspired by Jack Sparrow from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and the final battle could have directly come from one of the ""Star Wars"" movies. Then we have the dinosaurs, who are, of course, extremely evil and always hunt down the main characters. All in all, the movies appears slightly stretched and has some relatively slow bits, for which the beginning and ending compensate, though. Especially the first 20-25 minutes, are some of the funniest in any Ice Age movie. And the scenes involving Scrat and his new girlfriend are just as funny as they have always been.Then we have once again, the actors who give the characters their voices. Ray Romano, who has such a unique voice, speaks Manfred, Denis Leary is Diego, John Leguizamo is Sid and Queen Latifah is Ellie. Buck, the pirate, is voiced by British actor Simon Pegg. Animated movies can never be judged according to acting, because the true leading actors here are the animators. But just as we are used to, the previously mentioned actors put their best effort into providing their character's voice.So, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is entertaining and enjoyable, but certainly not the best animated movie of the year. Still it is a good 90 minute time filler, and those who enjoyed the previous Ice Age films, will definitely also like this one. (3.5/5)The third installment in the Ice Age movie franchise is funny and entertaining, with some very original ideas, but certain lengths throughout the entire film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A cool addition to the Ice Age series,"I'm a fan of the Ice Age movies and I think they're quite funny to watch and it's one for kids and adults but is a trilogy always a good idea? After Ice Age 2: The Meltdown, a lot has happened for these lovable characters. Now that Ellie and Manny are together, they are going to have a baby which leaves Manny wanting everything to be perfect for when the addition arrives. Diego is bored and takes a look at his attitude and wonders if he's too laid-back about everything. Ice Age wouldn't be Ice Age without Scrat who is still trying to catch that acorn but has met his match when female sabre-tooth squirrel, Scratte, wants the acorn too. After Sid sees how happy Manny and Ellie are, he wants a family of his own so he steals three dinosaur eggs which leads to Sid being kidnapped to a weird underground world where his friends have to save him.The animation is simply brilliant and very well done and the characters are funnier too, especially the little clips of Scrat and Scratte fighting over the acorn. The story in the movie was very good for a kids' movie and adults can be assured that they will like it too. The jokes were quite funny and there were some sneaky jokes in there for adults but children wouldn't probably see it. Also the one-liners in the movie are pretty funny too, such as when Manny says to Sid, ""Don't worry, you'll meet a nice girl with low standards"". The cast who lend their voices for our heroes were great too, especially Simon Pegg as Buck who added a bit more of comedy to the movie.Overall, I would say that this is better than the second movie but not the first. It's a great watch for kids and adults alike and is sure not to disappoint.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprised that I enjoyed it.,"Not a bad flick. I don't remember liking the first one, skipped the second one and the only reason I went to see this one was because it was a ""sneak preview"" that started right after the movie I had gone to see and it was in 3D. I recommend seeing this one in 3D as it was worth the extra couple dollars. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The story was really stupid and didn't make any sense (dinosaurs living under the ice???), but it kept me interested the entire movie, partly because of the hilarious side story with the acorn loving animal and an excellent job by Simon Pegg as Buck the weasel(I just got done watching his TV show ""Spaced"" so maybe I am a little partial), who I had no idea was going to be in the movie. This movie also did a wonderful job of keeping everyone in the audience interested. The theater was packed and the only things you heard besides the movie was popcorn chomping and laughter, lots of laughter. Definitely worth seeing at the theater.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Nutshell Review: Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,"I think Ice Age has already established a strong franchise, and if it sticks to its own narrative formula, it should still find some legs to carry on the laughs with more movies to come, since the character base keeps on expanding, and unless the box office receipts tells the filmmakers otherwise. Like the adage goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.As always, the film opens with the adventures of Scrat from what you would already have seen from the trailer, where he encounters Scratte and has to decide which to give up, a potential relationship with a lover who sometimes prove to be manipulating his feelings, or that perennial piece of acorn that is always just as elusive. That'll bring you to the opening credits, before you're introduced to the all too familiar characters in Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) the Mammoths, Sid (John Leguizamo), Eddie (Josh Peck) and Crash (Seann WIlliam Scott) the possums, and Diego (Denis Leary) the sabre-tooth tiger, that rag- tag team of a makeshift herd who have stuck together through thick and thin, ready for one more adventure.The story's somewhat scattered this time round, with each character being pre-occupied with their respective concerns. Many and Ellie having to face some jitters with the looming expectations in being new parents, and in so this threatens the dynamics of their herd, with the aging Diego having his morale low due to his physical deterioration and decision to leave the herd, and Sid being a little more idiotic than before, this time adopting some three baby dinosaurs as his own kids.And because this surrogate parent role was especially not welcomed by the baby dinosaurs parent, which turns out to be of the T-Rex species, Sid's failure to give them back meant they all had to be forcefully taken to the dino's natural habitat, in a lost world still filled with lush greenery and plenty of other roaming prehistoric, and supposedly extinct creatures. In other words, with the action taking place in this part of the world, the title ""Ice Age"" did somewhat seem like a misnomer, as gone are the usual white, snow covered environment, that made way for thick forests and undergrowth.Which somewhat took the polish off the film, and I felt that both the characterization and the plot and subplots suffered. The usual themes which has been beaten to death in the earlier films, like trust, sacrifice and friendship get repeated again here, and the first half of the film really looked tired despite the 3D enhancement that I've opted for, with only depth of field, and as far as I can tell, no specific set action sequence to milk the potential of a 3D presentation. The story became bogged down with trying to handle too many different character motivations at the same time that it only managed to give each some cursory attention.Thankfully the slack was picked up in time for quite an exciting finale. This was in fact like a culmination of what the new character, voiced by Simon Pegg, could do, as Buck the possum which had gone bonkers. The filmmakers here seemed totally satisfied with allowing Buck to steal the show, and stole the film it did, with his Jack Sparrow-like swagger for that sense of adventure, coupled with an unsound mind, a fearless and gung-ho attitude, and plenty of wonderfully crafted dialogues and comedic instances. Comedy, a staple in the Ice Age movies, seemed to be stuck at a low with the usual name-dropping references to pop culture that Buck actually arrived at the right time to save the day.What could be a problem was of course the lack of a strong antagonist to shake things up a little. In the first installment we got the sabre-tooth tigers, and the second being a fight against the nature's wrath. This one had a tough cookie dinosaur in a T-Rex, but seriously, do we need another Rex as a bad character? Otherwise the ""villains"" just pop up whenever the situation calls for it, or became a sort of an enigma before finally appearing for some 2-3 minutes worth of screen-time. This made the film lose that sense of urgency in developing its narrative, and looked for the most parts that it was just coasting along, waiting for something major to happen.Given the way it bade farewell, I think there is still enough fuel for a couple more Ice Age movies, but the next time, I'm hoping for a lot more focus, a lot more genuine comedy, and for the animation to remain as flawless as it currently already is, if not better. Amongst the three, my least liked, story-wise, but it surely had the most memorable character of the lot in Buck.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ice Age 3 is the return of true family films,"Ice age 3 was really funny and it stays true to the series. Same old characters, a whole new adventure that everyone at any age can enjoy.I saw the critics and I thought to my self that it would be good, but I didn't expect much, but I really did enjoy it more than I thought. It may not be the best compared to the other Ice Age films, but it still a great thrill ride that the audience can enjoy.And if you find a theater near you that has it in digital 3D, go and watch it in 3D, because the action and adventure will excite you even more than it actually does.Normally people think since it's a third part, then the movie won't be that great, but hear me when I say that keep that thought out of your mind and parents, take your kids with you, they are sure to leave with a smile and a long lasting excitement for more.100% enjoyable, its a 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun for kids, tiring for adults","This film is about the Sid bringing home three dinosaur eggs in order to start his own family that he longs for.The animation in ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is very good. The initial scenes which Sid finds the eggs are impressive, as the shadows and the amount of light on the eggs changes when Sid moves. The scene where an animal falls into water looks actually perfectly real and not animated.However, the content of the film was a major bore. The same supposedly funny material keep coming up, as if the filmmakers ran out of jokes. I got so tired of squirrels chasing nuts and animals falling from height. The jokes may be entertaining if you do it once, but not when repeated thirty times. In addition, most of the entertainment is geared towards young children, which means there is not enough material to keep adults interested.I find ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" tiresome and boring. I was waiting for it to end about half way through already.",,Anonymous,Animation

A Wonderful and Entertaining Tale of Love and Friendship,"Manny is anxious with the pregnancy of Ellie and builds a playground for the offspring. Meanwhile, Scrat disputes an acorn with the female Scratte and they fall in love with each other while Diego feels old since he is unable to catch a gazelle. The lonely Sid feels jealous of Manny and Ellie and when he finds three dinosaur eggs in an underground cave, he steals and brings them to the surface. He hatches the eggs during the night and on the next morning, three dinosaur babies believe that Sid is their mother and follow him everywhere.Meanwhile, the real dinosaur mammy seeks their offspring out and when she finds the trio, she brings them back with Sid to her underground world. Manny, Ellie, Diego, Crash and Eddie pursue the dinosaur to rescue their friend and stumble with a dangerous underground world. But they are helped by the smart and talkative one-eyed weasel known as Buck that wears a patch and chases the dangerous Rudy, who was the responsible for the loss of his eye.""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is a wonderful and entertaining tale of love and friendship, with adorable characters and witty situations. The love of Manny with Ellie is very beautiful; the triangle of love among Scrat, the acorn and Scratte is hilarious; the love of Sid with the three dinosaurs is funny and also heartbreaking. For me, the best scene in the story is when mammy dinosaur brings the three babies to the top of a tree and Sid is unable to climb it and says goodnight to the children. But maybe the most important is the friendship Manny, Ellie, Diego, Crash and Eddie with Sid, risking their lives to save their friend. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): A Era do Gelo 3"" (""The Ice Age 3"")",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Peaches!,Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs is not nearly as good as the original in the series but a lot better then The Meltdown.In this part of the series Manny and Ellie are expecting their first child. Diego is losing his ability prey on animals and is getting older and he decides that he wants to leave the herd but he doesn't. Also we see the soft side of Sid (of course he always has been soft) as he fosters three dinosaur eggs he encounters. Later on we discover he has been taking care of babies that belong to a sort of ferocious T-Rex.Perhaps the best parts of Dawn of the Dinosaurs is the new and vibrant character Bucky. A weasel looking animal he takes them through a land of new creatures that the clan have never seen before. They are walking through a plethora of dinosaurs that rule this land unlike their own. They eventually will find Sid who has become lost.Bucky is hilarious as the nutty weasel he is. His jokes are funny. But some of them may be a little too adult like in humor to the point where it's downright filthy. But on a whole he is a great addition to the Ice Age series. Another funny part of the film follows our favorite prehistoric squirrel Scratt who while chasing his beloved acorn comes across a gorgeous female squirrel who tries to take his acorn away. The humor between these two comes down to the wire where they will end up falling in love. Has Scratt lost his mind giving up his prized acorn over a girl? Just watch and see.I am also looking forward to Continental Drift.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sometimes funny, sometimes not","This is the third movie in the highly enjoyed Ice Age trilogy and after the fantastic first one and sadly slightly lackluster second movie, my reactions when I heard of this movie was that of not caring. But when I had seen everything else at the cinema I went, and I must say this movie was pretty entertaining. Its plot, while predictable kept me entertained and the character's were kept true to their usual self's.Some negative movies though is the humour it resorts to if a scene starts to drag on a little and this film we saw a lot of the same humour used in 100 films before it but only a small fraction of the films jokes were taken up with this and mostly the film kept original.Overall, I think I enjoyed the movie more then the second one, but the second one had this bit for style and grace. I will give this movie 52%.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Okay, but diminishing returns are setting in","The Ice Age films have never achieved (or aspired to) the greatness of Pixar or the better films in Dreamworks' canon. That said, they've always had a light and easy charm that adults can enjoy right along with their kids. By now audiences know exactly what they're getting from an Ice Age film, and the best compliment one can pay this third film is that it maintains the quality of previous entries. What it lacks in originality it more than makes up for in improved visuals (a pterodactyl chase in particular is stunning), a fun turn by Simon Pegg as a wilderness warrior, and the simple fact that after three films they still keep coming up with innovative mini-stories about Scrat and that acorn.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Ice Age 3 delivers the goods, and appeals to grown-ups and kids alike","My wife and I attended an early press screening for the third Ice Age installment two weeks ago and had a wonderful time. The film easily tops the second outing of the series, and is right on par with the first - with just the right mixture of new characters and settings vs. the older ones we've all grown to love (especially Scrat. I can watch a whole movie with this guy).This time around, Manny and Ellie are expecting a baby mammoth, something that leads to unexpected responds from Diego and Sid. When Sid decides to become a parent himself in return, he steals three giant eggs he accidentally bumps into, only to later realize they're dinosaur eggs that belong to a pretty angry mother. When mother-dinosaur kidnaps Sid, it's up to Manny and friends to return him home safely. Adventures ensue as they find out that underneath their icy world lives a land filled with enormous and sometimes menacing dinosaurs, one which our friends would need to cross in order to rescue Sid.Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is cute but not insulting, the visuals are stunning and if you forgive the obvious historical loophole (there were no dinosaurs during the Ice Age) you can actually have quite a good time. The dinosaurs add a lot to the plot, and there's actually a very cool, nice sense of adventure throughout the film, one that was somewhat missing (in my opinion) from the previous installment. All this adds to a fun and thrilling experience - alongside the visuals, jokes and general good atmosphere.To sum things up - Ice Age 3 is an above average animated film, that'll appeal to grown-ups and kids alike. I gave it 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Desperate nonsense...but excellent desperate nonsense!,"'Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs' certainly makes the crew at Blue Sky Studios look desperate and deprived of ideas as they render straight off the ice age script (what the film is supposed to revolve around) and head under the ice to tackle dinosaurs.Crazy? Certainly.Ridiculous? Of course.Is it good? Incredibly!Though it may be what I have stated in the first paragraph, 'Dawn of the Dinosaurs' is a hilarious and visually fabulous tale of how Sid the Sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo) is taken hostage by a Tyrannosaurus-Rex and Manny (voiced Ray Romano), Diego (voiced by Denis Leary), Ellie (voiced by Queen Latifah) join forces with the hysterical one-eyed weasel named Buck (voiced by Simon Pegg).Again, you may imply from the above the narrative is rather similar to 'The Meltdown' and the original. Yes this is true despite the completely different scenarios. The basic plot is very familiar and not much fresh ground is covered; the change of environments and villains means though it is far less noticeable.The film's main highlight is Simon Pegg's weasel Buck who is outrageously funny from almost every line of dialogue. Pegg voiced the troublemaker perfectly like a can't-be-bothered-teenager and he is able to give him a distinctive cheeky attitude with effortless ease.'Dawn of the Dinosaurs' is certainly ridiculous and mental in the fact it has nothing to do with ice age's and teaches you nothing about dinosaurs. However, it keeps the spark alive in the 'Ice Age' franchise with another consistent source of entertainment for all ages.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
'Ice Age' Getting Better & Better,"Frankly, I was shocked this movie was so good. I mean, sequels aren't supposed to this entertaining, are they? This Ice Age series - three films, so far - just keeps getting better and better, funnier and funnier.I think the key to their success is discovering what the movie's fans liked and putting those two characters in larger roles. I am speaking of ""Sid The Sloth,"" who is always hilarious and voiced magnificently by John Leguizamo. ""Sid"" has more lines in this movie than the other two, I would venture to say.....and that's fine with me and most other folks.The other ""character"" is ""Skrat,"" the squirrel, who is joined by a female squirrel. ""Skrat"" has the hots for her, but she's still no competition when it comes to the elusive acorn. Nothing is more important than holding onto one of those and both squirrels are very funny in their battles for possession of that acorn.As for the story, just picture Sid pretending to be a mom to a threesome of baby dinosaurs. That's all you need to know - it's pretty wild. In all, this is an extremely funny film which also looks, as the other two did, fabulous on Blu-Ray.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The element of danger is back, and - just like the first film - this one includes various genres including action, adventure, suspense, and humor that is actually funny - all at the appropriate time. The animation is stunning.Scrat once again serves up a generous portion of fun and humor. The Tango scene is simply awesome!! (wonder how many times I watched this scene...). While other characters fall in love, Scrat still only has eyes for his beloved acorn. So funny!

"It would appear moving away from the ice, on top of actually providing us with a little bit of adventure, was the answer all along.","Can a film still be called ""Ice Age"" when it takes place somewhere that resembles the tropics? For two whole films now, we've followed the adventures of a mammoth; a sloth and a sabre tooth tiger across the barren, icy lands at a time when land and continents intercepted with one another as one great big piece of terrain. There we sight gags to do with fossils and about evolution; second unit sequences involving icicles and would-be water flumes in a state of being frozen solid as well as meek tracts on global warming threatening to burn up all the frost and ice. Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a refreshing shift away from such things, the entry that moves things away from the above and into the locale of a jungle, a thriving; bustling zone wherein the crew are dwarfed by trees and shrubbery rather than glaciers and where the threat arrives in the form of dinosaurs. The sense of adventure is more omnipresent than usual, that sense of a space being alien or unfamiliar much more apparent. The answer, then, to the question is ""No"", but the film is all the more better because of it.This sense of stark change is actually synonymous throughout the film, and things are genuinely better as a result. Not only has location changed, director of this edition Carlos Saldanha, with the more recurrent Mike Thurmeier, have started pairing the central characters off on top of having one of them face imminent fatherhood. All of this is before the distinct shift in filmic tone and narrative arc – an entry resisting depicting these animals trekking on a one way route across anonymous snowy plains trying to get somewhere, or deliver someone to someone else. Moreover, we're taking a leaf out of one of those old 60's monster movies wherein a bunch of people are stuck in a place time has forgotten; a place wherein strange creatures and dinosaurs rule the jungle dominated roost and the likes of Jackson's King Kong remake as well as 2001's second Jurassic Park sequel have much more recently dared to exploit on grander, bigger budgeted scales.Gone too is the sardonic wit and general cynicism attributed to Manfred and Mammoth, replaced with a sort of 'goofy impending father' routine as he carries on with where he left off beside partner Ellie at the end of Ice Age 2. He is, of course, part of a group of three including Diego (Leary) and Sid (Leguizamo), the respective sabre toothed tiger and sloth; Diego of whom sees little future in his current predicament with these guys (facing an impending child on the scene/Sid's slapstick antics), and longs for an adventure as gags about old age and domestic suffocation rear up. Wouldn't you know it, Sid goes missing on account of a Tyrannosaurus Rex taking him after he stole, and then observed hatch, her eggs – thus, it's up to these remaining characters as well as the Seann William Scott and Josh Peck voiced quick-fire critters we were introduced to in the second film to tag along and save him. Upon stumbling upon a previously unaccounted jungle dominated world below the surface, they hook up with Simon Pegg's survivalist weasel Buck, who acts as their guide through the terrain. Interestingly, when we first encounter him, it is a recreation of the very instance Sam Neill's Dr. Grant character is rescued from all manner of prehistoric beats by the very boy he is involuntarily searching for in Jurassic Park III. As soon as those gas canisters go off, it is revealed to us right where we are in relation to this new addition and we ease into it in that sense.It comes as a relief that we can slog through this sort of film once again after the tedious disaster that was Ice Age 2. This is funnier and more exciting, with a lot of adventure to be had out of it. There is an urgency to things this time, a huge dinosaur akin to Jurassic Park III's Spinosaurus is on their tail and that element of chase works better here than it did in number two, when flesh-hungry fish were gobbling up anything foolish enough not to respect the fact there was a massive thaw swallowing everything up behind them. Where things break down in this sense of children and adults liking the same content, however, are in the scenes when Manfred mulls over potential fatherhood; while few people below a certain age will get quite the desired kick out of seeing Buck emerge from a muddy swamp alá Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now.Few people would argue against the recurring squirrel character Scrat being the funniest thing in any of the films, but where it is often advised in any walk of life not to try and mend things that are not broken, the film decides to revamp his own on-going crusade to finally snare an acorn he's been forever been attempting to obtain. The overlying joke inherent with this skit was always the cruel denial after the apparent security one would obtain what one wants, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs vamping up the core of the gag in their introducing of a female foil for Scrat; a sort of odd mesh of the Cadbury's Caramel Bunny with the jagged, brisk animations that came with the central characters from Disney's 1963 film The Sword in the Stone upon transformation into squirrels. Thus, these sequences have mutated into an odd, borderline bawdy, tease-and-denial routine wherein the laughs come hearty and somewhat regular, but with that nagging sensation at the back of one's mind as one realises this is a kids film. Regardless, the film is so much fun and is so immune to doing any wrong, that they've managed to mess around with the franchise's best and most popular item and still just about get it right.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Steps up its game to become the best of the series so far,"With Mannie (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) shortly expecting their first child, Sid (John Leguizamo) fears for the future of the herd. Soon enough, Diego (Denis Leary) decides to leave after failing to catch a gazelle, fearing he has gone soft. Sid finds three eggs in an isolated underground grave which he excitedly adopts, only for them to hatch the next day into tyrannosaurus rex's. When their angry mother attacks the herd and takes her babies back with Sid with them, Mannie, Ellie, Diego, Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) go off in search of rescue only to discover an underground lost world still inhabited by dinosaurs. It is a hostile environment and the group are soon under attack, but they are rescued by a demented one-eyed weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg) who becomes their guide through the treacherous jungle.There seems to be continuing theme throughout the Ice Age films. It could be said the first film dealt with childhood, with the three hapless creatures dealing with a delicate baby, and the second film dealing with adolescence, with Mannie finally discovering a female mammoth and falling in love. Naturally, the third film has Mannie and Ellie having their own baby, and therefore focusing on adulthood. Even the sabre-toothed squirrel Scrat is growing up, finding a possible mate in Scratte, and giving all his attention to her rather than his beloved acorn (which seems to be lonely in an inspired yet quite bizarre love montage between the two). Although, in my opinion, the first sequel The Meltdown (2006) was a step back compared to the first film, the third is the best of the bunch, and it's nice to know that the films are growing just as their characters are.The 'underground lost world' is admittedly a bit of a cheap way to throw in some dinosaurs, but I found it hard to care with animation this beautiful. The opening shot amongst the tree tops of the jungle, with dinosaurs slowly moving and eating from trees, is truly stunning, and a real improvement of the slightly blocky animation of the first film. Sadly, Diego is again given little to nothing to do, and seems a waste of Leary's talents, but the introduction of Buck was certainly a smart one. With Buck as our insane tour guide, it becomes easier to put up with Mannie and Ellie's slightly dull moral heart of the story and enjoy lines such as ""about three months ago I woke up married to a pineapple. An ugly pineapple! But I loved her so..."". In Pegg's hands his sheer randomness is hilarious. Directors Carlos Saldanha and Mike Thurmeier have stepped up their game rather than relying on the Ice Age franchise to bring in the punters, and given the series the kick up the arse it needed.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Excellent visuals, funny gags and characters overshadow it's lackluster story and it's lack of heart & antagonist","After the success of Ice Age 2: The Meltdown, another sequel is inevitable, but only this time, it became the start of a franchise that has completely gone downhill due to it's lackluster reviews despite it's success at the box office much like the previous film. One of our three friends named Sid gets captured by a T-Rex after he finds three of it's babies and it's up to Manny, Ellie, her possum brothers, Diego, and a new character named Buck to save him as they encounter some of the dangers that lie withing the dinosaur world.Just a brief note, I like the first Ice Age. It was a classic and a great start for Blue Sky Studios. I also liked the first sequel as well. It wasn't as excellent as the original, but it was well executed due to one of the character's back-story. This one isn't as terrible as some say it is, but when it comes to a complex story, this one seemed to be lacking not only in it's heart, but it's antagonist and I completely understand why it got seriously panned by the critics.To be fair, it does have a nice premise about our heroes meeting the dinosaurs for the very first time, but even that doesn't save the story itself from being too thin by using a lot of subplots (trying to save Sid from a mother T-Rex or volcano, encounter three dangerous courses with Buck, you name it) and the dialog, much like the second film, lacks the wit and irrelevance of the first Ice Age. The second half does get dragged a bit especially towards the end and the script isn't that good.Flaws aside, I think I like the characters and their nice moments throughout the film especially Scrat who steals every scene along with a beautifully attractive new saber tooth squirrel named Scratte and the romance between is both funny and cute. The best character who steals the show the most goes to Buck voiced by Simon Pegg with his funny gags. In fact, the voice acting isn't that bad after all thanks to Ray Romano, Queen Latifah, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary and others. The music from John Powell isn't the strongest, but it's pretty decent, there are some gags that got a chuckle out of me and the pacing moves along very nicely. The strongest aspect goes to the visuals especially the look of the dinosaur world which is in my opinion the best aspect of the animation.Overall, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs isn't a terrible entry to the franchise, but with a better story and a better script, it would've so much better. I understand that lots of people also hated it as much as the previous one, but I think that this is a decent third entry.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A simple story executed to near perfection.,"Its all about family in essence. Starting one, keeping one, becoming one, protecting one. A family film about family is always going to ring the right bells (unless Eddie Murphys in it), and this is no exception! It's funny, its sharp, it's clever, and when it wants too will tug on your heart strings. It's everything a great family film should be. It has just as much humour to keep the grown ups happy as it does the kids.It's not perfect; it starts fairly slowly with scenes we've already scene twenty times in the trailer, but the further you go into this adventure the more fun you will have.A fantastic new addition to the franchise is ""Buck"" (Simon Pegg) a looney tune hermit possum who joins the herd around half way through. When he enters the scene, the whole movie shifts up a gear! Some of the stuff he comes out with will have you rolling in the isle! If you have the chance, you must see it in 3D! It's amazing how this new version of such an old and dated technology can suck you even deeper into a film! The chases are more exciting, the locations more real, it works so well! And it doesn't give you a migraine!Overall - Like a franchise should, Ice Age gets better and better and better! If you liked the first, you'll love the second! If you loved the second, you'll go crazy for the third! 2D - 8/10 3D - 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,"Third instalments of franchises are hard to land correctly - just ask Shrek!I think it's fair to say that 'Ice Age' had become a bit sillier with its humour by this stage, and that the plotlines had moved towards more of a cartoonish nature, BUT what can't be denied is that this is a fun film.It's got jokes in here for all the family, and it does have a nice message.Yes, it's silly, and the ""we have to run away from something scary"" moment every twenty minutes or so gets a bit repetitious, but on the whole this was a good example of family entertainment and that's what this was ultimately trying to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
And a third time's the charm!,"Manny and Ellie are expecting a baby, which makes Diego and Sid question themselves. Diego yearns to be back out in the wild and Sid wishes he had a family of his own. Due to Sid's determination, he ends up stealing some baby eggs, which results in everyone discovering a new world filled with dinosaurs.The movies in this trilogy just keep getting better and better! This film still has the humor and charm that the last two movies had. It kept me entertained. Sequels usually don't do good in the market- more so if it is a threequel. Surprisingly, ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" wasn't at all bad! The new additions were hilarious and amusing.My only complaint about the movie was the unnecessary ""too-long"" footage of Scrat and his female frenemy. I think the movie could have done better if it wasn't for them. I would have liked to see more of the main gang, rather than Scrat and his nut problems. It gets tiring after a while.Overall, this was still a funny movie! A great addition to the trilogy! I still wonder if there will be a fourth movie to the franchise.. I can only hope that it stays as funny and as true to these three movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Obviously the Superior Ice Age,"If you ask someone what their favorite Ice Age film is, and they DONT say this one, they are obviously wrong. This movie is funny, has heart, and it's the most entertaining out of the series. After this one, they all go downhill. This movie is the Ice Age franchise peak. Diego's depression is a very emotional part, and Sid feeling like he has no family, no one to love him, until he finds the eggs. Sid is mainly played for laughs, but this movie gives him real character development. Even though this movie has heart, it still has its very funny moments. Also, the character buck is the best character to ever exist in this franchise, and maybe ever.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Adding Dinosaurs really works,"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs finds new life in the franchise by adding Dinosaurs to the mix and proving that it's a solid way to avoid franchise fatigue. Moving the action to a lost world beneath the ice brings a lot of fresh ideas and set pieces which keeps it entertaining even when the characters and bits exclusively aimed at younger children aren't landing like they should.Ray Romano, Denis Leary, and Queen Latifah are all really good once again and it's especially nice to see Ray Romano act sillier thanks to the new plot thread of him becoming a father. John Leguizamo remains the best carryover as Sid with no signs of phoning it in present here and Simon Pegg brings so much zany energy to a character designed to become a fan favourite, which Pegg makes official.Carlos Saldanha's direction still finds time to include the ongoing adventures of Scrat in a way that thankfully doesn't grind proceedings to a halt and each one offers a welcome opportunity to indulge in some old school slapstick. John Powell's score generously borrows a lot from his own work on Kung Fu Panda but that does result in music that can bring a surprising amount of drama when needed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mediocre third flick,"A meltdown couldn't stop the ""Ice Age"" crew the last time so now the filmmakers are upping the ante with dinosaurs. Does it make sense? No. If this third film in the series does as well as the first two, will Manny, Sid, and Diego next contend with aliens? I wouldn't put it past them. Heck, the only thing that's really supposed to make sense here is that these movies are trying to capitalize on a hit franchise. (""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" even more so as it rolls into theaters in not just 2-D but 3-D as well.) Just much like the third ""Shrek"", this is a forgettable and hollow installment, fine for kids but sure to have older fans of the series checking their watches.The characters are all back. Manny Mammoth (Ray Romano) anxiously awaits the birth of his first child with Ellie (Queen Latifah). Diego the saber-tooth tiger (Denis Leary) sees his skills as a hunter being diminished and ponders leaving the herd. And Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) feels like the odd man out and wishes for a family of his own. When he finds dinosaur eggs, Sid is determined to raise them as his own, not thinking that mama dinosaur is close by. She tracks Sid down and takes her eggs and him back to her underground valley habitat where dinosaurs and other animals live. One of them is a one-eyed, dinosaur-hunting weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg), who helps Manny, Diego, Ellie, and Ellie's possum brothers (Sean William Scott, Josh Peck) when they go looking for Sid.Scrat the squirrel stars too, still trying to obtain that acorn. Usually his slapstick segments are some of the best parts of the film but even he is little more than lightly amusing. Scratte, a female squirrel, hinders his efforts this time and also serves as romantic counterpart but since neither talk and both seem to like the acorn more than each other, who cares. The same goes for the rest of the movie. The physical comedy gags are too far between and all that's left is a lot of outlandish personalities, most of which are more annoying than funny.Plotting is limited, stretching the importance of family while at the same time doing nothing of any interest. Splitting the team up takes away from the fun, too many secondary characters only serve as a distraction, and the perils, which include plants, a large dino named Rudy, and floating lava will thrill the kids but be too dull for parents. This puts a damper on the 3-D animation as well, which has some nice snow and forest-filled landscapes but nothing that, figuratively, jumps off the screen about the characters or action.The vocal actors are still matched up well, just they get very few actual funny things to say. Leguizamo's slurring, goofy performance as Sid is the most fun. Romano is well matched with the cautious, nasally Manny, as is Leary to the vicious Diego. And Latifah is sassy as Ellie. Simon Pegg gives the movie some life as Buck, a nutty safari-hunter who loves the thrill of the chase.But we're a long way from the visual feast and energetic fun of ""Up"". I'm sure the kids won't seem to mind though. ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" exists for them. It's just too bad parents are forced to shell out big bucks for something that would have been just as good for cheap had it gone directly to DVD.For more reviews, check out Leesmovieinfo.com",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great for kids, not so much for adults","This 3rd entry in the Ice Age franchise is mediocre. Better than the second film easily, but still mediocre. It's pretty a pretty by-the-numbers sequel. Take everything from the previous films that everyone loved and just keep doing those things and don't try anything new. That said, newcomer to the series, Buck is great and easily the best addition to the series yet (yes, better than Ellie, Crash & Eddie). He is a fascinating and fun character and I am glad they're making a movie all about him. He would be fun to see much more of and focus on and learn more about. The Scrat scenes aren't interesting at all and I would say actually boring. The story itself is even more unbelievable than the two previous stories, though for the worst. Is Sid an idiot? Yes. But he always had a heart and did whatever he could to survive. In this movie he makes decisions baffling even for his character. So, he's staring down a dinosaur mother and doesn't hand back the babies? That's dumb for even Sid. That and they start up this story of Diego feeling as if he's losing his edge and really don't do much with it, which was disappointing. Anyway, it was mediocre in the end. Fun for kids, maybe mildly amusing for adults, especially the adult jokes (e.g., ""It's a boy! Congratulations!"" ""Sid, that's a tail."").",,Anonymous,Animation
Boring and exciting,"The show starts rather lamely and boring, predictable without the same sense the show had with the second installment. I actually anticipated highly with this one but almost disappointingly unappreciated it, I still remained in my seat because I paid for it.Indeed, it progressed to a real show and the same theme with kiddie shows shed – adventure and fun and funny. The jokes were actually still funny and quite original, the introduction of some characters were effective and sensible they were not some just-arts to add up to the entourage. Still, the characters were consistent with their beings.Surprisingly, there were some richly entertaining actions packed with visual stimulations to keep me stuck on my seat. Although it failed to entertain me intellectually, I enjoyed the most of it because it simply was fun.I was just annoyed with the kids at my back who were voicing their predictions about what was going to happen and their parents nagging that they should leave the cinema because they already watched the movie for the third time.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
ICE AGE still far from extinction.,"My Take: It's not the best animated movies have to offer, but with all the charms and laughs of a likable one.Third time's the charm, occasionally. As I loved the first two ICE AGE movies, I admired ICE AGE: DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS solely on its own terms; as pure family fun. Unlike TRANSFORMERS 2, which guises itself as a ""family movie"" while gearing itself for an older audience, ICE AGE 3 is a more harmless (not to mention trimmer) family affair, and in my opinion a better diversion if you plan to bring a lot of younger kids along for the ride. That saying a lot for a movie about an inter-species herd of Pleistocene mammals in a ridiculous adventure that has them crossing paths with dinosaurs in a lost underground jungle!If I was 8 years-old right now, I would have absolutely loved ICE AGE 3! The title couldn't be more straight-forward: Our sub-zero heroes get tangled up with an adventure that breaks all plausibility when they find an underground forest inhabited by dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes. As the ""DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS"" of its title kicks in, I felt the the 8 year-old in my head bouncing with joy. I don't know, maybe it's been a while when I saw a dinosaur movie (I don't know if the new LAND OF THE LOST, which I haven't seen yet, would be able to give me that same feeling). The animation doesn't break new ground, but for what it wanted to offer, it's colorful and lively, even better perhaps than in the first two movies. If good looks are not good enough ,the movie also offers some exciting action scenes filled with nearly endless visual inventiveness. I should have seen this on 3-D as it was intended to be. This is probably the most visually elaborate of the three.Still, outside the visual astonishment to be had, it does suffer in comparison with its superior predecessors, as any sequel (or more specifically trequel) might. First, which probably deserves a lot of discussion, is the return of the character Scrat. I thought Scrat is one of the most brilliant creations ever in an animated movie since his debut in the first ICE AGE movie (the opening scene was classic!), but during his return in this sequel, he is not given much more to do. I guess the folks at Blue Sky Animation is contended with giving Scrat a love interest, which is none other than Scratte, a female flying squirrel. Perhaps when the DVD comes, Blue Sky will redeem themselves with their priced creation with yet another lovable short feature. The laughs also come in short. While it's s usual complaint that too much cultural references are gratuitous in a kid-friendly animated feature, this film gears itself more on making the kids laugh that adults will probably be left smiling, giggling at best. Still, there are a few gags to be had with Simon Pegg lending his voice to the tenacious Ahab-like weasel named Buck, as well as the familiar voice cast of Ray Romano, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Queen Latifah, Sean William Scott and Josh Peck providing the voices to their respective characters.ICE AGE: DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS is not the best of the three films, and it's not the best animated film either. Superb entries like WALL-E and the recent UP changed the way we look at animated movies, but that doesn't mean the ol' Looney Tunes way is out of fashion. While I did leave a bit underwhelmed, I still say this is what family movies are all about: Tongue-in-cheek fun. If family entertainment is what you're looking for, I recommend that this is the one to see.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Meh,"Ice Age 3:Dawn of the Dinosaurs isn't a bad film, far from it, but it is my least favourite of the Ice Age films. Granted, the animation is absolutely wonderful as it was with the first two, and the music is nicely composed. The characters are likable enough, I have always love Scrat he is so funny, and the voice acting is very good. However, the script and jokes aren't quite as good this time around. There are some good moments, but some of the writing is lacking and there is the odd lame visual gag. Also this is the Ice Age film with the I feel most predictable and most unevenly paced story. There are some scenes that are rather derivative and the pacing either feels rushed and lagging, it never quite feels just right. All in all, it was okay, but it never wowed me as such. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

The only thing I can say I did not like was the whole dinosaurs living under the ice and it being all hot under the ice, but other than that it was pretty good, of course it would not be any good at all and I probably would not have went to the theater to see it if you did not have that squirrel chasing that acorn around, Its a good family movie though.

Ice Age 3: Worse than Jaws 3D,"Basically this should be the last Ice Age, but it won't. The characters have been reduced to stereotypes of their previous personalities, nothing feels at stake in this movie, the best moments are in the trailer, and plot has been sacrificed to showcase the vaunted 3D animation. Jaws 3 did the same thing, except I cared enough to see the next person get eaten. This didn't make me care in the slightest.There is an overabundance of Scrat in this movie as well. Out of the 90ish minutes, I figure a good 45 of it showed Scrat in some fashion. To me, Scrat should be an amusing side show, not a centerpiece.In hindsight, I'm not sure why I bothered to go see this. At least I know now this will be my last foray into the ""Ice Age.""

An Absolute Riot That's Well-Aware Of Its Limits.,"Although Ice Age never needed a sequel to begin with, the success of the second chapter did give its studio another franchise to milk for all its worth. The third instalment in the Ice Age series once again fails to offer a compelling story but for me it is the most enjoyable chapter in the saga so far, thanks in particular to its energetic pace & vibrant slapstick humour.The story of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs finds Manny & Ellie venturing into parenthood as they are expecting a baby. Diego plans to leave the herd after suspecting that he's losing his predatory nature. And Sid comes across three seemingly-abandoned dinosaur eggs, deciding to adopt them, but is abducted by their real mother and is taken underground where an entire lost world exists.Directed by Carlos Saldanha, Dawn of the Dinosaurs packs in plenty of hilarious moments even if it doesn't offer anything rewarding in the storytelling department. Scrat's misadventures continue to be the series' highlight moments but the story's adventurous vibe is finely maintained. Manny gets an interesting arc to work with but the rest simply tag along. And the manic one-eyed weasel owns his moments.The fluid operation of the camera in addition to its vivid use of colour palette & fab implementation of the third dimension gives its images a rich texture & feel, new characters fit in with relative ease, Editing swiftly paces the narrative & there is attempt at humour in nearly every segment although not all of them work out. John Powell's score is in tune with unfolding set of events while the voice cast ably chip in with required inputs.On an overall scale, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a delightfully amusing, wildly entertaining & thoroughly mesmerising sequel that shouldn't even work but it does. It may not impress those who were expecting an emotionally rewarding tale with sensible characterisation but for those who are looking for a simple, relaxing & lighthearted extravaganza, it checkmarks all the required boxes. A romp ride that's well-aware of its limits, Dawn of the Dinosaurs is an absolute riot.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Not really worth paying the extra money for the 3D version, actually not even worth paying for the 2D version","I was pretty much a fan of the first Ice Age, right now I have one adjective to describe each: for the first one (released in 2002) the adjective is great and for the first sequel (released in 2006 and called The Meltdown) the adjective is boring. I don't really remember much of those both movies but certainly the feeling of being very disappointed back in 2006 is still present. Now comes for this summer the new and third Ice Age movie, Dawn of the Dinosaurs, and frankly I wasn't interested at all in seeing it however over the past few days I began to have a certain expectation, maybe it was just because Ebert who called it the best of the three Ice Age movies, said that ""it involves some of the best use of 3-D I've seen in an animated feature"" and well gave it 3.5/4. I just saw Dawn of the Dinosaurs today in 3D and well this more like The Meltdown, weak storytelling and about the 3D version, well it's certainly a nice-looking movie but with few exceptions (for instance the first appearance of the character Diego) there's nothing really impressive, it's certainly a better choice to save your money and pay for the standard version, actually it's a better choice to save your money (it doesn't even need you now with its gross revue, so far according to wikipedia, of $215, 506, 000!) and wait for a rental.That squirrel is unfunny most of the times here (not really when the squirrel has now to satisfy the orders of its partner!). For me the baby dinosaurs were funnier but only at the beginning of the movie since the plot is about the character Sid getting in real troubles, he felt the loneliness then he stole three dinosaur eggs, the dinosaurs born and they loved their mom! So you can imagine when the real mom comes for her babies, Sid is in troubles so the gang, Manny, Ellie, Diego, Crash and Eddie, comes to rescue him.I'm a fan of Simon Pegg, not quite because of his good performance in the recent Star Trek but certainly because of his stuff under the direction of Edgar Wright. Unfortunately I saw Dawn of the Dinosaurs dubbed in Spanish so I missed Simon Pegg's voice performance as the new character Buck but obviously I didn't missed the great stuff that Buck delivers. This character is one of the good things of the third Ice Age but still maybe next time not even lots and lots of good comments and a four star review of Ebert will make me go to the theater. I guess for this one a rental is just fine6/10, being generous.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Surprisingly almost as good as the original,"After the bore fest that was Ice Age 2: The Meltdown I went to the cinema with very low expectations, a lot of popcorn and an intention to bad-mouth the movie throughout the screening. At the same time I was dreading the laughter of young kids and hoping that it would be at least mildly entertaining.I must admit the movie came by surprise. Sure. It has it faults. Indiana Jones action scenes are overcooked and uninspiring. The new character addition of Buck is just irritating even though he helps move the plot along (the character concept is just poor). The premise of dinosaurs is idiotic (but then again this is a cartoon...). The love affair of our lovable little Scrat is just tiresome and a lot less of the munchkin actually means more.But all in all the characters suddenly began to click again. To some extent this is thanks to exploring new areas of their relationship, instead of just rehashing the first part, as The Meltdown did. Manny is about to expand his family and is expecting a child with the mammoth/opus Ellie. This disrupts the status quo in the weird little family that has been created. Diego the sabre-tooth has been getting weary of the vegetarian settled down life and is ready to move to new hunting grounds. In the meantime it occurs to Sid that the changes about to come will make Manny more focused on his new baby, whilst with Diego about to leave he will be left to fend for his lone self.This leads to Sid wanting to create a family of his own... An opportunity occurs when he finds three eggs buried deep in the snow.Funny, smart, if at times repetitive. Overall the characters are once again lovable and energetic, something sorely missed in the second outing of the team.

Another Fun Adventure,"I haven't seen the second movie of the series, and so can only compare ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" to the first. Aside from the equally superb animation, I thought this story was weaker than the original (as are most sequels) but still was good fun. Here, Sid the Sloth is working with babies again (just as he worked with the human baby in the first movie.) This time, it's a trio of dinosaur babies that he stumbles upon and decides to raise as his own. Yeah, I know, dinosaurs and mammals didn't co-exist - but it's a kid's movie - and the writers got around that by turning this into a kind of ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"" type adventure. Sid discovers the eggs after crashing through the ice into an underground world where dinosaurs still rule. Unfortunately, Mamma Dinosaur wants her babies back, and Sid ends up being taken along for the ride, which means that Diego, Manfred et. al. have to set out on their own adventure to rescue him.What I thought was much weaker here than in the original movie was the lack of any real poignancy, such as Manfred's memories of his family or Diego's ""death scene."" This movie simply comes on like an action/adventure with some comedy (and some of it pretty funny) thrown in. Personally, I didn't care that much for the new character of Buck, a one-eyed weasel who's essentially exiled himself in dino-world and who ends up leading the gang in their search. It's a good movie for kids (although some of the dinosaur scenes might be a bit scary for younger ones.) 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Painfully bad script,"OK, you saw Ice Age 1&2 and you will see the third one. I know this mini-review will not prevent you from seeing the movie. But at least I will have have a good sleep... because I TOLD YOU!OK, IA3 is BAD. Really bad. It is missing something the previous 2 movies had. Humor.Yes, there is a lot of action, animals are jumping all around the screen and every now and then someone is falling into bottomless abyss... But that is too little to present it as a movie.Mainly because...The script is retarded! I felt like Sylvester Stallone was writing it! The movie seems like a sequence of random scenes a events - this may work great for Family Guy, but it does not for IA3. I did not have a clue what was happening in the first 30 minutes, apparently the animals were trying to get from point A to point B. What was happening after knows only God and a few millions people who actually sit through whole movie.Jokes were too forced and rare. Feels like 10 ""creative"" marketing guys were sitting together and everyone had to felt the obligation to actually contribute something to the movie. You just do not feel the passion and enthusiasm that was put into the first Ice Age. IA3 feels like a YET ANOTHER GENERIC PRODUCT manufactured by generic employees of a generic company.It is bigger. It is noisier. It is more annoying. And it is NOT FUNNY. Sure, graphics is great but it is just a lipstick on a fat & dirty (fill in the animal you really dislike).",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Thawing Ice.,"Sid inadvertently finds a world in the melting ice age which is home to prehistoric dinosaurs after he takes one tyrannosaurus rex's unhatched eggs (believing the eggs have no mother and never knowing until they hatch they are actually dinosaurs). Now it is up to Manny, Ellie (expecting their first child), Diego, and the other major characters brought back from ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" to save the day. And of course we have new characters and graphics to go with the new adventure. Impressive, but somewhat underwhelming third installment in the hugely popular computer-animated genre as the characters are still right on target (particularly those from the original installment) and the situations continue to be fun and interesting for most all age groups. With that said, the thrill and energy of the initial concept is slowly trickling away as the film-makers seem to be grasping at straws to feed hungry audiences who love these characters and concepts and keep the money machine rolling full-speed ahead. Though far from perfect and easily the weakest of the series, the movie is still highly entertaining and serves the masses well in spite of numerous shortcomings. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Animation
"""I liked you guys better when you were extinct!""","The mammoths have a baby on the way. Diego feels like a fifth wheel. Scrat finds his perfect match (too perfect--she wants the beloved acorn too), and Sid adopts eggs. Oops, they belong to a dinosaur. And she's not extinct. Mommy wants her young back, seizes their kidnapper Sid, and drags him off back to a subterranean Lost World.So it's Ice Agers to the rescue of their friend in Jurassic Park. Rumors of them bringing in the big reptiles as a desperate attempt to revitalize the Ice Age series have been greatly exaggerated. Ice Age is still cool, and all the stuff that's made it fun up to now is still fresh. New characters establish themselves as valuable parts of the crazy silliness almost immediately. There's a great soldier of fortune guy who comes across as a Capt. Jack Sparrow/Paul Hogan mix. The mommy T-Rex is genuine and likable. All of the baby animals are cute. Pterodactyls, horn-backed creatures, stegosauruses, and more all drop by. Then there's a great villain, the king of them all, a rampaging Gigantisaurus who makes Lady T-Rex look petite. It's a sure bet some of these guys will be back for future Ice Age episodes.While all this goes on, the ongoing Scrat saga continues, but now he has competition for his prized acorn. A pretty female Scrat. You can guess where this is heading, and the film utilizes the conflict/romantic tension routine for hilarious results. There are also some key lines extracted from Jurassic Park that are dealt out for great one liner/sight gags, as well as a few cultural reference jokes.It helps to enjoy this if you've seen the first two Ice Age movies. It's a nice addition to the ongoing character story lines, although its high octane zany approach contrasts with the low key atmosphere of the first one. A fun watch for both kids and adults.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Defying every science book imaginable, the third Ice Age becomes the most surreal of the trilogy.","The Ice Age franchise is the lone wolf in the computer-animated franchises since its not from Pixar or Dreamworks yet however makes a fantastic amount of money and receives a good amount of praise. As a matter of fact, the original Ice Age remains one of the better non-Pixar efforts since 1995, when Toy Story started it all. Unfortunately, the sequel failed to live up to the original, despite the best efforts from Scrat, the unofficial mascot of the franchise. In the third installment though, the amount of believable material slips to a dangerous low as we have dinosaurs underneath the ice in a totally different atmosphere. Then with more characters introduced, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs was beginning to look like Shrek the Third: too many characters, not enough plot, and too many futile attempts at humor coming from multiple different angles.Despite my predictions coming true loosely, the movie is surprisingly enjoyable. As a matter of fact, it was a few quips away from topping the original, while surpassing the second installment in every possible way. Scrat is as funny as ever, and some of the unfunny characters from The Meltdown have their shining moments in this film. The animation is beginning to lag behind Pixar though, when before they were getting close quality-wise (especially with Horton Hears a Who).Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is about the entire crew discovering an entire ecosystem full of dinosaurs underneath the ice. Both worlds collide when Sid (John Leguizamo) accidentally takes some dinosaurs eggs while looking for new ways to entertain himself and find new friends; after seeing Manny (Ray Romano) focusing all his attention to closely being a father, and Diego (Denis Leary) suddenly leaving the pack. Along their travels, they'll meet a hyper and bizarre weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg). The other portion of the movie has to do with the lovable Scrat chasing an acorn along with a female squirrel that may or may not want him.Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a highly unbelievable movie, and it was crafted in a way that made it obvious that the writers wanted to milk the franchise even more yet couldn't find the proper way of doing it, so they dwelled even deeper in fiction. The first two Ice Ages were at least loosely scientifically realistic. This one breaks all rules covering which animals thrived in which time periods. Luckily for us, the dinosaurs were not the main focus of the film as much as the heavy assortment of main characters. Just like in the second part of the trilogy, the chemistry amongst the cast just wasn't there, and the voice acting yet again isn't to blame. Poor Ray Romano and Denis Leary, they just have no material to work with, and it hinders their voice work. They do deliver more laughs this time (even the opossums), but it's still not as present as the first Ice Age.The writers ruined and saved the movie. The concept itself was bizarre, surreal, and just didn't mesh well with the rest of the series. But they did craft some clever sequences of peril and did throw in some hilarious obstacles, especially the bit with poisonous gases. We also have a decent amount of modern-day references to Star Wars and even current issues. Then of course, every scene Scrat was in was comic gold. I stated this in my review of The Meltdown, but Scrat (just like the penguins of Madagascar) needs his own movie immediately. His Road Runner-Coyote-like antics just make the film and remain the top reason to ever watch an Ice Age movie.The director of the original was not present in the second, or in this one. This is probably why the original remains the best. Chris Wedge, the voice of Scrat, proved to mesh emotion and comedy best with his work on the award-winning short Bunny and his lead director duties in Ice Age. The third installment is directed by Carlos Saldanha, the co-director of the first and main director of the sequel. His strengths and weaknesses are the same here, as he doesn't mix emotion with comedy well, and gives the wrong characters too much screen time. Buck's (the main new character) antics themselves were very hit-and-miss, with the misses being quite painful.Don't let all the bad news bring you down though, the movie is indeed funny, and if you liked the previous efforts, there's no need for you to skip this one. It's just that with the bar in quality being set higher and higher as animation and storytelling is beginning to evolve in a much more mature manner, it's harder and harder to claim that this movie stands out amongst the mediocre ones.Bottom Line: Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a grand step forward from the second part with superior humor, superior pacing, and more Scrat hilarity. However, the emotion still doesn't mix well, especially with Up's incredible ability to rip you to your emotional core a few months back. More characters doesn't necessarily mean more humor, and its time that everyone learns this. Madagascar 2, Shrek 2, Shrek 3, Cars, Shark Tale, Ice Age 2, Ice Age 3 all suffered from the same fate of having too many characters, and then cutting back on the characters that we enjoy watching most. Dawn of the Dinosaurs: Surprisingly funny, but not fulfilling and ultimately quite forgettable.Quote of the Film: ""I don't speak wind""",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ice Age - Buck Rocks,"Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs - what i like in the movie is the new character Buck (voice by Simon Pegg), slightly crazed weasel. He is like this small creature who is going to take over the largest dinosaur called Rudy, (a white Baryonyx that is the world's biggest carnivorous dinosaur),oh yes bigger than Tyrannosaurus Rex. He is this miniature Rambo fighting in the jungle who knows hot to protect himself and the people around him. The characters' attitude is again awesome and he says that you have rules in the jungle, and the first rule is to ""Listen to Buck"".The story of Ice Age 3 is about being a part of the family, in their case is being part of a herd that stays together, lives together and then has a brilliant adventure together in protecting each other. Ellie (voice by Queen Latifah) and Manny (voice by Ray Romano) are having a baby and Manny has baby proofed nature. There is this potion of jungle where he has removed all the pointy objects, covered all the twigs with snow balls that it does not hurt the baby. At the same time, Sid (voice by John Leguizamo) and Deigo (voice by Denis Leary) are feeling left out from the herd, that is normal.The adventures start when Sid finds the dinosaur eggs and the hatch to know that they are the eggs of T-Rex, Sid tries to make the hardcore carnivores get converted to become vegetarian, but in vain. Then, one the Mom T-Rex arrives, she takes the three babies and Sid to whole new world where the Dinosaurs are still not completely extinct. This where they meet Buck.My favorite sequence from the movie is the chase when Buck is flying one of the bird like dinosaurs to save Sid from falling into the lava waterfall and is being chased by even more vicious bird like dinosaurs who are trying to attack them (Buck, Crash, Eddy) in an aerial combat. You need to watch it to believe it. This is the favorite animation sequence.Scrat, has new thing to seek other than the Acorn, this time it is Scratteeeee. She is seductive, beautiful, battering her eyelids to gain attention of Scrat only to get to the acorn. In the end, they play this song with the credits which was again, super awesome and there is Sid in a very funny dance moves.Sid, Manny, Ellie, Deigo, Crash and Eddie are their usual self.

1 and 2 were better,"I always liked animations like his one, but I just didn't like Ice Age 3. The other Ice Ages were so much funnier, with comic situations, and this one is all about family and kids and stuff like that, what turned it into a boring movie.On the other hand, there are still good scenes, creative situations and everything, besides that the animation itself is just perfect. Other thing that catches the attention are the ""subliminar sexual jokes"" that, I think, just grown ups understand.All in all, I really think there are other movies of this gender much better. Finding Nemo is the best example, besides the other Ice Ages, like I said... It is not difficult to find others.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best 3-D movie yet!,"There have been quite a few movies in 3-D lately (and there are more to come), but at this moment (Pixars Up is not available to review yet), this is the best of them. It's not the effects, that make this movie wonderful. They are nice, but I'm sure there will be better ones shortly (like in the movie Avatar by James Cameron). It's the movie/the story itself that convinces!While the second Ice Age (movie), could be considered a bit of a letdown, this one picks right up and takes you along a great ride. There's not that much that you can accuse the movie of (one of the things might be, that you think Diego is underused), because it works nicely. The new main character that is introduced, is spoken by someone very famous in Great Britain .... Everything fits and the movie can be enjoyed by young audiences and older ones. Even Scrat gets something ""new"" ... something he that is very familiar for us ""humans"" in every aspect that he is living through it and therefor very funny.I can only recommend the movie to everyone!

The Ice Age Jurassic Park,"Ice Age: Dawn Of The Dinosaurs is the kind of sequel from the franchise at least passible. I know there are some people that consider it better than Meltdown. Me, it is a little worse due to the characters that do get annoying even the fact this is the film Sid's character went downhill and some elements get pointless. But it can still have fun moments with some good animation from the dinosaur world and the heart of Manny becoming a father does come to the right place. And I do find Buck Wild an enjoyable addition to the franchise, especially with the backstory. It would be too easy to recommend this to the major fans of the franchise. So because this is a dinosaur film, this would be something for the kids that are dinosaur geeks. Even if this is an Ice Age sequel, at least this one is not the kind to feel frustrated with. Honestly, this is exactly the franchise should've ended with. But instead, it has decided to get worse with the last two films.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"all the charm and wit that made the first two ""Ice Age"" pictures so wonderful has withered away and what we're left with is an entirely forgettable third installment","Isn't it quite amusing that seven years ago, the creators of ""Ice Age"" declared that there would be no dinosaurs in their saga? In a way, that was false right from the start. Remember, there was a dinosaur frozen in ice in the first movie, two prehistoric marine animals let loose in the second, and now here we are, and a tyrannosaurus rex is stomping around having left a subterranean underground prehistoric world in search of her eggs. The idea of reusing the old underground prehistoric world and incorporating it with the Ice Age saga is enough evidence to tell that the filmmakers are running out of ideas. The animation is still top-notch, the voice-acting is great, and the intentions are still good, but the charm and wit and magic that made the first two movies so much fun has withered away and what we are left with is a cheap thirty-minute cartoon expanded into a feature-length movie. ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is a movie made strictly for profit and not for entertainment. It's not really a bad movie, but unlike its two predecessors, it's completely forgettable.In the third installment in this once wonderful series, Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) are expecting a baby. Sid, a little jealous and feeling left out, stumbles upon three dinosaurs eggs in a frozen underground cave and, being Sid, thinks he has what it takes to raise them. The eggs hatch into three baby dinosaurs and then, just as you'd expect, mama arrives, takes her brood and snatches up Sid as well. And then its up to Manny, Ellie, her possum brothers, and Diego to go and rescue him in an underground world where dinosaurs still live. As they search, they are guided by a cocky and pretentiously goofy possum who is like a cross between Captain Ahab and the explorer Frank Buck.There is nothing wrong with the movie visually. But where it really counts, in the story and characters, it's crippled. The movie is composed of dialogue that is one hundred percent deliberately chirpy and ostentatious, with the filmmakers expecting you to believe that just because they're telling a joke, that you will laugh. The humor in this movie is the same kind you will find in any half-hour cartoon and maybe even a little less profound. Only the character of Buck, the possum, really contains the magic and wit that made the first two movies so much fun.As for everybody else, they are either watered down or pushed a few too many steps ahead. For instance, I liked Manny when he was a moody mammoth, but I don't like him so much now that he's a happy, jolly guy like Santa Claus with fur and a trunk. The whole pregnancy subplot was just publicity and serves no purpose in the story. Crash and Eddie the possums are no longer funny—Buck has all the humorous moments. And Diego's place in the film has completely watered down into basically cameo quality. He has a lot of screen time, but very little character and impact. Again, he has a problem that's eating away at him, but unlike in the first two movies, where the subplot was worked into making sense, here it really just flickers up now and again and never is fully encompassed upon. And worst of all, Sid the sloth, who always acted stupid but was once very funny, has become so ostentatiously dumb that he condescends into becoming irritating for the audience as well as the other characters.And what about Scrat, the saber-toothed squirrel after his acorn? Well, guess what? He's boring now as well. Because the filmmakers came up with the incredibly dreadful idea of having him only chasing his acorn half the time and spending the rest of his time ogling at a female squirrel.Now the movie is saved from being a total disaster by the character of Buck, who was enthusiastically voiced and animated, but he's just a supporting character. What made the first two movies so much fun? Whole casts of good characters, effective moments of humor and wit, developed stories, and a certain level of charm. All of that is gone in ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs."" This time the filmmakers decided to focus appeal strictly upon the very young members of the audience and forget all the techniques and imaginative works that made the first two films so enjoyable. In the end, ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is, in a single word, forgettable. This should have been a straight-to-DVD production. It's not worth a theater ticket.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great animation and action but that's it,"The highlight of this film was the animation of the dinosaurs and the weasel. They were fresh additions and had great action.

Maintains standard of previous two,"I have to say, straight out, that I enjoyed the third installment in this prehistoric animated series. I can’t get enough of the adventures of Manny and Sid and Diego, even as their “herd” continues to grow. Each of the movies is a lot of fun to watch, with just enough sweet scenes to balance things out.This time around, Manny and Ellie (Ray Romano and Queen Latifah) are expecting, and of course Manny’s a nervous father to be. But that’s not all – the group dynamic is starting to shift in other ways as well. First, Diego (Denis Leary) is starting to feel old and in the way; second, Sid (John Leguizamo) is actually getting in the way of Manny’s well-laid plans. But like with the first couple of movies, what brings everyone together is a journey. This time around, Sid is accidentally snatched by a giant T-rex, whose eggs he had been, er, watching. And the race is on to find and rescue Sid in what’s apparently a dinocentric world right under our friends’ icy land.The visuals are stunning. Sweeping vistas of whites and blues when the gang is at home, and vibrant hues of browns, greens, and darker blues in the land of the dinosaurs. Computer animation has gotten to the point where the movies have the same level of quality as the early Disney cel animation films. The Ice Age films are wonderfully rendered, from those stunning backgrounds to the detailed expressions of the characters.I do hope, though, that the Ice Age films (if more are made) don’t fall into the same rut that befell the Land before Time series. There have now been thirteen LBT movies! Of course, only the first one was in theaters, but you get my drift. Let’s not see Ice Age XX: The Search for the Great Wisdom Tree or some such fluff. Now, each of the Ice Age films has been in theaters, and although none of them has been an instant classic, each has been charming fun, and the quality has not deteriorated over the films.So in essence, the latest Ice Age film maintains the high fun quotient of its predecessors without lapsing into schmaltz or too-broad physical humor. I mean, it IS a kids’ film, after all, so there’s plenty of physical humor to be found, but the comedy isn’t based solely on pain and suffering.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another good sequel,"Me, my wife and my seven year old son were curious to see Ice Age 3. It's no doubt another good original sequel with full of original ideas from the time of the dinosaurs. There were again plenty scenes were we laughed a lot. The special effects are really well done and the cinematography contains superb colors. The story line follows the typical dramatical dynamic with a certain suspense. I liked especially the air battle scene and all the different species of dinosaurs. I hope there will be another part of Ice Age but I doubt that in the next there would be enough elements to create again a successful movie. This one merits a solid rating of 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The rebirth of a dying franchise,"The first sequel to 20th Century Fox's Ice Age, Ice Age: The Meltdown, was awful. There was nothing redeemable about the film. The writing was bad, the animation hadn't improved, and the story along with it's characters were rushed and predictable. The franchise was virtually dead in the water.This summer brought Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, the company's first 3D endeavour. Since most animated films coming out nowadays are heading towards the third dimension, it seemed necessary that this would follow suit. After seeing a few of the 3D films this year this was nothing spectacular, but it was definitely on par with the rest.The film starts off with Scrat (the squirrel) finding another female squirrel and the two of them fighting over the beloved acorn. Manny and Ellie (Ray Romano and Queen Latifah) are expecting their first child and Manny is not handling being a father very well. Diego (Dennis Leary), sensing that his time with the ""herd"" is almost up, is on the verge of leaving for good. Meanwhile Sid (John Leguizamo) tries to start a family of his own by swiping some idle dinosaur eggs. This opens up a whole can of worms, resulting in the mother dinosaur stealing her babies along with Sid and venturing back home to her world under the surface.The remaining members of the herd follow him below the surface to a Journey to the Center of the Earth type realm where the meet their guide, Buck (Simon Pegg), a lone weasel whose cunning is almost as great as his madness. It is up to him to bring them safely through the jungle without being eaten by the dreaded monster Rudy.The story is nothing out of the ordinary but it doesn't disappoint by any means. Where the film excels is in the writing. There are jokes here and there for the kids, after all it is a children's movie, but for the most part an adult will feel pretty satisfied on the whole with the humor. The problems the characters face are not that uncommon for most adults. There are family issues like pregnancy, fatherhood, and other issues like finding a sense of belonging and whether or not you can still keep up with the rest of the world.The animation compliments the story quite nicely. There are some cheap gimmicks with the 3D effects but they aren't over the top. The layering of the objects in the background and foreground are excellent, giving the film great depth. There are some neat motion shots and point of view shots throughout the film that give it a cool feel.I'm not really promoting you see this film but if you have the chance to I would say don't be scared. It's a cool little film that has a lot to offer for all ages. I don't think they should make another one, but after all the money this film is making tallies up I think they might have to. That could be very bad. Or not. We'll see.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolute garbage -- do not waste your time,"I have walked out on a handful of movies in my life. Ice Age 3 joins that handful. For the first 45 minutes of the film the plot meanders along aimlessly. The characters all act like self-centered boneheads, and un-comedic shenanigans feebly result.I'm serious. I love digital animation. I love 3-d. But I realized while watching this movie that neither of those things can save a rancid stinker of a script. The only interesting aspect at all of the movie was the sabre-toothed squirrel and his acorn gag, which by the way can be seen in its entirety in the preview and was not new in any way.My fiancée turned to me at one point during the movie and said ""it's in 3-d, isn't it?"" The effect was so watered-down that we could no longer tell. Plus, there was no aspect of the story which caught our interest whatsoever.Good animated comedies are funny to the adults in their audience as well as their kids. Dozens of digitally-animated movies succeed wildly in that respect. But what we've got here is proof positive that someone will finally spend the millions of dollars it takes to put an absolute turd on the screen using the latest technology.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Still not as good as the original ""Ice Age"" from 2002, but a decent second sequel","This third installment in the ""Ice Age"" trilogy from Blue Sky Studios made it to the silver screen this summer, but I haven't seen many films in the theatre this year, and this was no exception. I hadn't even seen its two predecessors by the time it was released. I saw both the original ""Ice Age"" and the first sequel, ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"", for the first time just last month. Since I was impressed with them both, especially the original (which is unsurprisingly the best of the three), I was bound to end up watching ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" soon afterwards. Yesterday evening, I rented a copy of it on DVD, just like I did with the first two last month. After seeing them all, I can say neither sequel is as good as the first one, but that doesn't mean they're boring.Manny and Ellie are expecting a baby, and Manny wants everything to be perfect for the arrival of the newborn. Diego believes he is losing his predatory skill, and decides to leave the herd. Sid wants to raise a family of his own, and sees an opportunity to do so after he accidentally falls through ice and finds three dinosaur eggs, which he believes have been abandoned! He takes the eggs back up to the surface, and when Manny sees them, he tells Sid to take them back, but they soon hatch into baby Tyrannosaurus! The sloth thinks it's great to be a parent, but the three young dinosaurs cause a lot of trouble for the other children around. It isn't long before the Tyrannosaurus mother comes up, and when she finds Sid with her young, she takes the sloth and her three offspring back underground with her! Ellie, Manny, Crash, and Eddie go underground to find Sid, and discover an entire jungle down there, with creatures thought to be extinct! They find Diego, who has also come down to rescue Sid, and the five of them find themselves in a lot of danger as they are guided by a one-eyed weasel named Buck!Just like the two previous ""Ice Age"" movies, this one is often very funny. The humour may sometimes be a little too kiddish for adults (I still don't find Crash and Eddie, who were introduced in the second film, that funny), but many gags in ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" made me laugh, with the usual conflict and such. Also, I found what Sid says when his head is stuck up the mother Tyrannosaurus' nose to be a comic highlight, even though it's very juvenile! Of course, we once again have Scrat the ""saber-toothed squirrel"" constantly trying to protect his acorn, but this time, he has a female competitor named Scratte, which leads to more comical moments. There's also a good amount of action and excitement during the characters' underground adventure, with the man-eating plant, lava, and some ferocious beasts! This underground jungle can easily remind one of the jungles of Skull Island in ""King Kong"". Once again, the animation is great in this third ""Ice Age"" movie, even if it didn't impress me quite as much as the animation in its predecessors did for some reason.The original ""Ice Age"" was rated PG for mild peril, and the first sequel was given the same rating for its smut. This second sequel has been given the PG rating for both of those reasons. ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" has some sexual innuendos, and I will warn parents that there are even more of those in ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"". These crude jokes, or at least some of them, could easily go over the heads of little kids, which is a good thing, but parents should still be careful. On the other hand, for adult viewers, the sexual innuendos can be really funny. No, ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is not one of the cleanest CGI animated family movies from recent years, even though it came from the same studio that brought us ""Horton Hears a Who!"", the first G-rated full-length adaptation of a Dr. Seuss book, just last year. However, this third installment in the ""Ice Age"" trilogy is still decent family fare for kids who can get over the mild smut and for many adults as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Ice Age 3 completely embraces its action sequences, which are well built, but eliminating those moments, the rest of the film is empty and definitely worn out in its proposal","If the first two films in the Ice Age saga, released in 2002 and 2006, collected together, at the box office worldwide, more than one billion dollars, what about Ice Age 3 besides: 'by what took so long?'? After all, this was, and rightly so, one of the most anticipated features of 2009. And it is with satisfaction that it is announced: it was worth the wait! Again directed by the Brazilian Carlos Saldanha (who co-directed the first and commanded the second alone), this third episode deftly combines an agile plot, fun characters and a fabulous visual, combining the potential of 3D with a context in which it was few before. Makes it necessary and very well explored.Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) are waiting for their first child. Sid (John Leguizamo) finds some dinosaur eggs, which leads him to have his own adoptive family. Except that the theft causes him to get into trouble, with the mother tyrannosaurus coming after his shoots. She takes the three cubs and Sid to an underground world, where the dinosaurs still exist, which forces Manny, Ellie and Diego (Denis Leary) to go in search of him to rescue him. As is usual in the series, as we watch the main plot unfold, we also see Scrat in his endless hunt for his precious nut, generating some of the funniest moments in the production. However, the squirrel will not be alone, as a female of its kind, the seductive Scratita, also wants the coveted prize. Will the struggling - and indestructible - Scrat succeed in defeating his opponent or will he fall for the maxim ""make love not make war""?By insisting on the same formula for the second time in a row (a formula that, let's face it, was already born repeated), director Carlos Saldanha and screenwriters Michael Berg and Peter Ackerman obviously did not think about reaching new limits with this second sequence of Ice Age. What they and Fox wanted was just huge revenue, to make everyone (them) a little bit richer. So, it didn't matter if the final result turned out to be mediocre. That's what ended up happening. This one is the same movie that we have already seen twice and, if before there was a feeling of pure fun provided by the simplicity of a script and captivating characters, this does not stand up to another visitation, because ""The Awakening of the Dinosaurs"" seems to be really a chapter of the drawing made for television. Only very well produced.Unlike the first two films, the objective of director Carlos Saldanha here is pure entertainment and it is worth mentioning that he is successful in this proposal, building several efficient action sequences, such as, fights against dinosaurs, flights over pterodactyls and escapes of carnivorous plants. In addition, due to this focus, the squirrel Scrat gains even more prominence, since it is one of the favorite characters of the public, especially the child, so, it gains more space on canvas, having this time a romantic arch, where he is torn between the two loves of his life, the nut and the female squirrel Scratte. The romance of the two squirrels is one of the highlights of the film, the visual jokes are fun, naughty and the soundtrack that complements these moments is witty. Like ""You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine"", whispered in the best Barry White seduction style, or a tango in which between a dramatic step and another, the nut is disputed by legs and tails vying for what really matters, the nut.The characters already known are very well characterized in relation to the previous films. Manny continues to be the emotional center of the franchise, with the future owl-father having here concluded the arc of the loss of his family that started there in the first feature. We followed the journey of this bitter loner, passing to a good friend, until he became, again, the head of a family and this was extremely important for the franchise, because we really knew the nice big guy, we sympathized and we were thrilled with him. Diego also gains some prominence in this third film, dealing with the issue of not being more skilled as soon as possible and his concern about being ""softening"", something that even generates a distance from him in relation to his friends. For his part, Sid remains as funny and clumsy as ever. His dynamics with the mother-dinosaur and its pups is great and generates good moments, although sometimes it comes dangerously close to that between the Donkey and the Dragon in the series ""Shrek"".The figures presented in the second film are even better worked here. The mammoth Ellie becomes more interesting as Manny's wife than as that bizarre character who thought she was another animal on the previous tape. The Crash and Eddie duo are much more tolerable, because they start to have a really comical counterpoint here, incarnated by the male weasel Buck, practically an insane and animated version of Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell character in ""Escape from New York"") mixed with Captain Ahab (from ""Moby Dick""), certainly the best news in history. This insane guide - in the original voiced by the ubiquitous Simon Pegg - takes the group through the dangers of the Jurassic world and is accompanied not only by perfect design and captivating personality, but also by a very particular cinematic signature. Buck, Saldanha reserves dramatic close-ups, stylized flashbacks (as if they were old films, in 3-D!) And a special affection.In the visual aspect, the tape directed by the Brazilian Carlos Saldanha presents itself very well, mainly showing the wild land in which the troupe ends up embarking in the course of history, with the filmmaker creating really beautiful plans and very inspired visual outlets (see the ribcage) with the Scrat nut), as well as careful work on the animation - the characters' furry effects are incredible. Regarding the visual, if in the first film of the series it was simplistic and almost boring (which at least did not hinder the quality of the work), and if in the second it remained simplistic, but it won impressive technical jokes, now, despite the fact that same evolution as before, visually it is still a rich film that, at the very least, does not look ugly close to the obvious competitors - Pixar and DreamWorks. The three-dimensional effects are well used, especially in relation to the depth and are really worth the slightly more expensive ticket of the 3D rooms, with certain sequences being absolutely incredible in this version of the tape, especially the action scenes in the last third of the projection.The production design matches the action sequences and creates an even richer, colorful and imaginative universe, building a perfectly credible, beautiful, but also hostile Jurassic world below the earth. This hostility is underscored by the sound editing, which, unlike the first film, where it put subtle sounds of wind to create a cold environment, this time inserts several grunts of diegetic dinosaurs, to give the feeling that the danger is close by. Instant. Another technical resource used to capture the audience is photography, investing in some subjective plans so that those who watch it experience the action as if they were part of it.Even with the technical praise, a film cannot survive without a story that connects these good sequences, however, in this third feature, the script is even more shallow than the second, betting once again on the already beaten story about family, message that was already broadcast at the beginning of the franchise. In the very first act, the script, written by Lori Forte and John Donkin, shows how Manny's new family affects his companions, with Diego fearing monotonous family life and Sid missing belonging to one, however, rather than exploring this, the story uses the plot only as a resource to make animals enter the world of dinosaurs. After that, any character development is discarded and the film is only concerned with placing obstacles for them to face and even though they are fun scenes, they do not add any weight to the narrative.Despite a very fast pace and suitable for an animated comedy, the film slips in its editing by presenting two climaxes in its final stretch, something that really could have been avoided. In terms of entertaining, Ice Age 3 completely embraces its action sequences, which are well built, but eliminating those moments, the rest of the film is empty and definitely worn out in its proposal, since, when the only interesting character is Buck, introduced in this third feature, this is a clear demonstration that either the franchise creates new elements or will fall into monotony once and for all.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Ice age:dawn of the dinosaurs,"Manny is anxious with the pregnancy of Ellie and builds a playground for the offspring. Meanwhile, Scrat disputes an acorn with the female Scratte and they fall in love with each other while Diego feels old since he is unable to catch a gazelle. The lonely Sid feels jealous of Manny and Ellie and when he finds three dinosaur eggs in an underground cave, he steals and brings them to the surface. He hatches the eggs during the night and on the next morning, three dinosaur babies believe that Sid is their mother and follow him everywhere.Meanwhile, the real dinosaur mammy seeks their offspring out and when she finds the trio, she brings them back with Sid to her underground world. Manny, Ellie, Diego, Crash and Eddie pursue the dinosaur to rescue their friend and stumble with a dangerous underground world. But they are helped by the smart and talkative one-eyed weasel known as Buck that wears a patch and chases the dangerous Rudy, who was the responsible for the loss of his eye.""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is a wonderful and entertaining tale of love and friendship, with adorable characters and witty situations. The love of Manny with Ellie is very beautiful; the triangle of love among Scrat, the acorn and Scratte is hilarious; the love of Sid with the three dinosaurs is funny and also heartbreaking. For me, the best scene in the story is when mammy dinosaur brings the three babies to the top of a tree and Sid is unable to climb it and says goodnight to the children. But maybe the most important is the friendship Manny, Ellie, Diego, Crash and Eddie with Sid, risking their lives to save their friend. My vote is nine.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best in the franchise so far,"My favorite of the franchise so far, Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs takes the franchise to new heights and new creative ideas- marking the first time in animated history that the third time's the charm. Although I did enjoy the film greatly, it isn't without its flaws. Its plot can be a bit all over the place at times, and other moments feel a bit too rushed or forced to have their intended effect. Despite all this though, it's easily the most entertaining film in the franchise so far, and its further addition of new characters and exploration of an entire new world was rather fun to watch. Simon Pegg as Buck Wilde is just some of the greatest voice casting of all time, and really sticks out in my mind as one of the most iconic characters in this franchise- which is sad to see Disney ruined him with the franchises most recent film and there recasting. I laughed many times out loud watching this one, and it's honestly the funniest one yet. It does feel a bit campy, a bit quirky at times, but forgive me, I really did enjoy it. This franchise has never been great films in terms of story, but films very rich in character and fun- which is something a lot of films like this forget today. No other animated franchise can give you such memorable and iconic characters as a crazy pirate weasel or a saber-tooth squirrel- thats what sticks this franchise out amongst its fellow competitors, and that is what makes the franchise and this film in particular so enjoyable.My Rating: 8.4/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Overall an improvement over 2 but still inferior to 1,"At first I really didn't like it. Diego leaving for a really dumb reason, Manny just being a dumbass, there being a lot of pp jokes so it really didn't have a great 1st act. But once it took us down to the dinosaur world. I oddly enough enjoyed it a lot.The second movie had a better plot but it was just so boring but as I said the dinosaur world is a pretty fun place to be at and we get the best character of the entire series, Buck wild. He is pretty funny, had a really great voice acting and overall Buck was a really fun character to be around. Even though I thought it was a bit generic at first, the relation between Sid and the little dinosaurs was surprisingly sweetI thought the first was a bit unfunny, the second unfunny but this has gained the title as the best of the series comedy wise. Buck's comedic lines really do hit with his great voice acting and I did laugh sometimes by lines that were not delivered by BuckThis has a lot of improvements over 2. First of all, only the Scrat sequences were fun but I've pretty much enjoyed all plots after arriving at the dinosaur world. All the characters were important and they all had something to do, unlike the 2nd where only Manny, Elie has things to do. And of course the visuals looks great. The first 2 has outdated CGI but this holds up well animation wise. Also I enjoyed the Scrat plot even more this time aroundBut there is a reason why this doesn't quite surpass the first for me because as I said, the first act is really boring. And why does this movie have 2 climaxes? Manny had a glow-down here. He is far dumber, annoying and he had to the same arch he already did in the first film which is ironic because he was pretty much the smartest character in the first film but I'm not crazy when I would say he's the dumbest here.Overall rating: 7.3/10 just slightly worse than 1 but a major improvement over 2.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"May be crazy, but overall hilarious with a capital ""H""!","Following our love of the first two Ice Age films, my entire family and I expected a third one. It's just as hilarious (if not more) than the first two! As with ""The Meltdown"", ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" introduced us to new characters, Scratte, Scrat's love interest, and Buck, a weasel who bears traits similar to Crocodile Dundee (played by Simon Pegg of ""Shaun on the Dead"" and ""Spaced"" fame). It was a breathtaking experience (with outstanding colors) to see our favorite herd in a new dimension: the Dinosaur world! What more could you ask for? Seeing as Ice Age is a popular movie franchise like Toy Story, we can all relate to the characters at one point or another in our lives. The experience that Ellie and Manny share, Ellie giving birth to her first born child, is something that a lot of parents get excited about and Scrat and Scratte (pronounced Skrat-tay)'s story which regards love is something that we can all relate to.In conclusion, if you are a fan of Ice Age and enjoyed 1 and 2, I suggest that you watch ""Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"", you and your family will enjoy it dearly, and will want to watch it even more than once!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ice Age 3 is a decent film.,"I thought that Ice Age 3 was better then the second but not as good as the first. The animation was superb. The story was alright. It was a little dry in some places. My wife was bored throughout. Watch it in 3d because anything in 3d seems to make the film better. Nothing lashes out at you in 3d, but it gives this film so much more volume. My favorite character was Buck, Simon Pegg did the voice for Buck and he was a perfect choice. I've always loved John Leguizamo as Sid. He's always been the comedy relief for the past two films and this film he continued to make me laugh. I've liked all three Ice Age films.

"Ice Age 3 - a bland, forgettable experience","I'm really shocked at all of the raving comments for this movie. It was an utterly bland, humorless, and predictable film. I wasn't expecting much based on the trailers, and I wasn't disappointed in that respect. This was the same sort of bland that Shrek 3 was; not a bad or terrible film, but just obviously stretching for laughs (and falling short), and completely rote and predictable dialog and situations. The actors sounded tired recording their parts. I said to my wife during the film ""this should have been released directly to video, like one of the Land Before Time sequels"". That all said, the animation is fantastic, for what it's worth. This film is nowhere near as funny as the original Ice Age, but then the kids enjoyed it and that's the main point, I suppose.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Prehistoric Pandemonium Unleashed,"Seeing a 3D animated kids' movie that doesn't stick out its flashy effects for the sake of it is a refreshing change. To be honest, you might not even see some of the tiny 3D aspects in Blue Sky's latest prehistoric critter carnival. The film's electrifyingly vivid palette and thrilling action moments are something you won't want to miss.Significant life changes are experienced by Diego the sabre-toothed tiger, Sid the sloth, and Manny the mammoth. Sid finds dinosaur eggs, Diego is going through a midlife crisis, and Manny is expecting. With the help of a brand-new weasel character, Manny and his group undertake a risky rescue in a Cretaceous underworld.The leads' vocals and design have drawn criticism from some. Though I don't agree, I do believe Simon Pegg's weasel, goes too far in vocal clichés. In a similar vein, a few of the chaotic, humorous transitions involving Scrat the squirrel and a recent romantic relationship are starting to seem too similar. Much like the two previous movies, the main plot is frequently very funny and enjoyable despite the sometimes erratic pacing.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,"When ""Sid"" crashes through the ice and discovers a nest of eggs, he is soon rather unwillingly adopted by their parent and finds himself in a lost, more dangerous and Jurassic, world. Meantime, atop the ice his pals are anticipating the arrival of a baby mammoth while sabre-tooth ""Diego"" is having a bit of a mid-life crisis and ""Scrat"" might just have found love during his latest acorn-tussle. The gang soon realise that ""Sid"" has gone AWOL and that they are going to have to risk life and limb to try and rescue their buddy from his new hostile environment - so off they head into the perilous land of dinosaurs and of the hugely annoying ""Buck"". He's the eye-patched, and very verbose, weasel who claims to be the sort of Allan Quartermain of dino-hunters. From hereon in there are plenty of lively escapades to be had as the franchise quite successfully morphs into the world of the T-Rex and velociraptor whilst helping ""Diego"" feel valued again and getting everyone ready for the arrival of the wooly wean. The soundtrack is interesting - most of it way too old for the demographic, I'd have thought - but the animation is fun to watch with a better story than ""Meltdown"" (2006) and even if I really would have preferred something had eaten the weasel very much earlier on, it's a solid and entertaining outing for everyone and that acorn is still elusive!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Prehistoric fun with a dino twist,"""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,"" the third installment in the Ice Age series, takes the beloved prehistoric characters on a new and exciting adventure. Directed by Carlos Saldanha and Mike Thurmeier, the film introduces a vibrant dinosaur world that brings a fresh twist to the franchise.Manny, Sid, Diego, and the rest of the gang return with their signature humor and camaraderie. This time, the story revolves around Sid's misadventures after he adopts three dinosaur eggs, leading the group into a hidden world beneath the ice. The movie's new setting is visually stunning, with lush, colorful landscapes and impressively animated dinosaurs adding to the excitement.The film balances humor and action well, with plenty of comedic moments, especially from the eccentric weasel, Buck, voiced by Simon Pegg. The dynamic between the characters remains engaging, and the addition of the dinosaurs provides a fresh layer of fun.While ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" may not offer deep storytelling, it delivers plenty of laughs and entertaining sequences, making it a delightful watch for families and fans of the series. Its blend of humor, adventure, and heart ensures a fun prehistoric romp that earns its place in the Ice Age saga.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I liked you guys better when you were extinct,"The third film about the squirrel running for the acorn is visually more impressive than its predecessors.

Iced-over storyline and action,"James Bond, Harry Potter, and Star Wars notwithstanding, there are not too many movie franchises that aren't gasping for breath by the third entry. The latest evidence is the animated comedy ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs.""Like the ""Shrek"" movies, the ""Ice Age"" stories began modestly but have now caved under the weight of too many characters. No. 3 brings back the wooly mammoth Manny (voiced by Ray Romano); his significant other Ellie (Queen Latifah); Diego (Denis Leary), the macho tiger; the hapless sloth Sid (John Leguizamo); and the wordless squirrel Scrat (Chris Wedge).The first few scenes are ominously discouraging. Ellie's is shown to be ""with child,"" and Diego is starting to feel his age. So we get a lot of touchy-feely dialogue about mortality and sharing your emotions – not the kind of talk you're eager to receive from a couple of wooly mammoths.These characters have worn their more endearing traits down to a nub. Sid was always meant to irritate his on-screen friends, but now he gets under our skin as well. Ray Romano, in what was once his only credible movie role, makes Manny as grating as his ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" persona was. And if you've seen Denis Leary on his TV series ""Rescue Me,"" you know that the last emotion he should be asked to display is sensitivity.As if just giving enough screen time to each returnee wasn't enough to intimidate the movie makers, they added an underground world of dinosaurs, so the whole gang can get chased around and scream as if they're in Jurassic Park.Then they get a travel guide, in the form of a macho weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg), so that the movie can score a few ""Apocalypse Now"" jokes.Who's supposed to care about any of this guff? Cartoony as they were, the first two movies made you feel as though something was as stake for these creatures. Now they've turned into stand-up comics, delivering little zingers before they lumber off-screen. The movie alternates between these puny jokes and drawn-out scenes of frantic action, neither of which adequately carry the story or its many subplots.Finally, it must be noted that the movie is in 3D, with the usual cheesy glasses provided at each screening. If you're a fan of this format, ignore my carping. But I share critic Roger Ebert's view that if animation is done plausibly enough, a viewer shouldn't require special glasses to be dazzled by it. Here, 3D is just another prominent distraction.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Scratch has become Nuts (Screen),"The previous sequel seems far away now and I still remember more what happened on this day than the movie itself. Was number 2 a failure?

Furthermore, eye (or brain) adapts very quickly to this vision.It was great to rejoice with this funny trio, which keeps becoming bigger after each movie. In regard to the new delivery, I can't really like Buck, the jungle guide.The story is more oriented this time and fast paced. The gags are funny and even hilarious, especially the Scratch ones! They are really at their best when it comes to glide or fall down!But I fear the extinction is near because the scope is very limited: a ""family"" like this is very difficult to write, all the more in prehistoric times!

"Although the script is weak, this is a very funny film.","Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs {dir. Carlos Saldanha}***/****A major improvement over the last installment, this might be the best film of the series and it is certainly the funniest. Visually the film is well done, although (per usual with Ice Age films) the script could use some fine tuning. Some of the one-liners fall very flat and the characters seem to become boring. However, the film's two biggest virtues make up for its numerous flaws. The best part of the first two films was certainly that curious mix of squirrel and rat fittingly named Scrat. This film features Scrat at his funniest, with more extended scenes and hilarious situations than ever. Also, the addition of a new character, a one-eyed weasel named Buck (voiced brilliantly by Simon Pegg), provides a new pace, rhythm and humor to the tired plot-line.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Bringing fun back!,"You may think my rating of 9 out of 10 for this movie is a little high, for a mere sequel without an original premise. Why throw such high praise onto it? Well I'll tell you. I believe firmly in rating a movie according to its genre because different people like different things! Whilst most would agree that the Godfather is an excellent movie that is more deserving of a 9 rating than this one that viewpoint is a bit silly since it only considers the movie from the point of view of people who like realistic, dramatic movies and not those who just want a bit of fun and escapism from their movies. I loved the Godfather movies but I wouldn't call them fun! I read some of the other reviews of this movie here and it amazes me some of the gripes that people are coming out with about it: ""Dinosaurs died out 65million years before the ice-age!"", ""there's not much of a story.""... You're concerned about realism In a movie about talking animals? A movie in which tigers are hanging out with possums? You're really gonna gripe about how implausible the time-line is in a Children's fantasy fiction CGI CARTOON? In any case they DO actually explain this away - for those kids in the audience whose parents have crippled their ability to suspend any disbelief (presumably those parents are the ones making such ridiculous comments here and I feel sorry for their kids) as our plucky heroes are surprised to find the underground world - & say so. Can you imagine walking out of a cinema after seeing a movie like this only to hear a concerned parent pointing out to their kids how it wasn't factually accurate? Haha! Why not tell them Santa's not real too while you're at it ya' fun-killer?As for the lack of story I've gotta say again; KIDS movie people, jeez stop looking at everything cynical and jaded adult eyes! The story is as involving as it needs to be for the purposes of the film (i.e. allow for our characters to get into humorous adventure situations) as who cares about plot twists & character development when you came to a movie to have fun with your kids or even without as there was more than enough here to keep me - a 25year old male with DVD collection filled with 15-18 rated movies - entertained for the full 90 mins give or take a few minutes at the beginning of the movie which opens with the scene from the trailer we've all seen like 20times by now on T.V. or before other movies - its funny but it is a visual gag and so isn't that funny after you've seen it the first 3times.What's great about this movie is that, as I've already said, if you haven't lost your sense of fun, can suspend disbelief / cynic in yourself, and appreciate a story that exists for the sole purpose of allowing the setup of humorous situations and a plethora of visual gags then you my friend are in for a real treat. I quite liked the first two movies though I can't really recall what they were about (like a good night out - after a few weeks you just remember that you had a good time and that's it, haha) but I thought this one was even better, just rock solid fun from start to finish and a perfectly balanced movie in that you don't have to have seen the previous two in order to follow everything but if you have seen them then at least there is enough new stuff here to hold interest such as Simon Pegg doing an awesome job with the genius comic creation that is Buck the one-eyed weasel; someone here said he reminded them of Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow and I sort of see where they're coming from except Buck is a little of the opposite in that he is foolhardily brave rather than a coward, haha! And so I give this movie a 9 for its genre: the I just want to lose myself in a colourful adventure filled with clever visual gags and a real sense of fun type of movie - nothing serious or dramatic or anything that requires me to think / pay attention. This movie instead just grabs what little attention you might have and takes it for a ride :o) The only reason I didn't give it a 10 for its genre was because I hate and I mean HATE the guy that plays Manny (Ray Romano I think his name is), how he got his own T.V. show (""everybody loves Raymond""... not me!!!) I've no idea, I just don't find him funny, more of a boring, annoying and skull-splittingly drone-some kind of fellow so the fact that even his presence in a lead role was not enough for me to drop this movie more than one star should hopefully tell you how good it is.One final note, I did not watch this movie in 3D, I watched it on a tiny little screen with only stereo sound and I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I'd imagine it would be much much better - as CGI movies often are - in full digital HD with surround sound so if you have an IMAX near you that's showing this or are lucky enough to have a huge HD TV and surround setup then I highly recommend that you watch it that way as I could tell whilst I was watching it that the spectacle of many scenes would have been much more impressive in 3D/HD and with full on sound. Anyway, if you don't enjoy the movie then do yourself a favour and don't have kids - you'll only turn them into boring imagination-devoid poor suckers like you and thats no fun for anyone ;o)",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Awful Awful Awful Hollywood Rubbish,"What is happening to Hollywood movies?! It seems like in the last 10 years or so they've been so busy rushing through scripts to select the ones that tick all the target audience quota, that they have forgotten what it means to make a good movie. And this pile of garbage holds true to that mushy ""American family"" feel they try to regurgitate over and over and over again. Making way too many direct and obvious references to the lives humans lead. Now yes it may be a movie ultimately aimed at children but I for one really enjoyed the 1st and 2nd movies. They were well written, incredibly funny and top-notch on design. This however, is just cheesy punchline after cheesy moment after cheesy character. There were far too many jokes referenced to snot and other 'gruesome' mucus-y type fluids, which were way over-used and overrated as a gag. Also, some of the dialogue was just plain mean and questionably perverse. Like the lines ""Why are we saving Sid? I don't even like Sid, no one does, hes an idiot hahahaha"" and ""I dunno why everyone says 'I've got your back', all the best bits are in the front"".All in all, the movie lacked any real substance, the characters were old and bland and the whole thing just ended up being yet another Hollywood movie out to make a quick buck, which will be forgotten in the weeks after its taken off cinema.What a waste of talent on the animators' parts...",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Better than the second, but still inferior to the first.","""Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is a fun movie, but it stays on the same level as the second one, which already felt like a downgrade for the series. While it introduces new characters and an interesting dinosaur setting, the story lacks the emotional depth and impact that made the first film so memorable. The franchise seems increasingly focused on light comedy, moving away from the more mature and heartfelt themes that gave the original its charm. The main characters retain their simplified personalities from the previous movies, which makes the plot feel somewhat predictable and less engaging.However, the movie shines with the introduction of Buck, a completely new and charismatic character who brings much-needed energy to the franchise. His eccentric personality, adventurous spirit, and mysterious backstory make every scene he's in more engaging, adding a refreshing element to the movie. Buck is undoubtedly the highlight and, in my opinion, the best character introduced in the series so far. Overall, ""Ice Age 3"" is enjoyable and provides good laughs, though it lacks some of the magic of the first film. Buck's presence, however, is what truly makes the movie memorable.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Still better than the first.,"Passable adventure that departs from the Ice age aesthetic and tries to be a bit more Jurassical and Vernesian.It works, it feels fresh, Manny's family drama doesn't improve it but this is a likeable adventure that never gets to any emotional intensity but for a very long saturday morning cartoon, it's not half bad.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Awesome animation; terrible movie,"This movie was very impressive visually--by far the most impressive and convincing 3D animation I have ever seen.That said, the content of the third ice age movie was so much worse than that of the previous two that I genuinely regret paying six dollars to waste 90 minutes sitting in the theater, hoping the entire time that it would get better. I expect this movie would be really funny to a 5-8 year old, but for anyone much older than that, I think the constant poopoo humor will just be a letdown. The last two movies did a good job of entertaining little kids and adults alike, but this one is really only for the little kids, with all the jokes being about butts and farts and other bad smells.In short, I would absolutely encourage you to spend your money on Up! or some other kids movie, as I was sorely disappointed with this one.

Pure Family Friendly Fun,"The Ice Age series is famed for it's physical comedy and heartwarming moments, coupled with incredible animation. Ice Age 3 is certainly no disappointment in this respect and shines through every second.The plot kicks off with Allie and Manny expecting a child, Sid feeling left out and needing to fulfill his parental potential and Diego growing tired of the domestic life and longing for adventure. Explaining any further would ruin some truly brilliant gags and story lines - I'll just say this, the story is strong throughout and enjoyable to the very end. A new character voiced expertly by Simon Pegg was always enjoyable and perhaps one of the brightest highlights of the film, some lines still making me chuckle as I think about them.I have very few negative points on this film, probably the only thing that detracted from my enjoyment were the possums (Crash and Eddie I believe) who seemed quite forced at times and some pop culture references seemed nearly unnecessary compared to all the in-situ comedy.I'd recommend going to the 3D edition as it is a lot more engrossing in the more energetic sequences, all of which are incredible pieces of cinema, animated or not.All in all, a good film for kids of all ages with some good hearty laughs for the adults, an involving storyline and truly amusing characters. Thoroughly enjoyed every minute.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sever meltdown,"To be perfectly honest, I wasn't a big fan of the first two Ice Age movies. The first one has a couple of solid jokes back-up with uninspired storytelling and cheap CGI. The seconds fixed any complaints I had with the animation but once again the laughs were futile and ineffective. Here we have Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and with the prospect of 3-D to tantalise our taste buds it's hard not to get excited. But is this fossil becoming extinct? After the events of ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"", life begins to change for Manny and his friends: Scrat is still on the hunt to hold onto his beloved acorn, while finding a possible romance in a female sabre-toothed squirrel named Scratte. Manny and Ellie, having since become an item, are expecting a baby, which leaves Manny anxious to ensure that everything is perfect for when his baby arrives. Diego is fed up with being treated like a house-cat and ponders the notion that he is becoming too laid-back. Sid begins to wish for a family of his own, and so steals some dinosaur eggs which leads to Sid ending up in a strange underground world where his herd must rescue him, while dodging dinosaurs and facing danger left and right, and meeting up with a one-eyed weasel known as Buck who hunts dinosaurs intently.Dawn of the Dinosaurs sports some great visuals, sweeping landscapes and phenomenal character design. Everything looks and sounds just as it should. The film spots some fantastic voice acting most prominently from Simon Pegg as Buck, what's trips them up is the lazy dialogue, as much as the trailer tried to deviate away from it, Buck is the focal point of the movie, he's in 80% of it and does a great job in every scene he is in. It's just a shame that by doing this they pushed the rest of the cast forcibly into the background. Dennis Leary who plays Diego has a prominently smaller role than in the previous film and acts as nothing more than a springboard for other characters. Here in lies the problem. The creators on Ice Age 3 have done a great job at capturing the look and feel of the era but have skipped over some serious character arch's, they resolve the main characters efforts but the supporting cast is criminally underused.The wrighting, unfortunately, is no sharper than that of the first two films. Which is to say it's rather blunt? Characters peak in monotonous one liners, there are fart gags left right and centre and while the audience who feel in love with this series back in 2002 have grown up, the series is still playing catch up. It's a futuristic looking film that feels like it was written way back in 2002. It feels uncomfortably convoluted at times with each character having their own primary motives and suffers from what a lot of threequel suffer from. T.M.S.G.O. Which stands for too much sh*t going on. It's confusing especially for younger audience members. The most disappointing aspect is the 3-D which at times is utterly phenomenal, but there such a rare occasion that if it weren't for the glasses perched on your face you would forget you were watching a 3-D film.Verdict: Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs looks years ahead of its time, it sports great visuals and an impressive vocal cast. The wrighting on the other hand are such in the Jurassic Era with a script stolen from""Animation for Dummies"" it's a admirable attempt, but a one that feels older than the fossils it encompasses. Compared to animation giant ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" the 3-D is admirable but far from jaw-dropping. 2/5.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brought me back to the golden age of Tom and Jerry.,"I had a struggle as to give it a 7 or 8 'cause I gave Up an 8. So how to justify the difference or the distance they had was quite hard to decide. I finally gave it an equal 8.Frankly, Ice Age 3 is a good movie that doesn't really need a review. People went to see it expecting what exactly it will come out. Yet it's free of foul language, inappropriate information that other blockbusters may have. And they got exactly what they want and came back smiling with the whole family. End of story? Not exactly. The cartoon context is so unique in that you can invent your whole environment and creatures to ensure the technical eligibility, while throwing in your real-life friends for fun and for differentiation. For those HD quality fanatics, they would buy the Blu-ray with no doubt, while for most families they just want to laugh and laugh again with an ironical feeling. This kind of subtlety and awareness are not scarce in recent animations, but fits into the context of Ice Age 3 perfectly. Just like Tom & Jerry, the characters may really fight/kill their butts off, yet they still know it's a cartoon. So when a teenager sees the interactions between Scrat and Scrate, he laughs his teeth off every time. But when a middle-aged couple see the scenes, they laugh at first but had a mixed feeling later.The best thing about this movie is that it knows what it is, and surely it doesn't want to compete with Up in terms of sentimental value and life philosophy. In some way, it's even more honest and pure. However it succeeded with a much simpler formula but offered equal fun and maturity. So why not giving it a chance? P.S. Scrat and Scrate made a cinema gem with their Tom and Jerry charm.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"New characters, new locations, more excitement","I have to say that I liked this movie the best out of the Ice Age series. This movie was much more humorous than the last 2. Although sometimes there was forced laughter in the cinema hall, it was still an enjoyable movie.What is really exciting is that the Ice Age animals lived under the dinosaurs the whole time. I loved the scenes where Sid was trying to take care of the baby dinosaurs. The introduction of Buck was awesome, considering the things he did.My favorite scene is where Sid has to feed the newly-hatched babies. So, he sneaks over to a sleeping bull and pulls the thing where milk comes. Turns out the bull was a male.The movie being in 3-D only added to the excitement. I think that the movie had too much mushy stuff when it came to the baby dinosaurs and Ellie's baby. But still, this is one of the best movies I have ever watched.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
More of the same.,"This film is set in the end of the Ice Age and is another sequel to ""Ice Age."" In this film, the animals at the glacier will have an unlikely encounter with dinosaurs, which are presumed extinct. Directed by Carlos Saldanha and Mike Thurmeier, has voice actors like Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Queen Latifah and Denis Leary.There should be a moment in the film industry that, when a film ceases to have quality, can no longer have sequels. If the first two films were not particularly noteworthy but can be minimally enjoyed, this film was not capable of it. The idea that dinosaurs survived in a hole under the ice is absolutely stupid and shouldn't have been carried forward. It totally ruins the script! The characters are also not particularly interesting or worthy of positive note. Sid remains the most detestable character, for the reasons given in the criticism the previous films, and even Scrat has lost some charm. The pair of possums is, ultimately, who will escape the list of less positive moments of the film. To all this we must add a soundtrack virtually inaudible, voice actors that no longer brings anything new and regular animation work, unable to reach the public anymore.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
I woke up one morning married to a pineapple! An ugly one. (But I loved this film so...),"I was fortunate enough that my local theatre was not showing Ice Age 3 in 3-D. It is a technology that I thoroughly despise, and it is one of the most distracting gimmicks ever created for film. I was able to enjoy Ice Age 3 without getting relentlessly pummelled by 3-D (although, to be honest, I am slightly interested how 3-D was pulled off here).Hopefully, Ice Age 3 will be the final instalment in the series. After the extremely disappointing Ice Age 2, I was expecting next to nothing from this movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, which is the best of the series.Ice Age 3 finally solves the problem of the ""Scrat"" sequences. As much fun as the original was, the scenes involving Scrat felt random, awkwardly placed, and irrelevant. Scrat now has a role more tied in with the plot, and enhanced thanks to the introduction of a romantic interest/rival. Not only do these sequences remain hilarious, they feel more like part of the movie.One of the great things about this movie is all the references. Ice Age 3 gloriously lampoons so many genres and films. It spoofs romance films wonderfully: when Scrat and Scratte kiss for the first time, lava shoots up behind them, bringing to mind the classic image of waves crashing high as lovers embrace. The interactions between the two bring countless romantic comedies to mind. Jurassic Park is often spoofed, such as one shot near the beginning that reminds one of the ""raptors in the kitchen"" scene. The familiar group of animals meet an insane survivalist, Buck (gloriously voiced by Simon Pegg), whose role not only serves the story, but also spoofs ""stranded-in-the-middle-of-nowhere"" movies. Pegg comes across as hilarious; Buck made me laugh the most. (Yes, I actually *laughed* during this movie.) There's even a fantastic spoof of action films, where the hero so often must decide whether he must cut the blue wire or the red.The Verdict: Ice Age 3 is a pleasant surprise. The first film was fun. The second was a disappointment. Ice Age 3 is the best movie in the series, and the funniest. Although geared for kids, I too enjoyed it. It was loads of fun.Overall Rating: 10/10 (Now don't get me wrong: the movie isn't flawless. But I'm giving this rating simply because it was that much fun.)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Not as good as the first, but better than the second... by a little bit","I decided to review this movie again after watching it again. Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs could've easily have been the best Ice Age yet, or at least dramatically better than the second movie. But it fails at being overly impressive as far as plot goes. Though it does have some nice things in it which are enjoyable to see.Visually Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is fantastic... at times. The animation is very good during some certain scenes especially during the first appearance of the T-Rex mother. Out of all of the scenes in the movie, the appearance of the T-Rex at the beginning was probably the best. However the rest of the movie fails to really make the dinosaurs as threatening or dramatic as the beginning. Since the majority of the plot takes place in an under-ice dinosaur world, you would expect it to look really nice... but sadly most of the dinosaurs seemed to have been designed very quickly and look very simplistic/generic. Even the landscape in the dinosaur world is kind of boring... not enough depth to it.The plot is actually shockingly simple. Actually really really simple. It is the classic gang trying to save Sid when he was captured by a T- Rex. There are some dangers along the way but that is the plot in a nut shell. The problem I have with this movie is that the characters seem stale and not as deep as the first movie. The first movie had character development and some actual deep and interesting topics. This movie, however, does not. The jokes aren't too bad, but most of them come from Buck... the new guy. Thank goodness the Opossum twins don't have as much screen time yet they still make pop-culture references which ruins the mood. Buck is better than the Opossum twins as far as being an interesting side character who is crazy, though sometimes Buck gets a bit annoying.Overall Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs isn't a terrible movie, but it doesn't really improve the series at all which is disappointing. The first movie is still the best and most interesting. If only this movie were a little bit darker and had a bit more of a plot. This movie is arguably the goofiest of the three films and is the least serious.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ice cold entertainment,"I instantly regretted having gone to see this with my nephew. It all seemed to be heading straight to Overlylineardevelopmentsville: the old team of Mannie (the mammoth), Sid (the sloth) and Diego (the sabre-toothed tiger, which are not real tigers, by the way) is split up because Mannie has gone square and founded a family. Sid then decides to do likewise and adopts three eggs, which gets him into all sorts of hilariously predictable scrapes ... but after about 10 minutes the story picks up speed, stops being anal about plot development and promoting family values, and just delivers punch after punch. You see, underneath the ice, our three friends discover a lost world where slapstick and fart jokes reign king! Overall, a very successful third episode from the Ice Age venture (and the umpteenth instalment of Arthur Conan Doyle's Lost World plot). The lost world is beautifully done, and I especially liked the new character of Buck (voiced by Simon Pegg), a hyperactive weasel who compliments the often very staid characters of Manni, Diego and Sid nicely.And Scrat the nut-fancying rodent finally finds happiness -- and loses it again ...",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Three's a crowd...,"Ice Age III was the long awaited sequel to the second Ice Age-movie. Long awaited at least by one of my dearest friends, who just gets a kick out of these kind of CG-animated movies. Due to time limits, we didn't get to see the movie until a few days ago, and I must say it kinda disappointed me.I was unable to laugh the entire movie, the characters had all their best jokes in the first two movies I think, and they leave little entertainment value to me. Now, it is probably my problem, since these movies are not for me. However, my friend also told me, she had only smiled a few times during the movie, and usually she's belly laughing throughout these cartoons. Another thing we both agree on was that there was that Scrat appeared too often in this movie. He was best in the first movie where he got a little scene in the opening and ending of the movie, but in this movie, he appears in short scenes throughout the movie, and this is overkill in our opinion.The plot in these movies is also painfully obvious after you've seen the first 15 minutes, at least to the adult eye.My personal experience was not that positive but this does not mean it is a bad movie at all. I can appreciate the stunning graphics this movie offers, along with the nice voice acting, especially by Sid and Buck. Buck is also a new character that will be a favourite to many, but for me he did not work. This tough ""jungle pirate"" that believes fear is just a four letter word, has grown completely paranoia and has multiple personalities, much to the delight of other people in the theater.The humour in this movie is described as being for kids and adults, but quite frankly, I don't think too many adults will enjoy this movie for the humour, most parents will be dragged to this movie by their children and have a nice time, but nothing more. However, this is an ideal movie to take your kids too, and give them a delightful afternoon for a relatively cheap buck in these times of economical crisis.It was not for me, they could have quit after the second movie, but still 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Scratatouille Ice Ice Baby steals the show!,"Scrat the Squirrel is on the dawn of finally hitting the utopia of Squirrelism by capturing the beloved acorn. That is until his whirling squirling hormones get the worst of him and he falls for a sabre-toothed female squirrel named Scratte; who evidently wants a piece of that herself. Piece being Scrat or the Acorn? OK, so that was not the best way to break the ice in my review of ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"". What do you expect? I first wrote it in ""scrat paper"". This third installment of the infamous Ice herd franchise does have numerous comedic dawning moments that come mostly in the form of the aforementioned Scrat adventures. The male procrastinating complexities of choosing love or gratification are in a way symbolized in Scrat's dilemma of deciding between Scatte's love or the tempting acorn. OK, that was way too ""acorny"" and unforgivably deep! Sorry, it is just that I am still living in the Pun Age, and this is the Dawn of the Punasours. OK, I will stop. All punning aside, Scrat once again shows that he is the superstar of the Ice Age installment. Herd, do not misunderstand! Heard me? Not to take anything away from your stellar lineup including the mammoth stars Manny and Ellie, the cerebrally-challenged sloth Sid, the feisty sabre-tooth tiger Diego, and the screwy possums Eddie & Crash. It is just that Scrat rocked the Ice Age House once more! In this Ice Age narrative- Ellie is pregnant carrying Manny's little mammoth baby, Sid wants to be a dad of his own so he steals three dinosaur eggs, and an aging & unmotivated Diego is trying to recapture the ""eye of the tiger"". Through some Sid-witted disasters, the herd end up in a dinosaur underworld chased by a gargantuan Dino mom who wants her triplets back from Sid, and a even more grandiose dinosaur named Rudy who is just plain rude. The herd befriends a one-eye weasel named Buck who lives in the underworld and ends up being their key to escape. But does the herd end up getting a bang out of their Buck? I am going to have to pass the Buck on this one, and let you figure it out yourself. Some critics have given ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" a cold-hearted reception and have ridiculed Co-directors Carlos Saldanha and Mike Thurmeier for not bringing more originality to the story. They do have some valid arguments with those theories, but the hotness of the ""Ice Age"" movies has never been the story, it has been the characters. And I think that these herd of characters were once again marvelous and should not be inserted in the endangered movies franchise list. Chill out til dawn with ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"".

Seriously an excellent thrill fun flick : ),"Well I just saw Ice Age and thought that it was a well spent fun flick. The humor was somewhat used in past films, but overall the usage is fresh and fits well within the story. The film's plot genuinely fits the trilogy, there is no sense of confusion, no disregards of any character. They are all freshly renewed and ready for another adventure.I am a critic for film style, and am loving it! This film had great film style. The camera angles and zooms and such really followed dialogue and action sequences. One aspect of the film that I would give it a 100% is the transitions between scenes on the movie. The Nut and Nut, they really spice up the word ""transition"" because whenever there is a new situation, they entertain the audience for a little bit and then the scenery takes place with the situation the squirrel holds.The only reason that I give this film an 8 out 10 is because of the old usage of humor. The audience laughed mildly, along with a few obnoxious children, they were hyped up by the jokes. A great film for the general audience and really a stunner for this year's animation comedy film.This is worth your time and money, and especially if you have children, it just reminds one of the situations during the 9 month phase of having a kid :) enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Epic Family Adventure!,"While this may be an unpopular opinion, I believe Dawn of the Dinosaurs to be the most enjoyable film in the Ice Age franchise! This film has the most eyecatching visuals, the best action sequences, the most intimidating threat being Rudy, and of course the introduction of the most interesting character of the entire franchise being Buck the weasle! Dawn of the Dinosaurs simply deserves more of a reputation than it has in my personal opinion. A few complaints that I had about the second Ice Age film consisted of alot of the jokes feeling forced and the majority of them being target towards a more mature audience coasting away from the ""fun for the entire family"" aesthetic that the first film setup so well. Dawn of the Dinosaurs rights those wrongs in more ways than one. The jokes no longer feel forced and the themes explored feel as if they alternate between child friendly and the more adult themes on a much more natural level than the previous film. If I am ever in the mood to watch an Ice Age film I will more than likely be throwing this one on!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The main story line made no sense, and seemed to be thrown together by the writers. If you choose to see this movie, go in without expectations, because that's the only way you will enjoy it. The sub-stories will be enough to carry you through the wishy-washy main story.

Avoid - it's pretty terrible,"Went to see this in an early showing in 3D today. Took my 5 year old son. I think I might have laughed the once... but I can't remember what at.I don't remember hearing my son laugh at all.I saw Coraline a month or so back and was really impressed by the 3D - 3D was the main draw for me in this film. In Ice Age 3 it just didn't have any impact at all. Often the window of the shot cut off important images at the edges which destroyed the 3D effect.The new character voiced by Pegg is just plain awful. The jokes are just so obvious they could have been written by a 5 year old.Some of the faster paced visuals are okay. The one consistently funny character from the other films (Scrat) is also okay - but a very tired character at that.If your kids are not too easily scared then go and see Coraline, or if they do scare easily then see Monsters vs Aliens.

"Buck, when exactly did you lose your mind?","Three months ago. I woke up a morning married to a pineapple. An ugly pineapple. But I loved her - Buck wildI already talked about the first 2 ice age movies, and both were great family films that could appeal to anyone. And the sequel was a bigger success than the original, so Blue sky decided to continue the story even further with the dinosaur world, it seems like the creators wanted to give this franchise a brand new look and the animators new ideas to explore. But is the movie as wonderful as the underground dino world?

As for the underworld, I feel like it was inspired by Jurassic park and Journey to the centre of Earth, by featuring a variety of ancient species, colorful jungle with lots of exotic plants and being more vibrant than the top iced one. Even though the creatures don't look historically accurate, you need to understand that this is an animated feature, were anything can happen. After all, it is a fictional world with talking animals, so it's forgivable. The animation has more warm and bright tones than the last 2 films, after all, it's an eternal summer compared to the icy winter. The old characters still look great as they were in the meltdown and the new ones look fitting in both worlds!The characters are certainly one of the most memorable parts of the series. Manny is now a worrying husband and soon father that needs to take care of his wife and the baby. I like his sarcastic comments about Sid, which proves that he still doesn't tolerate the sloth like in the prequels, but still cares about him. Diego doesn't serve as much purpose as he did before, but at least he has a choice to either go away and enjoy a single life or still be around his old friends. Sure, it may seem pointless and rushed, but at least it can be relatable to some older audience. The final member of the trio Sid doesn't appear much in the movie, but what I like about him is that he's still a sweet and joyful sloth who simply doesn't want to be lonely, and because of that, he became a great parent to 3 baby T-Rexes. Even though his ways of taking care of them don't always go successful as he wanted. Ellie, the crazy mammoth-possum character is soon going to be the mother of a baby, yet she still has a funky rebellious attitude like before, and her brothers Crash and Eddie still make the audience laugh with their wacky behavior, but could be annoying to some others. The new cast is great too. I liked Buck a lot, sure, he can be a crazy guy, that literally fell in love with a pineapple (funniest line in the whole movie). But he's also a brave weasel, he liked to fight against dinosaurs, especially Rudy. His voice performance by Simon Pegg was great, where sometimes he sounds mysterious, and sometimes being a little bit more funny. Others did a great job too.Moving on to Scrat, probably the best character from the whole franchise, he still chases the acorn and yet not catching it. But he's not alone. The sabertooth squirrel meets a female rival named Scratte (I'll admit, this name was uncreative, as it's just a girly version of Scrat but that's the only bad thing about her). Anyways, Scratte is probably one of the best love interests/Rivals not only in the ice age franchise, but also the whole animation industry! She may seem cute and hot at first, but once she's angry, then she's up to no good and may hit or push Scrat aside just for the acorn. She sorta reminds me of Lola from Shark tale and Rouge the bat from the Sonic games, yet she still has an identity of her own, because she's a sugar glider! Meaning that she could float in the air when needed. Also, their rivalry and later on love reminds me of the movie featuring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie called Mr and Mrs Smith. It's because the critters equally love and hate each other, and they would fight at first, but later they would appreciate and support each other.The movie is definitely fun, adventurous, colorful, and cute. But it's not perfect. Firstly, it has more gross humour than before. There are moments where the characters puke, smell bad stuff, get kicked and do dumb things. It can be distracting to some fans, especially those who adored the first movie for its heart, but even with that, I laughed really hard at every moment. I especially thought that the helium cave scene was hilarious, where Manny, Diego and the possums would laugh non stop there by breathing in the poisonous gas, that causes them to laugh really hard. I can see that the voice actors had their time of their life And same for the audience who watched this film in either a cinema or at home.This movie is a must watch for all ice age, adventure, comedy and animated films! Cause in my opinion, it is the best movie in the franchise by featuring great, yet sometimes gross humour, likeable characters with unique personalities, colorful animation with new designs and especially a fun story, that can entertain anyone. I really loved this movie, in fact, it's somehow better than the first and second ones. But sadly, it was at it's peak, and as we move on to the later films like Continental drift, Collision course and Buck wild, it will only get worse.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Third Time Still Has the Charm,"I was shocked to see so many bad reviews for this film as I had been so looking forward to it. I went to a matinée in part to save money and to avoid crowds. Well, all I can say is that once again the professional critics got it wrong. I was so happily surprised to find the negative reviews were wrong and that Ice Age 3 has all the elements that made the first two wonderful: great characters, wonderful dialog and tight, fast paced plot and stunning visuals. This installment was as delightful and fun as the first two. I laughed out loud so often - it was such a tonic. The film is was just gorgeous to watch; I saw it in regular, not 3-D and actually I am glad of that. I would be afraid of being distracted by the gimmick. Being unemployed I am happy to save the money a 3-D ticket adds. There are some truly touching moments that are effective in part because they are a surprise - to me anyway...but totally believable.

They excepted a baby. The baby was borne and it was so sweet and nice made. I want to take it at home! I was a bit disappointed about the 3d because i thought the animals really comes to you, but it wasn't.Sid found some eggs and they were really big. He was stupid and took the eggs with him. The eggs broke and there were some dinosaurs in it. in the end everything was alright and the had a lot of adventure with the dinosaurs.The film was really good made. It was awesome!

"Ice Age 3 has it's moments, but it fails to bring back what the first two movies had","I have really enjoyed the Ice Age series so far (with The Meltdown being my favorite). I was hoping Ice Age 3 would continue it's charm with it's colorful setting and characters. Unfortunately, I got put off watching it in theaters due to the negative reviews so this was only a DVD rental for me. This second sequel left me disappointed thanks to the atrocious dinosaur setting and a lame story.In this third entry, Manny and his new partner Ellie are expecting their first child and Diego gets tired of being treated like a house cat. Sid however, gets jealous with Manny and Ellie and adopts three unhatched eggs which turn out to be baby dinosaurs. When the angry mother comes to take her children (and Sid too), the pack go on an adventure to rescue him in a underground ""dinosaur"" world with the help of one-eyed weasel Buck. Scrat the saber tooth squirrel is still after his acorn but can't choose between it and his love interest Scratte.What made this movie such a letdown to me was the addition of dinosaurs. Kids really like dinosaurs and I don't understand why, but why did they add them to an Ice Age movie? Even though the movie is called ""Ice Age"", most of the movie is spent in the dinosaur world and thats a pretty bad thing to do if the first movie was committed on the Ice Age period. It seemed like Fox wanted to get greedy and grab money from dino-loving kids. The movie is also filled with references and adult jokes (such as Sid milking a male ox) which is very inappropriate for a kids movie. It's a shame how Blue Sky could waste a sequel on such an abominating dinosaur world and a paper-thin plot.Despite this dinosaur setting, the movie was still enjoyable to watch. In addition to the impressive animation, the dinosaurs looked pretty good (despite size inaccuracies) and they sound authentic too. Crash and Eddie, the twin possums provided me most of the laughs with their witty one-liners and Buck's back story was quite interesting. I thought Scratte was a nice addition too but I would prefer Scrat chasing the acorn on his own.Finishing off, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs isn't a terrible movie. It just takes the franchise in the wrong direction. Being a movie that you can either love or hate, it has the characters you love and the thrilling action sequences, but it all goes down with an appalling dinosaur concept.I am hoping they fix these problems for the fourth installment and make it the last.

ice age 3,"I thought the film itself was brilliant,entertaining and the 3D version was good value for money, great animation quality. It's a lot better then the second film. The new character of Buck is a great addition, he reminds me of Jack Sparrow (Pirates of the Caribbean). I thought the best part of the film was when Sid finds some T-Rex eggs and tries to adopt them and they copy him when they hatch. The only downer of the film was when the baby mammoth is born, its not as heartfelt as it could be, which let it down a little. Certain aspects of the film could have been improved, mainly the relationship between Manny and Ellie, could have been conveyed more obviously. However, in conclusion, I found this film a great watch and very funny.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was totally Fun and Comedy,"The movie was totally Fun and Comedy. Especially, Buck was the best character for me and he was very funny. The Dinosaurs was awesome and cool in the movie. The dinosaur world was beautiful and green. Another best character was Rudy. Even, he was superb. Even, the last scene was superb and it was awesome. Even, Sid was funny. I like the small baby because he was so cute and the name is perfect for the baby. When, Buck is telling his rules, that time he was funny. When, the animals are fighting with the small dinosaurs, that was scene was cool. When, Manny and Diego are caught by a large plant, that scene was superb and it was little thrilling. When, Diego is chasing a deer at the first, that time Diego was cool. Even, the baby dinosaurs was cute and nice. The introduction of the mom dinosaur was superb and her thud was cool.

"Don't worry fans, the third ""Ice Age"" movie is a delightful threat for everyone","I was looking forward to this movie with anticipation and rather listened to my friends and the critics recommendations for the film, despite I also worried that it could turn out to be bad, considering the movie industries are milking of the products for what it's worth. But fortunately my hopes for this movie got pleased.There are rarely a trilogy where all the movies turn out to be equally good, but that what the Ice Age trilogy proofs. I felt this movie surpassed the first film, while it's still a notch below «Ice Age 2; The Meltdown», which in my opinion is the best of the trilogy.However, ""Ice Age 3"" is a cute and delightful experience, more equal to the second film than the first one. It has good animation, great cinematography, funny lines and gags, a good score and tender, emotional moments. Most of the familiar and beloved cast is back, including the new, amusing character Buck (my favorite one), Scrat's new love interest and the dinosaurs. In spite there's too many characters and not enough screen time to everyone, you still don't feel that the mayor characters gets left behind. The old cast is more or less just the same way like you're used to see them.Storywise, ""Ige Age 3"" may not be deep and complex, but one shouldn't expect a profound story while going into this movie, one should watch this movie to get entertained and amused. There are however a subplot that is similar to «Shrek The Third» (which I won't tell more about now). If there's something to complain, it would be the fast close-up shots with Buck, which were unnecessary and I would have liked the film to have more action sequences, but those are just small details which doesn't ruin the experience.Overall, ""Ice Age 3"" is a great movie for kids (cause there are too many crappy films/shows that is aimed for them nowadays) and for adults. It's one of the best movies of 2009, so just go and check it out, you'll have a entertaining experience. And be sure that you'll may have the catchy ""Walk the Dinosaur"" stuck in your head while leaving the theater.And by the way, a note to Fox and Blue Sky Studios (as if they would have read this); please don't make a ""Ice Age 4"", it's enough with three movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best of the trilogy!,"Ice Age 3: Dawn Of The Dinosaurs is one of the better animations to come out in 2009 and it has proved to be the best. It combines humor, historical facts, adventure, and a weird herd that contains two mammoths, a sloth, a saber-tooth, and two rat-squirrels, to bring you a fun-packed explosive family film. The voice cast is perfect and not one person is out of line or doesn't provide good voice acting. John Leguizamo and Simon Pegg, in my opinion, did the best voice-acting because those two were hilarious throughout the whole film and they sustained their voices to perfection. Simon Pegg voices a Hermit-Possum who is a wannabe Rambo that lives for adventure and the thrill when your being chased by scary creatures. Buck is his name and he helps the odd herd rescue Sid for most of the film. John Leguizamo once again plays the lost Sid who is in fact a weird and funny sloth who belongs to the odd herd. His love for kids starts the adventure and it sure is a good one. Ray Romano, Queen Latifah, and Denis Leary were good but not as good as those two I mentioned earlier. Kids and adults will love it for I guarantee it.Manny and Ellie are expecting to have a baby, after being paired up, but while they are happy, some are not. Diego doesn't like the life he is living because he is getting slower and older. Sid the sloth is jealous that Manny and Ellie are expecting a baby and once they do he is not going to get the attention, so he decides to have his own children. He eventually finds dinosaur eggs, which he doesn't know, and names them. He wakes up and finds that the eggs are cracked and dinosaurs are hatched. That's is when the adventure starts because he is dragged to another world by the mother dinosaur and his friends have to rescue him. They get help from a possum-hermit who is familiar to the world but can he really help them save Sid and most of all themselves?There are so many hilarious scenes but I don't know which two are the best. Mmmmmmm!Okay, I know!The laughing gas scenes has to be the best because it is funny how they are laughing and talking in a funny way. The other funny scene has to be when Sid is training his dinosaur babies. The animation is so colorful and vivid that it makes this film stand out from the rest,including Kung Fu Panda, and viewing this film in 3D make sit even better than it is! And who can forget that saber-toothed squirrel,Scrat, who has a appetite for his beloved acorn, but he is not the only one after the acorn anymore because another sabre-toothed squirrel,Scratte, is after it as well. Is she out to steal his heart or his Acorn? The bad thing about this film is the first slow ten minutes which is just boring. If you want to expect laughter then watch it with your family members because I did and it made the film funnier than it already was. The reason you should watch it with someone, is so you can share your laughter with them. My brother was laughing so hard that I had to play some scenes again. The creators of the previous three Ice Age films should make a fourth one and a fifth one to keep everyone happy. This film is wonderful, colorful, funny, adventurous,but most of all: FUN! Everyone will love this film from the start to the end. It will be a movie that will be jammed into your brains. 10/10 - Highly Recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Ice age rocks for adults and a masterpiece for the kids!,"This film is terrific! The unusual prehistoric herd is back, and of course, Scrat. But Scrat isn't the only one who's trying to get the acorn, he got himself a rival and at the same time, a lover. For the herd, Manny and Elle are expecting their first child. Diego's losing his capability of being a predator since he's not active at hunting anymore, then wondering if he should leave the herd. While Sid stole some babies that he will take care for himself. But these babies are not just like any other babies, they're babies of Tyrannosaurus and their mother's looking for them. How fun is that? Plus they have a new companion along their journey, Buck, and he rocks too! IMO, It's as funny as Shrek, or even funnier, depends on parts. You'll have to step down a little level for you to fully enjoy this. I've watched this film along with my 7 year old cousin, And I LMAO, you don't want to watch this film along with all the adults, this is a kid's comedy.

"Improves Upon the Second, However Remains Inferior to the First","Released during the summer of 2009, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs was once again directed by Carlos Saldanha and saw the return of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary and Queen Latifah to voice their respective characters alongside newcomer Simon Pegg who voiced the character of Buck. Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs picks up some time after the second film with Manny and Ellie preparing for the birth of their child. While all seems well and good, Sid stumbles upon three mysterious eggs which he decides to adopt as his own. Not realizing that they belong to a mother T-Rex, this results in Sid being kidnapped to an underground lost world and forces the rest of the gang to rescue him.After the financial success of the previous two films Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs sees improvements from the second however still doesn't come close to matching the quality of the first. The animation is once again polished up upon, which should be expected given the six-year gap between Ice Age: The Meltdown and this third instalment. Another refinement came in terms of the story, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs had a wonderful sense of adventure that took the viewer on a journey, something that the second film was starved to do. This time around I actually cared about the main story at hand, and even though some aspects were a little tedious there certainly were enjoyable segments. As with the previous two films, there are frequent scenes with Scrat that deviate from the central plot and focus around Scrat trying his best to retrieve an acorn that manages to slip his grasp almost every time. In Dawn of the Dinosaurs, Scrat has a mini arch within these handfuls of short scenes, as he finds a love interest named Scratte. Despite the Scrat, moments being a highlight in other films, here I found them to be mostly mundane and uninteresting. Although there are still are hints of slap-stick which is always appreciated, I never found them as entertaining as I did in the past and was more so anticipating getting back into the main plot, which says a lot when compared to Ice Age: The Meltdown.With the plot arc and visuals being an upgrade from the previous film, I still felt like a lot of the voice acting was phoned it, there was no performance that truly stood out and some lines could have used way more emotion than what was delivered. Likewise, some of the minor arcs were very underwhelming, such as the one with Diego, Early on it is established that Diego struggles with being the apex predator he once was and appears largely out of shape, it made for an interesting dynamic that I was looking forward to seeing how it would play out; however, there is very little touched on until the ending, where Diego overcomes this obstacle. It felt like a payoff that wasn't warranted and detracted from what could have been an interesting storyline for a character that I quite like.All in all, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is an improvement from the second entry, it still struggles to be truly good. Although the adventure is fun, many moments are drowned in clichés that can come across as quite monotonous, especially for older viewers. Still, though, I can recommend this film, I think young children would find some enjoyment out if, even if it won't be all that memorable. It's a film that is very average and despite its improvements, there are too many faults to ignore and for that reason, I am giving Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs a 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

The jokes and funny moments were also less funny than the first two movies. Another problem in the movie was that the movie felt little bit long due to slow screenplay.Overall, you should give movie a try if you haven't yet.

I don't care for it either, and more than likely I will never re watch it either. The graphics and voice acting was good though. The third one seemed lost compared to Ice Ages one and two.

The storyline is terrible and lacks verisimilitude - I still don't understand how ice age mammals ended up battling dinosaurs.The addition of new characters drug down the acting in this sequel. The original characters are still okay and have a few (just a few) comedic lines and some good comedic timing, but Ellie is the most dull and lifeless character imaginable. She adds nothing to the movie. And Queen Latifah's acting is cringeworthy in its blandness and total lack of emotion. The new character, Buck, is equally irritating.
