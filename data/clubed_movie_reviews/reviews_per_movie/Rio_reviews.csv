Predictable but well done,"We saw this in 2D, on a digital projection system. While the movie is an hour and 36 minutes, it felt longer to me. I guess it's because there was nothing new about this, it was all pretty predictable. I even dozed off for a few minutes part way through.Now, on the positive side, the movie's colors are rich and vibrant. The animation quality is simply amazing; some of the wide scenic shots looked almost real. The music is a lot of fun and there are some good laughs, especially in the latter half of the film. My 10-year old son was glued to the screen; even asked us when it was over which was our favorite scene(s). Overall, it's a good film. I'd say take the kids and go have some fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Rio-an epic, lovable, beautiful and visually stunning animation","Not many animations like Rio come around these days.When i first saw the trailer and the team behind this very anticipated animation, the Ice Age team, i knew it will be very enjoyable and fun to watch.Seeing a TV spot right now, i remember that it was all those things, but much more as well.The quality of the animation was unique-only two or three movies can still compete with this and those are Tangled, Up and How to Train Your Dragon.But still, there was so much going on in Rio, the birds, the colors, the non-stopping stream of movement, lights, music and songs, around the carnival in Rio or in the opening and closing scenes with the singing and dancing of the birds in the forests around the city.So much was going on and with such quality, that no animation has matched.And those epic proportions of the animation are its strongest qualities.Something one can't see every day.The character development was very good, beginning with a little background of the macaw bird Blu's life, with his owner Linda in Minnesota.Maybe, the other macaw, Jewel, was a little underdeveloped as a character, but with positive reviews coming, there might be a sequel coming on the way as well.Then, Jewel's background might be better developed.With an animation of such proportions, some box office power along with a few Oscar noms will surely be along the way and the fact that it takes place in Rio alone, will act as an audience magnet, given that Rio's one of the most popular and non-stopping cities in the world.This magical feeling stays all along the movie.You just can't forget you're in Rio.Rio is as well another example of an animation, worth the time and money of both young and grown-ups.That's what catches the eye.20-th Century Fox has made a great animation and with the possible box-office power of the movie, a sequel might as well be on the works.So, a great animation, very epic and visually stunning, Rio will keep everyone mesmerized and captivated long after the end, and personally for me is one of the best, if not the bast animation i've seen.I definitely hope for a sequel and i'll definitely see it again, at the movies.10/10 for this stunning, colorful, heartwarming and breathtaking experience, named Rio!P.S.The one thing i thought was missing, was Bellini's Samba De Janeiro- this song can make the mood of every crowd in the world :)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Culture and Flight Film,This is an alright film for everyone to watch. The storyline had some weak points. The crew could have created the film better. The cast selection was great. They did a splendid job fully committing to their respective characters. Anne Hathaway does an excellent job in every role she plays. This film is full of colour and culture. This film reveals to viewers the strength and wisdom that culture can have. It shows spirit and tradition that viewers can learn and understand. Culture can be good for everyone. This film clearly reveals the limit of culture. This is a fine film for everyone to watch and probably enjoy.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I believe I can fly ...,"Or not. But what does matter is that the movie is fun. And it's not only fun for a younger audience, but also for adults to watch. Some (especially in Great Britain) were fed up with the movie even before they watched it, because the two stars of the movie were starring in an ad for a cell phone company (Orange). Of course that kind of treatment would be unfair to the movie.If you are not biased and can handle a bit of romance and the overcoming odds story, then you will enjoy this. As Jesse Eisenberg is spot on as a ""bird out of the air"" so to speak. Even people who don't enjoy George Lopez as a comedian, might like him here. I thought his performance was spot on. Not a perfect movie overall, but the cast (as mentioned) and the mostly very well written jokes, work their magic!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Location, location, location. It's Rio!","""Oh, how wish I was back in my cage, with my mirror, and my little bell""Jesse Eisenberg should be forever grateful that the Oscar-nominated ""The Social Network"" was released before Rio. That's because his voice as Blu, the macaw, is so distinctive and perfect, that in my mind he will always be Blu. And if Rio had been released months ago, audiences worldwide would think that Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, missed his cage, mirror and little bell.Now, for the movie itselfLocation, location, location. Because what's Rio, the movie, without (pulsating, colorful, exuberant, romantic) Rio, the city? The story is delightful, though predictable. The characters are cardboard, even if 3D and feathery. But ""predictable"" and ""cardboard"" are the worst adjectives I could possibly link to Rio. The Rio deal, is that I laughed all the way through it, like everybody else in the theater.Blu, the last male of his kind, is the happiest macaw, out there in a snowy town with Linda, his nerdy owner. Jewel, the last female of her kind, lives in Brazil, and is the saddest macaw, imprisoned in a cage and fighting for her freedom. She's a free-spirited soul, with the world at her feet. Blu has lived a sheltered life, can't fly, and loves every minute of it. What happens when they meet? Anyone above the age of 7 can guess how it ends (age 5 if he's seen the trailer). But there's so much delight from the first minute to the last, that you don't want it to end.I was one of the lucky few to watch the premiere of Rio in Rio, and at this point I can hardly wait to see it again. A Brazilian, Carlos Saldanha, directed the movie, and it shows. The details of the city are all there, but so is the big picture (you know, everything that really matters, along with wide panoramas of Rio by night, of a crowded beach, of a sunset in the cable cars of Santa Teresa).Lots of AMAZING aerial views in the action scenes. The main characters are birds, thus flying should be expected. Many of those places showed in the movie can be visited by tourists.Rio doesn't have the depth of stories such as Toy Story or Up. It is a simpler plot. It is, however, pure fun from start to finish, and visually stunning. Location, location, location. As a native of Rio, I could recognize most places, and was stunned with how realistic were the slums, and how the geography of the city, especially the mountains, could be so painstakingly reproduced.The movie is not a musical, but it comes close to it. There's funk, bossa nova, a few clichés of Brazilian music and even samba sang in English (still conflicted about it!).There is also the portrayal of animal trafficking, a centuries-old problem in Brazil, and the subplot of a boy who lives on the streets and must resort to petty crime, which adds up to a much-needed social commentary.By all means, don't miss this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Two birds of a feather,"The story starts as a number of birds is caught in the middle of the Brazilian rain forest. One of them is a blue parrot, and as it turns out, a very special one. Years later the wheels of fate have taken him into the loving hands of a woman that treats him very well, maybe a little too well. Fate is again turning on him and his presence is needed in Rio.And that's where this very colourful animation film really starts rolling. He quickly meets a number of friends and a necessary number of enemies and the rest of the story unfolds at a pleasantly quick pace.Animation wise this one is nice, but not more than nice. The colour scheme is just great, spot on for the type of film, but action wise it's too much of a kids film - there's too little fun stuff hidden under the surface to keep the adults happy.Story wise it's a little too rich on clichés and the easy turns and tangles. It's not bad but it's not great. All in all, it works great on the children, and works OK on their parents/guardians.7 out of 10 feathers in a ruffle",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Nothing new, but look at that breathtaking scenery. Wow!","Rating: *** out of 4.I usually don't like movies like RIO, mainly because they always end up being rehashes of previous movies; unless your talking Pixar, there's very little to no new things in animated movies nowadays other than their exquisite looks. So when I saw a special advanced screening of RIO a few days ago, my expectations were low, enough for me to expect that the film will fail. But hey, what a surprise! It's pretty good actually. So RIO ain't a new masterpiece-it's not at all much different with any Dreamworks or Blue Sky Animation effort that comes out every given year- but it was fun. The kids at the screening had a ball with it, but I can also hear older teenagers and adult audiences chuckling along with them. And I'm up there with them.The story isn't something you haven't heard before. Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) is a rare Blue Macaw raised in Minnesota by the bookish Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann). But being the last male of his species, Blu is requested to leave his Minnesota homeland and shipped to his real birthplace, in Rio de Janeiro, where a female of the same species is being kept in captivity. Blu doesn't warm up easily to the impetuous Jewel (voiced by Anne Hathaway), and certainly a rare bird such as her being kept in captivity like that doesn't help. It also doesn't help that Jewel wants to escape and Blu, being a total ""housebird"" and all, can't fly.But what it lacks in a fresh new idea it more than makes up for in lively execution. This movie is just amazing to look at, boasting one of the most gorgeous looks of any animated movie since some of the Pixar films and the occasionally bizarre but lavish-looking BEE MOVIE. It may even be more beautiful since this is exactly what it wants to be and not much else. Director Carlos Saldanha, who helmed two ICE AGE sequels, and the rest of the crew have done just that. The eye-popping visuals are the moneymaker and one of the few films to come out once and a while that is worth paying extra money to see on 3D. Once again, the 3D ain't something groundbreaking, but it's exactly what comes to mind when thinking of 3D; the visuals are pristine and dynamic, with flying scenes that are just breathtaking to watch. I could almost feel the wind as a glider glides past the Christ the Redeemer statue. Rio itself looks gorgeous, from the ""Carnival"" parades to the look of it during the nighttime scenes are just beautiful. If nothing else, it's a virtual tour of a beautiful portrait painted by Saldanha and his animators. The voice cast ain't bad either. Eisenberg is hilarious, and granted he'll be doing these kind of work sometime soon. The real standout is Jemaine Clement (from FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS), who lends an irresistible bad guy charm as a cockatoo named Nigel. Hathaway, George Lopez, will.I.am and Jamie Foxx all fulfill their roles perfectly.RIO ain't much new, but at least I enjoyed it for what it is. And I wouldn't mind going back to it during its official release and wallow in the dazzling scenery again. Here's a movie meant to be done (and seen) on 3D.",,Anonymous,Animation
Adventures of Bird Blu!,"It's story of how love compels to break comfort zone and discover our new self. Visually stunning Rio is brilliant stroke of writers to add magic to adventures and love tale of endangered bird ""Blu"". Story wouldn't have been same with Samba, carnival, beaches, mountain views, Tram buses if it was not Rio.The whole story revolves around Tamed Blu and wild Jewel. Jesse Eisenber and Anne Hathaway did their best voice acting. Apart from Blu and Jewel there are plenty of characters which build story effectively and added plenty of rib tickling moments.Even though story is simple and very much predictable with obvious ending, still story survives to tell a tale of love despite differences.

There is something missing in Rio,"This film is about a blue macaw who is brought to Rio de Janeiro for mating. Things go wrong when some bandits steal the birds for the black market.""Rio"" is set in the exotic Brazil, amidst the world famous carnival. However, the film does not capture the same uplifting spirit. The plot is tiring and boring, with little to arouse or maintain viewers' interests.

Rio is bright and colorful but just not funny enough. Still exotic birds and locations keeps us engaging.,"RIO – CATCH IT ( B ) Rio is colorful and delightful but very predictable and not funny enough. The thing we as adults love the most about animated movies these days is that it amuses children along with adults. In case of Rio, it cannot be said, because this was made strictly for children, there is nothing humorous for adults in it besides looking at exotic locations and feathery birds. Rio is visually fantastic and mesmerizing. It won't be wrong to say that the production team has out done their graphics in capturing the true essence of the exotic birds and locations. Blu is voiced by Jesse Eisenberg and I don't know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing. The whole time it was Jesse Eisenberg we were listening too and not for a second he tried to change his voice to make a unique one for Blu. It was suitable but we will never know what someone else would have brought to the table. On the other hand Anne Hathaway was incredible as voice of Jewel. Not for a second it felt like Anne she really amazed me. Will I.M & Jaime Foxx has to be my favorites next, there combo was great along with George Lopez. Leslie Mann was good but Rodrigo Santoro's character was weird and very amateurish nerdy. Besides the first and last dancing song I personally didn't enjoyed other numbers in the movie. Overall, Rio is a fun entertainer for kids and families.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A funny, hearty movie. The music is especially worthy of notice.","What is it that drives audiences to a movie? Word of mouth? Arguably, yes. Box office intake? Rarely. Awards Buzz? Sometimes. But advertising is the main thing that drives audiences to a new movie. I must confess that Rio, today's film I'm reviewing, suffers from the same problem as the earlier released Paul, advertising that makes it look like crap. And even though it wasn't as good as Paul, Rio is a solid movie with heart and humor.It centers on the last male of his kind, a spix's macaw named Blu (Voiced by Jesse Eisenberg), currently in the ownership of a book shop keeper in Minnesota, who's brought by a Brazilian scientist to Rio De Jeneiro on the eve of Carnivale to mate with the fierce Jewel (Voiced by Anne Hathaway), the last female of the species. But they are kidnapped by smugglers who seek to sell them for countless amounts of money, but they escape into the jungle to make it back to their homes, and avoid the clutches of the smugglers' malicious cockatoo, Nigel (Voiced by cast standout, Flight of the Conchords' Jemaine Clement).As far as plot goes, the movie's not that special. The film has a certain romantic adventure quality to it, blended with the signature humorous touches of Blue Sky Studios, the film's producers. Is it predictable? Yes, and it's a bit kiddy at times, but Rio makes up for that with it's emotional touch, impressive voiceovers, and wit. The film, with it's clever one-liners and droll sight and sound gags, quite often got a good chuckle from myself.I must also give praise to the crew who designed the film with the utmost technical quality possible. The movie looked and sounded great. The Blue Sky animators delivered a gorgeous multicolored palette, while Randy Thom did well with the film's sound effects and mix. But what ultimately sticks with me the most about Rio is the songs and score.The music makes great use of percussive beats, guitars and maracas that are are incredibly catchy, something that's apparent right when the movie begins. The film's composer is John Powell, fresh off an Oscar nomination for what I consider to be 2010's best movie score, and one of my new top ten favorite scores, How to Train Your Dragon, and Rio is yet another outstanding job, so don't be surprised if he makes my year end top five score lineup yet again.I may have some minor problems with it, but Rio's admirable story telling and movie making methods are enough reason for me to recommend it.I give it *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Blinded by the lovely colors; but not brain dead to disregard plot-boilers,"Rio is set in a carnival-like atmosphere, orchestrated by vivacious, Broadway-themed routines and sizzling, animally-carnal and sizzling dance sequences. Rio also provides an oeuvre of eccentric characters, which like various ingredients of a taste test titillate the eyes. They also manage to get along a few laughter with all their idiosyncrasies; for example, the drooling dog whose slimy slobber inadvertently comes in hand. Also the colors so brightly razzle-dazzle the screen, along with the synchrony of the dances transported me straight to the visually-arresting, larger-than-life Rio de Janeiro parade. But did the movie, the essence, the fabric stay with me ling after the end credits? Sadly not.Blu, a precocious, protected young Macaw has been living since his babyhood with Linda, a nerdy, caring librarian and has many tricks under his sleeve, none of them involving flying (since he can't). Their fairytale life is punctuated by Tulia, a devoted ornithologist who after a quick deliberation, takes them to Rio De Janeiro to get the last male of the species (Blu, of course) to be mated with Jewel, a fiery but beautiful and independent female whose principles are islands apart from Blu's. Blu is a timorous, coy but adorable bird who enjoys human companionship while Jewel, akin other wild birds, prefers the dangerous yet sweeping jungles. Both embark on quite an epic, unpredictable journey with a multitude of characters to fit the pieces together.Blu is perhaps the most drawn out adventure in recent years of animation. Unlike Disney, the movie has a no holds barred approach in its story making, somewhat like Casablanca. I didn't like Casablanca much, though. I thought it to be somewhat of a pastiche. Rio is a hodgepodge of collage, impromptu ideas that sometimes hit, and at others miss the mark. I'm currently getting the sixth season of Top Chef in India where a contestant named Robin too experiments the same way. A splash of colors incorporating into one grand picture, yeah, like Sidney Pollack. But Carlos Saldana is not Sydney Pollack; he's a passionate film-maker who makes entertaining movies. And Rio is quite a blast indeed. But a ""dream project"" as ascribed by him- not.Rio has some nebulousness and inconsistencies in the actual vision that the director must've had at first. Throughout the film, characters fly in and out but not all succeed. Linda is gratingly voiced by Linda Mann who along with Radrigo Santoro acts cumbersome almost throughout the course of the movie. Lesley gets too synthetic and cliché in her delivery, while the scenes with Tulio are platitudinous. Rio is quirkily voiced by Jesse Eisenberg, who comes off smoothly in most of his scenes, even with those which lack finesse. Although sometimes the tone may come as calculative, analogous to his SN character and I felt not completely in love with Blu, but he surely enlightens the banality with his volubly theatrical tone. Anne supplies baritone and luminosity to her relentlessly brave Jewel, which complements Blu's nature, s some of the film's most fulfilling moments come when Jewel tries to make Blu fly while Blu helps her walk.The subordinate entities add luster to the veneer, some in imposing colors, while others Grey and barren. The most promising are the bottle-cap donning canary and the chest-thumping Cardinal, done by Jamie Foxx and Will.i.am chirpily. Ironically, the prime song sung by the singers themselves is auto-tuned and vapid. Also, the screenplay forces them to recite cheesy catchphrases (i.e. ""its birds versus monkeys!""). Rafael, the toucan and his hissy but affectionate housewife and their 17 brood do provide some laughs, but I hate when Rafael's actor is asked to iterate inane lines ""Sorry, Eva. Can't come home for dinner tonight"". Such dialogs really lack impact in movies. Nigel, as the tyrannous has-been performer cockatoo is cartoonish and hilarious (the ""Cage tyrant"" song had wonderful charm). The monkeys are added impish fun. Luiz as the harmless bulldog is perhaps the most engaging character, wittily written.The irresoluteness of the film really takes it to a pandering extent where gags are just randomly thrown in to arch out a smile in the faces of young unwitty kids. This is where Disney/Pixar scores one over them as they have sure shot money-making plots but with a touch of heart and maturity. Rio has the heart, lacks the ripeness. And I find it hard to criticize the movie as some moments, including the color-maniacal beginning, are magical. The bumpiness could be smoothened a bit just to add the ""Wow!"" factor so prevalent in Disney movies (e.g. Ratatouille's awe-inspiring ending). In terms of colors and animation, it's a spectacle. But, as a movie, it is a bit trite and incoherent. Sure summer extravaganza!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bird Love and Nerd Love,"The Brazilian city Rio de Janeiro is serving as the setting for two films being released this April: one being a full on action film, Fast and Furious 5, the other being a family animated adventure. Rio is that film and shows that the Fox subsidiary Blue Sky Studios is growing from strength to strength.Blu the Spix's Macaw's (Jesse Eisenberg) early life is tragic, having fledging from his nest too early and been kidnapped by poachers. Luckily he was adopted by a loving owner, Linda (Leslie Mann) as a little girl. 15 years later Linda owns a bookstore in the snowy landscape of Minnesota and Blu becoming a very nerdy bird. A Brazilian ornithologist, Túlio (Rodrigo Santoro) finds Linda and tells her that Blu is the last male of his species and takes them to Rio de Janeiro so the bird could breed. But Blu does not hit it off with Jewel (Anne Hathaway) and matters get worst when poachers take the birds and chain them together. When their escape Blu and Jewel they try and reunite with Linda whilst avoiding being captured by the poachers and their insane cockatoo Nigel (Jemaine Clement).Rio is a pure formula picture and there are many elements have been in other films, such as Blu being taken from the wild as a chick, the animosity between Blu and Jewel and we all know where it is going to lead, the story of Nigel having a tragic past and being rejected, etc, etc. But formula does not have to be bad and when done right it can easily lead to an enjoyable film for all the family. Director Carlos Saldanda certainly made a fast paced adventure with a great amount of velvet colour. There is a more old-fashion feel to it, like Disney films and its copycats in the 90s. Pop-culture references are toned down and there are a few musical numbers which is rare in CGI animated features. The animation itself has a similar look to Pixar's particular the human characters, though Túlio looks very similar to the main character in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. The animation of the parrots climbing is particularly well done and true to live to anyone who has ever own one.Much of the humour of the film is kid friendly slapstick as is expected from this type of film and it is done very well. There is enough for parents and adults audiences to keep them entertaining. My personal favourites were the double act Kipo (Robin Thicke) and Marcel (Carlos Ponce) who were the dumb henchmen for the poacher and outsmarted by a cockatoo. They have some of the best lines in the film. But the two characters Pedro the Red-crested Cardinal (will.i.am) and Nico the yellow canary (Jamie Fox) were annoying and pretty stereotypical.Eisenberg gives a typical nerdy performance as his character is book-smart, but not adventurous at all, preferring to be safe with his owner. Compared to Hathaway she is a feisty, strong female character who wants to explore and distrusts humans. Both learn from each other, for Blu that there is a wider world and for Jewel that not all humans are bad. Clement was funny as he parodies British actors playing psychopathic villains in action films. Though I do question why ornithologists did not question why they had an injured cockatoo considering the species is native to Australia and New Guinea (but this is a minor issue). As well as the bird love in the film there is also some nerd love.A respectable 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Harder and harder to stand out from the crowd,"Twentieth Century Fox Animation's first theater release was Monkeybone in 2001. That movie was abysmal.

They had some ups and downs before coming out with ""Rio"" in 2011.""Rio"" is about a blue Macaw named Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) who was abducted from Rio de Janeiro and accidentally dropped in Minnesota. He was raised by his owner Linda (Leslie Mann) and lived a very cushy domestic life. When an oranthologist (I assume) from Brazil named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) came to Minnesota in search of a mate for the only remaining blue Macaw it was time for Linda and Blu to pack their bags and go save the species, except it was easier said than done.Blu found himself being abducted again, and this time with his blind date Jewel (Anne Hathaway). They were chained together and slated to be sold with a lot of other rare birds. They would have to escape captivity if they wanted to survive, but they weren't fond of each other and Blu couldn't fly.""Rio"" had some nice music, some OK comedy, and a passable plot.

My favourite movie of the year so far,"That in mind, there is more of 2011 I have yet to see, hence the so far bit, but I absolutely loved this movie after seeing it when it came out today. From the trailers and advertising it looked like a bright, breezy and entertaining animation, and in my mind it was much more than that. And I genuinely mean it when I say it is my favourite of the year so far, even surpassing the outstanding(if somewhat misunderstood) Rango.What I loved most about Rio was its energy. Rio for me has more energy than any of the Ice Age(from the same team) movies, and its energy is truly infectious at that. Two reasons especially make it so. One is the writing, I wasn't expecting the writing to be this sharp, funny and witty, looking at some of the previous work the writer has penned, while the jokes are plentiful and come by thick and fast. The other is the soundtrack. It has a huge amount of authentic Brazilian flavour and just ripples with zest. I loved the samba and bossa nova rhythms that pulsate throughout, and further fun is to be had in the Busby Berkeley-style beginning and the truly spectacular Carnaeval finale.The story isn't perhaps original, nor did it need to be, but it is fast-paced, with many entertaining scenes and is very rarely predictable. There is also the obligatory life lessons here which are seamlessly blended without feeling shoe-horned in or preachy. I loved the characters too. Blu is very endearing, and voiced brilliantly by The Social Network's Jesse Eisenberg. Jewel is a lovely love interest, and her chemistry with Blu is ceaselessly entertaining and cute. Anne Hathaway previously voiced Haru on the English dub of The Cat Returns. She did a fine job on that, but in Rio she is even better, more understated and less shrill. I equally loved the villainous cockatoo Nigel(who avoids being a caricature and the like and voiced phenomonally by Jermaine Clement) and the constantly drooling bull-dog.Other than the above components, what also made Rio was its animation, which is simply stupendous. I haven't seen an animated movie in a long while(and I am a huge fan of animation) where the colours in particular are so rich and warm. The characters are also beautifully modelled especially the titular character Blu, and this includes the secondary characters as well, and the sceneries and backgrounds are breathtaking with such a refreshing richness and warmth. In conclusion, a wonderful animated film and my favourite of the year so far. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Colors and Flying,"The main plot of ""Rio"", an endangered bird doesn't know how to fly. It sounds a bit predictable and this plot was already used by many movies. But the core of this film is showing the beautiful place of Rio De Janeiro. The filmmaking was great. Colorful visuals, often hilarious, and decent directing.There is nothing wrong with the voice acting. The main cast, Jesse Eisenber and Anne Hathaway are like the bird versions of them. Jemaine Clement really made his character evil. The rest of the cast, Will.i.am, Jamie Foxx and George Lopez adds more fun to the movie. I just wish Tracy Morgan's character Luiz had more scenes.The visuals are colorful and very spectacular. It really shows how beautiful Rio De Janeiro is. The flying sequence is indeed breathtaking even if it's in 2D. The problem of the movie is it's not so compelling. The ending seems rushed. We will all know what's gonna happened to this flightless bird. Although the movie has a big heart. The movie is often funny of course.Overall it's a fun experience. ""Rio"" is not like Pixar but it's still enjoyable for the whole family. After watching all of those awful recent blockbusters, I think ""Rio"" is the best movie I've seen this year so far.

"Harmless family fun, but for such a hyped about promising film from a top animation studio, is slightly disappointing.","Rio Review:Over the past few years, the standard for animated films has been set so high by films like How to Train You Dragon, Toy Story 3, Rango, Tangled and Despicable Me.Sadly, Rio cannot meet the standards of any of the films mentioned above. This is because everything in Rio is so common in films, it is almost cliché; the geeky guy who tries to pull a girl, the interrupted kisses, awkward humour, the cheesy moral at the end. However, despite this, there are some moments where Rio genuinely looks incredible, and the colours and vibrancy puts a smile on your face.The story is very similar to Rango at the beginning, but not for long:Blu, a rare macaw, is accidentally transported from Rio to the USA, where he is found and kept by caring owner Linda. However, years later, a man called Tulio comes to tell Linda that Blu is very rare and the only remaining bird of its kind is back in Rio. So - with seemingly little thought - Blu goes back to Rio to mate with Jewel (the other macaw of its kind), and this is where all the unoriginal humour comes in when he is trying to pull Jewel.However, in some parts, the film sparks back into life, with an extravaganza of colour, best viewed in 3D. Also, Rio's graphics are very good, and the 3D is possibly the best use of 3D I have ever seen. But Rio is let down by unoriginal humour, cliché villains, and a lazy plot. And, Rio isn't a very likable film - kids are not going to go on about it for weeks after watching it, and Rio merchandise will not be on the top of Birthday and Christmas lists, unlike most kids films. It is almost as if it is a shrine to Brazilian born Carlos Saldanha's - the director - hometown.Summary: Harmless family fun, but for such a hyped about promising film from a top animation studio, is slightly disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, but didn't quite hit the mark...","A film clearly made for 3D (I saw it in 2D) and so the animation is very well done with pin sharp images. I can't say the film was groundbreaking at all, but I guess the filmmakers were happy enough as I see a sequel is already in the pipeline.Although I found it a little formulaic and a tad too predictable I found I did engage with the characters eventually. To be honest, I found the human characters more interesting than the animals. The songs were not to my taste, but I will say they fitted the mood of the piece pretty well. I guess at the end of the day the film will be entertaining enough for the younger audience but I can't see it being stuck in the DVD player too many times.My score: 6.4/10IMDb Score: 7.0/10 (based on 58,702 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 63/100: (Based on 29 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 72/100 (based on 141 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 72/100 'Liked It' (based on 73,872 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Watch out for Colours, Music& Samba.","Why to watch: Watch out for Colours, Music& Samba.It's all about Rio, Brazil. Its really awesome. Importantly, animated movie with so much of colours & music, (though it-colour part was there in UP) but in Rio it feels like you are there in the Natural Beauty.-Negative points: 1. Predictable story or rather regular story. 2. Not so humorous.Screen Play: Movie surely doesn't make you bore, story goes smoothly.For whom: Family & romantic people !!!3D Effects: Impressive.Actually, Same as Megamind & other animated movies, but so much of colours makes it more impressiveRatings: 7.5/10Personal opinion:Must watch :8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A fun, exotic animation to be enjoyed by all!","""Rio"" left me with a smile on my face when the end credits came up, the film was filled with fun songs, great characters and a good story. Blu is a likable character because he's a recluse who has his best friend Linda to look after him. But then he's thrown into an open, exotic and different lifestyle which is where Jewel comes in as this feisty bird wanting to be free. The songs were OK, no Disney songs, but they were catchy and not bad for a non-Disney production. Nico and Pedro (Jamie Foxx, Will.I.Am) were upbeat and fun characters as well as the leading couple with the voices of Anne Hathaway and Jessie Eisenberg who were great together. The little baby blue macaws were cute with their huge heads and tiny bodies. OK, so it may be no PIXAR animation but it has enough fun, cool songs and cool characters to keep you watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Rio,"Rio is an animation from the same people that brought us Ice Age and so it has a fair amount to live up to. It follows the tale of a blue macaw, Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) who is bird-napped as a chick and smuggled into the USA to be sold. During the move though, he falls from the back of the truck and is found by Linda (Leslie Mann) who takes him in and looks after him.The years pass by until Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro), a extremely bird obsessed ornithologist pays them a visit and offers them a chance to come to Brazil as Blu is the last male of his species and the last female, Jewel (Anne Hathaway), resides in Rio. Blu (who cannot fly) has lived a sheltered, comfortable life with Linda and is all the more happy for it whereas Jewel is the stark contrast and longs to be free from the cage that restricts her as she has tasted freedom before. So when the two meet, the fun starts to happen.First off, Blue is one happy bird with the animation and his characteristics reflecting that. You immediately like him and this feeling doesn't fade with time. In fact each character has their unique quirks which enables the comedy to flow seamlessly. I was never gulping for air but the jokes are well written and non-stop with the movie certainly having its moments.Rio, the movie, brings alive the carnival nature and flamboyant mood that one normally associates with Rio, the city, by including a couple of musical numbers into the story. Unfortunately they are not up to the standard of Disney- they are not very catchy or memorable. It's more pop music and rap with Will.I.Am lending his talents to the vocals than the traditional song associated with animations. The background music however certainly get across the energy and vibrancy of Rio with plenty of samba flooding your ears from the off.The visuals of Rio are impressive (though not quite as good as Rango) and during the flying scenes in particular the city and its surroundings are well captured with many of the iconic landmarks easy to spot. It probably helped that the director Carlos Saldanha was born and raised in the city and so was able capture the true feeling of the place that other directors would not have been able to.Did this live up to Ice Age then? Very nearly and I wouldn't mind watching it again to see how it handles a second viewing.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Un ironically my favourite kids movie ever.,"I have so much nostalgia for this movie, but that's not the only reason I love it now, also because it's great. The world isn't just some cookie-cutter boring world, and the human characters, (while not super prominent) are still fun and exiting and fleshed out. The bird itself (blue, who when I was a kid always thought was named rio) is funny and nice. Do recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great animation, but not good as the director's previous Ice Age movies...","The movie in general is good, the plot and design of everything from the animals to the city is really good, but...I just felt that there was something missing. There's not a lot of laugh-out-loud moments like there was in the director's previous Ice Age movies which are one of my favorite animated movies of all time. This movie lacked the humour which should have been given the main focus. But nevertheless, the most astonishing side of the film is the luminous vision of Rio de Janeiro and its carnival.Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) is a talking baby macaw, who is taken from his habitat in Brazil and smuggled in a box to the United States. Falling off the back of a truck, he is given a home by Linda (Leslie Mann). They grow up together in a domestic environment and by copying her he never learns how to fly properly. Years later and a scientist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) finds Linda working in a bookstore. He tells her that Blu is one the last of his kind and that he should be taken back to Brazil briefly so that he can mate with a female macaw. Linda reluctantly agrees. When placed in a cage Blu meets Jewel (Anne Hathaway), a feisty bird who is intent of escaping and is impatient to Blu's dithering. When the breeding facility is raided by smugglers, Blu and Jewel are caught and chained together in a cage. They have to learn to work together so that they can escape and find Blu's owner again.Rio Rio"" is set in the exotic Brazil, amidst the world famous carnival. However, the film does not capture the same uplifting spirit. There is only enough excitement for young kids, but little for adults to enjoy. Sure, the visuals are very good, with great colours and smooth animation. The aerial scenes of Rio de Janeiro is breathtaking, but the visuals alone are not enough to make ""Rio"" a success. The movie is a colourful one, but unfortunately not in a metaphoric manner. It is watchable, one can give it that, but also forgettable.Eisenberg and Hathaway are just perfect as the leads. So are all the all the supporting characters, especially my favorite Nico and Pedro voiced by Jamie Foxx and Will i Am, they were really funny. The soundtrack is one of the main plus-point of the movie. Some tunes are really catchy.This is a simple animated film for children who are going to love the monkeys and the birds, but they are also going to be nicely demonstrated that birds are so much better off and nicer in their natural environment. All the animals are cute and are likable, so are the human protagonists. Its a fun movie, not just that great as it could be. I rate it 6.5 out 10 for the beautiful scenery and awesome animation.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rio is no Ice Age; Yet decently entertaining,"What is the one thing that binds all children's movies? predictable plots but of course there are those that make predictable fresh (SHREK. Rio however shies from any experiment in the plot whatsoever. The end of the movie can be deciphered in the first 5 minutes.That said the movie is overall very enjoyable if you go with it. There are too many moments where u just want to laugh out loud. A word of caution thought; Rio is no ice age. Its written OK; its the action that makes it enjoyableThe animation is superb (nothing less expected). The city of Rio de Janeiro is multi facetly captured (there is a lot more to it than the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer)and the use of color throughout the movie is beautiful.About the cast and the characters, despite all of them giving a good performance there is not one character who is memorable. One may relate to the protagonist Blu but thats as far as it goes in making an impression. The two human ones are outrightly boring. Voice over is not that big a deal unless u really put yourself into the animated character (Take note Anne Hathway)The music is pleasant but none of the tracks are going to find their way into my playlistOverall the movie is worth a watch. Its funny, not so smart and has a great lesson.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stunning animations and excellent music make this worthwhile.,"Well, after seeing Rio recently, I feel like sharing my thoughts towards it. Walking into this film, I actually didn't know that much about it other than the fact that it was about birds in Rio De Janeiro. I saw the positives reception it was getting and what really patented my interest in it was that my good friend Vivzmind posted a journal entry gushing about how awesome this movie is. Well, here's my review, and remember, this is my opinion, not what everyone else thinks.The plot is unfortunately one of the film's drawbacks, and it seems a shame to open up with that, but hey, writing about the plot first just feels right. As far as the story is concerned, it's your typical talking animal adventure film: a bird named Blu gets separated from his owner and has to find her. The only thing that's not been done in every film of this kind is that they also throw a romance into it. Nothing else is really that special. The villains are pretty typical as are the supporting humans, but hey, they're entertaining to watch. Probably the one major highlight of the story, though, is how the romance is handled. At first, Blu and Jewel can't stand each other, but it slowly and believably develops as the movie goes on and unlike most romances of this nature, it's not in-your-face wink-wink nudge-nudge or super-mushy. It's handled very well. You know it's going to happen, sure, but it's handled in a way that at least makes the audience want it to happen.As for the other side characters, they're actually quite fun themselves. Rafael, the Toucan, is probably the most interesting and likable character in the film while the other two bird sidekicks, Pedro and Nico are also enjoyable. Pedro is the kind of character I would normally find irritating, but he didn't get on my nerves all that much even if just about everything he did seemed like a desperate attempt at being cool. And of course, the villainous bird, Nigel, is a good solid addition to the film and is much more interesting than his human owners, the other main villains I spoke of earlier. It's a good thing this movie focuses more on the birds than the humans, isn't it? There's also a bulldog named Luiz who I found really funny most of the time.Speaking of funny, the humour I find to be a mixed bag. See, not only is the story average, most of the dialogue's kind of half-and-half as well. I didn't find myself getting much of a kick out of the verbal gags but I found the visual gags hilarious. It's just that half of the dialogue- related jokes seem tacked on and forced. There are also a few bad puns, too, one such example being a bit where Luiz is enjoying himself and says ""This is the spit!"" because he's always drooling.The animations are a whole other thing and are one of the film's strongest points. They are just so much fun to watch. The plumage on the birds themselves is very impressive and everything is just so active and energetic that I can't help but get a kick out of watching it. Where the animations really shine is during certain moments that I'm just about to get into starting... now.This movie's a musical... bet none of you saw that coming, did you? I may have known Tangled was going to be one despite the trailers saying otherwise, but despite this taking place in Rio, I was not expecting musical numbers. And what's more... they are incredible! The songs are so catchy and the numbers themselves are so well animated. Heck, you can find the opening number online simply titled ""Rio-First 2 Minutes"". That scene in itself is spectacular and the others are no exception. There are also a couple that really surprised me with how good they are. First is a song titled ""Hot Wings"". Normally, I would hate this kind of song. It uses so many audio effects and lyrics that seem like they're trying way too hard to be cool for the kiddies, but this song is really well-written and composed and I just love it. Another is a love ballad sung by Nico called ""Fly Love"". When I heard Jamie Foxx about to sing a love ballad, I wasn't sure what to think, but this song is absolutely beautiful, which is why it's a shame the dialogue kind of drowns it out. The only musical number that did not impress me too much was ""Pretty Bird"", the villain song naturally sung by Nigel. Not that it was a bad song or had poor choreography. No, I actually really liked those aspects. However, this scene bothered me for one simple reason: it goes almost completely against Nigel's character. Here we have an elegant, graceful villain and what does he get? A cheesy rap song. I wish I was making that up. For a cheesy rap song, yeah, it's catchy, but it's also out-of-character. Even the lyrics sound nothing like what Nigel would say. It's like the writers were desperate to make him seem ""hip, cool and on the fly"". Nonetheless, the music and animations are fantastic.If it wasn't for the generic story and writing, Rio would be up there with films like Rango, which used their clichés as best as they could to make them feel fresh, or maybe even something Pixar could pump out, but those small drawbacks prevent it from being a masterpiece. That said, though, Rio is still a very enjoyable film and if you're looking for something entertaining and love animation, check it out.Subject: Rio Score: 7/10 Would I get it on DVD?: For the fantastic music and animations, this one's a definite maybe.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Bursting with infectious energy and verve from music to colour to spectacle, this is one heck of a party you'd be a cuckoo to miss!","The makers of ""Ice Age"" have decided to take a vacation from the cold and literally venture into warmer- much warmer- territory. Indeed, after three consecutive outings through sub-zero temperatures, director Carlos Saldanha has set his sights on the tropical city of Rio de Janeiro- also the second largest city of Brazil- where summer temperatures often hit a sizzling 40 °C. And what a wondrous source of inspiration this sojourn has been for the Brazilian-born Saldanha, whose ""Rio"" bursts forth from the screen with unparalleled colour, imagination and sheer energy.Saldanha wants you to know that he is in Rio to have a party, so right from the beginning, all manner of feathered creatures of different sizes, colours and species welcome a new dawn in the lush tropical rainforest with a boisterous acrobatic sequence, set to the infectious beat of the legendary Sergio Mendes (who serves as executive music producer here). Among the greenery is the birthplace of our protagonist, Blu (Jesse Eisenberg), an exotic blue macaw who is subsequently taken out of his nest and domesticated by a local bookshop owner Linda (Leslie Mann) in the snowy Minnesota town of Moose Lake.A visiting ornithologist from Rio, Tulio, offers a quick and convenient excuse for Blu to return to his native land- the last male of his species, he is needed to mate with a feisty female called Jewel (Anne Hathaway) for the continuity of his kind. Jewel, on the other hand, is only intent on escaping her captivity, but things get complicated when she and Blu are abducted from Tulio's lab by smugglers and chained to each other. By sheer luck and some ingenuity, they manage to escape, and spend the rest of the time trying to cut themselves free from each other, while evading capture by the bad guys and their evil cockatoo Nigel (Flight of the Conchords' Jermaine Clement).Staying true to formula, Blu and Jewel will bicker like the typical mismatched couple at the beginning, only to fall in love with each other by the end. Predictable though the journey may be, veteran screenwriter Don Rhymer makes the journey a pure delight every step of the way with great supporting characters, witty lines and hilarious scenarios. Not often do we find all three in equal measure within a movie, but ""Rio"" is a perfect example of the laugh-out-loud hilarity that ensues when these three elements come together so beautifully.A tram ride up the slopes of Rio is turned into a matchmaking opportunity by Blu and Jewel's three travel companions- a Toucan named Rafael (George Lopez) and two wisecracking birds Pedro and Nico (will.i.am and Jamie Foxx)- as Rafael dispenses love advice to Blu while Pedro strums across the wires of a tram like a guitar and Nico croons a romantic tune. ""Tell her you have beautiful eyes!"" Rafael whispers to Blu, to which Blu turns to Jewel and says ""Did you know that I have beautiful eyes?""Rhymer also saves some of the best lines of the movie for Nigel. An uproarious song-and-dance item where he gets to introduce the depth of his villainy to his audience sees him prancing pompously around caged birds cowering in their cages singing lines like ""like an abandoned school, I have no principal"". And when recruiting a bunch of thieving monkeys as his henchmen to search for Blu and Jewel, Nigel warns them in a dead-serious tone, ""no more monkey business"".Of course, these lines are only as good as the voice cast delivering them, and thankfully then, the cast Saldanha has assembled here is outstanding. Eisenberg oozes apprehension and trepidation with every line as the cowardly dork, Hathaway packs gusto as the spunky foil against Eisenberg, will.i.am and Foxx have perfect comic timing playing off each other's lines, and Clement chews up his great one-liners with menacing glee (you may be keen to know that he also co-wrote the song ""Pretty Bird"" above). Their chemistry is palpable from start to finish, and their exchanges throughout the film are nothing less than spirited and lively.But a lot of the energy in ""Rio"" is visual, courtesy of Saldanha's eye for detail and aptitude for action. The animation of each one of the characters, lead or supporting or even extra, is exceptional, their respective characteristics distinctive and inspired. The colours- unlike the duller, wintry landscapes of ""Ice Age""- are dazzling and vibrant. And most of all, the action sequences best appreciated in 3D- a flight over Rio with a panoramic view of Guanbara Bay, a narrow escape over the rooftops of the favelas, and the climactic finale through the crowds at the city's annual Carnivale festival- explode with vigour and verve reminiscent of that in the city's signature samba music, whose Latin rhythms add generously to the film's oomph.That oomph is simply part of the party that Saldanha invites you to be part of from beginning to end, and ""Rio"" has every bit of the infectious sounds of the drumbeats, the colours of the sequins, feathers and headdresses, and the energy of the performers in the city's most famous annual party festival. Yes, for those of us who probably can't afford to take that Singapore Airlines flight down to Brazil, this is the closest you'll get to soak in the sights and sounds of that lively city. The best part of it all? It's a party the whole family will enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Rio is one of the best of its kind of this year,"Just watched this computer-animated film in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend, his nephew, and that nephew's friend. We all enjoyed the infectious atmosphere of the story along with the highly enjoyable music-both classical Bossa Nova and original songs-that takes us from the title city to a small town in Minnesota and then back again. The story of a bird poached from his native land who accidentally ends up with a young girl as she grows up during the 15 years that passes before he's summoned by an animal doctor to mate with a female of his breed because of possible extinction is just the start of what I highly consider one of the best of its kind this year so far. And hearing the voices of Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, will.i.am, Jamie Foxx, George Lopez, and others just adds to the great fun of the whole thing. Nothing more to say except I highly recommend Rio.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Adventures of a Blue Macaw in My Wonderful City,"In Rio de Janeiro, the macaw baby Blu is captured by dealers and smuggled to the United States of America. While driving through Moose Lake, Minnesotta, the truck that is transporting Blu has a minor accident that drops the box where he is trapped on the road. The girl Linda finds the bird and raises him with love.Fifteen years later, Blu is a domesticated and intelligent bird that does not fly and lives a comfortable life with the bookshop owner Linda. Out of the blue, the clumsy Brazilian ornithologist Tulio visits Linda and explains that Blu is the last male of his species alive and he has a female called Jewel in Rio de Janeiro. He invites Linda to travel with Blu to Rio de Janeiro to mate with Jewel and save their species.Linda travels with Blu and Tulio to Rio de Janeiro and they leave Blue and Jewel in a large cage in the institute where Tulio works.

Linda and Tulio look everywhere for Blu that is chained to Jewel and hidden in a slum. Meanwhile, Jewel and Blu escape from their captors and befriend a group of birds that help them to get rid off the chain. It is Carnival and the smugglers and the mean cockatoo Nigel do not intend to give up of Blu and Jewel and are chasing the birds through the crowded streets.""Rio"" is a delightful animation with the adventures of a blue macaw in my Wonderful City. The successful director Carlos Saldanha was born in Rio de Janeiro and he knows the beauties of our city to show to natives, to Brazilians and to foreigners. The CGI is also awesome, with magnificent colored birds and the landscapes are impressively realistic and disclose minor details of our daily life that a real ""carioca"" will certainly note.The story is engaging, and the blue macaws Blu, who is smart but can not fly, and Jewel, who is impulsive and does not think before acting, are responsible for some of the funniest moments.

What a disappointment...,"Wow, this was such a disappointment, I felt really bad having convinced my partner to go to see it. The great part that earns the 4 stars is the animation of animals (not humans) Yes, they are cute, well drawn and animated, and all that jazz. But, yes, there is a huge BUT here, the plot, the dialog, the human ""love"" story... Well, they all fail to inspire any kind of emotion or imagination. On top of badly written, slow dialog, which is not helped much by the necessary comic elements, you have really badly written songs! Something like: ""I fly like a bird, oh wait, I AM a bird."" Wow, really really? What's interesting, though, is that the ""camera"" lingers a few seconds after the characters leave the scene on the favela, the human built trash-tin-dumpster living spaces crammed on top of each other, full of homeless, street-smart kids like the one meet in the film... It lingers, as if to almost say something, as if it will finally add something to all this taking place in Rio, and the economic necessity that some people might have in stealing rare animals, but it doesn't. Nor does the film shy of piling up many stereotypes, you know, all Brazilians care about is partying, and they fail at doing their jobs mostly because they just want to party, watch soccer, wear Carnival costumes and dance in the streets, no wait, even at home all the time. Naturally, the police are useless, the professor is useless, the animal smugglers are useless. Right? At times the stereotypes are a bit uncomfortable, because it is not clear why they are there. They are mostly used as stale plot devices, otherwise nothing would be believable, even in the cartoon-suspended-reality kind of believable. The only character worthy of any praise, in terms of vision and execution, is Nigel, the villain bird. The rest? I have already forgotten everything about them! The laughter sometimes was louder than the joke merited, mainly because people and children expected to be laughing. When it is hard to find something good to laugh at, you laugh hard at the lame jokes even harder. Note for parents: Children in the audience seemed to enjoy the film much more than the adults.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bird Love and Nerd Love,"The Brazilian city Rio de Janeiro is serving as the setting for two films being released this April: one being a full on action film, Fast and Furious 5, the other being a family animated adventure. Rio is that film and shows that the Fox subsidiary Blue Sky Studios is growing from strength to strength.Blu the Spix's Macaw's (Jesse Eisenberg) early life is tragic, having fledging from his nest too early and been kidnapped by poachers. Luckily he was adopted by a loving owner, Linda (Leslie Mann) as a little girl. 15 years later Linda owns a bookstore in the snowy landscape of Minnesota and Blu becoming a very nerdy bird. A Brazilian ornithologist, Túlio (Rodrigo Santoro) finds Linda and tells her that Blu is the last male of his species and takes them to Rio de Janeiro so the bird could breed. But Blu does not hit it off with Jewel (Anne Hathaway) and matters get worst when poachers take the birds and chain them together. When their escape Blu and Jewel they try and reunite with Linda whilst avoiding being captured by the poachers and their insane cockatoo Nigel (Jemaine Clement).Rio is a pure formula picture and there are many elements have been in other films, such as Blu being taken from the wild as a chick, the animosity between Blu and Jewel and we all know where it is going to lead, the story of Nigel having a tragic past and being rejected, etc, etc. But formula does not have to be bad and when done right it can easily lead to an enjoyable film for all the family. Director Carlos Saldanda certainly made a fast paced adventure with a great amount of velvet colour. There is a more old-fashion feel to it, like Disney films and its copycats in the 90s. Pop-culture references are toned down and there are a few musical numbers which is rare in CGI animated features. The animation itself has a similar look to Pixar's particular the human characters, though Túlio looks very similar to the main character in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. The animation of the parrots climbing is particularly well done and true to live to anyone who has ever own one.Much of the humour of the film is kid friendly slapstick as is expected from this type of film and it is done very well. There is enough for parents and adults audiences to keep them entertaining. My personal favourites were the double act Kipo (Robin Thicke) and Marcel (Carlos Ponce) who were the dumb henchmen for the poacher and outsmarted by a cockatoo. They have some of the best lines in the film. But the two characters Pedro the Red-crested Cardinal (will.i.am) and Nico the yellow canary (Jamie Fox) were annoying and pretty stereotypical.Eisenberg gives a typical nerdy performance as his character is book-smart, but not adventurous at all, preferring to be safe with his owner. Compared to Hathaway she is a feisty, strong female character who wants to explore and distrusts humans. Both learn from each other, for Blu that there is a wider world and for Jewel that not all humans are bad. Clement was funny as he parodies British actors playing psychopathic villains in action films. Though I do question why ornithologists did not question why they had an injured cockatoo considering the species is native to Australia and New Guinea (but this is a minor issue). As well as the bird love in the film there is also some nerd love.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best work from Blue Sky,"Rio might just be my favorite theatrically released film from Blue Sky animations because I liked this more than Ice age, and The peanuts movie. Now let's discuss why it surpasses those 2 films to become the best from Blue Sky.Most animated films take place in mystical worlds or the US but one where it happens in South America is a rare occurrence. All the characters had a ton of personality to them and I pretty much liked everything else as well starting withBlu and Jewel had an interesting chemistry. It shows the differences between domesticated pet animals vs wild animals and I absolutely loved the fact that the animals are not anthropomorphic, This could have put a lot of dumming down and a downgrade to the quality so I'm really thankful Blue Sky decided to make them just animals like what Pixar did to Ratatouille.Overall Rio is a unique film. I already said it happens in Brazil, no anthropomorphic animals, but the message is even more unheard of and it's a pretty strong on as well. Having to stop hunting animals and selling them and warning the audiences about endangered species. Now tell me any film that has the same messageOf course as with every product there are negatives, I have some to name like how Linda and the guy fell in love in a really stupid way but overall I enjoyed this a lot maybe it's just nostalgia but this is better than any of other Blue Sky's theatric outputOverall: 8.1/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun little animated adventure,"Rio is the story of Blu, a very rare blue macaw, who has ended up as the pet of a Minnesotan bookstore owner. Events transpire to take him all the way to Rio de Janeiro to meet the last remaining female of his species. Hijinks ensue due to a pair of animal traffickers.Blue Sky Studios is most well-known for its Ice Age films, which are definitely funny, but have their fair share of cringy moments as well. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It's not very deep, nor will it make you challenge your views of the world or to grow as a person - like something from Disney or Pixar might do - but it is a solid animation movie for the whole family.The characters are likable, for one. They're pretty one-note in certain respects, but their voice actors are talented and they're given enough interesting things to say and do that you care about what happens to them. I also like that there's some actual character growth. And in a way that feels both natural and earned.It's also a very colourful film. Fitting, keeping in mind the Brazilian setting. All the different birds look suitably lifelike and I do admire the fact that they've kept the sizes lifelike as well. There are certain birds that are teeny tiny and there are some that are huge. As it should be.Is it great entertainment? No, not really. But it is all-around likable. Very well worth a watch, especially if you've liked the other films from this studio.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Although I don't know why I should have been surprised, because anything related to the beauty of Rio and the never ending euphoria of carnival (designed for children that is) can only be good!Carlos Saldanha did himself and Brazilians all over the world proud! As I am one of them, and love Rio, I can honestly recommend this movie with all my heart.It's well written, very funny, incredibly well animated and well performed by the voice talents of some well known Hollywood stars, like Anne Hathaway, Jesse Eisenberg, George Lopez and so many others.But the real star of this movie is without a doubt, the city of Rio!She is simply magnificent! One of the most beautiful cities in the world! Truly blessed with natural beauty, charm and charisma!But, not all that glitters is gold! It was good to see that Saldanha did not try to hide the poor and sad side of the city, showing the slums also in their full ""glory""! Anybody that knows anything about Rio, knows that wealth and poverty, beauty and misery, charm and crime, all go hand and hand together.Nevertheless, it's a kids movie and it was portrayed not like ""The city of God"", but with good taste and excellent comedy! So do not listen to the nay sayers, instead enjoy the samba music and a most brilliant film, it's worth your time and money!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's okay. Not more.,"A fun movie for the whole family. Just don't expect anything similar to the epic emotional drama that was the first ""Ice Age"". The whole movie goes lightly its way without ever really challenging its protagonists. People might say ""come on, this is a kid's movie"". Those people i would again refer to Ice Age.This movie rather draws a strict black/white scheme. Good guys against bad guys. Great for kids and probably their parents. If you longing for some good character portrait though, a story with surprises, humor outside of an afternoon-sitcom-level and maybe just a little bit of drama you're left all alone in the jungle. This is basically a Disney movie, sticking to that proved formula far to close to let some creativity in.The sad fact is that by now 3D-animated movies have gone the same way as traditional cell-shading did in the 80ies. While few companies like Pixar still maintain an amazing level of storytelling within the medium, most animation studios refrain from complex and hence risky screenplays. The result are mediocre, but fun movies like this one.If you want to see what nowadays can be done with traditional animation, you'll have to turn to Japan. Western studios have lost the magic.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Good movie, but full of issues","I really enjoyed this film. It is the story of a Sphinx Blue Macaw that is the last known male, aptly named Blu. He and his owner are flown to Rio to see if Blu might mate with a female in an effort to ""save the species"". There are of course the obligatory bad guys that steal the pair of birds with a mind to sell them for a profit. We end up with a family friendly tale of love and devotion and how great people can be. There are a lot of vivid colors and great songs to keep the attention of kids, and enough over the head jokes to keep the adults amused.Now for the issues. This movie touches on but does not address the terrible thing that happens at the opening of the movie, how parrots are stolen from the wild and the sold as pets. Contrary to popular belief, parrots are not domesticated and should not be kept as pets. These are animals that are still wild at heart and they are also highly intelligent, so this act is akin to an advanced alien race kidnapping your children and keeping them as pets. Sure, the kids might eventually bond with their captor, but it is far from the ideal situation for them. Also they show Blu drinking hot chocolate and eating what looks like chocolate chip cookies, both poisonous to parrots. This is a gross misrepresentation of how to care for a parrot, and one day one of the people that saw this and thought how great a pet a parrot might make will kill their bird through ignorance. I do not mean to climb up on a soapbox here in the review section, but if you are going to put out a movie that so terribly represents how to care for a pet like this, then the issue needs to be addressed.In closing, this is a great family movie that anyone who does not have a parrot in their care would love and even those that do will enjoy it to a certain point.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why isn't this a 10?,"This movie is a absolute masterpiece in story wise, animation and in art style. For me the story was just perfectly put together In different fragments of the movie all put together to make one hell of a masterpiece.

I can't tell more about the art style for the movie because it's just impeccable for every single detail for every single thing that you see in the background the entire movie long. For example the aging of fruits or metals you can see is amazing. So I can't recommend this enough if you haven't seen the movie yet and if you have seen it I recommend it you watch it again for how the movie actually is.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good,"Rio (1) (2011) -Jesse Eisenberg is much better when you don't actually have to see him and in his role of Blu I really didn't mind him at all. In fact the whole film was much better than I had thought it would be.When I first saw the adverts for it, over a decade ago, I thought that it looked like every film about some animal with something to prove and I was right, because it really was, only this one was full of bright colours and party music to appeal to a younger generation even more. But as I watched I realised that actually, what does it matter if the same story gets a makeover every once in a while, if it can be tweaked just enough to engage a newer audience and still be entertaining? I mean it's not likely that it won the writers any awards at the Oscar's, but the animators did a good job and probably should have got some recognition for that. And the studio must have been happy enough with the merchandise sales, because they made a second one.As I've said, it does the loud and bright thing that kids films all seem to have nowadays, but with substance too and a lesson about endangered species, even if the tale was as old as time and we all knew what was going to happen.It had a great pace and felt a lot longer than it's hour and a half, because it got so much in. It also didn't feel overly saturated with big star names, which I appreciated, although strangely enough some of the bigger celebrities had quite small cameos.So it's not a new story, I can't think what to compare it to, but it's definitely been done before, the animation is lovely and the delivery, direction and production all seemed to have been done well and it should keep kids happy for a bit, without draining parents minds too much. Generally enjoyable.609.99/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

An overall enjoyable film.,"Normally I'm getting fed up with animated movies with animals in it, that look like real animals but yet behave like humans. But I simply enjoyed ""Rio"" for what it was and it didn't ever angered or annoyed me in any way. Instead it entertained me, even though this movie still has plenty of flaws to it.A thing that the movie most definitely has going for it are its locations. It makes you wonder why there aren't more animated movies set in Rio de Janeiro. It's bright, cheerful and very colorful (well, depending on where you go in Rio de Janeiro of course), just like basically every computer animated movie! In other words, it's a perfect combination. Besides, it provides the movie with plenty of excuses to feature lots of singing and dancing and jumping around in it, which most modern animated movies seem to love to do.And just like most of the other animated movies as well, this movie its humor has its hits and misses in it. But luckily it's all getting done and told in such a fast way that you can forgive it for its misses, since chances are that 5 seconds later something good and funny will still happen. And the movie still really has some big hits in it as well. This movie will make you laugh at least two or three times, guaranteed.But there still is plenty wrong with this movie as well. First of all, its story is being far too simplistic and straightforward, even for an animated movie for kids. There really are no good side-plots and the main story itself is about as simple and generic as it could get, about a parrot getting lost in Rio de Janeiro, trying to get back to its owner, while his owner is also looking for him. But come to think of it, throughout the movie he is actually hardly looking for his owner at all. He is far too busy with his new girlfriend and learning to fly.Another serious issue I had with this movie was the fact that it kept introducing new characters, basically throughout the entire movie. Did we really need 4 villains and 5 different comical reliefs? Really, every time you start to think; 'this character is going to be important!' a new character pops up and the other characters are getting pushed to the background again. The movie does this a bit too often but maybe they thought they would sell more merchandise if they introduced dozens of characters in it.Visually there is nothing wrong with the movie. Like I said before, its perfectly colorful and cheerful and Rio de Janeiro looks truly superb in this movie. I also really liked the character's animation. Picking a parrot for the main lead doesn't sound like the most likely choice but it does work out really well for the movie. But the design for basically every animal or human character in this movie is just great. Seriously, sometimes just the look of a character was enough to make me laugh.Despite the plenty of problems I had with this movie, I could still really enjoy and appreciate it for what it was.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Keep on making the same old mistakes,"Well, it's very difficult, specially for a Brazilian, not to rate this ""thing"" as 1 (awful).What we see in this movie is a nightmare for any educated Brazilian, and the ""song"" remains the same: A movie that keeps on selling our image as a country that only cares about carnival, naked women, parties, soccer and having fun all the time.I wonder when we will see people actually thinking before making such travesties related to my country's name. Where are the movies related to our discoveries in various education fields, such as engineering, aeronautics, space, physics, alternative fuels, and all sorts of applied science? If this thing called RIO is what we send to the outter world, what else will they think of us? Not to mention the fact that the state of RIO is an embarrassment to us all. Corrupted to its roots and absolutely violent, although our dear press pathetically sometimes tries to sell an otherwise image. Ask anybody from Brazil, it's not just me saying it.Back to the RIO movie: Monkeys stealing iPhones? Shantytowns (although there is no translation for it, that's how the New York Times has called our 'favelas')? Carnival? Whores on Copacabana beach? Soccer? My country had enough of this.

"if it does not present a better story (with many stereotypes) , is correct in presenting the personality of each of the characters, let them captivating all the time","Recognizing the fragility and predictability of the script, director Carlos Saldanha is right to bet on the charisma of his characters and the fabulous look of the feature, which also serves as a great postcard of the wonderful city. It is not by chance that Rio de Janeiro is the filmmaker's birthplace, which makes the capital of Rio de Janeiro almost one of the protagonists of the film.Still talking about the script, he is happy to be able to make the characters pass and interact throughout the development of the plot with the main locations and postcards of Rio. On the other hand, the argument cannot be much more than that. It is all really a big advertisement and at the same time a tribute to the city, with a not-so-exciting adventure taking place in the background. There are no big twists, everything is very predictable and some jokes are there for the sole purpose of getting some laugh from the audience. In some of the sub-plots of the feature, we see Blu maturing, the redemption of the boy who took the birds to the smugglers, and Linda and Tulio's adventure through the favela and the Sambadrome. Everyone expected a more elaborate itinerary, with surprises and that would introduce the city naturally. The impression we have is that the presentation of Rio covered the flaws and weaknesses of the script, and the city was not the background for a great tropical history. In addition, everything is presented in a very fun and cheerful way, as if the city were an invitation to uninterrupted joy, further increasing the view from the outside about partying and carefree people. The fact that the film performed well during the Carnival season only confirms this impression. The musical numbers present also seek to exalt samba and the joyful atmosphere of the production. In the opening scene, we have a beautiful scene that shows the birds dancing with the Sugar Loaf as the background for the show.The story is nothing original, however, the characters are very captivating. It is easy to relate to the trauma of the neurotic Blu and to Jade's longing for freedom, as well as to Tulio's mess and Linda's sweetness. The protagonists have very simple characteristics and are visually quite expressive, which facilitates communication with the public. In addition, seeing jokes with the stereotypes of the old and good Rio rascal in positive and negative figures has hilarious results. When even street robbers become funny figures, you know that the film got it right. The thieving monkeys, the security guard Silvio, the trickster Rafael, and the partying party Nico and Pedro are great supporting characters that add sparkle to the animation. Villains are also not very creative, but they do their part. The highlight here is the Nigel cockatoo, which works for smugglers. Rio's great asset lies in its charismatic and well-built characters (although not necessarily well-developed). Despite little change in their characteristics during the course of the predictable and basic script, it is a pleasure to simply watch them on the scene, their mannerisms, their dialogues. For several moments, I preferred the narrative to simply stop for a moment and let them interact simply, without the need for songs, hang gliding flights, or action scenes. It is not for nothing that the film is being considered the beginning of a franchise. Unlike Ice Age, which needed a secondary character like the squirrel to steal the show and keep the interest, Rio has protagonists who can do the job, leaving little space for the funny figures who insist on popping up on the screen, who help to illustrate, but they know that the focus is on the macaws.Saldanha is right not only to show the natural wonders, postcards and customs of the city, but also for showing favelas, thieving monkeys, the sale of wild animals by children who live in slabs. Saldanha puts all these factors that could denigrate the image of the Marvelous City, without judging, but still showing. More adventurous and dramatic than comical, the storyline shows how Blu and Jade escape the clutches of the bandits, get rid of the handcuffs that keep them together, make friends with local animals and visit the postcards of Rio de Janeiro, from Christ the Redeemer to Copacabana, all beautifully portrayed. There is also the story of Blu's maturation, the redemption of the boy who took the birds to the smugglers, and Linda and Tulio's adventure through the favela and the Sambadrome, all done in a very fun and light, but, unfortunately, light way. When it comes to a film for the family and made in Brazil, everything logically ends up in samba, but the whole process serves to further fuel all the stereotypes that foreigners have in our country. As the director was a Brazilian, it was expected (at least by me), a less caricatured view, that at least he would not have strong security guards hiding bright clothes under his uniform, just waiting for the moment to ""fall into the samba"". It is obvious that we are known abroad for the trinomial football-samba-butt for its own merits (or demerits), ranging from the results at the World Cups and the growth of tourism during the Carnival season, but is that really all that do we have to offer?Rio is one of the faces of the Marvelous City, and I don't sin when I say that. Being a construction, the film creates its own reality and shows an existing and plausible aspect of Rio de Janeiro. That much has been omitted, this is obvious. But it is necessary to remember that the product is not an educational animation, it is a fiction, and a fiction that brings between the lines the essence of one of the most popular periods of Brazilian cinema: the chanchadas. It is only necessary to observe the trickery, the songs in the middle of the projection and the clutter of heroes and villains to see their well-defined features of a cinema of our own and which Saldanha, almost contraband, inserts in the film. And the result, except for the script that sins for running over and paying attention to a number of unimportant things, is just adorable.Rio is also proof of the evolution of Blue Sky, reaching practically technical perfection in 3D. The capacity of animators in one of the most complex animation works of recent times is impressive due to the huge number of scenarios and characters, each of which has its own specificity and characteristic. The whim and technical accuracy are impressive. From human characters, to each of the types of Brazilian fauna birds and, of course, complex and monumental landscapes. The concern, especially with the landscapes, was great. Since the film was totally focused on the city, it was important to show every detail of each postcard, especially the best known in the world. Thus, we can check the Rio favelas in every detail of the houses on their hills; we were able to pay a visit to the city's sambadrome, the Marquês de Sapucaí; the Sugarloaf Mountain; Christ the Redeemer could not be missing; the stretches with some native vegetation on one of the hills; the crowded Rio beaches on a sunny day with the women in their bikinis; the Ipanema boardwalk, among others. Seeing the city portrayed in 3D in such a competent way is a source of pride when you see your country well represented on the big screen. The texture of the characters, the natural movement of particles, such as the feathers of birds, and the facial expressions of humans and birds, also reach a degree never reached by Blue Sky studios.Renato Falcão's photography is rightly very colorful, solar and that explores the landscapes in a dazzling way. For the instrumental soundtrack, Saldanha once again called the always competent John Powell, who had already collaborated with the director in Ice Age and Ice Age 2. The track is done in a frantic rhythm and knows how to be more exciting in some main scenes. The sung soundtrack presents as it could not be, Brazilian singers and some fans of the rhythm of national music, and has names such as Siedah Garrett, Jemaine Clement and Carlinhos Brown, Bebel Gilberto, Taio Cruz, Ester Dean, Will.i. Am, and Sérgio Mendes. Fortunately, funk was left out and these more classic samba songs and themes dominated. At no time do the musical sequences hinder or hinder the tempo, before, they give it an atmosphere different from most animations, even though this use of music sung ""for the viewer and by the characters themselves"" has been done many times before, mainly in Disney movies. In the case of Rio, what we have is a well-made connection between the musical world and the fictional drama: the songs do not seem like lost sketches, inserted only to give a ""more melodic and harmonic"" air to the film.The script, if it does not present a better story, is correct in presenting the personality of each of the characters, developing them fully. It is true that some stereotypes still appear, but in general Carlos Saldanha managed to present his city well to the world. Rio has all the ingredients for good animation. It has a great and well-known cast, charismatic and genuinely hilarious characters, unquestionable technical quality, a pleasant story in a different culture, and which still passes the ecological lesson, of having to respect and protect nature and its animals against man's greed. Rio must be remembered as one of the best postcards of the Marvelous City, even with slums, thieving monkeys, children who steal animals in exchange for money and who live in slabs. Saldanha has the merit of being able to insert all this data, which could seem so heavy and harmful, and turn it into a fun movie, without judging, but without hiding. He is proud, but without lying (a lot).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great children's movie,"Rio is a very fun and energetic movie! Sure it has a predictable plot and some immature humor, but this is a movie for KIDS! And actually it is quite funny. There is some humor you can clearly see, and some only an OCD person like me found. The overall plot is predictable, yet there are smaller twists to keep you entertained. It is more appropriate for smaller children than Rango (another good movie). I also like how they portrayed smugglers in a negative light. I also like the voice actors. Good job! It never strays into the realm of being offensively stereotypical, and it shows some of the bad side of Rio. The animation is beautiful and smooth, and I found that hair and feathers were especially lovingly rendered. Please remember that this is a movie for fun, so don't walk into the theater expecting the next ""Citizen Kane"". Overall a great movie. So go see it! P.S. Go see it in 3D.

"Cute, funny, and  musical","The most recent CGI comedy opened up today and one word to definitely use to describe this movie is colorful. From scene one, this movie is filled to the brim with a wide variety of bright colors that bring energy, excitement, and positive feeling to the movie. After we get a little bit of intro into the lives of Blu and Linda, we meet Tulio who takes us to the wonderful world of Rio de Janeiro. Here is where we get a CGI look of this country and some of the culture that it contributes to the world. Not long after arriving we meet about seven major characters in about ten minutes. From there the movie takes off.To start with the positives of this movie let's start with the characters. The voice cast for this movie was well selected with Eisenberg making the perfect choice for a smart, well read bird that is socially awkward, after all he nailed that role in the Social Network. Anne Hathaway plays the snappy, headstrong bird Jewel who provides a lot of attitude that many girls will love. George Lopez's soothing voice and his comedy talents made him the perfect role of the toucan that was funny, but also a wise mentor to Blu. The sidekick bird duo, voiced by Will.I.am and Foxx were a welcomed comedy duo that provided those one lines constantly seen in kids movies and many will appreciate that funny nature.I guess you could say the second strength would be the character variety. As I already mentioned the diversity of the two blue macaw's makes for an interesting combo that sort of portrays a kid odd couple mix. The two sidekick birds make you laugh with quips, which can also be seen in the two henchmen of the main villain, who remind me of a Latino Horace and jasper. Regardless there is also a malicious cockatoo that is reminiscent of Scar from the Lion King. His devilish nature really helps bring back the idea that even the most cuddliest of creatures can be truly evil on the inside, which they have captured well in this movie. Finally we meet the mysterious Louis who is mentioned throughout most of the movie, and turns out to be a dog that reminds you of Sid the Sloth from Ice Age.They have also captured the beautiful scenery of Rio in their CGI work, which allows one to feel like you are in a cartoon version of the city. The divine statues, white buildings, fiestas, beaches, tropical jungles, and slums are all portrayed beautifully, which made a lot of the surrounding audience want to go there.Perhaps one of the strongest aspects of this movie though, is the musical numbers integrated into this movie. Each song fits well with the characters that are singing it and again captures the mood like we have seen in many Disney movies. My favorite was the toe tapping song that the birds party to, sung by Foxx and Will.I.Am. Surely there is a song that everyone can get hooked to in this movie, you just have to look for it.So I have mentioned a lot of good things about this movie, but what about bad. Well this movie is definitely not slow, but the comedy is not the is not the same as it was in the first Ice Age. One big thing I loved about the Ice Age comedies was Sid's dumb nature and unique ways of saying things that made you laugh hysterically. However, in this movie I didn't feel that same kind of comedy and felt it was a little more juvenile in nature. Despite the constant amount of one liners and situational comedies, I was not laughing as hard as I did in Ice Age, which may or may not be an issue for you. Perhaps the only other weakness I could find was that it was pretty predictable and simple in design with no real surprises, twists, or ideas thrown into the mix. Again I don't know if this is really an issue, but it's worth mentioning that it is no new CGI comedy.My rating of this movie would probably be somewhere between an 8-8.5. I would recommend this movie to those that want a fun, colorful movie for their kids that like singing and dancing. People who like colorful and fun, happy comedies will also like this movie, but again i don't think it is a modern ice age comedy. Finally those who like cute movie, like UP, will like this movie and will not be as sad by the end of this movie. Until next time my friends, keep enjoying the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

We didn't like it at all I'm sorry to say, I had hopes of watching a cute movie with the wife.Did anyone else feel like this? We can't be the only ones, no one else we know saw the film and probably won't after we told them about it.I thought a few parts of it was nice, hence the 2 star rating instead of a 1 which it would otherwise receive.

Take me to Rio!,"I want to go to Rio de Janeiro! Rio is an exuberant CGI animated 3D film with wonderfully vibrant colors that literally jump off the screen. This is a classic fish out of water story filled with romance, life lessons and a fairly predictable ending. Nevertheless, Rio is a truly enjoyable film and nearly impossible to watch without dancing in your seat. Director Carlos Saldanha incorporates a tremendous amount of the Brazilian culture into the film and realistic landscape; it is very easy to forget this is an animation. In particular, the flight scenes offer spectacular bird's eye views of the exotic Rio de Janeiro setting. Breathtaking scenery filled with rich, warm colors is incredibly detailed and mesmerizing.Although the themes are familiar, the characters are engaging and lovable. Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) is a domesticated macaw from a small-town who embarks on an adventure in Rio de Janeiro with native, Jewel (Anne Hathaway) to save endangered animals. Credit goes to the writers for providing a sharp, witty dialog and the voice actors for bringing the animated characters to life. In addition to the incredible computer generated visuals, the music adds authentic Brazilian flavor and zest. I love the samba and bossa nova rhythms that pulsate throughout and provide infectious energy. Rio is not billed as a musical but it definitely has that feel and the music is what makes this fast-paced adventure so enjoyable. The Carnival festival explodes on the screen with vigor and verve providing a dazzling display of movement and color set perfectly to music.Rio does not have the depth of some other animated stories; however, it is pure fun from beginning to end. This movie is a visually stunning escape from everyday life and serves as an animated brochure for a place I hope to visit one day.Rio. Dir. Carlos Saldanha. Perf. Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway and George Lopez. Blue Sky Studios: 2011, Film.",,Anonymous,Animation
Flashy bright colors and a passable story,"Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) is a baby macaw who was captured and smuggled to the States. The bird was lost and taken in by little girl Linda. They grow up together. She's a bookstore owner and he's completely domesticated. Brazilian scientist Tulio tells Linda that Blu is the last male of his species, and she needs to bring Blu to Rio de Janeiro. When they get to Rio, Blu and the female Jewel (Anne Hathaway) get stolen.This is a brightly colored confection. It's a neon bright show that tired me out. The story isn't anything special. The characters are fine but I don't see much staying power. Nothing is really exceptional other than those exceptionally brilliant colors. It's a good kiddie movie.

"If you haven't been to Rio, this is the time","¨This is great. I'm chained to the only bird in the world who can't fly! Is there anything else I need to know? ¨ Carlos Saldanha gives us one of the most colorful movies of the year, and it couldn't have been any other way considering the story takes place in beautiful Rio de Janeiro. Saldanha pays homage to the city where he was born, and does it by showing us the beauty of its locations, its people, and its music, during one of the most fun and colorful events that take place every year: Carnival. It's impossible not to like this animated film, despite having a weak and predictable plot, because not liking it would be like not enjoying a trip to Rio. Saldanha takes us to his city and shows us all the beauty Rio has to offer. The visuals in the film are excellent and we get plenty of aerial shots of the city, we see its beautiful beaches, tropical forests, and even get to experience a motorcycle ride across its infamous favela. We also get to meet some of their eccentric characters (Saldanha has a lot of fun with the stereotypes), although the main attraction of the movie are the colorful animals. Animated films have matured greatly over the years and we've come to expect excellent visual effects, but in Rio the visuals are the main attraction and the characters are just a product of their environment. Rio is much better than the other animated film 2011 had to offer: Rango. Rango was an animated film I disliked, but I admitted the visuals were fantastic. Neither of the films have a decent story or memorable characters, but the difference with Rio is that when you have Rio de Janeiro the city itself becomes a character and a very memorable one for that matter. That is why the movie is such fun because it's all about Rio and not so much as the rest of the characters.The film opens in the tropical jungles of Brazil where a blue macaw's life will change forever when a group of poachers take him captive and smuggle him to the States. Somewhere along the way the bird ends up in chilly Minnesota after the truck that is smuggling him hits the breaks a little too hard and the box where he's in ends up flying out of the truck. The macaw is fortunate enough to be found by a young girl named Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann) who takes good care of him. She names the bird Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and they both seem to be enjoying a comfortable life together when all of a sudden they get a visit from a Brazilian ornithologist, Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro), who claims that Blu is the last male bird of his species. Tulio has found a female macaw (Jewell, voiced by Anne Hathaway) and needs Linda to take Blu to Rio so the birds can breed and save the species. Linda unwillingly takes Blu to Rio and that is where the fun begins because Jewel and Blu don't get off to a right start. She is more of a free spirited bird who enjoys her liberty, and he is a domesticated macaw who can't even fly. Somehow both birds are kidnapped from the lab by a smuggler named Marcel (Carlos Ponce) along with his stupid accomplices, and accompanied by an evil and scary cockatoo named Nigel (Jermaine Clement). Blu and Jewel manage to escape from these poachers but not before they end up being chained together. Both birds end up on a journey trying to free themselves while escaping from Nigel and the poachers and along the way they befriend Rafael (George Lopez) the toucan, Pedro (Will.i.am) the red-crested cardinal, Nico (Jamie Foxx) the yellow canary, and Luiz (Tracy Morgan), the bulldog.The plot is probably the weakest part out of the 96 minute movie because it is very predictable: it's a formula picture where we have a male and female lead character that can't stand each other at first only to end up discovering they have feelings for each other. We've all come to expect these stories from Hollywood were opposites attract. Fox-Blue Sky Studios may not have the depth in their stories as Pixar does, but they sure can deliver great visuals. Don't expect a heartfelt story like Pixar's Up or Toy Story and I guarantee you will enjoy this fun colorful movie because Rio de Janeiro is a fun place to be, especially during Carnival. The city itself becomes the main character in this film and that is why the movie is called Rio and not Blu or Jewel. The details of the city and the beautiful locations couldn't have been enjoyed more if it wasn't for Carlos Saldanha and his love for the city in which he was born. Rio is a fun and entertaining movie where kids and adults will have a good time alike thanks to the beauty of its scenery enjoyed mostly through aerial shots, and the soundtrack full of Samba which identifies the city. Saldanha couldn't have picked a more different location from his previous film: Ice Age, and the result is visually noticeable. Rio is a lot of fun and I recommend this animated film for the entire family.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

What Happy-Feet is to penguin poaching; Rio 'ISN'T' for Exotic Birds poaching.,"We had enough dose of animation and 3D movies (combined and in isolation) in the past 3-4 years; so RIO-""3D"" should not ""the"" USP of the film; which makes us ask.. ""What was?"" If you ask this to yourself, you wont get a convincing answer, and that is what sums up the entire experience. The animation part was fairly good (ice age for me was better though) but not up-to the level set by recent competitors like Tangled and How to Train Your Dragon; and very pale compared to Cars / Happy feet.It was not an ""Ok"" movie, BUT a ""Good"" movie, BUT definitively could have been a 'Great' one. This movie came from the makers of ice age and that was written all over the entire 2 hour slot of viewing experience. Isn't that good?.. If course it is but when the Ice age type 'fun' epic is twisted to include a 'message' (bird conservation) oriented story ; it somewhat is not able to do justice to either. Happy feet on the other end could be a direct comparison where the confluence was superb. Rio on that count, sorry to say, wasn't.On the positive side, it has the inherent carnival vibrancy with pulsating, colorful, exuberant, locales. The details of the city are all there, but so is the big picture (you know, everything that really matters, along with wide panoramas of Rio by night, of a crowded beach, of a sunset). Jesse (facebook) Eisenberg has done a great voice-over job.This is where Disney / Pixar scores over others as they have sure plots but with a touch of maturity. Rio has the energy but lacks the ripeness. The movie ride is somewhat bumpy without the ""Wow!"" factor so prevalent in Disney / Pixar movies.

A Nutshell Review: Rio,"20th Century Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios hit all the right notes with their Ice Age trilogy, a series that I had unabashedly enjoyed, and for their follow up feature with director Carlos Saldanha, the icy cool pre-historic environment got traded for the land of contemporary Samba warmth. Still dealing with talking animals as characters, there was this sense of constant dread while watching Rio as it really tried too hard to entertain and to sustain that party atmosphere, and the filmmakers seem to have run out of tricks in their formula bag to keep one entertained.Then it dawned upon me that I have grown up, lost that sense of wonderment a kid would have, and probably have been spoilt by Rango. Rango showed the heights that animated feature films can reach if they do not try to dumb it down for the kids, and is more adult orientated fare that didn't have to rely on cutesy characters created just to make kids want to buy their plush toy versions, or to allow for some of the easily impressionable female crowd to go gaga over. It had spirit and a tremendous story at its core, never really needing to rely on the cheap milking of emotions. Rio had gone overboard when you discover that their designs and crafting of cute characters equals baby, small, round, fat, and to speak funny. I see plush toys rolling off the assembly line already.You would already know the story inside out if you had paid attention to the trailers for Rio. And having the screenplay written by Do Rhymer didn't exactly spell confidence, given his filmography thus far with the Big Momma series, and a number of sequels like Santa Clause 2 and Agent Cody Banks 2, which spell direct to video business. Perhaps the only bright spark that I had enjoyed from Rhymer was his Surf's Up, but alas Rio wasn't as innovative in narrative, following a set path of a pair of would-be love birds hating each other's guts, having to duke it out while chained to each other and finally emerge as winners to reclaim their freedom and walk, well, fly into the sunset together. Sounds like a typical opposites attract romantic tale to me.Loaded with plenty of characters who talk too much, one cannot deny that it has star power at its side that will positively impact its appeal factor. There's the newly minted ""It"" stars like Jesse Eisenberg who plays Blu the blue macaw with the same whiny, nerdy demeanour Eisdenberg is known to play (someone spell stereotype already), while Anne Hathaway tackles Jewel the spirited female blue macaw in extremely bland fashion, probably the least interesting bird character amongst the lot. Chipping in are Leslie Mann as Blu's owner Linda, who goes into a parallel love story of her own as well with bird scientist Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro), Flight of the Conchords' Jermaine Clement as the villainous bully Nigel, and with others such as will.i.am, Jamie Foxx, Tracy Morgan and George Lopez, who is lending his voice to too many animal characters already for crying out loud.Animation wise, Rio allowed Blue Sky Studios to dabble in richer and warmer colours across a wider spectrum, and this validates that the studio isn't a one-environment wonder with its bevy of colours filling up the entire screen from the get go, with realistic, vivid textures that compensates not having real animals up there. And the film plays like a musical with just about every Samba tune conceivable packaged into bubblegum pop, never letting go of any chance to chant ""RIO"" every now and then. Like how many complain about Bollywood movies padding their run time with its musical numbers, Rio is also guilty of the same, making it seem overly longer than its 96 minute runtime.Maybe it's reflective of my current mood or age has caught up with me, or perhaps I now realize I prefer my stories with a lot more grit than fluff. I had expected more, but Rio stayed well within its comfort zone. Definitely targeted at the younger crowd, and the still young at heart who like their characters develop according to formula, and designed with bright colours to stay cute and cuddly (damn, there I said it)!",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Great film not only for parents and children alike, but also bird lovers of all ages!","Charismatic computer-animated musical comedy about two Spix's Macaws on the run in Rio de Janeiro from three bird smugglers and their crusty evil Macaw (voiced viciously perfect by Jemaine Clement).

Along the way, they come across many colorful (no pun intended) characters played by will.i.am, Foxx, Lopez and Morgan.

A Cute Children's Movie,"I will admit it- some of my favorite movies of all time are children's cartoon movies. The heart-warming themes, innocent plots, all feed into my memories of my happy childhood. Sadly, many recent children's movies have been a major disappointment to me...Over the Hedge grated against my nerves, The Wild bored me (and was a total rip-off of Madagascar, which was a very good movie), and Hoodwinked Too destroyed my love for it's prequel (darn you movie!). However, when I saw the commercial for this movie, the story intrigued me. The colors were brilliant and fun to look at, the story seemed cute (even though not very original...), and the main character seemed somewhat tolerable for a children's movie hero. The movie was as I summarized- cute. It wasn't anything too special or magnificent, but simply cute. The voice acting wasn't very impressive, but it made up for it with it's vivid scenery, enjoyable music, and lovable hero. The story was, of course, cliché, but it was a fun cliché. It seemed to know it was not very original, but it embraced this and didn't try to pretend that it was, and instead focused on visually pleasing the audience. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, however it could never compete with some of the great cartoon classics (I.E. Beauty and the Beast, which is my all time favorite movie!).

An animation bursting with color that makes up for the movie's quality,"I was excited to see this film because the teasers seemed funny enough and I heard that the people who made this film were the same guys who produced the awesome ""Ice Age"" movie. But after getting the tickets, I began feeling worried and guilty. ""What if the movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be? What if the money that we used wasn't worth it? What if I've just wasted my afternoon by seeing this film? What if this is just another movie meant for children?"" But all those thoughts stopped as the opening credits began and the screen filled with a great landscape view and then suddenly, birds of every color bursted into a lively song.Blu, a Mackaw, is taken as a pet while he is still young, by a sweet girl named Linda. As years pass, Linda and Blu form a special friendship where they both trust,love and care for the other. The only problem is that Blu, a bird, can't seem to fly. One day, Tulio, an ornithologist, informs Linda that her pet seems to be the last male of his kind. He asks Linda if Blu and herself could be flown to Brazil so that Blu could mate with the last female of their kind. Linda, after some hesitation, agrees. However, things don't quite go as planned. Jewel, the last female Macaw, doesn't take well to Blu and because of some unfortunate circumstances, both Blu and Jewel get lost in the wild chained up together.The humor was not bad. I actually found myself laughing, which I didn't really expect. Some of the songs in the movie annoyed me. I think this movie would have been a lot better if it didn't have a musical-like feel. The ending of the movie is very predictable, but even so, that doesn't mean that you won't feel that short euphoria that all happy endings give us.The animation is great. The background and the settings were just brilliant. So much color! It made me think that Rio does seems like a grand place to take a vacation in. The parade scene made me appreciate Rio's beauty more, too! If I could rewatch one scene from the movie, I'd pick the parade scene. There's just so much going on and it's a pretty cool scene.

Well-executed use of a tired formula,"Animated talking-animal films since the dawn of CGI have gotten much more prolific. Now that animals can be illustrated with ease and superb realism (namely in textures such as fur, feathers and scales), the supply can meet the demand and almost every major movie studio has either its own animation division or a relationship with an animation company. ""Rio"" is the product of Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios, the team behind the ""Ice Age"" franchise.With animated films coming out in rampant fashion, originality has taken a hit. The formula? Pick a country, climate or segment of the animal kingdom and set the exact same story there. So what started as a ""fish-out-of-water"" tale has become a bird/dinosaur/penguin/African animal-out-of-water story. ""Rio"" is a visually beautiful film with a sweet story and humorous supporting characters, but it contains not one original feather in its coat other than the Brazilian backdrop.""Rio"" tells the story of Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg), a domesticated blue macaw that ended up in Moose Lake, Minn. in the care of a socially awkward bookworm named Linda (Leslie Mann). When an overenthusiastic ornithologist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) shows up claiming Blu is the last of his species and he would like to mate him with the lone remaining female back in Rio de Janeiro, Linda is hesitant but agrees.Eisenberg's eccentricities fit Blu well and help sell the bird-out-of-cage story effectively. When he meets his mate-to-be, Jewel (Anne Hathaway), things couldn't go worse. She wants desperately to escape and return to be free in the Amazon. Blu and Jewel are kidnapped, however, by a man who intends to sell them. Chained together, the must of course learn to like each other in order to survive. Oh, and it would help if Blu knew how to fly.The writing team makes a concerted effort to infuse the film with the free spirit of Rio's annual ""Carnival"" festival in hopes of adding a meaningful cultural element. It basically results in a few unexpected musical numbers and several overweight male characters dressing scantily, but it helps give ""Rio"" a distinctive flavor.In my opinion, you go full musical or you don't go musical at all, but the concept works better than you'd expect. Even the typical ""statement of evil"" song from back in the Disney days makes an appearance here and is actually quite funny. Jemaine Clement voices the evil cockatoo Nigel, one of the more sinister and intriguing animated enemies you'll see in a film of this genre. He provides the necessary sense of danger for this all-too-typical adventure.The character archetypes are the most bland: the out-of-its-element main character, the rebellious love interest, the wise mentor figure (George Lopez as Rafael the toucan), the tiny sidekicks (Jamie Foxx and will.i.am as Nico and Pedro) and the big lovable stupid acquaintance (Tracy Morgan as Luiz the bulldog).Sure, there's a reason animated films keep coming back to those character types, but ""Rio"" uses them to an unoriginal end. The moral and themes are tired and not given any renewed attention. Do you think that Blu learns how to fly by the end? I even went so far as to try and guess a line of dialogue: ""Blu, you're flying!"" I would tell if you if I was right, but truth of the matter is ""Rio"" is still a light and enjoyable animated flick worth watching.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Blu and Jewel the first adventure with good animation, good sountrack, and a perfect chemistry","Rio is an American animated romance film from 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios, directed by Carlos Saldanha and written by Don Rhymer.It tells the story of Blu (Eisenberg), a domesticated male Spix's macaw who is brought to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a free-spirited female, the Spix's macaw, Jewel (Anne Hathaway). The two eventually fall in love, and together they have to escape being smuggled by Nigel (Clement), a cockatoo.I think the best part was the chemistry between Jesse Eisenberg as Blu and Anne Hathaway as Jewel and in my opinion are one of the best couples in animation, even though in their sequel there was not a fair deal between the two, but they are one of the best animation couples.But I have a love-hate story with this movie because every time I saw Rio it reminded me of a girl I fell in love with in kindergarten.WhenI was about five or six years old back in 2011, I was advertised a lot on Televisa on TV Azteca, channels from Mexico, and also on Lala and Ades products, also brands from Mexico. The following year, in 2012, I saw it for the first time on Fox Channel, now Star Channel, and every time it was shown I had fun, but there was a moment when I associated the movie with a girl who was with me in kindergarten and years passed and I stopped watching it. And whenever that movie was shown on channel 5, the Mexican channel or on the Fox channels now owned by Disney, I never wanted to see it.In the case of a good soundtrack, I'm talking about songs like:
Real in Rio performed by Jesse Eisenberg, Jamie Foxx, Anne Hathaway, George Lopez, will.i.am, and The Rio Singers with Hollywood
Hot Wings (I Wanna Party) performed by will.i.am, Jamie Foxx, Anne Hathaway
Fly Love performed by Jamie Foxx
Telling the World performed by Taio Cruz

Disspointing. Don't be fooled by its bright colors. Rio is as dull as it can get.,"Music! Dance! Colors! Parties and carnavals! That's what a movie set in Rio de Janeiro can offer, and that's what Rio offered...in a disappointing wave of let down. All the musical showcases are wonderful and beautiful, sure, and they're entertaining too! But what about the movie itself? It's shallow, uninspired and quite boring, to say the least. When the characters don't work, the music don't. And when they don't, you end up getting more joy watching backup dancers dancing than the main characters themselves.Despite its boredom, Rio is what it's all about - being amazed by the colors and sights the city offers. You've never seen this kind of place in an animation before. The real city looks superb, but dare I say, it looks more amazing and bright in animation. The lights, statue, streets and oh, the carnaval! The carnaval is the most wonderful thing you'll ever see in a CGI movie this year. Surely the huge lineup of colors and samba will delight you, at least for a while. BUT, the movie ruins it all. The sights do take your breath away, and so does the characters (in a bad kind of way).Let's boil down the characters - the humans are bumbling fools, the birds are flying clichés and the dog is a comic relief that's not even funny. Fine, you may say that the movie is meant for entertainment, not to be taken seriously at all. BUT hey, you'd want something solid and smart for entertainment, and I must say, Rio is the least entertaining compared to the other movies Blue Sky Studios have made. The script could've have seriously done better with the blunt and uncreative dialogue. Every word that comes out of the characters' mouth can earn you a facepalm. The plot could've worked better with better direction, pacing and editing. The musical numbers could've immortalized Rio with its upbeat songs and exciting musicals, but it didn't, because the characters didn't work. You won't feel a thing when the music plays, cause you don't give a dime's worth about the characters. There may be some nice scenes where you look at them and like them, but for most of the time, they're forgettable.It all seems to fast in Rio; you don't have the time to truly live in the moment. I don't know why that is, maybe it's because of the direction, but whatever it is, it makes the movie bland. Voice-acting? Not the best. You can get better from a foreign movie translation, and that's me being serious. There are a few select voices that are good, but never that good. Again, that's only because of the lousy screenplay/script. It's disappointing, considering the actors hired to voice the characters.Rio seems like an experimental animation aimed to impress audiences with its smooth pictures and colorful parades. It seems like the studio is still trying to find its ground after leaving Ice Age, but it must be said that Rio, is not their landing spot. They're still searching for a comfort zone. You can feel a bit of their style here and there, but never fully achieving that Ice Age fame.You never quite see the culture of the city that well either, thanks to the choppy direction and aimless script. The story has too much stuff in it that it makes everything half-hearted. I don't want to compare other movies, but Rio ranks low in execution compared to other animations when it comes to showing a city's culture and mood. Rio is seen here as a city full of party. That's it. The beautiful sights are just sights, nothing more. There's no explanation, no exploration, but instead, head-on action with mindless scripting.Must be said; Rio looks like something you'd see in a Saturday morning full-length cartoon meant for toddlers. Seriously.If you like birds, colors and eye-popping animation, this is a no-brainer movie for you. Don't be expecting any brains or charm coming out from this movie though, and truth to be told, the animation isn't that good compared to others (the humans' expression aren't that good). Jokes are lame, most of them, at least. Characters are uninspired, voice-acting is so-so, setting is terrific but the execution is nil. If you're watching Rio, expect to stay and yearn to leave. It does nothing but shakes its tail feathers without even knowing what it's doing.Rio, is feather-deep in everything. Enjoy! Not.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fabulous family film,"The animation is fabulous, full of vibrant colours and action. The script is funny, with some clever one liners and the voice actors are brilliant. There's also some fine music, catching the mood of Brazil. In short, it's an absolute delight from start to finish. Both kids and adults will love it, particularly if they have an interest in parrots.But the movie has an underlying serious message about the loss of the world's parrots and the illegal trade in them. The wonderful irony is that real Spix's macaws are flying free in Brazil again and 3 young were actually hatched there, uncannily mirroring the final scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just Lovely,"I watched this movie on a lethargic Sunday night and must say that it was the perfect fashion to bring to an end an otherwise lousy day. In few words, Rio is a fantastically executed humorous flick packed with cute scenes and gorgeous animation. Though the movie was a bit obvious at times but the charming & highly amusing sequences don't let you take your eyes of the screen.Jesse Eisenberg's voice is amazingly immaculate for a bird and he does a great job playing the role of the domesticated exotic bird BLU, who doesn't know how to fly. And Anna Hathaway's voice was so sweet throughout the movie that I actually fell in love with the character JEWEL. NIGEL, their evil counterpart was well scripted and does present wickedness. Needless to say, Jemaine Clement did one heck of a job while lending his voice to the character.The scenes with the goofy monkeys were outstanding on the level of clowning and were as good as the penguins of Madagascar. Moreover, the drooling amigo the birds find during the end was definitely the highpoint as far as the comic element in the movie is concerned.Finally, the animation deserves an accolade as it was just magnificent and gorgeous. The movie is filled with vibrant colors and dazzling performances. I truly wish I had watched it in 3D but 2D is not so bad either, in fact it is pretty awesome!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Great Film,"There were so many things about this movie that were great. The colours, the music, the characters. There was so much it is hard to explain all of it. Usually music in movies doesn't appeal to me, but this was the opposite. The soundtrack was spectacular, it had some catchy tunes, and some songs to set the mood for the moment. The colourful nature of Rio was great, bright tropical colours that you would actually see in the jungles. 'Rio' had good characters and good decisions who to choose for the cast. The way they change was fairly well done. It also made you feel the proper emotion towards the characters, like anger or happiness. There was no scenes that weren't needed in the movie, they all seemed to be in the right spot. A short as the movie was, it still never felt as long as it was. 'Rio' was enjoyable enough that I wished it could never end. In all it was a great movie, one that you can watch over and over and not get sick of it.My rating 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rio (2011),"Bright colors aside, I found little to truly enjoy about this movie. Rio centers upon a bird that must have a lot of sex to bring his species back from extinction. But he's a house pet and his suggested mate is wild. He is pampered and nervous, and she's a bird of the world. How will these two ever get along? They are joined by a wild and crazy cast (annoying), of comedic (loud) animals. I wasn't engaged by the plot, I didn't laugh at the jokes, and the only highlight was Jermaine Clement, who obviously got a chance to do some of his own stuff with his highlight song. Any movie with George Lopez and Tracy Morgan should come with a warning attached to it.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nerds and Macaws: Two Love Stories,"CGI animated films have become a common genre in recent Hollywood, especially during the holidays. Among them comes a refreshing little film called 'Rio'. Yes, the story is formulaic and easy to predict but formula not necessarily need be a bad thing, especially when it's treated well. So what makes 'Rio' stand out? It is the animation, energy, humour and charming characters that keep the viewer highly entertained.Most of the story is set in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro and the stunning animation so beautifully captures its essence with incredible detail and various colour. The detail in the characters and their expressions and movement is very well done. The visuals are very pleasing to the eyes.The film has a very old Disney feel to it, with its charm and humour. It moves at a steady pace and there's plenty of energy. There are also several songs that appear at the right time and are delightfully visualized. Much of the humour is slapstick and there are also enough funny lines to maintain a balance.The voice casting is brilliant. Eisenberg and Hathaway are very funny as the lead macaws and they are hilariously supported by Jaime Foxx, Will I Am and Tracy Morgan among others. I also liked that the two lead human characters weren't relegated to the background or given little attention. As such Rodrigo Santoro and Leslie Mann are great as the nerdy pair. I was only a little disappointed that comedy queens like Wanda Sykes and Jane Lynch were barely given more than one line.'Rio' has a lot working in its favour: Humour, energy, colourful visuals, Rio de Janeiro. And, adults can enjoy it just as much as kids. What more can one ask for in a fun movie?",,Anonymous,Animation
Fly Love. Fly Rio. The same flying tale told charmingly.,"Fly Love. Fly Rio. The same flying tale told charmingly.Yes, they seem to be inspired by PIXAR in animation and content too. PIXAR uses toys, cars, rats, monsters and these folks used birds. The content is simple, a bird has to find her home and has to get what it was deprived of, and that is it's flight. Not revealing too much of a story here but yes, it's worth a trip and I am sure that for most part we will be laughing on gags that we have seen earlier. What I think, they did is they took all the famous acts amalgamated them well and the concoction they ensured that was prepared was sweet.Like one scene, where when the guy tries to drive a bike, he hits the wall and fell off while the girl starts it they fly in the air. A few scenes like the one in which Blue (our protagonist) reads books on how to fly and then prepares itself to takeoff creating a runway as if its an airplane. All these bring out laughs and make us happy. So surely this can be taken a ride for such moments that are many.There is nothing as such jaw dropping or mind boggling in this animated film and its devoid of any surprise too with a pretty predictable storyline. Having said that, its surely watchable for its lovable characters and the wit and the charm (charm is subjective here, I found it charming and loving but others may find something else). The animation expectedly was top class and one scene in which the two birds go through Rio on a glider is where it brings in a 3D element.Song, I loved is Fly Love and for this as a director, one needs a good vision.Note : - I watched this is in Spanish without even subtitles so not sure what each character told each other exactly, but I could easily make out what was going through even then. This helped me learn that language is not barrier for content being shown.A good watch after which I felt energetic its 3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ordinary: The New Angry Bird,"Director Carlos Saldanha has temporarily abandoned his ""Ice Age"" saga moving to the warm, beautiful jungle and city of Rio de Janeiro following colorful birds in the kid safe movie ""Rio."" While the G rating targets young children, adults may find some entertainment from the straightforward, colorful song and dance of Brazilian birds. The problem is ""Rio"" does not bring anything fresh to the animated escape genre. To begin, the film briefly takes place in Moose Lake, Minnesota after bird smugglers transfer a new catch from Rio to the U.S. Their goal is to sell them as pets, however, they accidentally leave a blue Macaw named Blu (Jesse Eisenberg, ""The Social Network"") on the side of the road. In Moose Lake Blu is domesticated throughout the years as he befriends a lady named Linda (Leslie Mann, ""Funny People""). Life is perfect until Blu and Linda are informed by a scientist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro, ""300"") that Blu must go back to Rio in order to save his species from extinction. In Rio things start off rocky as he serenades his other half Jewel (Anne Hathaway, ""Love and Other Drugs"") and turn to the worse as the two are forced to escape the bonds of smugglers once again. They are aided on their journey by a seasoned entertainment cast including Will I Am, Jamie Foxx, Tracy Morgan and George Lopez. While the birds are running, flying and chirping for their lives another cliché love story forms between Linda and Tulio adding to the overall happy ending.The vibrant carefree musical vibes of Brazil are seen throughout the movie giving appeal to its colorful birds. The smart vocal casting of musical artists and contemporary acting stars creates speech and choral integrity for the performances in the film. This diversity also draws an older viewing audience who actually know who the actors are, while the quick simple pace mesmerizes kids. With this being said, ""Rio"" is the best G film of the year for all audiences because of its built in kid safety that does not totally bore older viewers away.Is straightforward cinema good? Yes, however, sometimes a film like ""Rio"" can be so straightforward that it doesn't bring anything fresh to the table. The only original aspect of the film is the fact that it takes place in Brazil ""Angry Birds"" style, but in the end there is no surprise. Consequently there are moments in the film that seem to drag on because the ending is already clear. Also, while Jesse Eisenberg is currently a big name actor in Hollywood, it was very awkward hearing his voice come out of the beak of a bird. His voice personified Blu in a very nerdy way, while Blu was developed as a cute naïve pet instead of a socially awkward parrot..Ultimately, ""Rio"" successfully fulfills childish expectations staying true to youthful entertainment with its straightforward plot. It also avoids causing the excruciating boredom to adults present in earlier G movie releases in 2011, however, it cannot escape the fact that it is only ordinary.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""The Real Deal""","This Movie was an A-grade cartoon animated movie. The movie Rio had the best animated features with ""Up and How to train your dragon,"" the textures and the recreated physics of the movie itself.

A good animation,"Rating-7/10Rio is a fun, bright and colourful film about a whole host of animals living in the inner city Rio de Janeiro and the rainforest just on the outskirts of the city. It although a kids film can be enjoyed by all, not the funniest film ever but still manages a sweet story with some great visuals even for an animation film. I felt the film was firmly a Good movie and would tell you to show your kids this film on a Sunday afternoon, but here is why I think even middle aged adults can enjoy this film.The story is straightforward and although it is like that it manages to bring smiles to your face and put me in a food mood for the rest of the film. The plot is fast paced with big falls and typical traits you see in Kids movies but I did feel most of all that it wasn't too cheesy like you see in many kids films and churned out a fun story. The villains are fun and the heroes have fun with them too to make a story that is fun for the whole family as well, and with a sequel it has to be said it is good.The voice cast are good Jesse Eisenberg as the main bird is a scared character who comes out of his shell to be a slight hero as the movie progresses onwards. Anne Hathaway's bird if courageous and hates to be kept in captivity, in comparison to Eisenberg who wants to stay put and has been pampered in America all his life. I liked all the voices even though they were all nearly American even though they are from Brazil but I shall let that pass in sake of the plot.I love the animation style which is far from superior style motion but serves some great colours up and the vibrancy of Rio is brought to life in this animated film, especially the carnival(what film set here doesn't have the carnival). The movement is also good with fast flowing motion that serves the faster parts of the story well as you feel the film will end soon but not in a hurry and a good pace. I enjoyed the script and it serves to let the Birds and humans have an equal say on the matters all the way through.The film I believe was meant to be a comedy and now for kids it may amuse them but for more mature people the comedy is poor and near none existent, I enjoyed the films plot and style but the comedy seemed underused and when it came up it just served to annoy rather than make you laugh. Eisenberg seems to rarely get into the role well but it doesn't hinder the movie, the plot as I said is predictable but the movie does turn up some good moments and nice effects and sequences.I could easily say this is made for 3 year olds but I think lots will enjoy this if they watch it with the intention of not laughing but enjoying a sweet movie and some nice characters too. Those who like animation films generally will like it as it flows nice and I said about the motion being fast, along with the film being not too long either. Finally I must say don't watch this film in a bad mood because I can imagine people would absolutely hate this when they are angry or sad.Overall I give it a 7/10 meaning firmly good, the film serves as fun entertainment for a family but not maybe everyone's cup of tea in truth, give it a miss if you want funny animation. I felt FOX did well to make it and put it out but failed to see if it was really funny, but hey watch it and a give it a try, you may just thoroughly enjoy yourself, but on the same hand you may find it cringe and boring, your call.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good entertaining movie.,"RIOThis is a film that I saw the trailer of when it first came out and thought it looked average. Now after watching it I can say in my opinion it is better than I thought it would be.The movie is about a blue Macaw named Blu. He is a domesticated bird that lives with his owner in a book shop. When a man walks into her shop and asks to take the bird to Rio so he can mate with a female Macaw, they reluctantly agree. Whilst in Rio, the 2 birds get stolen and now it is a hunt for the 2 missing birds and an adventure for them as they find their way back to their owner.The story was really good and the animation was very good too. I liked the characters. I thought they were very funny and the relationship they all had together was really well done.The action was good and was steady throughout the movie. There was not really a lot of time in the film where not a lot happened. It was entertaining throughout.The voice work was really good. They were so funny in places. Jesse Eisenberg was the voice of Blu. Very well done and very funny. Anne Hathaway was Lewel, the female Macaw. She was also very good, but nothing special. I didn't even realise it was her until the end. They could have got anyone do this voice. Other voice artists were Wanda Sykes, Jane Lynch, Jamie Foxx & Will.I.Am. Again though, I had no idea that these guys did the voices.I thought this was very good and had its own feel to it. You could tell this was not a Disney film, but that does not take anything away from it. It is a great film.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""Not cool man, not cool!""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
timeless masterpiece worth watching,"This is a movie enjoyable for the whole family to watch over and over. A timeless piece of beauty, humor and romance is how I can best describe it. It kinda puts you on the edge of your seat, as you seem to be going through a roller coaster ride. I first thought it might be another animated movie that is dull as some I've seen that were less interesting & entertaining to sit through. Like for example The Incredibles (2004) which whisked you through all sorts of special effects that you didn't have the time to appreciate anything about the characters. Even what I saw with KungFu Panda (2008) wasn't even close to being this good. I look to definitely purchase this one!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A pleasant experience,"Rio is a pleasant kids matinée film. There is nothing here particularly new or surprising, but the kids will love it. The high point for me for this movie was the nice animation of the colorful birds flying to Latin music.Blue is a blue macabre(who does not know how to fly) the last male of his type who is captured to be sent to some place in the USA. He falls off the truck and is found by Linda who adopts Blue as a pet. 15 years latter Doctor Borbosa comes from Brazil who has found a female blue macabre and wants to breed the pair to help keep the species alive. So off to Rio during Carnival to get the pair of birds to hook up. The problem at first Jewel the female bird is very fightsy and wants nothing to do with Blue. Well that night a smuggler of exotic birds steals the pair and binds their feet together. Later that night the pair escapes. The rest of the movie is about the 2 birds trying to get unbound, Linda trying to get Blue back and the smuggler trying to get the birds back. The rest is rather predictable.The movie is a nice kids flick but nothing more. The story is neither interesting or new, the characters we have all seen before.

"Maybe the kids might like it, but overall a very generic and formulaic CGI animated movie that relies too much on wacky characters","This is a pretty bad family flick, however the kids might enjoy it although I seen a lot of them get bored in theater and started to wander off. The characters are over wacky all the time in order to get the audience attention, but I lost interest very quickly. It's like watching something dull, trying to be exciting and entertaining. Even if a whole bunch of characters are constantly wacky and bouncing around all over the place. Now I enjoy watching CGI animated movies, but this one just wasn't engaging at all. In fact I found myself checking my phone a couple of times. The jokes were also very forced and didn't get any laugh or chuckle from anyone, including the kid audiences. Everything about this CGI animated flick seemed overdone in a negative way and so very generic to the point it becomes so very predictable. None of the characters in this was even all that likable or made me actually care for any of them. Plus the direction of it all is so very formulaic.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Olympics coincidence,"Although the animation of this film is most excellent, one has to wonder about the timing. The biggest issue with having the Olympic games in Rio is the crime and corruption. It makes it seem as the major source of crime is bird smuggling, except for the pickpocket monkeys. They show Rio with clean streets and friendly people. The only people in Rio that are friendly are the grifters (the con artists). One also needs to remember that Rio is in Brazil. That's where the corrupt government has allowed so much of the rain forest to be decimated. Then there's the fact that Brazil is the country that helped hide all the Nazi's after WW2. Now you wonder how a film like this comes along and makes Rio look like heaven. MONEY!!!",,Anonymous,Animation

The writers of kids movies need to consider the attention span of children, I have thought this about a few other movies as well.

A Beautiful Lie,"First, Rio is nicely made with a scene I will never forget - the huge amounts of slime slobbering dog will always stay in my heart beneath another children's movie where it is all about funny vomiting. The slimy dog caused my body to ripple a few times, while the movie did not loose focus on slobbering for a small eternity. It's nice for me to see somebody with equal taste.There are nice locations, nice colors, nice enemies, nice heroes, and even nice songs, which was a genuine surprise for me, as I usually hate musicals since my earliest youth. I don't need to recommend this movie to anyone, because it seems that already the whole world has watched it. And most people loved it, because it's lighthearted and funny.And here we come to the amount of light hearts, which I do equal with selfishness (of the seller). When I watched Rio with my children, my son (18yrs) mentioned the high criminal rate in Rio, one of the highest in the world, and I whispered back that he will not see anything of this in the movie except in a polished way that doesn't exist in reality.I have the archaic theory that watching a movie on the big screen should include a few educational aspects. That may correspond with amounts of money I spend at the cinema (here about 90 incl. junk food for two adults and three children).In this case lessons one could learn are, that people will not look behind nice illusions even if they know the truth first-hand, as it should be with the Brazil-originated director. And that the nicer and more excited a picture is shown, the more it should be questioned.In the town Rio of today's days there are private militia organizations, formed by members of the police, fighting against criminal syndicates consisting of up to 5000 heavy-armed men. While the police itself is completely absent in large areas of the town, the militia constantly pushes the criminals out of their range of influence, but demands also a fee from the citizens. The crime detection rate is near 1%.I know that the Brazilians have an admirable sense for living - or designing - an exciting life(style), the carnival, the Copacabana... But also most Brazilians are poor, uninsured, live between junk, have no future...The mega-cities like Rio may look modern to us, but living in the Favelas is not an easy thing. 2008 in Rio, until June, about 4000 persons died alone by gunshots.I understand it's not easy to make a pure fun movie for children with all the bad things that exist around. But who would make a movie about the wonderful live in Japan nearby Fukushima without even mentioning its dangers ? - I would say, only a cynical director on a money hunt could do that.Yes, I know, when it comes to Disney animations or children movies in general, my concerns should be all the same. Watching an idyllic world always needs some parental correctional afterwords. Couldn't i let fun simply be fun ? - No, not when it's hiding something dirty.",,Anonymous,Animation

Rio - 3 Stars,"Ironic, isn't it, how ""Rio"" uses an outlined plot and a standard story to produce a wacky, out-of-control party where most of its participants either have wings or fur.

Birds sweep through the air and swerve through the trees. Consistent through the rest of the film, this sequence is bright and colorful. The birds maintain a low height, probably with a fear of being sucked into jet engines.

How rude.Fate is very kind to the baby macaw, who later finds itself in the hands of a caring little girl in Minnesota. Years pass. Linda and her pet bird, Blue, are all grown up. Because Blue was captured very early in his life, he never did learn to fly. Linda is not to blame for Blue's flightless lifestyle. When a bird pushes its baby a cliff, it's called normal parenting.

"Birds singing and dancing their way to Brazil, and that's all","I thought it was just for fun that ""Rio"" rhymed with ""Nemo"" and that the story of ""Rio"" (2011) nearly mirrors the story of 'Finding Nemo"" (2003). But there is actual fact in this movie. Hyacinth Macaws (blue in colour) are real birds who are endangered and native to Rio de Janeiro. The cage bird trade — which takes our beloved Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) to Minnesota — are a problem for the species. I'm pretty sure they don't talk though.I mean form thoughts, speak in complete sentences and solve math and engineering problems. Blu can do all of that but he can't fly. When he returns to Brazil, that is the entire joke and conflict of the movie all wrapped up into one. Which makes the movie very, very short.To round it out, all the birds, animals, and even humans have to stop and sing and dance for awhile. They have to because it is done in every animated animal movie where the hero returns home (either the artificial or natural home). It's annoying here because the birds do a sort of hip-hop, rap, dance routine — the kind that is in ""popular"" movies. Blu's female counterpart Jewel is voiced by Anne Hathaway, who can actually sing, but she doesn't until the very end in a duet with Jesse Eisenberg who cannot sing.I liked the animation, especially of the Hyacinth Macaws (and I completely accept that they changed the female's colouring since we do need to be able to tell them apart). The animated ""choreography"" with the multi-coloured birds dancing was cute enough it was almost dazzling.The reason we animate animals is because it is supposed to be cute and funny, but ""Rio"" unfortunately, really was not funny. Perhaps it will be to kids, but for those of us who find flaws in animated children's movies, it's just not quite cute and funny enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not great. Not good. Bad? Maybe!,"I love animated movies. But when I went to see this, I was really disappointed. It wasn't a well put together movie. The voice acting was just OK, and the story left much to be desired. I found myself asking the question, ""Why does this movie exist?"" It's your cookie cutter, every day ordinary poorly done movie. The art was good yes. But the story was greatly lacking. The characters were shallow and it just felt like an opportunity to use big name actors for a quick money grab. Not a good movie. It's the kind of movie that you would expect to be playing on a small TV on low volume in the back of a doctor's office waiting room. I'm surprised they are going to make a second one.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not perfect but still good,"This colorful movie will delight young viewers and keep older ones from getting too bored as it takes you on a wild ride through Brazil.Rio is about a rare Blue Macaw parrot named...well, Blue...who was raised in a cold small town in Minnesota by a bookstore clerk. Blue never needed a reason to fly until one day they were approached by a bird specialist working to repopulate the Blue Macaws. He brings them to Brazil and Blue ends up going on the ride of his life. It is fun, light hearted, and enjoyable. The music is great as well, especially with Will.I.Am lending his talent to the Brazillian beats.As a previous reviewer stated, there is something missing to this movie, but I just can't put my finger on it. Its not perfect, but it is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Cute, but nothing new","I have to admit, I was kind of disappointed by this movie, and I was really looking forward to it. Instead, I walked out of the theater with a massive headache and a feeling of deja-vu.I will put this caveat: 3D usually gives me a splitting, incredibly painful headache, and this was no exception. But I'm also aware that's a ""your mileage may vary"" thing. My friend was the one to get the tickets, and accidentally ended up paying an extra $4.50 per ticket to see the film in 3D, when it would have been much more enjoyable in 2D. Myself, and two others who I went to see this movie with ended up with excruciating headaches from the 3D glasses. If you don't usually have a problem with it, though, it might be worth it for you to go see it in 3D.As for the story, it was very cute (I wanted to hug baby Rio!), but reminiscent of many different ""animal wants to go back to his home"" features. It was still enjoyable, with a satisfying resolution and some funny jokes that both kids and adults would be able to enjoy, but it all felt a bit familiar. That's not to say it wasn't entertaining, however. Just don't go in expecting anything revolutionary.Overall: 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worth Watching,"Great soundtrack, fantastic colors, beautiful plot (inspired by a true story by the way, where scientists are trying to breed the last blue macaw male found in the jungle with couple of domesticated females, hoping to save this unique specie of parrots, that does not breed in captivity, after years and years of over-hunting.)The story is not so different from the usual plot found in this type of anime: The lost person/animal who finds himself in an extraordinary situation that brings up the best of him.. So the story and the ending are very very predictable, almost every step of the way.. So don't expect to enjoy the story, what you will really enjoy, what you are paying to watch here, is the scenery! For me, this is the true hero of the movie! Along with the fantastic soundtrack that really stands out here! I gave it 8 stars, not for the story (although having the Parrots as heroes is new alright) but for all the small details that concerns the scenery and the soundtrack..",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
OK cartoon!,"That in mind, there is more of 2011 I have yet to see, hence the so far bit, but I absolutely loved this movie after seeing it when it came out today. From the trailers and advertising it looked like a bright, breezy and entertaining animation, and in my mind it was much more than that. And I genuinely mean it when I say it is my favourite of the year so far, even surpassing the outstanding(if somewhat misunderstood) Rango.What I loved most about Rio was its energy. Rio for me has more energy than any of the Ice Age(from the same team) movies, and its energy is truly infectious at that. Two reasons especially make it so. One is the writing, I wasn't expecting the writing to be this sharp, funny and witty, looking at some of the previous work the writer has penned, while the jokes are plentiful and come by thick and fast. The other is the soundtrack. It has a huge amount of authentic Brazilian flavour and just ripples with zest. I loved the samba and bossa nova rhythms that pulsate throughout, and further fun is to be had in the Busby Berkeley-style beginning and the truly spectacular Carnaeval finale.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Who's a pretty bird?,"Combine the vivid colors of ""Finding Nemo"" with some of the plot devices of ""Up"" (most especially telling the backstory through a series of old photos and press clippings) and what do you get? Unfortunately, the combination results in a film not as memorable as either of those Pixar semi-classics. ""Rio"" like ""Avatar"" focuses on blue hued creatures hassled by evil humans (when did we get so self-hating?). Both films are also gorgeous to look at but revolve around only moderately interesting stories and a general lack of witty dialog. For example, despite the main character being a blue-colored macaw called ""Blu"", the film never goes for the obvious joke of another character mistakenly confusing him with a bluebird. The soundtrack also misses the chance to use the old Duran Duran song ""Rio"" or the old Judy Garland number ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" (blue birds fly). Instead the repetitive sounds of samba dominate the soundtrack and most audience members likely agree with Blu who expresses his distaste for Samba. In short, ""Rio"" looks gorgeous but lacks substance - rent any Pixar film instead.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Animated Avian Adventure,"As this animated film opens several birds, including a young Spix's macaw are captured in the rain forest outside Rio de Janeiro and taken to America. The young macaw's crate falls off the van in the snow blanketed town of Moose Lake in Minnesota. Here he is found and cared for by Linda, who calls him Blu. Fifteen years pass then Túlio Monteiro, an ornithologist from Rio turns up asking for Linda's help... Spix's macaws are critically endangered and he needs Blu to go to Rio and breed with Jewel, the last known female. The three of them fly there but Jewel and Blu don't initially hit it off... she is certainly unimpressed that he can't fly. This is the least of their problems though; they are stolen, and chained together by thieving bird smugglers and Nigel, their evil sulphur-crested cockatoo. They manage to escape but their adventure is far from over. Meanwhile Linda and Túlio learn of their disappearance and start searching for them; as do the smugglers.This film is quite different from the stories one gets from Disney/Pixar; it is brasher in style and a little cheeky at times. This isn't a criticism though; it provides plenty of good laughs, child-friendly thrills and a touch of romance... in other words something for everybody. The main characters are good; I liked how Blu and Jewel's relationship gradually develops and Linda and Túlio work together to find the birds without their relationship becoming obviously romantic. I was less amused by Pedro and Nico, to cliché comedy sidekicks who were more irritating than entertaining... of course they may appeal more to younger viewers who are the real target audience. The character designs were impressive and the animation was top notch. I loved the scenes were we fly through the jungle and soar above Rio; they were clearly designed to show case the film's 3D on the big screen but still work on a small TV screen. The voice cast, which includes Anne Hathaway and Jesse Eisenberg as Jewel and Blu, does a fine job bringing their characters to life. Overall I'd say that this is well worth a watch if you enjoy animation or are just looking for something that can be enjoyed by all the family.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rio (2011) - There's a Party Over Here in Rio!,"""Rio"" tells the story about a macaw bird named Blu, who meets the only female macaw of his species, and they both set out on a hilarious journey through Rio de Janeiro. Along the way, they meet some friendly faces, some not-so-friendly faces, and some rocking hilarious faces. And each step of the movie leads to the moral of the story where to believe who you are on the inside, instead of the outside. Now, the moral to my review, ""Rio"" rocked the house. It's one of the most excellent animated features I have ever seen this year that contains everything thing I want to see. With a rocking soundtrack filled with incredible music that's just enjoying to listen or sing along to, and we receive the incredible sights and sounds of Rio de Janeiro that it makes us feel like we are part of the celebration. The movie was a well-written comedy, with fantastic animation provided to bring the sight and sound of ""Rio"" to life. But mostly, the brilliant voice talent of a casting ensemble to die for, was an excellent addition to this movie. With the talented voices of Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, George Lopez, Jemaine Clement, Tracy Morgan, will.i.am, and Jamie Foxx. Like I said, the soundtrack is rocking, the sights and sounds are real, the acting is hilarious, and the movie comes up with so much hilarious elements, scene by scene. ""Rio"" is a whimsical, charming, hilarious, and excellent movie that I will cherish for a long time. ""Rio"", in my review, ""an entertaining celebration, and the perfect family movie"".",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Take me down to Rio, Rio","Wow! This is A first for me – a review of an animated movie. I truly enjoyed this film from many aspects: story, animation and performance. The performers did a wonderful job of bringing depth to the characters. This movie gets a green light from me. I really appreciate the work that went into making this movie. First the actors perform their lines sometimes by themselves, and then the animators take over and not only capture the movements of the animal but also the actors performance. If you are looking for a family movie that everyone can enjoy, take them down to Rio. Well, the movie Rio not the actual Rio, Rio.

The first cartoons were made for elementary schoolers and kindergarteners and were full of jokes of the same level (such as ""thong size forty (I don't remember what size)"" and a loud ""Beeeee!"" from one of the cartoon characters after eating or drinking something) .

Should please kids but no one else.,"'RIO': Two Stars (Out of Five)Another computer animated kids film from the director of 'ICE AGE' (and it's two sequels) Carlos Saldanha. This one tells the story of a Minnesota raised Macaw, who's afraid of flying, that's taken to Rio to mate with a female macaw in order to save their species. The film is written by Saldanha (who was born in Brazil) and six other writers and is said to be his ""dream project"". That's kind of sad considering the film isn't very good. It's beautiful to look at but it's also filled with cheap jokes and is rather boring and predictable. It should please kids but no one else.Jesse Eisenberg stars as the voice of Blu. Blu is a macaw who was born in Brazil but was captured, along with his family, by smugglers and shipped to Minnesota. The box that Blu was in fell off a shipping truck though and he was picked up by a small child named Linda, who named him. The movie then flashes forward 15 years when Blu is living with Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann) in a bookstore she owns. He still has not learned to fly but constantly attempts to teach himself. One day a Brazilian scientist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) comes to the door and asks to take Blu with him to Brazil in order to mate him with the last female macaw named Jewel (Anne Hathaway), in an attempt to save the species. Linda and Blu reluctantly go with Tulio to Brazil but once there Blu and Jewel are kidnapped by more smugglers.I don't usually see most animated kids films in the theater (or at all for that matter) unless they really look appealing or have gotten rave reviews (usually both). This film got decent reviews from critics and fans (not great but decent) and it also has been huge at the box office so I thought I'd give it a try. The film reminded me why I don't see most animated kids films; they're a waste of time and money (if you see them in the theater). Sure the computer animation looks beautiful but that's not enough to keep my interest and with this film I really had a hard time staying interested. I found my mind drifting a lot after witnessing repeated silly jokes and a completely uninvolving string of events (which is the movie's excuse for a story). I like Jesse Eisenberg (he's another reason I thought I might like the movie) and he does decent voice work here but all the supporting comedic players are so tired and played out (including George Lopez, Wanda Sykes, Jamie Foxx and Will i Am). The movie just has nothing of any interest or entertainment value to offer anyone over the age of ten (other than good visuals) and a decent kids film should.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBqNUf10kuk",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rio: A Musical Adventure That Will Have You Dancing in Your Seat,"Rio is an animated film that tells the story of a domesticated macaw named Blu who is unexpectedly taken to Rio de Janeiro to mate with the last female of his species. The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and lively animation that brings the city of Rio to life. The voice acting is also top-notch, with Jesse Eisenberg delivering a charming performance as the timid Blu and Anne Hathaway bringing warmth and heart to the role of Jewel, the wild bird he falls in love with.However, the film's plot is not as strong as its visuals. The story feels formulaic and predictable at times, with a number of cliche moments. Additionally, some of the humor falls flat and feels forced. Despite these shortcomings, the movie manages to be entertaining and fun, with a catchy soundtrack that will have audiences tapping their feet.

"My 410th Review: Great theme, but maybe not for the smallest kids?","Rio is brash, colorful, bold, and bouncy full of energy and drive and great characterization. It is a terrific theme: animal trafficking and embraces a very strong Eco message that is just wonderful.However, and it is a really big however, our kids did not enjoy it, for them the character of the baddie bird Nigel, is, without spoilers, just too much; they were just frightened and even though they like a little, this was too scary for them. At six, you'd think it'd be OK, but they just found it too much and it really ruined it for them.I guess this will work best with the tweenies - it's a shame the music and the humor are all good - and the fact that this is a real green movie is terrific; but I'll not be buying the DVD of this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
George Lopez Knows How To Make You Laugh,"This movie is about a blue macaw who is the last male of his kind. He travels with his owner Linda to Rio where the last female blue macaw lives. Some of the main characters in the movie are Blu, Jewel, and Rafael. Rafael is a toucan played by George Lopez. One of the best lines in the movie is when Blu is trying to fly and Rafael says, ""Alright Blu, you're flying! Sort of. Not really."" That is so funny. George Lopez has also played in another movie that I really loved called Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2. He always knows how to get the audience laughing.My favorite part of the movie is when Blu's owner Linda is waking up in the morning and is trying to turn her alarm off. When she thinks she has it off, all of a sudden she hears more loud noises and it turns out to be Blu!Every movie has to have a bad guy and this move is no exception. There are poachers that steal lots of different kinds of birds as well as their mean pet cockatoo Nigel who causes a lot of trouble throughout the movie. He also enlists the help of a group of monkeys that turn out to be no help to him at all. Another great part of the movie is when the birds and monkeys fight! It was a great action scene and of course the birds won.I would recommend this movie for all ages because it's such a good movie. There aren't really any scary parts and I think all ages would like it. Go out and see it in theaters when it premieres!Reviewed by Anthony Aranda, age 8, KIDS FIRST!

Blue the blue macaw,"Being kidnapped since he was a tiny blue macaw, an endangered bird species, he ends up in the hands of a caring, lonely girl, who raises him as her best friend. One day, a person specialized in birds comes to her door, asking her to come to Rio in order for Blue to meet a lady bird of his kind and hopefully repopulate. Thus, a big adventure starts, one in which three misfit bandits try to get their hands on the birds for a big amount of money.It's a wonderful animation which presents the life of Blue, how he's raised by his human friend and how he meets Jewel, a beautiful female macaw, with a mentality on the opposite end of his. Their adventures are well described, with much emotion, managing to maintain interest throughout its entire length. I have to say that the start is a bit slow and somehow rushed, but from there on, laughter and good will are due to form a great atmosphere from which you don't to exit. I must also mention that this move is really hilarious, being able to make you laugh pretty often, making the overall experience a real treat. The story isn't fabulous, but it does its job well, making enough room for its characters to display whatever they desire, and they do it with style and plenty of fun. As you would expect, the animation is top notch, a true delight for your eyes, especially when it presents complex, far away scenery, made almost specifically to impress.Overall, I found a very good animation, which has a good story, great characters, looks amazing and makes you laugh quite out loud from time to time.

Rio,"This Blue-Sky studio animation is a genuine energizer for the spring time here in Shanghai, saw the 3D-version in the cinema and even one week before its northern America release.The fun is literally tangible, although the whole story is a standard mainstream Hollywood product, the twist-and-turn is perfectly calculated to meet the expectations of both children and adult audience, which sadly enough though, also means that it is too naive to believe in something surprisingly overjoyed would occur. There is no doubt this one will grab tons of money in the market and further set up a great mouth-of-praise for Blue-sky Studio and shows the world beside ICE AGE franchise, they are truly capable of being a potential competitor of Pixar.The 3D effect is more like an appendix due to the fact that the all the adorable characters alone is sufficient to keep us embedded in our seats for a fleeting 90 minutes, the Rio de Janeiro location and Carnival also help to relish the whole process.The voice cast is superb especially Jesse Eisenberg, his distinctively geeky register and drumfire speed is the highlight, by comparison, Anne Hathaway's tone is nothing particular, sidekicks Will i Am and Jamie Foxx attribute their competent effort in rapping and singing respectively.I call it an almost-perfect-manufactured animation, however, RIO is not valiant enough to bring any groundbreaking revolution into the status-quo (as it had the chance to do so), for example, eventually our unusual non-flying macaw Blu has to accomplish the final rescue of his apple-of-the-eye by taking his first flying and the epiphany comes just on time! Why not keep Blu as a unique as he is? You don't need to do anything to prove to be who you are, right? Because you are who you are! So for me the most memorable quote in the film is I HATE SAMBA, BECAUSE THEY ALL SOUND SAME TO ME!

A triumph of a film that even matches Toy Story 3 in perfection!,"Rio is simply a spectacular film that does everything right, and is likely the best animated film that we've seen since last year's incredible 'Toy Story 3', or even this year's 'Rango'.The movie has the great starting quality of having an all-star cast assembled. We have Anne Hathaway, Tracey Morgan, George Lopez, Jesse Eisenburg (The Social Network) and others to keep us entertained. They all turn in fun, enjoyable performances. Definitely a nice job on casting.The animation...This is made by the guys who made Ice Age. The one redeeming quality of the latest Ice Age movies is the AWESOME animation. This movie ups the anty even more. Many shots are full of rich colors, providing great visuals and it provides a nice background for the characters to explore and run through.The plot...Eh. It's basically a ""last of species"" kind of movie. Basically, the main character Blu is the last male of his species, the Blue McCaw, and he has to...Reproduce with a female blue McCaw, who isn't fond of him at the start. While not a completely original plot, it is an entertaining one and it keeps you interested throughout.The biggest part of the movie, however, is THE CHARACTERS. Never have I seen a movie that provides so many likable characters. From the very moment we see Blu, we're introduced to unique, fun, zany and extremely likable characters. By the end, it gives a sense that you care about the characters you're seeing, which is always a plus in any movie. However, the human characters are extremely undeveloped throughout, and feel stale and out-of-place with the main plot by the end of the film.This film also has the decency to feature...Songs. While some can be quiet random and out-of-place, will.i.am and Jamie Foxx put on an AWESOME song performance halfway through the movie. It feels like a Black Eyed Peas song, yet has a great Samba touch to it. While I can't say I enjoy Samba too much, the songs in this movie are fun and get stuck in your head real good.One more thing I need to add is the main villain in this movie...The main villain is a down-on-his-luck cockatoo who used to star in action movies, who has an almost devilish French accent and speech, and is almost like a James Bond villain...I don't know about you, but that is freaking' AWESOME...Overall, Rio is definitely a fun movie.

However the voice acting is fairly decent but that is it. The dialouge is terrible and just downright corny. The directer was obviously not paying attention when he made this abomination. This film had no redeeming qualities and belongs in the 4.99 bin. Another bad thing about this was the awful musical numbers. I have seen worse films but this still goes on my least favorite films of all time. Do not waste your time on this pitiful excuse for a movie.

Rio; A Children's advocate and naturalist's perspective,"My wife and I saw the animated movie, Rio, Friday night. We went to the 2-D version. As entertainment, we really enjoyed it and highly recommend it.With our interest in children, nature, birds, specifically macaws, the movie did pretty good, with two sloppy biological errors. Rio is of course animated entertainment, not a National Geographic documentary, but Rio did touch upon two side stories; Black market parrot trade, and the blight so many children of Rio live in.You've probably heard that ""Rio"" is about a pet Macaw from Minnesota that ends up in Rio de Janeiro. There, to be bred with ""the last if their species"".Naturalist's perspective: Maybe we missed it, but we never heard the species of this macaw mentioned, despite the main human character being a researcher.There are 23 species of macaw parrots (7 extinct), all found in South America and Central America. There are four species of macaws that are commonly referred to as the Great Blues. One has been extinct since 1960. The largest blue macaw, the Blue Hyacinth, is classified as vulnerable, but can still be found in the wild.One assumes the movie is referring to the Spix macaw. Named after the German naturalist, Johann Baptist von Spix, this macaw truly is critically endangered. The leading book about it, ""Spix's Macaw"" by Tony Juniper, tells the interesting, tragic story. (Wikipedia: ""List of macaws"") While parrots are not as a group, tropical birds, just as the rainforest is the most diverse ecosystem, more parrots species are found in the rainforest then elsewhere. All macaw parrots are rainforest parrots.As more/most pet macaws are hatched in pet industry breeding programs, reducing the impact on wild flocks, the Spix macaw is not surviving well. Because macaws are the largest parrots on the whole, as a group, they are all challenged because it's hard for these large birds to find large nesting cavities as deforestation continues.The Spix macaw was always located only in a very small area of South America. Then as Europeans came to the New World and started grabbing macaws from the wild for display and as pets, the Spix macaw started disappearing in the wild. Poaching continues. Since 2000, the Spix is considered extinct in the wild.Almost none of this came through the entertaining and colorful movie other than the main characters, Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway), are the last of their kind, and the researchers want to breed these two. To make an entertaining storyline conflict, while Blu quickly gets enamored when he meets Jewel, Jewel has other priorities; to escape back to the wild.Child advocate view: Which brings in the second side story; (spoiler) a street child, Fernando (Jake T. Austin), who has no family, is the one who steals the two blue macaws from the research breeding program. Of course he's stealing them because such activity is his only source of income for this hopeless boy who lives in a shack in the rooftops of Rio. There he watches Rio's extravagant high-income people spending money like Carnival confetti. As you'll expect, in the end, Fernando redeems himself in helping to get the two macaws back.SLOPPY BIOLOGICAL BLOOPERS: 1. Early scene; Blu's owner gives Blu his morning cup of hot chocolate. The writers could have had fun with this scene in many ways since parrots eat so many things that people eat, EXCEPT chocolate is poisonous to parrots! They should have used some other food item. 2. Parrot feet. Rio uses semi-realistic animation style. People had four fingers and thumb, not Mickey Mouse three-fingers-plus thumb. Feather details throughout the movie. You can see rust on a truck's license plate! Being realistic animation, how could the illustrators make the parrots three toes, instead illustrated with parrot's incredible hand-functioning, two-toes-forward, two-toes-back? Can't the animators count? VERY sloppy, and missing out on a fun opportunity.OVERVIEW: It was a very fun, beautiful, funny, touching, full of music, entertaining movie that we highly recommend. - The bottom line for us is we hope more people think about and get involved with children's programs; locally, and worldwide, --And learn a little about the threat of species such as macaws, so that people will become open to learning about this arguably, most intelligent species on the planet (including humans). -For more, visit PiratesAndParrots.com and , Wikipedia: ""List of macaws"".",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
THE GREATEST MOVIE ALL TIME,"Like many, we stopped staying at the Rio back in the early 2000's; it was so disappointing watching our favorite hotel/casino being driven into the ground.HOWEVER, after learning The Rio is under new management and is going through a major renovation, we decided to return after a 15-20yr hiatus and couldn't be more excited to share our experience!First, with the new kiosks, check in took us less than 5 min - we were surprised more guests weren't using themThe renovated rooms are fabulous! Ignore the naysayers, these rooms provide ample space, sitting area with a couch and bar height table/chairs. The beds are VERY comfortable and we slept great each night!We never had a bad meal! Luckily Tavern and Voodoo were evening favs and Go Go Hash for breakfast, yum! And where else would you find a vending machine offering delicious slices of cake - you gotta try this cake!We spent time out at the pool and again, experienced more great service! The pool area has plenty of chairs and reasonably priced frozen cocktails. Jose, the bartender was hilarious and so friendly. We found out he's actually been with the Rio for over 30yrs?!Lastly, we had a blast at the tables each night! The atmosphere in the casino is high energy and low pretentiousness. You know it's a great casino when the dealers and pit boss crews are smiling, enjoying and engaging with guests. We decided we didn't want to gamble anywhere else!Given the off-strip location, you just can't beat The Rio. You can tell they are dedicated to becoming a resort of choice, they have certainly convinced me to return after all these years! Can't wait to come back once all the renovations are complete, The Rio is, once again, our favorite!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best Movie of the Year!,"This movie is already on top of my all-time favorite list for animations. It is colorful, very funny, and did I mention about the local Carioca (which means from Rio) scenery, it is gorgeous! The Carnaval scenes were so real, I felt I was part of the party. The music was beautiful and energetic. It demonstrated in several ways how rich and fun Brazilian music is. The story is simple, maybe even predictable, but the characters are well developed and again, extremely fun to watch. So if you want to have a wonderful time at the movies, especially with your kids and family, this movie is a ""must go""! A jewel not to be missed! The 3D version with digital sound is the clear best choice.Have fun in Rio!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not worth looking,"This movie combines most things that are bad about movies:Story A complete flat and thousands of times all-the-same-story that develops in every moment like you know it would. No surprises and in fact you know from the start how it would end.Stereotypical role models The main male characters are dumb, have no idea about love and stumble through life led by a brave and intelligent woman. the female characters are bright, handsome, but just wait to fall in love withe the dumb male.Bad Soundtrack Come on. This soundtrack is bad. The songs in the movie are bad. Just ""big"" names (Will.I.Am) and really no soul, heart and art behind it. It sounds like modern very bad musical.Bad characters No development, stereotypical (even the dog) and sometimes disgusting instead of funny (the dog). Typical black and white. This time: good birds against bad monkeys. Not even the boy, which could have a really interesting role, was developed. Just going from bad to good in an eye blink.3D Many scenes are typical enhanced 3D scenes, that make no sense, but look good in a cinema.What was good about the movie? Animations were nice (not great). And the voice actors were pretty OK. And if you like a love story, there it is.Really, a waste of time.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Vibrantly brilliant,"I'm always apprehensive about watching an animated movie instead of real life movies. But off late this is turning out the other way. While most of real movies get mundane and depressing. These genre is just getting better and really doing justice to the 3D.Anyway, back to Rio, i thought it was brilliant. Very vibrant, colorful and thoroughly entertaining. One line to describe it"" Mood Elevating"".the soundtrack was satisfactory, couple of tracks were outstanding.

This movie will make you dance!,"I've read critiques reviews of this movie giving it low grade of a C. But I ignored the critiques because they have no clue what they are talking about- Seriously this movie is awesome, not amazing though. There's a difference. Some parts are a little meh but they are so few and far between- Rio managed to become a movie that I surprisingly fell in love with.My favorite characters are that small bird and that fat red bird- which names escape me now. Oh and the guy who looks JUST like the DAD from Coraline- really he DID Lmao and acted like a younger version of him. Then that very minor character of the night guard, cause he was SUCH a Bear lol.The songs really pull this movie together truly and not only that but the mixture of kid and adult humor (though one scene was SO weird and awkward towards the end). My favorite songs are the main title song and the one where Anne Hathaway goes Yayayayayayayayaya yaaaaa. Everyone in the thearte almost danced- but the little kids couldn't help it and did.Another small negative is the running time- or maybe just the pacing. But I didn't notice it too much. Rio is a great family movie, Rio I think is a great movie if you want to have FUN at a cinema instead of nitpicking on things that don't really matter. I found this movie to be better than Despicable Me.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Forgettable animated blunder,"With a lack of charm or any originality, Rio follows basic animated film tropes to get to its destination- never really finding itself along the way. As a kid I remember loving this movie when it came out, and as I rewatched it, I remembered very very little about anything that went on- and honestly will probably forget by tomorrow. The film is just as generic as most animated films come nowadays, and its whitewashed cast in Brazil of all places feels quite out of line and ingenuine- an excuse for profit and not really any quantity. I like the dynamic between the birds and the humans at the beginning, but it soon takes a much distanced back seat from each other as the two are separated and neither corresponding storyline are nearly as interesting, amusing, or entertaining. I like some of the lighting in the film, and some of the ideas are cool. I have to admit I kinda enjoyed Tracy Morgan as a bulldog and there was one good joke that made me laugh, but for the most part it feels like it tries way too hard to stand out and consequently feels as average as ever. Heck, even half the designs of the birds in the opening and closing scenes feel like they were just copy and pasted with different colors on them. It's quite frustrating, cause I do feel with the talent involved and the world they created they could have made something really unique with Rio but sadly that's just not the case. In the end, Rio flies about as high as flightless birds, never making its marks, despite always trying.My Rating: 3.3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A great, colorful animation","""Rio"", a new animated movie from the creators of ""Ice Age"", became very popular recently. It doesn't surprise me - in my opinion, this is one of the best animations of these times. Neither children nor adults will be bored watching it - kids will adore the characters and pleasant for the eye graphics, while their parents will enjoy the humor and music... but everyone loves the wonderful colors and beautiful views on Rio de Janeiro, of course! My opinion overall is very positive. The movie contains some funny scenes (for example - birds' party!) as well as some nice songs; it has a really great climate.I hope they will create more movies like ""Rio"". This film is a step forward in the technology and style of computer animations.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic display of creativity!,"The plot itself may not seem very interesting. But believe me, the way it is executed will make you feel good, sad, like dancing, and even laughing out loud.The animations are fantastic. The soundtrack is beyond great. Plenty of catchy tunes. The humor is witty but fits perfect with all audiences.The situations not only deal about the adventures of two birds, no, it also deals with Brazilian way of living, favelas, love, demonstrating guts in the right moment, and more.The 3D is also very good although not necessary.I can say that this is the best animated feature of the year so far. Give it a chance. It's not predictable, in fact, it's very creative. Feels like fresh air for cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
'Jewel' is appropriate.,"The 'Ice Age' series may be wildly popular but it has done little to bestow prestige upon Blue Sky Studios, whose only other notable credits include the under appreciated 'Robots' (2005) and the more recent 'Horton Hears A Who', which has remained in the public consciousness in anticipation of the release of 'The Lorax' (2012). For this reason I was, somewhat unfairly, not anticipating great things from 'Rio', a polar opposite of Sid, Manny and Diego's prehistoric adventures that takes place in the Brazilian city.A dazzling, bold palette characterises the feature, bringing outstanding visuals to each and every frame, whether it be taking place in the natural beauty of the jungle or the dull city slums, evoking a childlike sense of awe for bright, block colours. It is a firm reminder that not all animation studios need render their work in breathtaking detail when there are far simpler (and instantly better looking) tools at their disposal.However much the main storyline is a by the numbers retread of similar works which feature a rare animal breed targeted by opportunist crime lords, there is a unique spin in pitting the domesticated blue macaw (aptly named Blu) against the wild Jewel, resulting in a hilarious dynamic that almost defies the inevitable direction their character development takes. Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway lead the superb voice talent, featuring a stellar billing in which even the polarising 'Black Eyed Peas' star will.i.am proves he is an appropriate addition. Blue Sky displayed excellent restraint in their celebrity casting, and is one of several aspects that give 'Rio' a great sense of authenticity in its well-trained Brazilian accents, alongside the accurate visuals.A constantly witty script, funny jokes and a lively soundtrack make 'Rio' a memorable family movie and a deserving breakout hit for its studio, who have given themselves a fine opportunity to establish another successful franchise.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Phenomenal,"Whenever I decide to do a review about a movie, I always like to look at the ""Loved it"" reviews, and the ""Hated it"" reviews. The fact that I saw 43 ""Hated it"" reviews astonished me. However, most of them said almost the exact same thing, ""Cliche... Predictable... Unoriginal..."" Anyone who reads these reviews will undoubtedly expect the bad things, but now to give my point of view and hopefully make up some people's minds about this movie. First off, when I first saw this movie, I noticed the vivid color and amazing scenery portrayed right off the bat.In the beginning you are introduced to Rio in it's natural habitat and then you are introduced to Blu, who is captured and shipped to a town in Minnesota. He is found by a young girl, Linda, and she vows to take care of the little Blue Macaw. This is where the true adventure begins because it shows Blu's normal life, and in a flash Blu is traveling towards a 'foreign' land known as Rio De Janeiro. Linda is running her book store as usual, when a man approaches her and after much convincing and begging he gets Linda to consider his proposal to keep Blu's species alive.Once I saw how Rio is portrayed I was stunned and completely awestruck at the detail, roads, and beaches; almost identical to the actual city itself. As said in the beginning of the movie, Blu is the last male of his kind and just recently they have found the last female of his kind as well. As the usual love story goes the relationship between Blu and his new female counterpart, Jewel, is rough, but through an extraordinary adventure of meeting two hip-hop birds, a very helpful toucan, and a drooling dog, Jewel and Blu experience Samba, hang- gliding, and riding on a trolley at sunset.There is only one bad thing that I could find with this movie, and that is when the adventure is over, I didn't want it to end. With this movie you get a connection with the characters and feel as if you were actually on the journey. All the way to the last credit in the movie I couldn't wait to watch the movie the next night. There were absolutely no flaws and the music was very catchy and mesmerizing, especially the samba song.However, if someone were to ask me if there should be a ""Rio 2"", I would have to say no. This movie could not have been any more perfect. I feel a sequel would only end with people having a bad taste in their mouth, but I could be wrong. I would see the sequel, and who knows maybe I would be just as surprised as the first time I saw this movie. I hope this review is helpful and I hope that if you had any hesitation for seeing the movie before that you have made up your mind. This movie is a high recommendation by me.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun filled , Adventurous Journey !","When I went to the theater today to watch Rio, I really had no clue as to what the movie was or would be like... The movie began and there were my favorite Macaw birds dancing , chirping and flying in such vibrant colors that I lay there gazing at the screen in awe. As the movie continued there were many ups and downs, but what I liked the most, were the funny scenes included in every nook and corner of the 96 min movie, which always kept us laughing as gazing even in the most tense situations. The amazing color, texture and brightness to the carnival scenes of Rio De Janerio could not have been brought out perfectly if the movie had been in 2D. The effects and detailing to the movie need a special mention. Every scene was carried out with perfection by the skilled animators of the Blue Sky Studios. Next come the punch lines. Usually animations contain fillers and extra dialogs to continue the movie but in Rio its the exact opposite, the dialogs were so perfectly timed and written that I could not stop laughing at them! Whatever was done for the movie was done in perfection. Though the movie wasn't properly advertised, I still believe it will get a hue turn up for what it has to offer to the audience. I recommend people of all age groups to watch it at least one necessarily in 3D to get the full excitement and fun in an adventurous way... Adeus and have fun...!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie does NOT take flight,"Director Carlos Saldanha's 2011 animated feature, ""Rio,"" is a carnival of clichés and a cacophony of missed opportunities. This avian adventure, set against the vibrant backdrop of Rio de Janeiro, attempts to soar to cinematic heights but ultimately crashes and burns in a flurry of uninspired storytelling and lackluster execution.From the very first frame, ""Rio"" fails to break free from the constraints of its predictability. The plot, which revolves around a rare, domesticated blue macaw named Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg), feels like a regurgitation of every animated animal adventure that came before it. The narrative follows the tired formula of a fish-out-of-water story, as Blu finds himself out of his element in the wilds of Rio after a mishap during an attempt to save his species.Despite the film's exotic setting, the potential for cultural richness is squandered in a flurry of superficial stereotypes and clichés. The characters, while visually colorful, lack depth and are reduced to one-dimensional caricatures that do little to engage the audience emotionally. The attempt to infuse cultural elements into the story often feels forced and contrived, reducing Rio's vibrant culture to mere set dressing.The humor in ""Rio"" is equally lackluster, relying heavily on tired and formulaic gags that fall flat. The attempts at witty banter and comedic timing lack the sophistication seen in other successful animated features. The supporting characters, including a sassy jewel (voiced by Anne Hathaway) and a group of samba-dancing birds, are forgettable and fail to leave a lasting impression.While the film boasts a soundtrack filled with lively Brazilian beats, even the music cannot save it from its overall mediocrity. The vibrant visuals and energetic dance sequences are not enough to distract from the film's fundamental flaw-an uninspired and formulaic plot that lacks the depth and originality needed to stand out in the crowded animated film landscape.""Rio"" may have fluttered into theaters with the promise of a colorful spectacle, but it quickly loses its feathers in a sea of forgettable animated features. Saldanha's attempt to capture the spirit of Rio de Janeiro falls short, leaving audiences with a film that is as forgettable as it is formulaic. In a world where animated films have the power to transcend age and captivate audiences, ""Rio"" fails to take flight, destined to be lost in the crowded aviary of animated mediocrity.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Great movie!,"One of the best animated movies I have seen in a while! Lots of beautiful animation and likable characters! Jesse Eisenberg was great as Blu, the domesticated Spix's Macaw! The plot was predictable, but it doesn't make a difference as all the characters were likable, the animation was, once again, awesome, and the action never stopped! The estimated 90 minutes that I watched this movie flew by! I am 15 and I went to see it with my other reluctant friends, but afterwards we all had a great opinion of this movie! If you asked me what my favorite part of this movie would have been, I'd probably not be able to answer, as there was so much going on in this movie, it would be too hard of a decision. I saw this movie because I grew up with the Ice Age movies and also loved Robots!

My Parrots LOVE this!!,"First off I must say ""Rio"" is highly entertaining, imaginative & overall it is FUN! I have an adopted pair of Plum Head parakeets, & when I first watched this film on a Sunday afternnon on tv, my birds were having a very loud argument (screeching fit) but just 10 minutes in they were silent with their eyes glued to the TV, actually watching it, so I bought the DVD & if I must go out, I put this film on to entertain them! The research into how parrots act & move was done very well ( I have rescued parrots all my life) & very acurate. For instance when Blu is angry in one scene his tail feathers are splayed wide. But I did find it sad that said research failed when it came to birds diet, as chocolate is deadly poison to birds.The character development is good, there is a slight back story & there are even some terrific one liners like ""Your burgled baubles bore me"" which gave me a giggle. All the voice acting is excellent but I feel the villan development was lacking slightly. Now in this present mass media climate of PC cultural overload in most movies pushing a harmful socialist agenda, the message in Rio is one I agree strongly with, which is parrot conservation & blue Macaws are on the edge of extinction & this movie highlights what is a very real struggle to save the blue Macaws In Rio its presented, tactfully wrapped in an entertaining story, which I really enjoyed. I feel people of all ages will enjoy this movie",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
14 and loved it.... predictable and adorable,"This is without a doubt the most predictable movie on earth, but i don't care, this is so cute. so adorable. and the animation is beautiful. this is truly a masterpiece. yes, its predictable (I could guess what they were gonna see) but it is so much fun!!! The movie focuses on Blu, the last male blue macaw who lives in moose lake with his nerdy owner Linda. he loves his life there, is pure domesticated, but cannot fly. He is wanted in Rio Di Janeiro (i cant spell it!) to mate with Jewel, the last female blue macaw. this is just good fun, teaches great life lessons, and the scenery of Rio is absolutely amazing especially the statue of Jesus standing on the island. I love the idea of the gliders are a way to way fly, that was beautifully done. the characters are great, George Lopez as the toucan, Jesse Esseinberg as Blu, Anne Hathaway as jewel, Luiz the dog is great, and the humans are nicely done. I also like how this film focuses on some poor life in Brazil but does not overdo it to make it scary for children. it focuses on animal trafficking, a huge problem in Brazil, and a main character named Fernando is a young boy who is an orphan and has no one to go to, lives on the streets, and turns to crime for money. but he is such a likable character and gets so much sympathy. I am 14 and laughed at this movie, the whole time.... okay it was hysterical. so did my best friend who i went to see it with. so all you haters who think this doesn't deserve a 7.4, back off, because it certainly does. worth a watch for sure!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Colorful, Vibrant, and Entertaining","The last two blue macaw birds, one a sheltered domestic pet taken from the jungles of Brasil to Minnesota as a young bird and the other a free- spirit yearning to live out in the open, must fall in love and procreate to avoid the extinction of their species. This is not a revolutionary plot, but the magic of Brasil, and most specifically Rio de Janeiro come to life in the film.From the opening scene you have a perfectly crafted view of Rio, then the opening song Real in Rio full of color and it is truly engaging. Blu, the last male blue macaw, is taken from Rio and brought to the United States. He falls of the truck and young Linda takes him in. Fifteen years later he is domesticated and prefers the indoor life. When it is discovered that he can save his species, Linda and Blu travel to Brasil with Tulio to meet Jewel, the last female blue macaw. They are eventually stolen from their habitat, where the story begins. We follow Blu and Jewel as they try to navigate to different destinations: Blu to Linda and Jewel to the wild. With the help of other birds, and a dog named Luis, we follow their entertaining journey as well as Linda and Tulio's journey to find the two birds.The visuals were stunning and Rio was perfectly taken from the real world and placed almost identically into the animated world. The music was refreshing and anyone who knows Brazilians or Brazilian culture, specifically that of Rio, will love the inside jokes. I will say that I never had much intention to watch this film, despite enjoying the Brazilian culture. However, I was talked into it and I'm really glad.

Rio de Generic,"""Rio"" is one for the kiddies, so you'll have to forgive this childless twenty-something for feeling at odds with the target audience. The theater was stuffed with tykes with mouths agape—whispering, screaming, and coughing. I have no idea if that means they were enjoying it. From an adult perspective, this anthropomorphic epic isn't necessarily a painful endurance test, but unlike Nickelodeon's ""Rango,"" there isn't a single compelling reason to recommend it to anyone over the age of 12.The voice cast is unsurprisingly stacked with actors in vogue looking to score an easy paycheck. Jesse Eisenberg channels his innermost neurosis as Blu, our fine, feathered protagonist with a fear of flying. Leslie Mann plays his owner Linda, a bookish Minnesotan who is coerced into schlepping her beloved pet to the eponymous South American city in order to have him (ahem) mate with the only known female of his kind.If you've ever been subjected to children's programming, you may know the cadence that most of the cast adopts. Sentences delicately spill from animated lips with careful annunciation of each syllable, lest anyone fall behind. There are a couple of legitimately impressive performances, including Jemaine Clement of ""Flight of the Conchords"" fame as a conniving cockatoo, and Tracy Morgan from ""30 Rock"" as an oversensitive bulldog. Rounded out by the likes of Will i Am and Jamie Foxx, ""Rio"" draws from a pool of veteran vocal performers.And if the above talent didn't tip you off, I regretfully inform you that ""Rio"" fancies itself a musical. Doubtless spurred by the success of ""Happy Feet,"" every so often the characters break into exuberant song, which is even more grating than their unhurried dialogue.The archetypical adventure plays out predictably. Blu doesn't exactly hit it off with Jewel (Anne Hathaway), his undomesticated mate—but the two are birdnapped and find love as they find their way home together. Granted, it's a proved template, but to use the oeuvre of Pixar as a counter-point, there's plenty of wiggle-room to establish identity within the stringent confines of a narrative 'sure thing.' Even when Pixar isn't pushing boundaries, its creative shepherds generally recognize the chasm that separates the kiddie crowd from general audience.Not that there's anything wrong with catering a cartoon to children, but even under those auspices, I can only recommend ""Rio"" to, what, 15% of the population? Probably none of whom are reading this review. Parents have my condolences if they're dragged to this utterly uninteresting animated flick, though history is fraught with worse cinematic prison sentences.It's hard to outright hate ""Rio"" given that I am almost two decades the elder of its target audience, and childless to boot. Thus, my window into its appeal is either long-since closed or not-yet open. As a fan of animation, however, I can safely assert that grown ups need not apply. If readymade heartstring pluckers like lost pets and orphans get you all gooey-eyed, maybe ""Rio"" will speak to you—but my sense is that most of us are calloused to such obvious emotional exploitation.As for the twelve and unders—their reaction was tough to gauge amid the chorus of whispers, shrieks, and hacking coughs. They all pretty much sat still and watched the damn movie. That must count for something.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

An amiable outing,"""Rio"" is not terrible like more recent Dreamworks movies where the animated movies always have to depend on star power and pop culture references for laughs, but their stories aren't as convincing as those of Pixar movies. Like most spring movies, ""Rio"" is fine for an outing, but it is not the kind of movie I would put in my DVD collection.The best thing about Rio is the colors, the realistic animated backgrounds of the South American tourist city which also includes the slums as well as the beaches we love to see ourselves at, and a few good musical numbers, including the song that goes ""I Want to Party, I Want to Samba,"" by Jamie Foxx and Will I Am, who play two birds held in captivity who entertain the other birds. Otherwise, I would say that the story is formulaic and predictable, and we've seen many of these movies before.The story goes that Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg from the brilliant ""The Social Network"") a nerdy domesticated macaw dropped off in Minnesota from a truck on the streets, enjoys his companionship with his owner Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann), and has never learned to fly. A Brazilian ornithologist named Tulio (voiced by Rodrigo Santoro) comes to town and wants to bring Blu back to Brazil to mate with the other remaining macaw from the country, the independent Jewel (voiced by Anne Hathaway). They get down there during Carnaval season, Blu meets Jewel, but sure enough, they are kidnapped by nasty bird smugglers, but make escapes to various parts of the city. It always appears that villains steal the show in otherwise middle-of-the-road movies, and that villain is the smugglers' cockatoo pet Nigel (voiced by Jemaine Clement, who does the best work), who gets more into the action and smuggling than the humans themselves.Linda and Blu are separated from two-thirds of the movie. She and Tulio are looking for Blu, who is now with the smugglers and Jewel. During the adventures, there are friends who aid in returning Blu to his owner, such as a funny bulldog named Luis (voiced by comedian Tracy Morgan), a wisecracking toucan named Rafael (voiced by comedian George Lopez), and two rapping birds played by Will I Am and Jamie Foxx. Recently they performed that party/samba number on ""American Idol,"" and they did better on that show than in the movie. Then there are ugly, thieving monkeys who Nigel enlists the aid of to find Blu and Jewel in their escapes.As stated earlier the story follows the formula of most animated movies. Couple meets cute. Couple gets into danger. Then then male bird returns to its owner, and marries the female, producing their own birds. Villains lose and get locked up. Note that Rodrigo, a poor kid, reluctantly works for the smugglers, and would rather be with Linda and Tulio, as he searches back for the macaws. He just kidnaps the macaws just for the money, but the smugglers won't let him get away with that.In my years of seeing animated movies, I have to say that the Pixar movies are by far the best. They don't depend on clichés and formulas, like Rio. Even the first Ice Age Movie, made by the makers of ""Rio"" didn't depend on these elements. They don't look for star power and pop culture, like Dreamworks does all of the time in recent years. However, ""Rio"" goes slightly above Dreamworks, but still falls into the predictability cliché department. The backgrounds and colors make up the most for the movie, but the plot and character development is just about everything we have seen before as well. Fine for an outing, but not one of the best movies I have seen.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Colorful but unremarkable,"So mediocre that it's almost an achievement. Almost.Blue Sky Studios (Ice Age, Robots, Horton Hears a Who!) has some great animators, and their latest film, Rio , is nothing if not full of deliciously curvy character designs and a color palette that is at times sweetly saturated with deep hues, but it's clear that film's budget went primarily to wrangling a celebrity cast and writing some catchy songs. The animation noticeably cuts corners at times—character models are often under-animated and overused, and there's a stifling sense of formulaic rigidity to the whole thing.It's unoffensive, though. Rio is the kind of animated film that easily entertains and placates kids for its running time. However, I must encourage parents to consider whether or not that's really such a good thing. In an age when animated films are popular and great films are produced with considerable regularity (Coraline, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, Pixar films in general not to mention Disney's commitment to localizing Studio Ghibli films), why settle for mediocre?",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rio,"What is it that drives audiences to a movie? Word of mouth? Arguably, yes. Box office intake? Rarely. Awards Buzz? Sometimes. But advertising is the main thing that drives audiences to a new movie. I must confess that Rio, today's film I'm reviewing, suffers from the same problem as the earlier released Paul, advertising that makes it look like crap. And even though it wasn't as good as Paul, Rio is a solid movie with heart and humor.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Underrated, But Blue Sky Delivers and Soars Into New Territory!","I have many things to talk about regarding ""Rio,"" and I think I know what's best to say in two words: Brilliant execution.Now for the movie itself, the plot of bringing a domesticated bird from America back to his native hometown in Brazil to preserve its species was not what I expected at first, but now I'm completely mesmerized by how we got to know the interesting human and animal characters, the amazing Brazilian setting, and a couple music numbers with South American samba flair.The voice actors were chosen well, Oscar nominees Jesse Eisenberg (voicing male Macaw Blu) and especially Anne Hathaway (voicing female Macaw Jewel) brilliantly proving that she has the vocals to pull off a stunning music performance. Most might have heard her demonstrate her singing talent at the Academy Awards, but this movie is living proof that acting is not the only thing she's good at anymore.After watching this movie for the first time in theaters and then seeing it again on its DVD release, Blue Sky has demonstrated that they can divert themselves away from their ""Ice Age"" franchise from time to time and deliver a marvelous new story filled with joy, sympathy, and quirks you can't help but follow along. Director Carlos Saldanha has given us a dose of what his hometown in Brazil is like and its tranquility (via CGI) is very engaging. Their research was done really well and hoping to see more of this again and again. For a non-Disney film, I'm giving Blue Sky a chance and saying that their team has pulled off - which perhaps looks like - THE BIRTH OF A NEW FRANCHISE!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The exotic locations of the film are enough to get me to watch a demo reel, but the script and dialogue are far from coherent.","Giving it a second chance, I really wanted to love this movie.From now on, I'm going to try a different format of reviewing. I'll see how it goes.Plot:It's a forced romance story. Haven't seen this a million times, right? Oh, and a cliché villain with no character is thrown in to give the movie drama.Characters:The main characters are really likable, especially Linda. Blu and Jewel's relationship shows a standard forced love story, but I suppose it works for the plot. Other than that, the rest of the characters are terrible. The villains are completely obvious and stereotypical. They have no unique personality... or anything. It's actually hard for me to describe how they acted. I even forgot their names.Visuals:The visuals are what make the movie. The beautiful scenery of Rio de Janeiro is what gives the movie it's core appeal. That's what my family was talking about when we left the theater. Just like how Disney's The Lion King was a break-through in hand-drawn animation, this film is how all animated CGI films should look. Simple as that.Enjoyment:It was really hard getting around the cringe-inducing dialogue and terrible secondary-characters, but if you can get past it, it is rather enjoyable. The side-characters are pretty much what really killed it for me. If they were different or not in the movie at all, this film would get another star rate from me.Rewatchability:This is one of those animated movies you see on Netflix and just skip past it to see what else is available. It's only good to see if you want to say you saw it. Just go to the real Rio de Janeiro to see the movie in 3-D.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A flawed but Fun Movie,"I'm probably being too nice on the rating for this movie, it probably deserves more of a 7. It does have flaws, the biggest one being the fact that the film is extremely predictable, I knew exactly how the movie was going to end by the time the movie got to twenty minutes. However that's the only really big flaw, true some of the characters I didn't care about, and one of the songs is, well, stupid, but I can forgive those because I was having a good time.I really enjoyed the two leads, and the voice acting by Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway is really good. The villain's fun too, and has a really good back story, unfortunately the song he sings to describe it isn't. I enjoyed the humans, but if they weren't in the movie I wouldn't really care. And the comic reliefs were, actually funny.The animation is absolutely gorgeous, where Rango has outstanding detail, Rio has so many colors, that it's a feast for the eyes.And the songs, are really good, save for the villains, my only problem, they're a little short.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Guess what happens next!  Oh wait, you know, don't you.","I don't think anyone would deny that although there was a time when almost every animated film that came out was at least good and creative and had some great songs, that time is gone. And ""Rio"" doesn't help the cause very much.With a very weak, almost-not-there-yet-still-incredibly-predictable-story, ""Rio"" focuses on Blu, a Macaw that was stolen from Brazil when he was young for reselling but inadvertently falls off a truck and into the life of Linda, who raises him domestically in Minnesota. When a random ornithologist walks into Linda's book shop and sees a now all-grown-up Blu, he invites them down to Rio de Janeiro so Blu can mate with his female counterpart, Jewel, as they are the last two of their kind. Because we all know if you get asked to go to Rio by a total stranger, even if you own a business, you just pack up and leave, and so they are off to Brazil. However, before Blu and Jewel can do the deed, they both get stolen for sale on the black market again...and a very light, forgettable ""adventure"" ensues.There is no doubt that this film is gorgeous to watch. A virtual colour orgasm, ""Rio"" will make you want to go to Rio! And the opening song, ""Real in Rio,"" one of the only two Oscar-nominated songs this year, is a fantastic tune. But the film itself won't hold much interest for anyone over the age of ten. Once you get over the well-done animation and the colours, there really is not much else there. And generally, I find the use of a well-known actor's voice fun in an animated film, but here, Jessie Eisenberg doing the voice of Blu just ends up nothing more than distracting most of the time.So. Um. Yeah. There's a reason this film didn't get nominated for Best Animated Feature. It's as clear as the skies in Brazil on a sunny day.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing,"If you don't like this movie it is, because you are to old to be watching it to begin with just kidding you are never to old to watch this. Seeing a review with anything below a 7 out of 10 on this movie is ridiculous. Great plot, great animation, great songs that help bring the culture of Rio to your TV screen. Great voice casting and great dialog. Some people say this movie is predictable and to that I say ""What could you possibly expect would happen from a kid movie? I mean half the time parents go nuts if there is a death in an animated movie and so its got be good and positive and pg rated stuff."" So if you think its boring then I say it's probably just your inability to connect with the characters or maybe you're doing to much thinking instead of just sitting back and enjoying the show. If its still boring then maybe you've spent way to much time watching the Fox Channel. It also seems to have good realist geography according to the city of Rio. Expresses good enthusiasm for the tradition of Carnaval. Either way unless you just like trying to insult good movies, then this will be an enjoyable movie for kids and adults to watch. I know, because I have this movie on Blu- Ray. So sit back, relax and enjoy the movie, because it will have you dancing and singing to some amazing music and intently eating buttery popcorn waiting to see what will happen next on this high flying adventure in the grand city of Rio de Janeiro! :D",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The actual animation was so colorful with the striped colored Macaw figures to there big,cute,bulgy eyes to the Lights of Brazil's Carnival that lighted up this animated event. very humorous at most times and enjoyed it to beginning-end.

Very good,"Of course, passing on an idea of Rio de Janeiro in such a short time is very difficult, but Rio is very real (!), Perhaps sometimes reinforced by stereotypes that we ourselves create for foreigners and that basically help to create the plot of the film going through the playful side and the serious side that is the trafficking of animals. The animation is fantastic and very realistic, it's a show! The soundtrack was nominated for an Oscar, but it's not a big deal I would say just cool, but it's nice to recognize Rodrigo Santoro's voice in the film.

Despite this, RIO still rates a 10 from me. It made me laugh and it made me cry - isn't that what you want in a movie? RIO will also capture your heart if you are an 8 year old at heart, trapped in a much older body, such as myself.

"A fun, energetic, and entertaining musical adventure!","It's been a decade since a new animation company competed against Pixar and DreamWorks Animation known as Blue Sky Studios, a division of 20th Century Fox. So far, they made the Ice Age franchise (with the original being critically praised and the sequels received mixed to negative reviews) a Dr. Seuss adaptation *Horton Hears A Who*, and two William Joyce projects ""Robots"" and ""Epic"".Then, three years later, the company made a new franchise that started with this one known as ""Rio"", a story about a blue macaw named Blu who travels to Rio De Janiero, Brazil with his human owner. One day, after meeting another blue macaw named Jewel, they get captured by a bunch of bird thieves and a cockatoo bird named Nigel. As they escape from them, they must find a way to get back to Blu's owner with the help from other birds.Looking back at this, I never realized how spectacular this film is. It's not nearly perfect by any means, but it's a really great film. My only nit-pick is that it does have the same clichés that we've seen before (a pet getting kidnapped by people, etc.), but there are other movies that have execution that makes the old clichés work and this is no exception. It does a good job executing those clichés by developing the characters and flowing the story really well.Everything else is great. The story isn't exactly the best, but it's really entertaining and a cute one that has it's heart in the right place. There's never a moment that would make you feel bored. Also, I liked the energy that was put into it and the humor comes across as fast and thick you can't help but giggle and chuckle. The pacing is very brisk and takes you to the world this film introduces us.The characters are likable with the help of a solid voice cast. Jesse Eisenberg does a nice job as Blu, the nerdy, but endearing protagonist while Anne Hathaway does a great job as Jewel, the love interest and secondary main character and her chemistry with Blu is very entertaining. The other characters are amazing. Nigel is a very menacing enough villain he even steals the show. The same thing can be said for the comic reliefs, Nico, Pedro, and Rafael.The music score from John Powell is actually a really good one. Not How To Train Your Dragon worthy, but I liked the Brazilian flavor, the emotion, & energy it gives an epic scale to the film. Also, the songs are really good to listen to. Real In Rio, I Wanna Party (I Wanna Samba), and the others are really nice choices for a musical adventure you'll end up humming them for a long time. Then, there's the animation. The character animation on the humans is fine and the bird designs for the protagonists and the side characters are great, but what really stands out is the visuals. The look of Rio is fantastic. The city, the streets, the ocean, the forest, and the Carnival Festival sequence. It's just... wow.Overall, Rio isn't the best CGI modern animated feature film and it's not on par with Pixar and DreamWorks Animation, but it's a really fun film with a story that is rarely predictable, characters that are endearing, a few songs that are solid, and has a nice touch of Brazilian flavor. It makes me feel like I want to go to Rio so I can party and live my life. Thumbs up!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really sambastic and beautiful,I watched this on hot summer day and it felt just perfect. Colors and renderings are beautiful and real treat for eye.Story and screenplay are solid.

really fun for all of us,"I have young kids, and also, as a family, my husband and I decided early on to try regulating media, to watch and listen things more positive, especially for the kids. I've noticed that our kids repeat verbally and physically everything EVERYTHING they watch. It's really turned our lives around. There are a lot of benefits we've seen since we've done this.With that being said, I haven't found a lot of kids movies I can watch with the kids. They are either too cheesy for me to keep my interest, or they cross the line with kids. As a result, I've turned to a lot of older movies from Singing in the Rain to Neverending Story.The kids wanted to see it for ages since seeing it in previews and playing the Angry Birds RIO on Kindle Fire. I was skeptical, newer kids movies almost always pushes the envelope with really rude behavior, language, and scary images. We finally saw it on a free summer movie day at my local theater a few days ago. I figured, if there was really anything I find offensive, since its free, we can walk out or just sit it out, and talk to the kids after about things, and make a point not to show it at home.Rio is truly the first modern I found that really is great for all of us to watch as a family. I'm so pleased that it was entertaining, and in the same time it was safe, even for my standards. No one even said the ""damn"" or anything. I couldn't believe I was laughing while watching it. The writing was brilliant. I didn't know this was a mini-musical too. It was kinda like the classic Disney movies from the 90s.

So I just watch a cool animation about birds. And that's about it.,"There are a lot of good animations hitting the screen these days. Yet there are very few 'awesome' animations. I'm afraid Rio is not falling in the awesome category. Maybe the first reason is that it's based on birds (Which are a part of animal kingdom) and we have seeing a good load of speaking animals already.Blu is a domestic Macau. Bought up in with the care of Linda who is a young book store owner in Minnesota, Blu has no knowledge of what so ever about the real world out of the glass window. But he practically loved the life in side. After a surplice visit from Tulio who is a Brazilian Ornithologist it's revealed that Blu is the last male of his kind. And next thing he is on a place to Brazil with Linda and Tulio in order to meet the last female of his kind. In Brazil he finds the freedom of his life and the companion of his heart when the couple gets kidnapped by bird smugglers.The plot is quite unique. And it's pulled off with wonderful animation, splendid voice acting and darn good music. But like I mentioned before it lacks some punch. The thing which gives the wow factor is not to be found.There have being many animations about animals, birds and fishes in the near history. Some have made us jump out of our seats practically. And now the industry is changing. And nowadays if you want people to say AWESOME it has to be something like Wall-e or UP. Something so unique and never seeing before. And this is not like that.So I just watch a cool animation about birds. And that's about it.My reviews at flickshout.tk",,Anonymous,Animation
The colours are only the painted ones,"The movie is a colourful one, but unfortunately not in a metaphoric manner. The only excitement remains in the shades of blue, red and so on taken from real life jungle birds. And it is watchable, one can give it that, but also forgettable.The action is cliché-istic, the idea of fear of flight was used for penguins and reindeer, and the plot to make it fit for a parrot is a bit forced. The humans are the geeky boring figures that seem to come most handy to the scriptwriters lately. The bullied child, or the fat child, and the mature geek...haven't we had enough of that? It does transmit the idea of love, sort of, maybe even coin a tear on this subject to some more sensitive viewers, but bearing in mind that it is hardly a movie for adults, what is this intoxicating children with love stories that actually happen much later in life? Do not take this for a prude affirmation, but rather as one pointing out that new good ideas are hard to find, as it seems.Plus, what could have saved the movie wasn't there. They placed everything in an exotic country, but the atmosphere is lacking. It is as if they read some tourist leaflets and put them into the picture. Let's throw in some smugglers figures, some famous statue, a busy local market and a beautiful rich residence area...that will do it! The samba was, as one character said, boring, because it felt like old and recycled. The carnival of Rio was all over the place, yet it did not seem to be ""there"". If they went cliché-istic, for example, why didn't the girl dance on top of the carnival cart, but came down and produced a stumbled ballet that went away almost unnoticed? The parrot (Blue - what a creative name, btw), was cute as a baby parrot, parrot-y as an adult and the humans dressed up as parrots were freaky:).The aftertaste of this animation is that of a spineless one, but then, a lot of those have seemed to meet the ovation of the critics and most of the public in the last year, so nothing new here too. So far this year I liked Gnomeo and Juliet more that this.",,Anonymous,Animation
The Ice team goes samba!!!,"Rio is possibly one of the best animated films I have seen in a long time! I first saw this in the spring of 2011 when me and mum went down to the cinema in Crawley. The film was done by the same people who spawned the equally brilliant Ice age movies which I have seen too. the film was directed by Carlos Saldanha who did Ice Age 2+3. A lot of people say Saldanha can't direct as well as Chris Wedge (who directed the original Ice Age film) due to 2+3 getting a more mixed word of mouth than the first one, but what I have seen from Rio is amazing which shows that Saldanha knows his Brazillian stuff if not his cold sub-temperature skills.

Not good,"Not funny, not particularly ""fun"", the story and characters aren't interesting and are rather annoying. There is also a rarity of great key scenes of animation or visuals, for example there is one flying and panorama scene (as one should expect) in the middle which neither leaves much of an impression nor is representative of the rest. Most of the dialogue nad character inateraction is really just average babble and there is lack of mercy in terms of music, especially given that none of the music is any good. I think it deserves something between a 6 or a 7, I would like to give it a 7 for the idea, but watching it, I don't feel like giving it a 7.",,Anonymous,Animation
