All Quality Elements of a Magnificent Movie!!!,"I watched this movie on DVD. It will be enough for me to mention that there had been no other movie where I'd had to pause the play in mere awe at the magnificence of the storyline! At a point, It was as if I could see my jaw on the floor praising in thorough amusement the brilliance, relevance-to-our-daily-lives, deepness of message, sophistication, great portrayal, top-of-the-class creativity, marvelous acting/directing/screen writing all having come together in a movie, which called for a rating of 9 out of 10 and no less, certainly, undoubtedly.Al-Pacino's acting is to no surprise as brilliant as ever, exuding confidence, proficiency and clarity as always. Keanu Reaves leaves a great master-play in his work, meeting up to the acting skills required in displaying a character of wisdom, success, love and perhaps, of vanity. Charize Theron too puts up a play of passion in its right.But what amused me more than all were the great and fantastic script-lines thrown around. All very meaningful and interesting indeed. The whole movie got me stunned and fixed at the edge of my desk seat, but the favorite part for me has to come at the end, where the theme of the movie comes to words and finds a chance as of clarifying itself in one the most brilliant ways I as one have ever seen possible! Recommended for everybody willing to enjoin on a meaningful story and a blend of excellent plays... surely a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What makes this movie very disturbing at the same time makes it amazing,"Evil promises everything but gives away nothing. This quote, which I like very much, sums up the point of The Devil's Advocate.In this movie skillful lawyer goes to New York to pursue career of his dreams. He makes many compromises with his conscience on the way and even starts to neglect his romantic relationship.It's really unbelievable that this movie isn't more popular than it is. It's got all the elements of a serious, adult thriller. It is true, however, that this is a very disturbing portrayal of someones life going down the spiral. What makes this movie great, makes this movie disturbing and vice versa.We've all seen many movies devoting to much time to unnecessary violence only to disturb you, not to utilize it so that story line actually benefits from it.However, all the violence, nudity and disturbing material in The Devil's Advocate fit nicely with the plot. I don't remember anything disturbing not being in concordance with moral of the story - that is to point out to viewer how the Evil actually operates.Now recall the book of Genesis chapter 3, verse 1: ""Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made.""Many movies have portrayed Satan as an ugly, violent monster often not intelligent enough. This movie portrays the Evil one as it actually is: intelligent, subtil, patient, taunting, masquerading as the angel of light. And one more thing: He hates God. His true call is to convince people loving God does not exist.If you're looking for a movie which provocatively raises philosophical and theological questions in a way a book never could, look no further.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"astonishing then, astonishing now","I saw this movie back in '97 in the theatre. It was running just a week after Cameron's Titanic. I remember the crowds that rushed to see Titanic, and an almost empty room when this movie was playing. After seeing this I thought how unbalanced is this creativity (originality) vs big budget blockbusters on one side, and the number of viewers on the other side. Later I realised that blockbusters are for the masses, and interesting movies like this one are for the few who can see beyond the FX and the small little girls tears. I was just a kid back then. I watched it again last night. And although I knew the ending, it was an awesome ride, and the ending gave me the same shivers as the fist time. If you haven't seen this one - go get it, if you have - watch it again. It never gets old, nor boring.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Most Underrated Film of the '90s,"The reviews for ""The Devil's Advocate"" were not too kind, to say the least. But what did the critics refuse to see in this? With movies nowadays being nothing but flashy, over-the-top, masturbatory, CG-fests, ""The Devil's Advocate"" holds up like osmium.The cinematography is good because it's quite understated and that's a virtue in today's cinema. The acting, while containing pretty lame Southern accents, is still pretty good. Even from Keanu, dude.Sorely forgotten in it's day, the script tells a very deep, original and interesting story, with lots of development, respect for the characters, delicate pacing, and a head-spinning ending. The movie is solely about the people and their struggles. Fear takes hold of the audience through the dialogue.Think of ""The Devil's Advocate"" as Woody Allen trying his hand at a horror/thriller and succeeding. This movie never makes you jump, but it puts you in a general state of discomfort through it's atmosphere. As with all memorable supernatural dramas, this one handles its spectacle with discretion and grace.Isn't that what we hope to see when we watch any movie? 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
this is how you make a thriller,"Stylish, sexy, suspenseful thriller stars Reeves as an accomplished southern lawyer who's never been beaten; he travels to New York City to take a job with powerful legal mogul Pacino, but his once ideal life is soon turned upside down as he's plunged into a surreal, demonic world of lust, temptation, and vanity. Slick writing, direction, and an array of startling scenes, breathtaking effects, and dazzling performances make this an imaginative thriller quite unlike any other. Reeves gives one of his finest performances to date, aided immeasurably by a wild, wickedly over-the-top performance from Pacino and a first-rate supporting cast. Not for all tastes, but highly watchable indeed. ***Â½",,Anonymous,Mystery
A beguiling experience,"This is one of the most intensely dark and beguiling movies I have seen. The purpose behind it is to create a moral drama about the fight between good and evil in a man, or the devil's everlasting quest to conquer man's soul. In retrospective, there are few movies I've seen that bring out such strong feelings in me. Specially the first hour. We follow a young couple, played by Reeves and Theron in her first big picture, who move to New York from the south when he is given a job as attorney in one of the biggest firms in the country. We see the change come in Kevin as he is introduced to a world of luxury and pleasure by his boss, THE DEVIL, played by old master Al Pacino.The ending brings a new, unpredictable and great twist to the story. I will not give it away. The supporting cast is pretty strong, specially Jeffrey Jones who plays a senior partner in Lucifer Pacino's firm and who first arises the suspicion in Kevin/Keanu with his mysterious behaviour, and Connie Nielsen as Cristabella, an extremely hot Italian colleague who is the very symbol of temptation. Nielsen looked even better here than in ""Gladiator"" and her performance is also more interesting. Charlize Theron displayed her range here for the first time, showing she had a great potential to become a star with her mix of ethereal beauty and acting talent. Reeves was also very good as the hotshot attorney and his looks elevated his macho hero potential. Al Pacino didn't disappoint, but his performance here counts as one of his least spectacular.This is a dark movie with elements of horror and some gore and sex thrown in for good measure. I think Taylor Hackford never did it better. He gave us something to ponder on while entertaining and scaring us at the same time. It is a film one can't forget.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Still a great movie...,"Of course I have seen the 1997 movie ""The Devil's Advocate"" before. But truth be told, I needed no persuasion to sit down and watch the movie again here in 2024, as I had the opportunity to do so.Writers Andrew Neiderman, Jonathan Lemkin and Tony Gilroy put together quite an enjoyable and entertaining script and storyline. It is a narrative that is parts drama, thriller and mystery, which actually played out quite nicely. And there is something unique about the storyline which makes the movie watchable again and again.The movie has a very impressive cast ensemble, with some pretty good talents. You know what you are getting into when you have the likes of Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino in the leading roles, and they do deliver here; especially Al Pacino, he was phenomenal in the role of John Milton. The movie also have the likes of Charlize Theron, Jeffrey Jones, Judith Ivey, Connie Nielsen and Craig T. Nelson on the cast list, among many other great talents.""The Devil's Advocate"" has a few special effects throughout the 144 minutes that it runs for, which helps promote the narrative quite nicely. It is not a movie that relies heavily on special effects to tell its tale, nor does it rely on special effects to be an effective movie. Instead, director Taylor Hackford makes usage of carnal situations to cement the elements of pleasure and lust that drives John Milton and his surroundings.I will say that ""The Devil's Advocate"" is the type of movie that you just have to watch, because it definitely was one of the more memorable and defining movies of the late 1990s. And it is quite an entertaining storyline in the movie.My rating of ""The Devil's Advocate"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I will definitely have to see this again.,"Movies about people getting involved with the Devil are quite common, but Al Pacino's deadpan performance makes this one especially cool. True, Keanu Reeves is a strange choice for a person who started out in Florida - especially since he still sounds like the guy from the ""Bill & Ted"" movies"" - but he also does a good job. I am going to have to watch ""The Devil's Advocate"" again, just to see where...well, you'll see what I mean if you watch it. When this movie came out, I had never heard of Charlize Theron (although she had already starred in ""That Thing You Do!""), but she showed the same chops that she would later bring to ""Monster"" and such movies. All in all, a really cool movie; you may never look at anything the same way again after watching this.Vanity definitely IS my favorite sin...",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Devil Inside of All of Us,"The Devil's Advocate was just something different. It did not try to be deep and certainly did not take itself seriously making it good. It fortunately just follows its own path and throws you into a whole different world.The acting in the Devil's Advocate was average. Keeanu Reeves was horrible as usual but Al Pacino fit his character perfectly. He seemed to have more fun with this role more than any other movie he has been in. He portrayed all the temptations we have inside of us. He kind of gave a glimpse of what type of person you would be when giving into those temptations and how it will just transform into something that is not human at all. Charlize Theron also gave a very interesting performance as she falls apart because of her loneliness and paranoia. The only problem I had with her performance is that she seemed as if she had some sort of southern accent at the beginning but it quickly vanished as you get deeper and deeper into the movie.Directing, cinematography and writing were all good. Especially the cinematography making you feel as if not only the characters becoming more and more corrupt but as if the camera in which is looking into this story is being corrupted as well. So much of this happens it feels as if this movie just spins out of control which is probably a mistake of the director.This movie does not portray the devil as a horrible crime riddled thing. It shows that the devil is inside of us and that devil is our temptations. Are temptation run through every little thing; Money, power, relationships and anything else that could give us a thrill. It shows that if we give into to our temptations it will not only reflect ourselves but become us.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Guilty as Sin,"A hotshot Florida lawyer is hired by a powerful New York law firm. Pacino is tailor-made for the role of the larger-than-life owner of the law firm. Reeves is miscast as the whiz kid lawyer who's in for more than he bargains for; his performance is so wooden that one can see every acting muscle being flexed to no avail. Theron and Nielsen are fine as the love interests. The film is reminiscent of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" but is not as compelling as that film. Starting with an intriguing premise, it is engaging enough for the most part, but becomes increasingly ridiculous, including a contrived finale that seems to have been tacked on as an afterthought.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting movie,This movie has great pacing and every shot furthers the story. The dialogue is great and feels true to the situation.

Prepare to be gobsmacked!,"What a surprisingly rewarding film. I have not watched a film that is so engaging for a long while. I had never even heard of the film before and only saw it by chance on the shelf at the video store. I am glad I picked it up as I enjoyed every minute of it. The Devil's advocate is heavy viewing, it is not a light cinema experience, yet it is rewarding in it's heaviness. It is very clever depicting the devil realistically and giving a totally truthful example of how people can un-knowingly be sucked in by evil. The film though dealing with a unrealistic concept is totally believable due the the fantastic acting by all involved. Keanu Reeves gives the performance of a life time, he is perfectly cast opposite Charliez Theron who is also very impressive. The two posses an obvious chemistry.

Entertaining As Hell!,"Pun intended for the title. While not many horror factors are incorporated, the constant subjects of the devil and hell and death are very creepy. But they are fun too.Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, two of the best actors on God's Green Earth, pulled off very sick devils. As an actor, playing either God or the Devil is one of the highest callings. De Niro pulled off a pretty sick devil in 1987's Angelheart. Ten years later, Pacino dazzles us with his own devil. Reeves is the movie's main character, but it is Pacino that steals the show. While Angelheart is a straight-up horror movie, De Niro's devil is simply scarier than Pacino's, as this is a thriller with a horror undertone. I also found this to be a better movie.Pacino plays the devil who is the head of the world's most powerful law firm located in New York City. He recruits Keanu Reeves, who's 64-0 record proves he can punish the guilty one day then make the guilty look more innocent than a child the next. Reeves and wife, Theron, move to a lavish New York life, too good to be true. Reeves is unaware what's on the line as everything of his could go straight to hell.This really gives lawyers a bad name. Sadly, it is true. Sometimes, lawyers can be bad people as they free monsters. This Gothic fairly tale makes fun of this theory in an-over-the-top way, that is thrilling, fun, and scary. This was done before Keanu Reeves sold out and Pacino started doing good and bad movies, so both actors do mighty fine jobs. Supporting actors such as Charlize Theron and Craig T Nelson are just as good.3.5/4",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"So, the Devil is running a lawfirm....what's so surprising about that?!","""The Devil's Advocate"" is a very well made film, I won't deny that. But, oddly, at the same time, it's a most unpleasant movie...and after a while I was looking forward to it ending.When the story begins, Kevin (Keanu Reeves) is winning yet another case as a defense attorney. In fact, you soon learn that when he worked as a prosecutor, he never lost as well...an amazing record. So, it's not all that surprising that a huge and very prestigious New York lawfirm would come looking for his services. Little did he realize that the man in charge (Al Pacino) is demonic....though since he's a lawyer, I found this part pretty easy to believe.Through the course of this film, you see Kevin repeatedly making bad choices and losing his soul. But how this happens...well, that makes the film a bit hard to watch at times. I could say more...but it's a very adult film and occasionally very unpleasant.This is a hard movie for me to rate. Technically, it's well made. The acting, direction and look of the film are great. But the story itself is so downbeat and unpleasant that I can see the picture is not for everyone, that's for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An extraordinary film with a great cast and one of the best interpretations of the Devil I've ever seen in the movies.,"It's always a pleasure to see this film. Its one of those films that makes us think and that touches on one interesting theme: the eternal struggle between Good and Evil, between God and his eternal enemy, the Devil. And this film gives us, precisely, the best interpretation of the Prince of Evil that cinema has ever seen!The script could hardly be better: we followed the trajectory of meteoric success of a Florida lawyer, Kevin Lomax, who is hired by a prestigious New York law firm run by John Milton who, without anyone knowing, is the Devil himself. The position is so good that Lomax doesn't even think twice: an excellent salary, a large and good apartment and other perks in exchange for a permanent effort on behalf of the company, defending cases that, at first sight, seem lost. But things will get worse when he has to choose between work and personal life.Gradually, the audience begins to realize the whole thing, starting with the high level of amorality and perversion that reigns in the firm, where the boss flaunts his sexual affairs with assistants and employees, and where company's parties end in authentic orgies. Equally striking are the dialogues, most notably the monologues of Al Pacino, which are never tedious but rather exciting. Throughout the film there are several veiled mentions to ""Paradise Lost"", a classic of English literature, and sometimes we even see Lomax about to fall from grace, too, as happened to Adam.In addition to an interesting story, the strongest point of this film is the impeccable and overwhelming work of Al Pacino, which overshadows the rest of the cast. I think he liked his character a lot and the result of his commitment is another great work... it's not his best because he made a lot of colossal films and characters (""The Godfather"", ""Serpico"", ""Scent of a Woman"" etc). By the way he ""defended"" diabolical action in his arguments and reasoning, he turns out to be the real Devil's advocate. Keanu Reeves, who played Lomax, gives us a very good job, full of talent, but he is clearly overshadowed by Pacino. In the supporting cast there are still good performances by Charlize Theron, Jeffrey Jones and Connie Nielsen.Technically, it is a film that has it's value but knows how to give space to the story told and the performance of the cast, never falling into the temptation to allow technique to override dramatic art. Cinematography is very good, and makes an intelligent use of light and shadow to create the most appropriate environment for each sequence and scene. Manhattan's urban landscapes are already known to any movie buff, but they always look good on film and have been well used here. The sets are extraordinary, thought to the detail. Being a film that spends a lot of time in the characters' houses, the creation of indoor environments was important and each apartment reveals a lot about the character that inhabits it: for example, the detail of Milton's apartment not having a single bedroom... the Devil never sleeps, in fact. Finally, a word for the special, visual and sound effects, that appear punctually but are extremely well made, and also for the soundtrack, which includes an excellent original score by James Newton Howard and some well-known songs, like ""Paint it Black"".",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
too ambitious and too long,"Florida defense lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) has a perfect record. He is angered when he realizes his client is guilty. Nevertheless, he destroys the victim on the stand. He is married to Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) and his religious mother Alice disapproves. John Milton (Al Pacino) recruits Kevin to his NYC law firm. The couple is given a massive apartment and lots of money.Al Pacino seems to be having a lot of fun with lines like ""They don't see me coming."" He's great at being Satan. The movie is too ambitious. It wants to be a horror like 'The Exocist' or 'Rosemary's Baby', but it doesn't have the tension. It tries to be a character study but Kevin is too arrogant and too dumb to be appealing. It's also too long. This should be better especially with Pacino enjoying himself. The final twist is also problematic and is a cheat on the rest of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Devils Advocate A Good Thriller With Flaws,"The Devils Advocate is a good thriller with flaws from director Taylor Hackford whose admirable in making this movie about a hotshot lawyer who gets a lot more than he barged after when he learns that his new boss is Lucifer himself. Keanu Reeves is solid as Kevin Lomax the hotshot lawyer and Al Pacino is better than ever clearly enjoying his chance to play Satan. Reeves makes for an effective hero and Pacino is great as the villain. I just wish he had more to do. The rest of the cast including Charlize Theron, Jeffrey Jones, Connie Nielson, and Craig T Neslon are good as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The movie is creepy occasionally with some suspense and surprises but a slow pace is what weighed the film down the most. If director Taylor Hackford had amped up the suspense and made it faster paced somehow the movie would've been better. The few surprises near the end I didn't really see coming but it couldn't hide the movies few flaws. Overall though The Devil's Advocate is a decent thriller thats creepy with some suspense, surprises, and exceptional performances by the cast who make this overlong movie worth watching at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of my all time favorites,"In my opinion,this is one of the best movies of all time. I'm shocked that it has no Oscar nominations. Pacino definitely deserves one for almost every movie he was in. But it won Saturn award for the best horror... really?! Horror?! In which universe is this movie a horror?! It's drama, it may pass for thriller or mystery, but to say it's horror is complete nonsense. I suppose everyone saw this movie, but to those who saw it just once I recommend watching it again, because this movie is full of ingenious lines that in first watching mostly pass unnoticed, because without knowing how movie ends they seem casual and irrelevant, and they're not. In spite of the fact that the main role is entrusted to Keanu Reeves, the story and other actors are so strong that the film is a pure10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What's your Price?,"When you're in the mood for something unsubtle but visceral, it pays off to give ""The Devil's Advocate"" a spin.I have to admit it has a style that's relentlessly 'over-the-top', so to some that might be a turn-off, but I like it because it's really easy to watch. It has a nice flow to it, which must be down to Hackford's direction.Plus, you get to see Al Pacino chewing scenery! Everyone criticises his 'shouty' acting, but it makes me feel really alive when I see a performer get that passionate in their work. James Woods is another guy who has that manic quality going on, too, and it's riveting when they're in full flow. I can't take my eyes off them.Keanu Reeves is often mocked for his lack of expressiveness, but this time his casual manner is the perfect foil for his co-star's maniacal air of mischief.Ultimately the movie abandons all attempt at any kind of moral/legal parallel by the finale, choosing instead just to give Al space for his personalised, paraphrased riffs on Paradise Lost material, so if you're expecting consistently sensible and thought-provoking, then you're probably at the wrong gig. If however you only seek to be lavishly entertained, then surrender to your inner hedonist and dive right in. You may not respect yourself for it in the morning, but hey, tomorrow's another day.

Very Good,"When I first saw The Devils advocate I was in amazement of how good it was. I was thinking about it for a long time after and when I got to catch it recently on TV it made me think about it all over again and it this time raises some questions and.I didn't find it as good the second time round. I have watched it many times since I first saw but the recent viewing I was paying more attention than ever. I still think Keanu Reeves was maybe not right as Kevin Lomax. He has great moments but I think he has to many moments where he is trying to act is ass off and making it look obvious. Is it me or in some scenes where Keanu is talking he sounds like Elvis with his accent. Just a thought. Al Pacino was perfect as John Milton but again he was a bit over the top but makes up for it in his charm and charisma which he tackles head on easily through the movie. The best acting we get here is from Charlize Theron which is no surprise to me considering how well she has done since in films like Monster. The story doesn't really kick off till the very end where everything unfolds very fast to a massive climax which without this film would have failed badly. I don't know much about Taylor Hackford's previous work but I am impressed with how he handled The Devils Advocate and if he directs an y others films of this caliber then he might be poised to win an huge award of sort. The film is just not about paranormal goings on with Satan, it is also a law film which actually makes being a lawyer look like a lot of fun with a lot of tension thrown in. If any adrenaline junkie wanted to go for a mainstream job then a lawyer would be his cup of tea as Kevin Lomax will show you.The direction, music, cinematography and nearly everything about this film is perfect. The story is quite close but towards the end there is just to many revelations that happen all to quick and it gives you this feeling that the film is getting a bit silly and that's how I feel about it now. If you haven't seen it before and you are wanting to see it for yourself then you should see it without a doubt. Don't let any review including mine put you off as this as the movie is one hell of a ride but it may raise questions of how much they tried to cram inside the movie in the time it had. It does run for nearly two and a half hours but they run quicker than you can imagine and as soon as the film finishes you will be wanting to watch it all over again so you can see where everything makes sense.Al Pacino does pack a punching performance to the very end and is as crazy as ever if a little over the top at times but without him we wouldn't be talking about this film as much.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Keanu gets a devil of a job.,"Hot-shot Floridian defense attorney Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is head-hunted by New York's most powerful law firm, unaware that his new boss (Al Pacino) is The Devil.For The Devil's Advocate, director Taylor Hackford breathes fresh life into several well-worn satanic horror themes, skillfully weaving them into a slick, big-budget horror/thriller that delivers on many levels: it's smartly written, sexy, intelligent, and well-acted, with a particularly fine, lip-smacking performance from Pacino, who owns every scene he is in. Above all else, though, The Devil's Advocate is thoroughly entertaining throughout.The film is perhaps a little light on scares and gore for some horror fans, but there is a genuinely creepy atmosphere to compensate, the script is gripping and imaginative enough that one soon forgets about the lack of stuff like bowel-loosening jumps and exploding heads, and to top it all, Charlize Theron and Connie Nielsen both get completely starkers.

"Grand, but not quite there.","This is a film that is almost ""great.""

Al Pacino was very good portraying his character, but Keanu... It's just his voice, man. Something about how forced and ""cool"" he's trying to sound while putting on and off a Southern accent is something I can't stand.Story is decent, but not quite as epic and intense as the mood was going for as well.Still worth a watch, but it's not up to the standard it sets itself up to face.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Satan accepted Kevil Lomax's soul...,"American justice has always been at the heart of many American films. A lot of them have showed lawyers as main protagonists who defend victims with respect of justice. ""The Devil's Advocate"" (1997) which presents a new and worthy variation on the myth of Faust exploits an idea we have rarely seen on the screen: a lawyer ready to do anything to succeed, even to defend doubtful cases. Moreover, if the supernatural is an integral part of the whole, we can expect to watch a promising movie. So, here's the story: Keanu Reeves acts a young and ambitious lawyer, Kevin Lomax who can pride himself of not having lost a sole trial throughout his career. One day, he gets in touch with a prestigious law firm in New York run by the charismatic and mysterious John Milton (Al Pacino) who offers him a golden job doubled with a comfortable income. Of course, Lomax doesn't think twice before accepting and so he leaves his natal Florida with her bride Mary-Ann (Charlize Theron) to live in New York. After this, the young lawyer thinks he has reached the top but in the meantime, doubt gnaws away at him until he discovers terrible truths: he has defended criminals, his private life is broken and Milton's real identity will reveal itself before his eyes.If I'm not totally satisfied with ""the Devil's Advocate"", it's because I think the outcome is largely telegraphed. Besides, even before seeing the movie, you can guess how it is going to end: the title and especially the cover speak volume about the conclusion: a benevolent Al Pacino taking Keanu Reeves under his wing. In another extent, if I look into the movie's references I realize that they are echoes of ""Angel Heart"" (1987) by Alan Parker and the story heavily borrows from ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968) Roman Polanski's masterpiece. Indeed, Charlize Theron's attitude is strongly reminiscent of Mia Farrow's. And just look at the big and somewhat disturbing apartment in which she and Reeves settle. It resembles a lot to the one in ""Rosemary..."". But on the other hand, ""the Devil's Advocate"" will influence a few forthcoming movies like ""End of Days"" (1999).In spite of all, I don't intend to slag ""the Devil's Advocate"" off. The director Taylor Hackford well fulfilled his pledges and delivers, here a well-crafted thriller in spite of the foreseeable nature that clutters it up. As for the scriptwriters, they don't do properly one of their main jobs which is to write a suspenseful script as much as possible. There are also a few holes and one can judge the last images as a little incoherent with the rest of the story. But the authors make up for it by favoring a slow but sure rise of anxiety through Reeves' descent into hell marked out by Theron's progressive madness. And by delaying as much as possible the final revelation, they hold the viewer breathless all the time of the movie. And concerning the dialogs, let's hail some well found cues (I am an humanist!).Among the other qualities we can attribute to Hackford's movie: a good use of secondary characters like Lomax's mother. We could expect her to occupy a decorative part and however her role is indispensable to light and to understand certain points of the story. In another extent, ""the Devil's Advocate"" is supported by a very careful photography which confers the movie a strong visual appeal, notably through New York's buildings and the interior of Milton's law firm as big as the devastating corruption which reigns in them. To a second degree, Hackford's movie can be read as a biting denunciation of the American judicial system's abuses and injustices. This critic is directed at unscrupulous lawyers carried away by success and money and ready to defend accused people guilty of a more or less serious offense who are eventually acquitted. In this way, Hackford's bitter critic kicks the bull's eye and at the end of the movie, there's a quite relevant morals which aims a positive objective.At last, about the cast, there's nothing to say about Al Pacino, the role of Satan suits him well and concerning Keanu Reeves, it is his second best performance to date after ""Matrix"" (1999). So, ""the Devil's Advocate"" (1997) isn't free from shortcomings but the above-mentioned positive aspects are eloquent to make you want to watch this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Al Pacino shines!,"Stylish, well written and atmospheric, with a smart and humorous script, ""Devil's Advocate"" delivers the right amount of suspense and eeriness.

And he is magnificent, incredibly charming, funny... No words can describe this performance, it's definitely one of his best.

Devil Movies!,"A friend of mine and I just watched the Harbinger and we thought it was really original and entertaining but then someone said you have to watch the prophecy, Constantine and the devils advocate.We have now watched all 4 movies. All great, all slightly different in their own way, but the devils advocate is the best out of the four.First of all, it has the best production value, Keanu Reeves has a couple of off moments in his acting but for the most part he's pretty good, Al Pacino and Charlize are great with an engaging story.All 4 movies are great because they have one thing in common - Most Devil movies don't have much original to offer. The Harbinger and The Prophecy even have a Native American element to them that we both loved. I recommend the Harbinger as a good low budget Devil movie, but it's original, I give it a 7. I give the prophecy and Constantine an 8 because they have higher production value and that matters, and I give the devil's advocate a 9. Thumbs up and all fun devil movies!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

There is a lot of nudity and extreme violence in this movie, but if it wasn't there the movies purpose and story wouldn't work. The final half of this movie put me in more suspense then any movie has in a long time. In conclusion, don't miss this film.",,Anonymous,Mystery

That's pretty much about the movie but here's something interesting, most of the bad reviews for this movie are written by people who have misunderstood this to be a horror film when its clearly not. They have rated it low for bad acting and not being scary enough. I mean what the actual f! It's a movie with a clear message, although with a slight drag, which has been clearly missed and I thought it would be worth pointing that out.

Divinity on a Leash,"Eternity and entertainment, how could one exist without the other? True entertainment only comes without limits.Seeing how my recent obsession with Charlize Theron has intensified in the last few weeks (may be the rather appalling effect of stress and responsibility which makes me want to elude reality), I got around to seeing the so renowned Devil's Advocate.The film as such is a fun ride and, by all means, very well done. It's in the artistic impression it conveys to life and the reality of its tone in the first half that this advocate succeeds in defending a case so easy to lose (forgive the pun). While subtlety may not be its prime method of going about things, the vicious devilishness of the world fits very well in the picture. Yet, it is mainly Charlize's performance which caught my eye and soul, a performance so ""tormentous"" it simply made the film worth the watch. My bias is obvious, but I sincerely hope this opinion goes beyond personal taste. Morevoer, it is not only in her performance, but also in her character and its drama that the film gains depth and tension.Keanu's Lomax, although the central character, never manages to truly get off the ground - as in, it never gains true distinctiveness. It would be erroneous of anyone to deem Keanu a brilliant actor, but there's always something more to acting than simply having the skills to do it, that is why I did not mind him being chosen for the role. Actually, he is only the ""vehicle"" which gets this film moving, but its value lies more in the peripheral happenings, the little things.As a whole, Devil's Advocate may attach too much of a moral label to itself to actually fulfill its potential. It is however a clever film, with some good performances from both Charlize and Pacino (who does his usual tricks to amuse everyone), but which descends into dangerous territory towards the end. And it's not the right kind of dangerous territory.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Interesting indeed, but somewhat overdone.","the Devil's Advocate (based on the novel by Andrew Neiderman) provides rousing drama with satisfactory flair and presentation. At the same time however, the story is equally heavy and cumbersome. With each chapter passing, another plot component is added, which for a while makes everything all the more interesting, but at a certain point, you start to feel lost. The Devil's Advocate seems confused in direction. In an attempt to answer all the questions that are posed, the movie's ending is painfully overlong and ridiculous. Well if nothing else at least it gives the cinematographer and effects department something epic to work with. The Devil's Advocate is a lengthy movie. The finished project is not uninteresting, and in fact it is frequently involving, but you get the impression that it is trying too hard.As far as a Keanu Reeves film goes, this motion picture is a step in the right direction. Ironically though it doesn't qualify as a good performance. It only seems that way because he shares the screen frequently with Charlize Theron who upstages him with badness. Her delivery is so over wrought, that it denies common sense. Al Pachino is stable for a while, but during the course of the movie's last third, he goes into Scarface mode, and flies off the handle. I have yet to come across a movie in which the devil taking human form is justified in intelligence by an actor's performance. Outside of these people, (and Craig T. Nelson) nobody else in the cast serves a function other than killing screen time. So much goes on in the Devil's Advocate, but too little of it becomes important.As a thriller, The Devil's Advocate finds success. A good word to use would be 'startling'. I can recommend the film on the grounds that it feels original and viscerally entertaining, but it lacks a sense of fluidity or general intelligence. It could use a bit of a reworking.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Good & Bad Of 'The Devil's Advocate,"BAD - Is there a dumber-sounding or more wooden-voiced modern-day actor in Hollywood than Keanu Reeves? In this film they have this guy playing a super-smart lawyer. I'm sorry but he just sounds dumb, his voice and vocabulary giving no indication of him being a brilliant lawyer. Maybe it was his fake Southern accent, which also was weak.Charlize Theron was in there for looks, playing Reeves' wife. Her tirades and constant OMGs got tiresome after awhile. Meanwhile, Reeves' mother (Judith Ivey) was portrayed as a preacher's daughter and, of course, a strange almost- nut-case-like person, which is how Hollywood usually portrays Bible believers.THE GOOD - Al Pacino was his usual interesting self, particularly since he played the devil, so you know he's going to have some dialog that will get your attention. Ivey, even though pictured poorly as mentioned above, is the only one with enough Biblical knowledge to know Pacino was the devil - not the other characters. Being a guy, Theron was nice to look: a stunning-looking woman.OVERALL - If you put with some of things mentioned above - or if a lot of profanity and full frontal nudity turn you off - the story is interesting and still worth a look. Even though the films goes on a bit long, the best part is the final 30 minutes. Even though perverted, the Devil's ""take"" on life and God are fascinating to hear. The movie also provides a good moral lesson on the subject of vanity.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wonderful Piece of Hell,"I must say, at first I never really wanted to see the movie after it got some pretty bad reviews, however, after going through the Keanu Reeves syndrome, I decided to watch this film, and I was glad that I did. Amongst all the characters, I was mostly pleased with Al Pacino's performance, as not only he plays a vicious role, but also his humorous comments were brilliant. Keanu's performance however was mediocre, I thought he could do better. As for Charlize Theron, as this was one of her first films, I think she did a very good job of playing such a serious role at the age of 22. This is a great thriller, and I recommend you watch it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Devilish Entertainment. 10 Stars Plus!,"The Devil's Advocate is by far one of the better films of the 90's. When I first saw it almost three years ago at the theater, I said movies and film making have come a long way, when a film such as this is wily outrageous. Al Pacino has a field day playing Lucifer disguised as the head of a New York law firm. Pacino's characther of John Milton has a member of his law firm recruit hotshot Florida defense attorney Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) to New York City to practice law for his firm, but soon does Lomax and his wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) learn not only are there cases to be won, but souls to be lost. Pacino gives in my opinion the best performance of his career, the name Milton is always associated with Satan hint: Milton's Paradise Lost. The Devil's Advocate gives us a message that some of us are simply chosen for certain roles in life. Giving into free-will can be a pain, but it is a must, because a person cannot always uphold the wrong side for argument's sake. Every one must watch this film over and over to get a more clear and better understanding. I tend to have different thoughts and questions each time I view the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I never get tired of watching this performance.He has a great supporting cast here with Keanu Reeves as a lawyer that will do anything to win. But, Kevin (Reeves) was bush league. He met John (Pacino) and learned what it meant to ""do anything"" to win. There are some interesting twists here that make the movie so much more interesting. I wouldn't want to spoil them for you.Also, the movie has the luscious Charlize Theron as Kevin's wife. Needless to say she has to be removed for John's plans to come to pass. It's not pretty! Connie Nielsen and Tamara Tunie add their exquisite beauty to the mix and make the journey so much more enjoyable.Does Kevin go over to the Dark Side? I'll never tell.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty Much about a Gaslighted Wife,"Keanu Reaves plays Lomax, a really good small-time southern lawyer who never lost a case.Al Pacino plays the devil, head of a big shot firm for the rich and powerful in New York who tries to recruit Lomax to come over to his side.I don't know why, but Pacino and his people keep harassing this guy's poor wife until she goes crazy by making her see schizophrenic demonic transformations. Nobody believes her and she ends up in the loony bin.Funnily enough, that's the main plot thread in the film. Lomax keeps getting more and more into his career while his wife nags him and he tries to gaslight her so she'll stop making a big deal of it.The rest is other minor plots tied to how Lomax defends criminals even when he knows they're guilty, which is, according to this movie, the devil's work. This is infused with wealth exploitation - they show scenes of how much extra spending cash this guy has since going to work for the big firm. Temptation, I guess?Al Pacino is Al Pacino, as always. He gives a stellar performance with some epic monologues in his dramatic raspy voice at some points and at other points he's threatening but subtle. It's funny how they keep pushing the language thing, though. His accent in foreign languages is so bad. Amazing that after pretty much making his name as a Caribbean drug dealer in Scarface (1983) he still can't do a decent Hispanic accent to save his life.Unfortunately the main thrust of the movie appears to be this moral message, which is very weak. It's not like Lomax has a grand moral awakening. The Devil tries to seduce him to his side but keeps harassing his wife and mother (seems kind of a dumb thing to do). And there's no real reason for Lomax to suddenly become a moral crusader except that The Devil is not a very nice to his family. Ok. Dumb reason to change your whole moral outlook on life.Also I'm not sure this is the right moral message. He defends some guys who are unpleasant and supposedly do bad things, but he doesn't know they're guilty for a fact and the movie doesn't make it clear until much after he defended him. It's a lawyer's job to try and get at the truth, not to make judgments about people on gut instinct and refuse to defend them if they ""seem"" to be unpleasant and ""seem"" to be guilty.Overall a dumb but mildly entertaining movie with some good performances.Honourable Mentions: Macario (1960). Pacino does a good job as the Devil here, but it's a little too much. He's a confident troll playing around with humans, but he's a bit too goal-oriented and hands-on about murdering people and assaulting women. But Mexican devil in Macario, now THAT is the greatest devil of all time. Suave, golden-tongued, sinister but gaudy, and the taking of souls is completely just a funny game to him.

Simply great!,"A very good lawyer and his wife move to New York for a very well paid contract provided by a mysterious guy's firm.

"Enticing daft legal thriller about a defense attorney corrupted by vanity, greed and ambition","Based on the novel by Andrew Neiderman deals with the world of the advocates at law, joining them to a fantastic intrigue. It's all about enticement, here earnest Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) proves to be an efficient lawyer, a slick young small-town advocate who has never lost a case -even though many of his clients are scumbags and as guily as sin. He is celebrating with his wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) a court triumph when is approached by a representative for a powerful law firm, Leamon Heath (Ruben Santiago-Hudson), to work in New York. He is seduced by the impressive head of a multinational firm with promises of fame and fortune and takes Reeves to the top of a high building, an impressive skyscraper. Ignoring the warning from his ultra-religious mother (Judith Ivey) that New York City is the dwelling place of demons, prophesizing doom, the legal eagle is soon seduced into working for the big law firm whose boss, John Milton (Al Pacino) is a charismatic charmer. But Lomax's pursuit of excellence soon gives way to an unpleasant ruthlessnes and his wife is having a breakdown. What is Milton's dark secret ? . Don't trust the devil !. The newest attorney at the world's most powerful law firm has never lost a case !. But he's about to lose his soul. Evil has its winning ways. Speak of the devil. Devil begins and wins.This is a thoroughly nasty black comedy-thriller with nice acting, luxurious environments, brilliant set design and a disturbing climax. Tongue planted gently in his cheek, director makes his anti-materialist points without ever taking things too seriously. Here filmmaker Taylor Hackford has several aces up his sleeve and a bagful of visual effects. Actores are frankly well, Keanu is good as a young Florida advocate who's seduced by power and money of a position at an influential N. Y. C. Law firm, Charlize Theron as his beautiful and deranged wife and Pacino relishes his showy, mysterious character, gives the Milton role his full bag of tricks. Along with a very good support cast , such as: Judith Ivey as quaint mother, Jeffrey Jones, Connie Nielsen, Craig T. Nelson, Tamara Tunie, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Heather Matarazzo, Chris Bauer, Debra Monk, among others. But this movie belongs to cinematographer Adrzej Bartkowiak , composer James Newton Howard and production designer Bruno Romeo, adding the breathtaking visual effects providing some much needed jolts, all of them offer a rich, lush look that's very attractive.The motion picture was well directed by Taylor Hackford. He has directed three actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Louis Gossett Jr., Debra Winger, and Jamie Foxx. Gossett and Foxx won Oscars for their performances. He, his ex-wife Lynne Littman and his wife Helen Mirren are all Oscar-winners. Taylor is a prestigious writer/producer and director who has made successful films, such as: Â¨ParkerÂ¨ (2013), Â¨RayÂ¨ (2004), Â¨Proof of lifeÂ¨(2000), Â¨Bound by HonorÂ¨(1993), Â¨When We Were KingsÂ¨, Â¨Dolores ClaiborneÂ¨ (1995) and Â¨An Officer and a GentlemanÂ¨(1982) .

Playing by the rules,"Sometimes you have to bend the rules - especially if you want to win. That is even more true, if your character demands from yourself that you can not lose. Some may call this one of the deadly sins - whatever you want to call it, it is there. And while Greed is apparently cool (it isn't, but don't tell Gecko that), Vanity might be even cooler (sorry for the puns and no I don't think that is true, I am kidding of course).But let me back off a bit, let me first talk about someone who doesn't seem to get the recognition he deserves. I am talking about Taylor Hackford, though you would be excused if you thought I was talking about Keanu Reeves. I have been critical of him too. His acting abilities that is. I do think and believe he is a very good and decent man to say the least. But again this is about Taylor Hackford - the man who made the best movie of them all - in my humble opinion that is. I am talking about ""Blood in Blood out - Bound by honor"". But he also has done ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" and so many other really good movies. And still his name is not a household name - like Oliver Stone to name just one. And that is not a dig on Stone - he is great too of course.The cast this assembled is magnificent. I only had seen this dubbed in German back in the day. So it was quite a delight to watch this today - with the original voices. Which brings us to the performances. Now a friend of mine compares this to Constantine when it comes to the lead performances. I'll let you be the judge of that. And I don't know if that is a fair comparison overall. What I do know is that Al Pacino is on top form. And Keanu is a worthy main player.It is easy to be mesmerized by whatever Pacino is saying. It almost does not matter what he is saying - he makes it sound beautiful and enticing. He makes you believe everything. And having watched this before, I was aware of his role/character and therefor was able to deduct certain between the lines things I did not see the first time around. Yes the movie warrants multiple viewings.But it is not just the main guys here - it is the bit players around them too. And the women of course too. Charlize Theron may have one of the most thankless roles to fill. And I am not talking about the nudity (there is a bit of that throughout the movie), no I am talking about her behavior. Well her characters behavior. You may call it annoying - but in the end you may understand what drove her. You hopefully have at least empathy for her and what she had to go through. A tough thing to pull off - but she does so ... and with ease.Even someone who watches the movie for the first time probably can figure many things out. That being said, the movie is able to surprise us. And that is especially true of the ending ... a near perfect one if there ever was one. A great score and great cinematography round the picture .. no pun intended.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Throughout the film, we witness Kevin's transformation after coming into contact with the luxurious and pleasurable lifestyle of his boss, played by the legendary Al Pacino.The movie's conclusion is both fantastic and unpredictable, making it well worth watching.

Incredible,"What an insightful film. I can watch this over and over again and not get tired. Al Pacino is the dude of acting! lol It goes a lil something like this: Kevin Lomax (Reeves) is a hot shot lawyer who's never lost a case. He's married to a follically challenged woman named Mariann (Theron) and they're happy as clams. John Miller (Pacino) hears about Kevin's streak and decides to recruit him. They go to NYC and are wined, dined, and bribed into accepting a job as a criminal lawyer in a network of top global lawyers. Once they start living the life and Kevin gets all his clients acquitted for their criminal deeds, things start to go haywire. Mariann starts to see demons in their friends and realizes she can't have the baby she desperately wants. She feels alienated and out of place while Kevin works. She eventually goes crazy, but only because she's seen the truth. Kevin is taken under the wing of John Miller and gets caught up in lying for his clients to maintain his perfect record. All is not what it seems as people start dying and Kevin finds out that he's the son of the Devil. As a child of a Bible-thumping mother, this creates a problem. Miller wants him to start a ""family business"" with his half sister (whom he secretly lusts) and basically wants to p*** God and all the angels off with the lack of justice in the world. I liked that this movie made people realize that the devil can be real and out there affecting forms of governments and other systems of power. This is obviously a movie, but the message to me is still clear. It was a unique angle to attack an age-old debate from. Satan is in the law? American law? Hmm....pretty interesting stuff. Sure would explain a lot and don't mention O.J. any of you, lol. Point is, the movie is fabulous and decadent and shows how vanity can be a deadly sin and probably Satan's favorite according to Pacino. Theron attacked her part wonderfully and made a fan out of me. She's absolutely stunning. Greed is a serious issue and this movie discusses that. It's a must see and they have it on TBS and TNT all the gosh darn time, so just watch it.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Now as a life-long lover of the baddie in films, I felt a bit let down by the ending. Faust it isn't - but, to be fair, it still goes as close as Hollywood will probably ever go in portraying a characterisation of the epitome of evil (and offering a wonderful critique on vanity being the downfall of mankind) that actually has a fighting chance of prevailing! Reeves is not the finest actor to grace our screens. Easy on the eye, certainly, but somehow he's just a bit too lightweight here.

Despite his record of wins, he and his wife Mary Ann (Theron) struggle to make ends meet and are looking for an opportunity to make it big so they can afford to start a family.One evening, after winning a big case, Kevin is approached by a representative from a large scale New York Law Firm about possibly coming to work for them. Before offering a job, they want to see him work first, so they offer him the opportunity to come and assist on one of their current cases. The trip includes all expenses paid, along with a bonus payout regardless of the outcome of the trial. (Well who would turn that down?)After winning the case with Kevin's help, he is brought in to meet with boss of the Law Firm, John Milton (Pacino),, a man who is much more than he appears to be at first glance,,,So, Kevin and Mary Ann move to New York, and he becomes completely devoted to becoming his new boss's greatest asset in
the courtroom, which leaves little time for his wife. Mary Ann finds the new environment and estrangement from Kevin very troubling,, and she soon begins to unravel mentally. Is her mental state due to the sudden change in their lives, or are there more sinister things happening?This movie is a 7.5 rating at least. Pacino is at his best here (imo). Who else has played this part better? Reeves (while not being the best actor) is great as the hotshot young attorney hell-bent on always winning. Theron plays her part very well, and a great supporting cast provides all the rest.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Satan is your ,your boss? UH-OH!","Keeanu Reeves put on a great performance as an hard-nosed lawyer from Florida in ""The Devil's Advocate"". The beginning of the movie starts off great, where he defends a teacher accused of molestation. I bet he felt real stupid when he sees his client playing his ""instrument"". He should have dismissed him right on the spot! The Lomaxes (Reeves and Charlize Theron) get the opportunity to go to the Big Apple simply because he's the best. There's a hitch, his employer is so shady, not only he will win every court case, his soul is the most important thing he has own. This movie is a little more hardcore than ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"" with temptations that are to good to be true. Mary Ann Lomax is starting to dislike being in New York, because the new friends she made, turns out to be more sinister, than Kevin would ever see. The part where the friend took off her bra so she can put on her new dress then Mary Ann rushes out of the store when she saw the demonic look in her. After finding out who his business partner really is, Lomax decides to tempt the devil, himself. It was better to stay and find a new line of work than to enjoy a job opportunity that carried a heavy tag. This movie was very sinister, very entertaining, and very intriguing, I could watch this movie at any time I want. GREAT! 5 STARS!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not your typical courthouse feature!,"Although the premise conspicuously hints at a monotonous courtroom drama filled with cases and arguments, trust me, it would be a grave mistake to consider it one.Why? Because the narrative stretches beyond the four walls of the courthouse, I would go as far as to say that the whole setup involving the judge, jurors, and attorneys was a backdrop to convey its real message, which is really about human nature.More so relevant, when you look at the current state of our society, where everybody is blindly chasing fame and money without ever thinking about what's right and what's not!It teaches about the consequences of greed and over-ambition. The lessons are uttered through events that transpire in Lomax's 'perfect' life, with 'Biblical' scriptures as an instrument to propagate the plot points.Though I'll admit the third act could have been better structured, Appalling pace and a higher than usual pitch in performances did affect its efficacy to some extent.Nevertheless, I liked it, probably more because I mistakenly presumed it as one run-of-the-mill courthouse feature.

First third is pretty good but devolves into a horror cringefest with moral lessons for 3 year olds,"I couldn't help myself but to mock certain characters during ""dramatic"", violent scenes because it was the only way i could cope with how awfully cringe this movie was at times. It stars out with a more nuanced vibe and has some really cool scenes where all this mystique and devil stuff is being hinted at but the longer it goes on, oh boy. It's about as deep and profound as a plate with water on it yet it's played as such an over the top grandiouse style as if (even in 1997) this was suppose to be somewhat interesting philosophy. I'd say the target audience is edgy 13 year olds. Al pacino had some cool dialogue when he wasn't going over the top, the ending was somewhat sweet and pacino's final remark was funny. It's a shame because i during the first 1/3rd or so, it seemed like such a cool movie but it turned really edgy really fast.

Lawyers. The ideal setting for a story of good versus evil.,"Lawyers. The ideal setting for a story of good versus evil. And Pacino is the perfect man to play Milton, the head of the powerhouse law firm who seems to know everyone who is anyone. Keanu Reeves, one hell of an actor who apparently doesn't listen to advice when it comes to picking roles (The Day The Earth Stood Still remake, Johnny Mnemonic, etc.), found the right role with Pacino. The two of them go hand in hand like ham and eggs. For the toast and orange juice, add Charlize Theron and Tamara Tunie, and don't forget the strawberry jam, Jeffrey Jones as Eddie Barzoon. This cast is perfect, and the story moves quickly to keep you caught up in the action. Pacino, master of the soliloquy, is magnificent, and seems to enable the rest to bring their performances up to his level.

Smart in its use of the devil as its villain--and great performances. *** out of ****,"THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE (1997) ***Starring: Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, Charlize Theron, Craig T. Nelson, Connie Nielsen, and Jeffrey Jones Director: Taylor Hackford  144 minutes  1997  Rated RBy Blake French:""The Devil's Advocate"" is like an HBO Friday night guilty pleasure movie. It gets so many things right on the money, from suspense to gore to how the devil really does work. Most of the time movies exaggerate monsters and myths, legends and killings. But Taylor Hackford gets his information correct: Satan is not a red colored monster with horns and a spiky tail, but a deceptive, conniving, individual in disguise and lives everywhere. Thus, ""The Devil's Advocate"" is so smart it's scary.The story is something to see. It is so wonderful and evenly laid out. It stars Keanu Reeves as Kevin Lomax, a young successful defense lawyer who, with his wife Mary Ann (a flawless and emotionally charged Charlize Theron), has recently moved to New York in order to hit it big with his occupation.And that is exactly what happens. He soon stumbles upon a powerful man named John Milton in charge of the cities biggest and best defense attorneys. He offers Kevin a deal, a beautiful office, a competitive wage, and bang, he his in goodÂbut he doesn't know yet how good he actually is in yet.Then things begin to happen. Bad things. Horrible things. Mostly to Mary Ann, Kevin's wife who has meet a friend, Christabella, who isn't quite who she seems to be. Then come the experiences: She hears someone in the house while alone at night that turns out to be a small child who isn't quite as innocent as she seems. Then the visions of people being brutally killed appear in her mind. Then the loneliness, such a big, cold apartment with no husband to share it with, for he is always at work.  Such things may or may not lead to other events that trigger an involving series of happenings which make this subplot almost more interesting that the real story itself.Then come the criminals who the wondering Kevin witness as they walk away from a case that surly points to their guilt. And then the temptations that he is lured with every day at work. It is when his wife doesn't something drastic when he questions just exactly is his new boss, and where exactly did he come from.The film is very interesting from beginning to end, and is certainly different than your typical horror/slasher movie. This one doesn't overdue the gore, but puts in more than enough to turn a head. The violence is harsh and cruel, only proving what powers this character in control has. The sexual orientation is a bit over the top, and yes, this film is adult with every atom of it's being, but to put in such copious amount of nudity and sexual content is still a little much. But once again, is only present to make clear that the devil works with enticement and lust, rather than sucking his victims in with force.Al Pacino is delicious and devilishly on target as Satan himself; I personally could not think of someone better to cast. He is, however, a little aggressive. The film works because of the way it uses the devil as its protagonist.  But Pacino seems to push the evil and demonic qualities, like his voice at times, and kind of destroys the concept of why this movie succeeds. Don't get me wrong, his performance is near perfect, but a little off the film's accomplishment.Keanu Reeves is well casted also. He performs confidentially like a real lawyer would, and seems to be knowledgeable in his territory. I also found Charlize Theron's performance to be superb. And going from this to ""Might Joe Young"" is an awful big change in pace. But this performance not only proves that she can conquer characters in horror thrillers better than family adventures, but also that she can perform with depth and depression, with feeling and emotional impact. I find her Oscar capable.There is one major problem in ""The Devil's Advocate"" that struck me as a shock. The film runs well over two hours and gets pretty tedious at times. But the flaw comes with the film's finale: the movie builds up so much for a powerful confrontation between Lomax and Hilton a.k.a. Satan at the end, that it somehow actually finishes in an ending that lasts but ten minutes, and only succeeds to prove it's overall message: you can't mess with a man's free will. There Is character tension, but it is used with dialogue instead of physical contact, and only the last fragment accomplishes anything that it should. This closing is mostly a disappointment. But that's permissible because I am not recommending ""The Devil's Advocate"" for the closing scenes, but for the acting, the cleverness of the story, and the use of Satan as its villain, in an altogether adequate movie on Taylor Hackford's credits.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Double Fall,"""The Devil's Advocate,"" (1997). Starring Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves. Directed by Taylor Hachford. Written by (Andrew Neiderman (novel), John Lemkin (screenplay) and others.
The key to this movie is characterization through name. The antagonist's name is John Milton. Milton wrote the epic poem ""Paradise Lost"" in the 17th century. Milton's poem is granted the full status of a single course at UWF, my alma mater. However, the reputation of the professor who taught the course had me scurrying about trying to satisfy curriculum requirements without having him affect my grade point. Yet, watching TDA last night had me regretting not taking Milton and Paradise Lost, the only literary work this class was devoted to. But having a slight acquaintance with the fall of Adam and Eve story and a smidgen of Satan and the Fall from grace from the Bible, I was able to garner a glimpse of the narrative that the voice of the screenplay was evoking.
This movie is about temptation and susceptibility to it. Satan knows your weaknesses, and he will bring you to low places using your weaknesses to exalt in the power the fall gives him. Satan sees only that man's vanity causes him to fall. Satan does not see that his vanity requires your sacrifice and subjegation to his will. He is in competition with God for your soul.
So we have what Milton called the Double Fall as the leitmotif of this film.
Al Pacino as Satan was superb. Keanu Reeves as Satan's mark, so well done. I could see myself in Satan's cross hairs at the time I was in Los Angeles. Pure evil all around me. And I could see that Mary's acumen was the same as my own. Fortunately, I was able to leave ""hell.""
Once you know what is going on, you will find this story applicable in your life. And you will have an awareness of when you are being set up and how to avoid it. The motto of the Catholic Church is ""All Is Vanity."" Best give it up! This film is on Netflix. I give it 5 of 5 stars. Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Perfect Rental Movie,"The 90's were nothing like movies of today or the past decade. Movies were so good, and actors truly talented, that one like The Devil's Advocate fell far down the list of ""must sees"". And rightly so.That doesn't diminish what a fun, weird, and unforgettable movie Devil's Advocate was, and is. This was the perfect rental movie, perhaps with a date. It had mystery, suspense, unforgettable and amazing scenes, twists, turns, and even some very relevant deeper themes if one wishes to analyze.Despite Pacino's riveting performance, unfortunately it falls apart in the third act, devolving into an entertaining, but far-fetched fantasy feature, which was disappointing because everything before that was realistic and buyable, even in the biblical sense.However, when rooms start melting, walls start shifting with scores of dead bodies maneuvering through the room, it becomes too farcical.

Epic train-wreck,"It is with mixed feelings that i review this movie. Simply because every time i re-watch it i get a different feeling about it. Sometimes it's just awful, other times it's close to entertaining. I guess it depends mostly on what mood i'm in.This movie actually starts out pretty good in my opinion. This is definitely one of Keanu Reeves least embarrassing performances, at least the first hour or so of the movie. He's still stiff as a wooden board and about as exciting, but it fits his character. He's the hillbilly hotshot lawyer from a back water in Florida who has never lost a case. And now he gets the chance to go to New York and play with the big boys. And the biggest boy of them all is an adrenaline-pumped Al Pacino. It seems that every other movie or so Al Pacino goes off (or on?) his medication and suddenly turns into a freak show all of his own. Watch ""Scent of a woman"" for another example of this. Here he is over the top most of the time. Barely just pausing to catch his breath.The movies main topics are sex, expensive wallpaper and Satan. And of course Keanu showing off what a damn fine lawyer he is. And before the end the whole story crashes like a train wreck of epic proportions. And the mad driver on the crashing train is an Al Pacino on speed.This movie certainly has some entertainment value. And the first half it also has some potential.

Playing with Temptation: The Devil's Advocate as a Mirror Image of Our Vices,"Taylor Hackford's excellent painting was a revelation to me. A discovery in many ways. An excellent story and production, the most worthy work of several now iconic actors at once, gorgeous videos and audio sequences. All this is the Devil's Advocate. A film that will show the inside of the human self, regardless of any norms and rules.Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), a young and successful lawyer, never loses a case. His career is skyrocketing, and when he receives an offer from the largest law firm in New York, it seems like an incredible chance. His new boss, John Milton (Al Pacino), captivates Lomax with his charisma and promises of huge opportunities. However, the deeper Kevin delves into the world of high stakes, the more he begins to doubt the true nature of his boss and the price of success. Questions of morality and temptation are becoming more acute, and Kevin is faced with a choice that could change his life forever.The main theme of the painting, in my opinion, is the issues of temptation - the eternal struggle between good and evil, which is reflected in every person. Kevin Lomax embodies the very point of choice when a person stands at a crossroads between morality and his own ambitions. The film explores how far we are willing to go for success and power, and how our decisions can destroy not only ourselves, but also those who are dear to us. The greatness of this story is that it presents philosophical questions within the framework of an exciting thriller, while simultaneously entertaining the viewer with an intriguing plot and forcing them to think about deep moral dilemmas.As mentioned above, one of the most striking aspects of the film is the amazing acting. Al Pacino as John is simply mesmerizing. His Milton is not just a boss, he is the embodiment of a diabolical charisma that attracts and scares at the same time. His every monologue is full of temptation and guile, and Pacino masterfully conveys this, creating one of the most memorable antiheroes in cinema. Keanu Reeves also copes with the role of Kevin with dignity, clearly demonstrating his inner conflict - from confidence to doubts and worries. Charlize Theron, who played Lomax's wife, adds emotional depth to the film. Her character shows how much loved ones can suffer from the decisions they make. Theron subtly and with feeling conveys the suffering of his heroine, turning every scene with her participation into a real drama.Although ""The Devil's Advocate"" did not collect many prestigious awards, the film was warmly received by audiences and critics, and its popularity has only increased over the years. He became one of the key paintings in Al Pacino's career, confirming his status as an actor with unsurpassed charisma. The film's influence on the genre of legal thrillers and psychological dramas is noticeable to this day, and its philosophical implications continue to be discussed among viewers. The result of the work of the film crew was the main prize in the nomination ""Best Horror Film"" at the Saturn Award. And there are enough horrors in the picture.The musical accompaniment of the film plays an important role in creating the right mood. The famous composer James Newton Howard managed to convey an atmosphere of tension and mysticism through music. The themes accompanying the scenes featuring Pacino create a sense of impending threat, highlighting the sinister nature of his character. The music enhances the dramatic moments and gives the film additional depth, making the scenes more intense and memorable.""The Devil's Advocate"" is now a classic. This is a film that stands out not only for its plot, but also for its deep philosophical component. Strong acting, especially by Al Pacino, emotional dialogues and a fascinating plot make the picture a worthy example of the thriller genre.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This was definately one of the better horror/thriller movies of the 90's.  The film is definately not for all tastes, but horror lovers will eat it up. **** out of *****.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A total '90s classic,"The classic, commonly used phrase is given an entirely new meaning when lawyer Keanu Reeves joins an important law firm headed by the charming, persuasive Al Pacino. Things are simultaneously too good to be true and frighteningly ominous, and before long, we learn why: Al is Satan-or, as he says in his famous, hilarious monologue, ""Call me Dad.""If you like these types of movies that border on horror, but aren't too scary for the faint of heart, this one's a classic. I only hid my eyes a couple of times, during Charlize Theron's demonic hallucinations, so everyone else out there should be fine. For a perfectly devilish Halloween marathon, rent both The Devil's Advocate and The Devil and Daniel Webster. Both are just scary enough so that you go to bed with the willies but aren't given nightmares, both star very handsome men playing the Devil, and Al Pacino cited Walter Huston's performance as his inspiration for the role. It just doesn't work when the Devil isn't played by a handsome, alluring man, does it? So, Al-and Walter, fifty-five years earlier-was perfectly cast. He's very magnetic and persuasive, so it's no wonder the weak-willed Keanu falls under his spell. The Devil's Advocate is so deliciously '90s. Check it out if you've somehow gone this long without seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Giving the Devil his due,"So many films have been made showing the Devil in so many different forms that it was nice to see Pacino as just another human. Of course, this isn't the first time that the Devil has been portrayed as just a man, Ray Milland did a wonderful and sinister turn in Alias Nick Beal and Walter Huston played the role with abandoned glee in The Devil and Daniel Webster. Even Ray Walston did a merry turn in Dam Yankees. But it took Pacino to really ham it up and make us enjoy every minute of it.

Charlize Theron acting better than Al Pacino? I never thought I'd see the day...,"'The Devil's Advocate' works as neither a supernatural thriller nor a courtroom drama Â instead it relies heavily upon excessive content and performances, silly over-the-top concepts and a genuinely unpleasing conclusion, all of which stain an otherwise fairy enjoyable modern-day parable.The movie rambles on far too long about nothing in particular, always thinking it's much cleverer than it actually is. For example, the identity of a mysterious tycoon in New York City, named John Milton (hint-hint), isn't revealed until about 2/3 of the way through the film Â despite the fact that the title of the movie, and all the events therein leading up to this 'revelation,' basically give away the 'secret' from the start. So why in the world didn't anyone realize this during production? Did anyone stop and say, 'I wonder if people will be smart enough to guess who he really is before we expect them toÂ?'If you don't want to know who Milton is, don't read any further. However, if you have an IQ past that of the guy from Sling Blade, you'll probably already realize that John Milton (played by Al Pacino) is the Devil. Lucifer. Satan. 'I have so many names,' he says to hotshot lawyer Keanu Reeves.The story is routine at best Â Milton hires the Aspiring Young Lawyer from Hicksville, U.S.A. to travel to the Big Apple and take on Important Cases. Soon the Lawyer's Wife (Charlize Theron) turns into the Crazy Character That No One Believes, because she thinks Milton is the devil, and they all laugh at her, and her husband laughs at her. HmmÂmaybe everyone on set was consuming laughing gas Â this would explain why the film rarely makes sense and Theron turns in the best performance in a film starringÂAl Pacino? It's almost sad to see him resorting to more yelling and screaming and over-the-top ranting Â Pacino's big speech about God has potential, but he says it all so annoyingly that it begins to grate on the nerves. I don't expect Pacino to play Satan as a calm everyman, but at least he could try and make a consistent character out of the role Â instead of showing up on set, consuming laughing gas and acting like an idiot. (Forgive me, because I actually am an enormous fan of Pacino's work Â but he simply stinks here, and there's no excuse for his poor performance.)'The Devil's Advocate' bears most relation to the supernatural film-noir hybrid, 'Angel Heart,' released a decade prior. That film co-starred Robert De Niro, who handled the role of Satan much better than Pacino Â mainly because although they both acted rather flamboyantly, De Niro had better control. Ever since 'Scent of a Woman' in 1992, Pacino's over-acting has increased to a point of near-nausea Â is this the same guy who so expertly played Michael Corleone and Tony Montana? ""The Panic in Needle Park"" had better acting -- and that was his first major movie!If you can put up with a movie that is over-the-top and excessive and puts the work of Brian DePalma to shame, then maybe you'll be able to stand'The Devil's Advocate.' If you can put up with a movie that wastes the talents of its main performers and leads nowhere but into an unsatisfying apocalyptic massacre of an ending, you might even enjoy this.But if you can put up with a movie that proposes Keanu Reeves is a genius lawyer who's 'never lost a single case,' you deserve to die a very painful death. Please go far away and never return.Just kidding. But seriously Â Keanu Reeves? Tom Green has a better chance",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Best, best, best...","""Devil's Advocate,"" directed by Taylor Hackford, is a gripping and thought-provoking film that delves into the realms of morality, temptation, and the darkness that can reside within us all. The film masterfully weaves together elements of drama, mystery, and supernatural thriller, creating an experience that is both captivating and intellectually stimulating.At the heart of the film is the mesmerizing portrayal of temptation and corruption by Al Pacino, who plays the enigmatic and charismatic character John Milton. His performance is nothing short of brilliant, as he effortlessly navigates between charm and malevolence, leaving the audience both captivated and uneasy.Keanu Reeves, as the young lawyer Kevin Lomax, delivers a strong performance as he navigates a world of power, success, and moral dilemmas. Charlize Theron's portrayal of his wife, Mary Ann, adds emotional depth to the narrative, creating a balance between the supernatural and the human.The film's exploration of the battle between good and evil is enriched by its intricate storytelling. It keeps viewers on the edge of their seats as they follow Kevin Lomax's journey from a small-town lawyer to a high-powered attorney in New York City, all the while facing increasingly challenging ethical decisions.""Devil's Advocate"" delves deep into the psychological and philosophical aspects of human nature, touching on themes of ambition, desire, and the consequences of one's choices. The film's eerie atmosphere, coupled with its stunning visuals and haunting soundtrack, contribute to the overall sense of unease and suspense.In a world where morality is often blurred, ""Devil's Advocate"" forces viewers to confront the complexities of their own beliefs and values. It's a cinematic journey that challenges the mind and leaves a lasting impression, reminding us that the battle between good and evil is not always as black and white as it seems.In summary, ""Devil's Advocate"" is an exceptional film that combines stellar performances, a gripping narrative, and deep philosophical exploration. With its powerful themes and intense atmosphere, it's a must-watch for those who appreciate movies that provoke thought and provide an unforgettable cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Vanity.........,"Its a little bit too polished up. We are being spoon fed here. Thats what stops me from giving it a ten.

This is all about how materialism sucks up your soul away from the precious, most precious things in life that you got to hold on to and give prime importance to. Not because super sexy Al Pacino will come along in what may very well be his peak act as a bad guy, because here he plays THE bad guy with a good explanation and speech/lecture abut a lot of spiritual concerns from the Devil's point of view.

Keanu blossoms from chip board into solid oak.,"The Devils Advocate is a film I thoroughly enjoyed even though it does have Keanu Reeves in it. I'm not Keanu's biggest fan  but loved The Matrix and Point Break and somewhat surprisingly its his performance which made me like Devils Advocate. The film had plenty of surprises and Keanu gives his best performance yet, even if Pacino did appear to be on autopilot throughout the whole film. However Theron is the real star of the show and her mental and physical decline is harrowing to watch.One interesting part of this film is that as you watch you don't know if its going to suddenly turn into a full horror like the omen or persue the more obvious thriller route. At times Keanu does look out of his depth in the acting department, especially next to Pacino and Theron but he carries the film well. Think of a supernatural version of the Firm and you can't go far wrong..........7",,Anonymous,Mystery
I f lawyers live that way I am a crocodile,Lawyers in the Western world seem to be the profession with the most powerful mythology towards the general public. When taking a taxi to reach the court of appeal in my native Greece the taxi driver asked me whether I have seen this film. I just laughed. Series like L.a. Law and movies like that have given the impression to the average movie-goer of the West that lawyers are some form of super-human elite controlling society through their machinations. In reality lawyers in the Balkans are struggling over-populated profession seeking to keep up appearances while other professions without such a tradition of ridiculous pretensions and antiquated conventions offer their practitioners a happier and simpler life.I could not believe that such mythology could be generated nowdays. The sexual politics of the movie are a muddle. The incurssions to horror unsuccessfully.

Great Pacino vehicle...,"This film will appeal to Al Pacino fans (who gives a truly fiery performance), and to those who believe in and/or just interested in the xtian mythology (some of the latter crowd may find the film a bit disturbing, however).  Perhaps unfortunately, the film is entirely lacking in suspense, since we know Pacino's the devil from the beginning... everything draws to a very inevitable conclusion.One thing I didn't find very believable is Keanu Reeve's characters' final action (I won't give it away in case you haven't seen the film).  The guy plays an incredibly self-centered, egomaniacal sort of person, so what he does is pretty unbelievable and out of character... it seems much more likely he'd go ahead and ""strike a bargain,"" so to speak, given his actions & motivations up until nearly the last moments of the film.Just a final observation... I've seen Keanu Reeves playing characters both dead and alive, and amazingly he doesn't look any different ""playing dead"" than he does ""playing alive.""  Sometimes I wonder if Reeves is actually neither dead nor alive... is there something in between?

He definitely has an edge over every actor in this generation. He is a class apart.He has fantastic style and he delivers simple lines with such a punch that they become iconic moments. In every frame here he convinces you that he is Satan. He gives the role the edge it needed and his performance makes this movie supreme. The direction is impeccable.

"When Satan Offers You a Full-Time Job, Say Yes... or Run.","Welcome to The Devil's Advocate, a world where lawyers aren't just sharks - they're literal demons. Kevin Lomax, a young hotshot attorney with an ego as inflated as a Super Bowl football, gets headhunted by Al Pacino, who's playing a corporate Lord of Darkness. What follows is a descent into 1990s New York, where the office spaces shine as brightly as the lawyers' razor-sharp fangs.Al Pacino as Milton is a boss who doesn't just demand quarterly reports - he asks for your soul with every case. His performance? It's like Tony Montana took a philosophy class with Nietzsche, followed by a spiritual retreat in hell. Charismatic, terrifying, and utterly captivating, Pacino delivers a Lucifer worthy of a Michelin star.Keanu Reeves plays Kevin, a legal prodigy but also an ethical fool. He's Neo before the red pill: a guy who thinks he's in control until he realizes his contract includes a ""eternal damnation"" clause. Reeves portrays the tug-of-war between ambition and disillusionment like someone caught between a Ferrari and an 18-wheeler barreling toward him.Charlize Theron is the sacrificial lamb on the altar of her husband's ambitions. Both stunning and tragic, she embodies the slow spiral into madness with a raw intensity that makes you rethink every ""we'll talk about it later"" moment in your relationship. From glamorous trophy wife to a witness of unspeakable horrors, her performance is as gut-wrenching as a rollercoaster on turbo mode.The film is a scathing critique of the corporate world, presented as ""you want the job? Go fetch it in hell."" Lies, betrayal, stepping over others - all done with a Colgate smile in front of the judge. The satire is so corrosive it could rust a titanium pipeline. Yet, The Devil's Advocate remains a gripping thriller, with a suffocating atmosphere and a spine-chilling score to match.This movie is a masterclass in gothic-corporate aesthetics, featuring powerhouse performances and a crystal-clear message: be careful what you wish for, especially if your boss goes by the name Milton.

It's a good movie.  Scary and enjoyable at the same time!,"""The Devil's Advocate"" is another one of those devil movies, like ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Omen"", and ""The Exorcist""(which I thought was very good).  But ""Devil's Advocate"" is very enjoyable.  And although it's very scary at some times, this movie was a lot of fun to watch, and maybe learn from.  It reuses the idea from ""The Exorcist""; the devil is going to take possession of someone, in order to lure and possess the ones most vulnerable to him.  However, ""The Exorcist"" was extremely serious and very tough to deal with after you finished watching it!  ""Devil's Advocate"" has a little change of heart.  It has the cool Al Pacino as the devil, and Keanu Reeves as his victim.   But instead of torturing him, Pacino simply showers him with gifts, money, and of course, women.  The women in this story weave a tapestry of irresistible temptation, which is why I think it had all the nudity in it.  And Al Pacino looks like he's having the time of his life. Pacino is usually serious in his films, but now, he's playing his role with guesto.  The only problem is, Keanu is taking this all too seriously.  He needs to lighten up a bit and attack Pacino with gusto right back.  His overacting makes him seem more vulnerable to Pacino, and to some, less likable.  But the real seriousness of the film is how Keanu proves the ""guilty"" not guilty.  It's horrifyingly true!  We live in a nation where rapists, suspected murderers, and other sickos can weasel their way out of conviction!  And worse yet, the people who are innocent are shafted and at a disadvantage, while the lawyers and criminals can get to the top of a mega-corporation.  We see it in insurance companies, where people go through ""drive-in"" health care, and the insurance managers are millionaires as a result.  It's sickening and morally wrong!  But in our country, we can get away with it!  And people like that, who is symbolized by the Keanu Reeves character, are going to come face to face with the devil in the future! That is my interpretation of it.  I highly recommend this film!  Though I warn you, there might be a few differences in the versions of the film you rent, and the versions of the film you decide to buy.  What I mean is, an ominous statue with people in it, which is seen in Pacino's penthouse, plays a key role in emphasizing the lustful temptation of Keanu.  But, the statue itself is an unauthorized reproduction of sculptor Frederick Hart's art! Hart sued, and in order to release the film on video, they released it as it was in the theatre, and eventually, re-edited the statue for the final video release.  I think that the impact of the statue wasn't as powerful, judging from the fact that the re-edited statue has no people in it!  Luckily, I purchased it on disc at the right time, before the editing took place.  Try to get the original if you can, and enjoy ""The Devil's Advocate""!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Filtered-through-Hollywood morality tale has its moments.,"New York lawyers are actually demons from hell! It's not hard to imagine and a great idea for a movie, but this adaptation of Andrew Neiderman's (more involving) novel is only partly successful, despite the A-list collaboration. So-so allegorical tale follows shallow hotshot Florida lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), who hasn't lost a case, and his beautiful young wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) to a prestigious NY law firm. Kevin is instantly taken under the wing of seductive head honcho John Milton (Al Pacino) and seduced by more than just the money, but the lack of decent morals are a turnoff and his simple-minded wife has an even more miserable time of it. It's because Pacino is actually Satan!The greed-isn't-good theme is old hat, and like Mike Nichol's WOLF, it borrows a lot of vintage horror film ideas, but dodges genre identification. Reeves is better than expected, but still never wholly convincing in a role that requires a stronger actor and Pacino fans will have to have patience, because he's completely restrained until the finale finally lets him rant and rave.

Idea Movie....OK for Timepass,"In the devils advocate, Keanu Reeves plays Kevin Lomax who literally ends up becoming the title character. Small time hotshot lawyer, Lomax gets the job of his lifetime with Milton (Al Pacino with dilated pupils) the most powerful Manhattan lawyer. With pretty wife Mary Ann (an ill looking Charlize Theron) in toe things seem perfect except that his new employer is the devil Lucifer himself! Things begin to turn ugly and Lomax soon realizes that there is a price to pay to work for Milton Â his soul. Al Pacino does well to spew his venom but somehow not enough. Keanu looks confused as always, an expression that has not left him from his 'My Own Private Idaho's ' days while Theron is reduced to being hysterical and showing skin. There is also Connie Nelson as the seductress in the office, bait Milton uses to buy Lomax's soul withÂ if you please.What might confuse people is that what devils advocate actually stands for - is it a supernatural thriller or some sort of a commentary on the declining moral standards of the American legal system or simply a rant against evil corporations. Well actually it could stand for all these and yet not and there in lies the problem, there is no specific focus. At one point of time late in the film the director is busy portraying biblical similarities to just drive in the point that Al Pacino is indeed the devil but by then everyone knows that.Nevertheless the devils advocate is watch able thanks to its elaborate set designs from the over the top finale to the water garden where Milton offers Lomax manhattan and more. Some of the one-liners that Milton shoots like 'Guilt is like a bag of fuc**in' bricks. All ya gotta do is set it down.' also keep you occupied.With an anti climax that most mid nineties movies usually had, the devils advocate will just be remembered as another one of those idea movies where in some out of work scriptwriter decided to write a movie plot after reading the title phrase somewhere.Recommended for a no brainer 'god fearing' Friday night at home.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Give the Devil his due,"The Devil's Advocate is a film which is at times frustrating to watch. It's a movie of fits and starts, never really able to sustain its momentum over the entirety of its clearly bloated running time of almost two and a half hours. A couple of the key performances leave something to be desired. Keanu Reeves is rather stiff and unnatural but that's what you're going to get out of Keanu Reeves. In what was one of her first major roles Charlize Theron never seems entirely comfortable. She's not bad by any means but it's definitely not the kind of assured performance we would see from her later on in her career. The one key player you can't really find fault with is Al Pacino who does have the advantage of playing a role which is absolutely tailor-made for him. You worry that it's a part which may open itself up to the yelling and screaming and histrionics which have marked much of Pacino's later works. But here he plays things with much more calm and subtlety. At least until the climax when there are in fact plenty of histrionics. But for this character at that point in the movie it works. So no complaints there. And by that point the movie could use a little injection of life as things do begin to drag. Even as Pacino begins to go gleefully over the top there's the sense that things are a bit talky. You'd like to see less words, more action. But it works well enough and when the story completes its final twists there's a sense of, at the very least, satisfaction. You haven't seen a great movie but it pulls itself together enough to be deemed a success.The story, which again could use some serious trimming as the movie goes on much too long for its own good, follows small-town Florida lawyer Kevin Lomax who has never lost a case. He is recruited by a major New York law firm so he and his lovely wife relocate to the Big Apple where we see very quickly that things are not necessarily what they seem. The head of the law firm is named John Milton and yes that name should start the alarm bells ringing. Something about this guy isn't right. Who exactly is Milton? Well that's the film's big secret, although if you've seen any of the film's promotional materials it's really not much of a secret at all. Anyhow, Lomax continues to have success but there's always the sense that Milton's pulling all the strings in the background. The interactions between these two characters are critically important and that's one of the film's bigger problems. Because Pacino, playing Milton, is so far and away a better actor than Reeves, playing Lomax, the relationship comes off as incredibly one-sided. Pacino totally owns these scenes and seeing as it's the Reeves character who's set up as the hero of the piece that's problematic. In fact Reeves always comes off second best no matter who's acting opposite him. Jeffrey Jones, Connie Nielsen, Craig T. Nelson...they all get a chance to outshine Reeves and they do just that. Eventually you just have to throw up your hands and say, ""Well, that's Keanu"" and move on. His interaction with Theron, playing his wife, works somewhat better so give him a little credit for that at least.Despite its faults there is much to recommend The Devil's Advocate. It's a smart story, with lots of sharp twists and turns. The production design and visual effects are outstanding, it really is a spectacular looking movie. For whatever quibbles you may have with Reeves the rest of the cast is generally very good. Pacino's the obvious standout but there are plenty of supporting players turning in fine work as well. Yes the movie goes on too long but at least it finally arrives at a satisfying destination. You get the sense the movie could have been a little better, especially if there was a lead actor better equipped to stand toe to toe with Pacino. But ultimately it works well enough to be worth your while.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best film of 1997,"This was a classic Hollywood Movie. It had many different genres blended splendidly together. Excellent acting by Pacino, Theron and a good job from Reeves. Most literate, well directed and written. Was not marketed very well. It is a shame that this movie did not do well at the box office. Well, what do except from people who flock to see ""Something About Mary"" and ""The Waterboy!""",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Somewhat A Mess, But Oh So Intriguing","""The Devil's Advocate"" is a strange motion picture. In some ways, it is a complete and utter mess. Yet, it touches on such interesting themes and contains such great acting that it is tough to rank it as anywhere near ""bad"".For a basic plot summary, ""Devil's Advocate"" sees hotshot lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) move from his small southern practice to the ""big time"" in New York with wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron). Employed by the mysterious John Milton (Al Pacino), Kevin begins to realize that his ""dream job"" may be a bit more complicated (and ultimately cosmic) than he could have possibly imagined.In terms of acting, this film is top-notch through and through. Al Pacino was born to play the nefarious Milton, Reeves gives a solid performance as the conflicted lawyer, and Theron is startling as the mentally-slipping (or is she?) wife. For fans specifically of Pacino watching this film to see one of his ""rants"", you will not be disappointed, either.The conflicting part of the movie, however, lies in its multitude of themes. Such topics as ""God vs. Devil"", ""Innocence vs. Guilt"", ""Small-Town vs. Big City"", ""Ethics vs. Greed"", and ""Husband vs. Wife"" are touched upon. Each theme in and of itself is extremely interesting and could carry the film without the others, but the problem is that they all smooshed together for two and a half hours. Just when you think the movie is about one thing...BAM, it switches to something else. While that filmmaking is admirable in terms of keeping the viewers glued to the screen, director Taylor Hackford could have done a much better job of sorting things out to produce a clean, crisp narrative, instead of one that jumps so often from theme to theme.Overall, this was one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. The acting and plot elements are incredible, but it just tries to do too much and gets lost within itself at times. It could have been epic, but instead (because of those flaws) settles for ""above average"". If you are a Pacino or Reeves fan, or just like movies that will make you think, ""The Devil's Advocate"" is very much worth a viewing. It may not fit together perfectly, but you'll be thinking about it long after the TV is turned off.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Behold! I send you out as sheep amongst the wolves!,"Ultimately it will be up to you which wins out in this film: Al Pacino's attempt to elevate it or Keanu Reeves' attempt to sink it. Pacino does a splendid job as Satan himself and is aided by the best writing in the movie. We are treated to Satan's own views on good and evil and it is fascinating. Reeves appears to be - as he did in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" - foregoing all of the complexities in acting and portraying a single feeling at a time. Angry Keanu! Sad Keanu! Confuuuused Keanu! It's frustrating to see Al Pacino attempting to play off of him and being forced to carry the scenes by himself.The overall writing is fairly standard with moments of brilliance. The supporting acting is pretty good, especially Charlize Theron. The cinematography and special effects work quite well.This is a good one to catch on HBO and even rent if you like Pacino.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Are you the devil in disguise?,The film opens with a scene featuring the corrupt but brilliant lawyer skillfully defending an criminal(rapist) and cross examining the victim a young girl in her adolescence or younger. AS the scene progresses into transposes itself and vanishes as our lead role goes to the lavatory for a short break. Here the story of one mans unbelievable power of words begins to attract the attentions of the Satan as he begins to see him as a perfect addition to his family. The unsuspecting lawyer is then attracted towards his lair by one favour after another the promises of an opulent and lavish lifestyle the fantastic salary its all just to much for our naturally material minded human. This film has an incredible plot where slowly but surly our man starts to believe in something he would of considered unthinkable Paccino is absolutely flawless in his performance and virtually every member of the cast portrays there characters convincingly accurate.

Running with the devil,"This movie has a very original plot, and it also contains enough layers to stay interesting throughout. The many story developments keep it moving at a good pace, and at times the director really pulls of some really great things. The confrontation at the end is just an instant classic scene, amazing in every way. And I might be kicking in an open door here, but Al Pacino is a very good actor. His portrayal of Milton/Satan is perfect, he's threatening and dark but you can still buy that people trust him, it's a subtle performance that makes this movie. However, part of this story seems a bit contrived. Why are these protagonists so extremely excited about moving to New York? They nearly faint when they see their new apartment, I'm having a difficult time believing a Florida lawyer winning 64 times in a row has is that bad back home. The ending is also let's say, an acquired taste. I personally am not really that into it. Nonetheless, this is an excellent, delightfully dark occult thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Freaky!,"The movie was indeed freaky but it was good in a twisted way. Al Pachino, was great (if you ask me), he definetly did a wonderful job portraying the devil. Keano Reeves was as usual- ok, but he was pretty good too. Charlize Theron was actually very good in my taste. The plot itself was very good yet twisted, the near ending where Keano... well I won't say, but when there is all the fire was very good and the freakiest scene of the movie. Though the real ending (the last scene) kinda confused me, though it was good.

Absolute Peak Cinema. Best Film All Time,"For years and years, this phenomenal piece of art has rightfully remained my clear favorite. It isn't just a fleeting admiration; it's a deep-seated appreciation that has grown with time. The concept, the execution, the idea, and the acting are all beyond impressive, each element contributing to a masterpiece that feels almost otherworldly. It's the kind of film that resonates on a deeper level, offering an unearthly experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. Avoiding watching this film is one of the most profound mistakes a man can do, as it would mean missing out on something truly extraordinary and unique, something that transcends typical cinematic experiences. The artistry involved in every frame, the meticulous attention to detail, and the sheer brilliance of the performances combine to create a cinematic gem that stands the test of time. There's a magic in this film that captures the viewer's imagination, drawing them into a world that feels both real and very very surreal. The narrative weaves a tapestry of emotions, ideas, and visuals that are unparalleled, and every viewing reveals new layers of depth and meaning. It's not just a film; it's an experience, an exploration of the human spirit and the possibilities of storytelling.

MY REVIEW: The Advocate of Antichrist!!,"This movie can't be fit in single genre. It is drama, thriller, fantasy, horror and many genres in one. That's where it scores, it keeps you surprising every now and then by not following rules. The whole idea of a hot shot lawyer having Satan as his new boss is winner. The great Al Pacino gets himself to play a ruthless Antichrist and Keanu as lawyer does good. Both leading ladies Connie Nielsen and Charlize Theron look ravishing and act very well. On imagination front movie scores big time but it losses you where it goes over the top in the climax and does not provide all answers in the end. Movie is fast paced giving you little time to breath through and there is lot of not so required on your face adultery. All in all, if you are looking for a thriller drama that is imaginative by a distance then your search is over.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Vanity is my favourite sin.,"Young hotshot Florida lawyer Kevin Lomax is lured to New York to work for a powerful law firm run by John Milton. With his wife Mary-Ann in tow, everything at first seems idyllic. But Mary-Ann starts to see unpleasant things and all may not be quite what it seems with Milton and his all powerful operation.Starring Al Pacino {Milton}, Keanu Reeves {Kevin} and Charlize Theron {Mary-Ann} and directed by Taylor Hackford {An Officer and a Gentleman}, The Devil's Advocate is adapted from the novel written by Andrew Neiderman. Going for a more traditional style of story telling as opposed to a heavy effects laden one, Hackford's movie was met with a mixed reception by critics and horror aficionados alike. Not surprisingly, because although it has horror elements in it, the film is more a cunningly crafted thriller embracing ethics, power, sex and prestige. All structured around a classical type villain and his new favourite protÃ©gÃ©e. A touch overlong, the film however is always interesting, be it Mary-Ann's slow decent into borderline madness, or the legal and court room morality on show. There is a lot to take in and enjoy here, even stuff to admire.Pacino gives one of his effervescent performances as Milton, and it's not hard to see why he was tempted in to take on this role. He gets to swagger with a glint in his eye, and the finale gives him license to shout a lot. Vintage Pacino really. Reeves is the perfect foil to Pacino's scene stealing's, and a pre-famous Theron is gorgeous and really heartfelt in what is the films pivotal character. Good support comes from Jeffrey Jones, Connie Nielsen and Craig T. Nelson. To leave a good film working from a good source story, to which The Devil's Advocate rewards if one can lower horror expectations and expect a more genre molded picture. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""Vanity Is My Favourite Sin!""","""The Devil's Advocate"" is an excellent allegoric film about human vanity and the dangerous paths it can lead. Kevin Lomax (Reeves) is a very successful lawyer in a small rural town. At some point, he finds himself in a case defending a professor accused of child molesting, whom he realizes that he is actually guilty. Despite his hesitations, he finally accepts to keep the case, and against all odds, he wins it; this immediately prompts a job offer by a big law firm in NY. As soon as he goes there with his wife Mary-Ann (Theron) he is immediately impressed and awed by his new employer firm, and especially by its charismatic yet somehow eccentric senior partner, John Milton (Pacino). Everything is very fascinating in the beginning, as Kevin and Mary-Ann are enjoying their newly acquired riches, while Kevin is speedily climbing the ladder of fame and success. However, he quickly realizes that things are not what they appear, and Milton is much more devilish than he first seemed; too devilish, in fact...Al Pacino gives a great performance as always, while Keanu Reeves is also very good in his role. However, Charlize Theron is the one who definitely steals the show, with her acting as confused and progessively destabilized Mary-Ann being really amazing; the scene in the psychiatric clinic especially, is one in which she shows her big talent. The direction is also very good, integrating the natural with the ""paranormal"" elements of the film in a very concrete and effective form.There are many reasons to watch this great film; among them, I would mention Pacino's fantastic and well-placed quotes, such as: ""The virtue of the devil is in his loins!"", or ""Vanity is my favourite sin!"". 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""They must want you pretty bad""""It's time to step up and take what's yours"".","This movie is about a talented lawyer that knows exactly what to do to win cases. But his ambitions get the better of him and things start to get weird. This film isn't as impressive as I was expecting it to be, but it's still a pretty darn good movie. With everything interwoven in a really good manner. I never really thought of Keanu Reeves as a phenomenal actor but he is alright in this movie and fit decently. He played the manipulative lawyer and intelligent lawyer really well. Although Keanu Reeves takes up most of the screen time, the real scene stealer is Al Pacino. In fact Al Pacino is what makes this movie engaging, sort of. Even if Al Pacino first refused this role because he wanted to get paid more and the cool actor Keanu took some money out from his own account in order to get Al Pacino into this film. Now lawyers are known to some as liar and this is the premise of the movie with lies and greed. And this all adds up to evil and the consequences of this and the message is basically about how there is aspects of the devil in all of us. Well mostly temptation for most people. But we all have choices, in fact life is about choices and we are accountable for our decisions. Now I found this movie to be a bit mediocre but as the film comes close to the end, it really does pick up. Although that ain't saying much since majority of this is mediocre, but the as the film comes close to the end it really started to become intriguing. Now I can see why some people would think the final speech Al Pacino's character gives in the movie to be magnificent, but it's old and it's a philosophy that has been done before. But on the other hand there is charisma the way Al Pacino's character delivers it, and many bad men in the past had charisma. And the main reason I found why some people would root for Al Pacino's character is the aspect of his speech when he claims ""I'mï»¿ a fan of man---I'm a humanist"". Even if it's stupid for people to claim to have become a satanist because of the final speech scene. I will give credit the way it's delivered is done well. Again this film proves why Al Pacino is a extraordinary actor. Keanu is alright but Nic Cage would have been a better choice.7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Devil made me do it.,"How many times do we do something wrong and rather than take personal responsibility we find an excuse, usually, ""the devil made me do it""? This compelling story about an attorney who must win at all cost shows that man is not some puppet being controlled by an invisible force. We have choice and can choose good or evil. Our choice depends on our motivation, on our prerogative, usually, what is best for ""me"". God and the Devil, aware of this human trait, exploit it to their enjoyment. What else do you think they do for fun? No matter what choice we make God or the Devil wins. There are only two choices in life, good or evil. We must choose one. The one great thing about this film, is that it re-asserts for me that we are never forced by God or Satan to act. We are merely presented with opportunities and we take our pick. Perhaps God and the Devil keep score. I believe they are very competitive in nature but would not go as far as to choose for us. There would be no fun in that now, would there?

EXCELLENT PREMISE BUT,The Devil is the head of a large law firm. Don't we all know that? A young promising attorney seems to be on the brink of selling his soul to join the firm. This would work as a serious drama and maybe it could as a comedy but the casting of Keanu Reeves in the lead ruins any chance that it could make it either way. Reeves like Kyle McGlaughin is a wonderful android as far as his range as an actor goes. His emotionless script reading could let him play a good accountant or maybe he could do a parody of himself in the future if they ever revive Leslie Neilson's comedy roles. But for now his presence and DeNiro's tendency to overact ruin what is a good screen play. The ending is also too predictable and a wonderful plot is wasted.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Keanu was his usual quirky goofy self but was also very entertaining and fit the confused and stressed lawyer role well. And an early look into Charlize Theron who was also fantastic playing the typical female losing her mind role but with edge and genuine intrigue.

Wall Street meets Angel Heart - impressive moral tale,"Very surprised and impressed by this film, which I really hadn't expected much from. Pacino goes for a far straighter devil than de Niro's in Angel Heart, and where he misses out on de Niro's egg-peeling creepiness he more than makes up for in bulgy-eyed intensity. He also out-charms Michael Douglas' moral black hole in Wall Street. The movie is very effective, following the old evil-is-something-you-do-not-something-you-are track, and all the more intriguing for setting its story not too far from reality. OK so not every corporate bigwig is in league with the pointy-tailed one, but most of the stuff that went on here wasn't all that fantastic (until the final few scenes) - a bored housewife slowly goes mental, some nasty people do some nasty crimes and try to get off with an expensive lawyer, people doing stupid things get in trouble (running across busy streets without looking, running alone in dodgy parks, trying to pick a fight with Al Pacino...). Keanu is the man put in the position of being offered masses of cash to do things most people would think of as immoral, something which happens all the time in this world...Those around him are callous and vicious, hardened by the high pressure, low moral world of the extremely wealthy. Pacino's devil is more like a metaphor for the corrupting influence of wealth, greed and power than a supernatural religious creature, a bad influence sitting on everyone's shoulders telling them what they can have if they're not too scrupulous about it. A well-told fable on the dangers inherent in exposing the souls of mankind to vastly greater wealth and power than their fellows.On the downside, Keanu's accent seems decidedly weak even to a foreigner, and it very nearly blows it right at the end, I almost expected Peter Ustinov to start dancing with some children it was so pat-Hollywood-happy-ending, but it saved itself with a killer last line. As to all those people complaining about ""excessive"" violence and nudity, it was actually a lot less gory than I'd anticipated, with just a few brief moments, mostly involving Charlize Theron, which were very graphic and quite harrowing, but had to be there to give a clear idea of how 'horrific' the world can be, and the nudity was important too - lust is as compelling a desire as greed, one that often involves as much cruelty and abuse of others, and can if unleashed from the conscience lead to great evil. This surely needs to be shown as much as anything else, and all those prissy little puritans upset by the sight of a pair of tits should just grow up, get over it and check out what this has to say about the things you should really worry about. Don't let that ending get you down though.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great film and fun to watch, all around greatness","The entire time i was watching this movie i was entertained.I saw this movie in the 90's in theater and thought it was good then forgot about it, 14 years later see it at again.I love Al Pacino and he is such a versatile actor. Keanu reeves was in freakin every thing in the 90's, the pair was perfect.Any way so the plot of this movie is timeless. A man verse good and evil.He has a job where morals are in question all the time, and has everything pulling at his from all angles.I don't want to ruin it for you so thats all im going to say.

A very good movie with some very nice acting and a clever story,"Even though Taylor Hackford isn't the most famous or best-known director in Hollywood (he has only directed 13 movies until now), he sure deserves everybody's attention. With his latest movie ""Ray"" he became very popular, but even with movies like ""Dolores Claiborne"" and ""The Devil's Advocate"" he has proved to be capable of making some great movies...""The Devil's Advocate"" is a movie about Kevin Lomax, a young, seemingly unbeatable lawyer from a small town in Florida. When he gets the chance of a lifetime to work for a big law firm in New York, he doesn't have to think twice. Together with his wife Mary Anne and against his mother's approval, he accepts the offer, and the money and immense apartment that come along with it. But soon Mary Anne starts feeling homesick and begins to dislike the city and Kevin's job as he pays less and less attention to his wife and she starts to witness devilish apparitions. It seems to Kevin like she is loosing her grip on reality, but soon enough he'll find out about John Milton's true identity and the reason why he wanted Kevin as his protÃ©gÃ©...What I like most about this movie, next to the excellent portrayal of this fine story, is the performance of Al Pacino. He plays that role of Satan so excellent, that I'm convinced that there isn't any other actor who could have done it better than him. That refined, devilish and charming character of John Milton, together with Pacino's facial expressions is absolutely brilliant. But Al Pacino wasn't the only actor in this movie of course. The other actors did a very nice job too. Keanu Reeves is nice to watch as the hotshot lawyer and Charlize Theron's fine performance was very prominent in this movie, even though she had a smaller role.As I already said, the portrayal of the story is also very nice. There are people who say that there was too much nudity and sexual content to be seen in it, but personally I didn't have any problems with that. Yes, there is some nudity to be seen and yes there are a couple of sexually inspired scenes, but than again, this is a movie about Satan, not about God. If you want to see little cherubs flying around, I suggest you try another movie. But even though the entire movie and its story are very nice, I was a little bit disappointed by the ending. It isn't bad, but somehow it seemed a bit like the ending had to be done in a hurry, because they didn't have much time left. The rest of the movie has been well developed, but the finale takes only about ten minutes. Still, don't let that make you think that the movie isn't worth to be seen. It's a very good movie with some very nice acting and a clever story and that's why I give it an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Almost a Perfect Movie!  Excellent! Pacino is at his best,"Excellent!, intelligent, absolutely well obtained; these feelings came out after i saw the movie; absolutely impressive as the story keeps going and you're forced to think and find out the meaning of the movie in an intelligent way, simply incredible. Pacino's acting is powerful, strong. I felt some of the great and young Pacino of the Godfather I and II coming back (this Pacino was hidden somewhere). The way that temptations are shown, heaven and hell mixed at the same place and the chance of choice between good and bad actions (like the Matrix problem...""choice""), and an intelligent story that has to be seen, without distracting, to reach the top of an extremely good script, is a total pleasure to the viewer.About the Movie: Keanu Reeves plays Kevin Lomax (a name that suits well for the actor) an attorney from Florida that is well respected and who hasn't lost a case. He is the well respected and successful men that anyone want to be, with a lovely and beautiful wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron), Lomax will to win all cases get him even to defend a guilty professor from child abuse charges. An important firm held at the big apple saw his success and decide to hire him as one of the main lawyers of the company. The firm ruled by John Milton (Al Pacino), put great and difficult cases to Kevin with important and wealthy clients; while, his wife start to feel depressed and empty with this luxurious life, but they are drawn into Milton's world deeply. The story evolves in an interesting an intelligent plot that will give answers to the name of the movie.9/10!, the only thing that didn't liked me is that the plot is hard to understand sometimes and you can get lost easily in the script.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Thumbs up for Pacino & script, Thumbs down for everything else","First of all, Pacino.  For big bucks, this is probably the best performance as an actor as Satan in a movie.  Although John Glover is just as effective, without the hammy overacting/ranting, in ""Brimstone"" (1998).  Pacino's performance is a tour de force.Although a lot of it is Pacino, the role of the Devil is also nicely scripted.  You kinda think that this is what Satan would really be like - just one of the guys, really.  A guy who knows what he wants and goes gets it, all with a perfect contempt for the Almighty.  After all, as they noted in ""Bedazzled"" (another source of much of the Satan portrayal here), God won't even let you undress in private.Unfortunately, surrounding Pacino is...well, nothing.  Mr. Reeves is his normal enigmatic obtuse, emotionally bland self. Nothing is really conveyed of the character other than that he's a self-centered jerk.  Which, granted, is kinda Satan's point in the first place.The rest of the characterization is...eh.  Characters come, characters go, characters brutally die.  Naked women cavort before us, which I can kinda get into, but it doesn't really contribute much.  And what's with the demon faces?  Is Satan possessing them?  Have they given themselves over to Satan? What has Mary Ann got that lets her see these ""faces""?And the ending...arrgh.  A 100% copout.  I thought this kind of stuff went out with ""Dallas,"" but no such luck.  There's a (mild) twist at the very end.  Basically, they might as well have had Keanu click his ruby slippers together and say, ""There's no place like home.""Overall, because I'm big on the whole good/evil God/Satan dichotomy, I gave this a marginal ""thumbs up.""  But catch any given episode of ""Brimstone"" (yeah, right, after Fox cancelled it in Spring '99) and you can see much the same thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Vanity, definitely my favorite sin.","I was initially dismissive of this film; it was only the ending I truly enjoyed, thanks to Al Pacino's epic speech, Keanu Reeve's epic solution, and all the epic special effects that came out of the woodwork (or stonework as the case may be). While those few things jumped out at me, I regarded the rest of the film as a rather dry and boring procedure, bogged down by all kinds of dialogue and drama.Upon repeat viewings, I learned to appreciate the film more. It does break up the monotony with the occasional fright scene, the occasional bit of sex and violence, and some interesting stylistic flourishes.Above all, the story is very interesting. It does a terrific job of tying together courtroom drama with theology, drawing parallels with universal morality and cosmic justice. Thanks to the film's fantastic conclusion, it pulls it all off sublimely, and leaves enough room for thought and interpretation. The plot is well-developed, characters are decent, and the occasional subplot helps reinforce the overall story and drama.The film has solid photography and editing, even if it does seem a little plain at times. Acting is fantastic: Al Pacino easily steals the show as the title character, while Keanu Reeves does his best to be earnest, and Charlize Theron flexes some impressive acting muscle. Writing is quite smart. This production has fine-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects.

Too deep for most people!,"The Devil's Advocate is in my top favorite movies of all times. I first saw it at the theater in 1997 and since then I knew that most people had missed the mark on what this movie really is. If you judge it as a drama, expecting action and obvious knee jerkers you may be disappointed. This movie is about humanity and life, good and evil and how our choices are dictated by seduction. The movie is full of wisdom, message and imagery. It shows how we get all kinds of signs before we choose but we still choose wrong because most of us put what feels good before what is right for us. We choose a beautiful woman or man over a wise one. We choose rich friends over loyal ones etc. Keanu Reeves is not one of my favorite actors but he's right for this role because he's supposed to be a young, innocent, ambitious man who is about to face so many conflicting things and at times he doesn't realize what's hitting him. So he has that natural confused Keanu look on his face. The cast is excellent with Al Pacino being perfect as satan in the flesh. Tamara Tunie, Connie Nielsen and Charlize Theron are just so good to watch. When watching this movie now, I can pause it and reflect on what I just heard or watched and it makes me realize even more how big this movie is, maybe too big for most mere mortals.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This film could have just been a rehash of everything else that has ever been made by Hollywood concerning the subject of religon as entertainment. There is a lot of nudity in this picture, but I think it is warranted. I mean the devil deals with matters of the flesh in this film. The nudity, sex and violence are all tastefully done and never exploitive. Al Pacino plays Satan with calm and confidence.

Tremendous fun,"Never believable for a second, but was it supposed to be?Devil's Advocate is a surreal folk story about a hotshot lawyer headhunted by a mysterious law firm. He's got a pretty perfect record, so on moving to New York he starts to become big business. Pacino is Milton, the boss of the new company, and as usual, he exudes charisma like it were going out of fashion. Clearly having a ball, he obviously enjoyed playing a character who always seems to be one step ahead. Reeves, Lomax, is the weak spot in this movie, with a role giving him the chance to prove he's more than a surfer dude with a penchant for 'whoa'. Unfortunately he struggles with his part, putting on a pretty hammy Texan accent which makes him look like he's contriving every word. Theron's his wife, Mary Anne, and puts on an understandably overacted show as a woman who can't cope with the strange goings-on around her.The plot's daft, and the movie never takes itself seriously for a second. Consequently as hokum, it's pretty darn good.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Superb Pacino in suspenseful, well-crafted, often smart movie","Is ""The Devil's Advocate"" a masterpiece?  Certainly not.  Is it a profound philosophical treatise on good and evil?  Uh, no.  It's a well-made, effective thriller that is definitely worth the price of the rental if only for Al Pacino's magnificent performance as John Milton, the powerful New York lawyer.  (""I'm a little more than that, Kevin."")  Pacino does NOT overact -- he is quite low-key when it's called for, and even in episodes where the screenplay could easily make him sound bombastic, there isn't a single false note in his performance.  His charisma and magnetism are such that it's not hard to imagine falling under this Devil's spell!Keanu Reeves is decent here -- I don't think he has much talent, but his performance as the up-and-coming lawyer Kevin Lomax, who becomes Milton's protege, is quite competent and does not drag the movie down.  (Though, after seeing ""The Firm,"" I wished they'd given the Kevin Lomax role to Tom Cruise -- who, IMHO, is very overrated, but he sure is a better actor than Keanu.)  I was very impressed by Charlize Theron as Kevin's wife Mary Ann; she does a good job of portraying her character's evolution from exuberant small-town girl to a guilt-ridden woman tormented by horrible visions.The story was very well-crafted.  Some of the ""Rosemary's Baby"" stuff was overdone (like that whole scene with the baby playing with Mary Ann's ovaries -- yecch!), but the special effects with people morphing into demons were good and actually scary.  One of the things I liked about the way the story developed was that while Kevin was being tempted, Milton (as he points out in his speech toward the end) not only never made him do anything and left all the decisions to him, but gave him every opportunity to bow out and do the right thing.Unlike some people, I liked the finale a lot.

A clever film with a clever twist,"If you have seen the trailer or any promotional material for this film you will generally know the rough story of it. I won't tell you the in depth story of the film but I will tell you the story before it is actually all revealed, the trailer gives far too much away of the final act which breaks the surprise of the conclusion.The film starts with Kevin Lomax (Reeves) defending a paedophile school teacher who is clearly guilty. Lomax manages to win the case and it is then revealed that he has won every case he has fought in. After winning this latest one, he heads out to celebrate with his wife Mary-Anne (Theron) where he is approached with an offer from a firm in New York who want his help picking a jury. Due to the financial gain, Lomax and his wife take the plunge and move to New York, where Lomax's great work in picking a jury see him lead the line defending a possible triple homicide case and moving into a top end fifth avenue apartment. This is a man at the pinnacle of his career, with a gorgeous wife and now a glorious apartment in one of the most attractive cities in the world. What could possibly go wrong?As Lomax begins to grow into his new job, and work under the supervision of his new boss John Milton (Pacino) things do take a turn for the worse. Mary-Anne begins to feel lonely and craves the baby that could make her life complete, however Kevin's concentration remains on his job. This forces Mary-Anne to socialise with the other lawyer's wives and partners. One day when they are out shopping, Mary-Anne begins to hallucinate and the wives begin to turn into demonic figures. She decides to lock herself in her apartment, where things start to become much worse for her in the hallucination stakes, as well as in the neglect from her preoccupied husband. On the side of his concentration on his job, Kevin begins an infatuation with a co-worker, who he envisions whilst having sex with his wife. His neglect doesn't go unnoticed by Mary-Anne and she slowly begins to free fall into possible schizophrenia, with her ending up in a metal hospital. Has Kevin let his life spiral out of control due to his job, his new boss, or himself?The film is very clever, even if it does become a little supernatural at the end. The courtroom set up works really well, and the fact that the 'demons' belong amongst lawyers seems to be sending out a hidden message. The story here has been developed well and the writing is top drawer. There are many twists and turns in the film, and I'm sure many of you are aware of the outcome, that slowly bring the story to its final conclusion. At several points throughout it is hinted towards what is going on, and the only person that doesn't see it is Kevin. You will find out when you watch it why that is though. Everything pulls together well and it is a real intriguing watch.Al Pacino is fantastic as John Milton, and when you hit the conclusion you will understand how brilliantly he portrays his character. The cinematography also aids in his character with many red lights and dark shadows really highlighting him, as well as Pacino's devilish smile. Theron is also great as the psychologically frail wife. Her emotional ride is clearly visible as the film goes on and she also shines in possibly the most horrific scene in the film, one that forced my jaw to the floor and my hand over my mouth. It was shocking. Keanu Reeves on the other hand plays Keanu Reeves. At times his portrayal works, especially in the final half of the film, however his accent becomes more of an annoyance and his delivery of his line make his performance even more wooden. Another actor may have done the character more justice, but Reeves is known for acting like that.The first half of the film is very slow, and it isn't until about half way through that it really starts to kick in. The hallucinations at times are freaky and it is at this point where you really will become hooked. The story is intriguing and is thoroughly enjoyable considering it is a slight courtroom drama. The twist of the film may not be a surprise, but it does hit you hard and it makes much of the film make more sense. The tension is high throughout the long running time and it had me gripped from start to finish. I do think the final climax could have been cut slightly though, and it does slowly border on farce, but the director holds it together and has produced a film full of tension, and with several biblical themes that refer to many of us.3.5 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The noise  with no explanation. The sense of evil that flickers at the edge of  your awareness, but is gone before you can identify it.  The Devil is not your typical ""horns and pitchfork"" caricature. Al Pacino portrays him masterfully as suave, witty, sophisticated, and  utterly evil.

It is also one of those hidden gems that can be very easily forgotten about in a swath of great films that were released around the same period.I watched The Devil's Advocate with remotely small expectations but was left feeling extremely satisfied, and full of positive emotions when the film finished.The Devil's Advocate has great character development and has great relevance to a person's daily struggles through life making it exceedingly relatable as It hits many themes all too similar in modern society.The Devil's Advocate follows a story of a young lawyer Kevin Lomax from a small town trying to make his way in the world when he receives an offer too good, and so he relocates his life to the big city.This is where Kevin is mentored by a man named John Milton, while unsettling occurrences begin to happen to those who connected with Kevin in any way.The film has amazing, professional chemistry between Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, and Charlize Theron. It is very believable and absorbing to watch as you see the transformation of a good person embark on something similar to that of Dorian Gray with his values, morals, and temptations.The ending was unpredictable and climatic. The twists kept coming even in the last scene of the film. The pacing was good so you were able to process all the movie had to reveal.I think Devils Advocate deserves a little more recognition.

Entertaining,"Be forewarned, this movie gets off to a very tough start as lovable Keanu Reeves, playing a lawyer and the protagonist in this story, is awfully cruel to a high school girl on the witness stand. She's the victim of sexual assault by her teacher, a man who's clearly guilty, and Keanu's brutal examination of her victimizes her all over again. The movie takes a long road to getting back to this scene and addressing it, and for a while it seemed like it never would.This is like a mashup of Rosemary's Baby, The Omen, and maybe even a little Star Wars tossed in, based on the family relationships. The identity of the character Al Pacino plays is obvious early on, making the film feel too long to me, despite how fun it was seeing him ham it up. I liked Charlize Theron as the wife whose health degrades, and Tamara Tunie, even if she hadn't been given much to do. The visual effects which included transformations of the actors to give us brief demonic glimpses were fun too. But somehow the film ended up kind of shallow and wasn't quite as good as it could have been, though it had its moments.Quote:
""You sharpen the human appetite to the point where it can split atoms with its desire, you build egos the size of cathedrals, fiber-optically connect the world to every eager impulse, grease even the dullest dreams with these dollar-green, gold-plated fantasies until every human becomes an aspiring emperor, becomes his own god, and where can you go from there? And as we're scrambling from one deal to the next, who's got his eye on the planet? As the air thickens, the water sours, and even the bees' honey takes on the metallic taste of radioactivity.

I loved this movie so much.  The plot is very strong and rolls on faster and faster until the breaking point.  Keanu Reeves did an excellent job in it...,"This movie is such a great work of art.  It was craftily directed by Taylor Hackford.  The actors and actresses in this movie all did a great job and were believable.  Al Pacino always does a wonderful job, there is no question about that. (See The Scent of a Woman) Charlize Theron was also wonderful as Mary-Anne Lomax, pulling off her southern accent (although very thickly pronounced)splendidly.

"Satan passed the Bar, did he go to Harvard or Yale?","Satan has been portrayed as many things in cinema, but who would think of Satan heading a top New York law firm?This film adaptation of the book does, and it's very entertaining. It shows the slow seduction of a talented, young,  small town lawyer who never lost a case being sent to New York to help a 'big' law firm win their cases. He gets involved in the money, the power and everything ole Satan can throw infront of him and his marriage as a carrot. Reeves plays the title character Kevin Lomax well, and Al Pacino is 'divine' as the head of this law firm who really is 'you-know-who'. Charlize Theron is as cute as a button for in this roll she needs to be, and she delivers on the tough acting side as well. This film contains very adult subject matter, it delivers fine acting performances from all the other actors and actresses as we the audience wonder why is Satan interested in this lawyer, specifically.

Al Pacino was definitely born for this part and appears to be having *just* the most fun.

Too realistic,Something about this film was too realistic. Al Pachino was sooo bad. Lucifer is so real that it's not acting. it is what it is. It felt like he was sitting on the end of my bed every time he appeared. Most horror films are designed for the viewer to watch from afar. You might feel like you are in the film and get the scares but not that the demons are trying to touch you personally. Lucifer and the demon women are directed towards the audience much of the time.

Entertaining Urban Fantasy,"I didn't expect to enjoy this film. Keanu Reeves is not the greatest actor on the planet and while Al Pacino may have been at one time, his choice of work has been a bit mixed of late. None the less, the pairing works and the fantasy/horror elements were nicely underplayed. The plot is relatively simple and is reminiscent of Wall Street in many ways, where an older city wise mentor advances and corrupts his young protege, but there are a couple of genuine surprises in there as well. The only real disappointment is in the final denouement where I was left with the feeling that American test screenings had resulted in some hasty revisions.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Riveting, stylish occult film","It is so rare to see a film about the occult that rises above the drive-in level of oversexed teens getting chopped up, but here is a film with long ""talky"" scenes which hold one's interest.Keanu Reeves plays a successful young lawyer from Gainesville, Florida, which is not in LA or NY. You know it is Florida as everyone wears white suits, sweats and cools themselves with those little fans they give out at funerals.  Kevin's preacher mum has been thumping the bible so hard that she has knocked her brains out.  Kevin's wife is a silly spoiled brat who seems to want nothing more than neverending sex in between bouts of hysterics.When Kevin receives an offer he can't refuse from a senior partner in a New York law firm, John Milton (Al Pacino) who is the devil in disguise, he jumps at the opportunity to become a hot shot lawyer and get fabulously rich, no matter what the cost.  And here lies the core of the film.  Milton offers him the world if he will sell his own soul.  Kevin is never pushed or threatened, the choice is his alone to make. He jumps into the shallow world of high-living movers and shakers who are rotten to the core, and literally hell bent on success, his wife goes insane and commits suicide, and his mother reveals that Milton is his father.Not surprisingly, Kevin wakes up to what is going on and in a superb long debate with the devil argues the case for responsibility for his slide down the slippery slope before choosing salvation.The film is a joy to watch, especially if you like to concentrate on what they are saying rather than just watching the action.  Al Pacino goes way over the top and gets away with it.  The only other actor I can think of who could have played this role successfully over the top is Albert Finney. It is rather like watching the old theatrical actor managers who always guaranteed to give a powerhouse performance that would wake them up at the back of the gallery, even on a wet Monday night.  Sometimes we need waking up.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Overrated, over slick, laughable acting--it rubbed me the wrong way","Devil's Advocate (1997)A highly regarded movie in some circles, and I think because of the idea and the intensity of what's implied (implied more than made palpable). Yes, in real life, this would go places. But it's a fairly routine flick with one of Hollywood's least interesting actors in the main role. I'm talking Keanu Reeves, of course. There is the idea of the devil incarnate, which is the big hook of the movie, but this is almost a comic book version, exaggerated and campy.Okay, yeah, there's the familiar thrill of a couple trying to move into high society and finding it filled with evil, carnal and monetary and otherwise. And there's the idea of a lawyer defending a man who is obviously bad, but the job overrides morality. All is well done enough on some level, but what an exaggerated hooha about nothing! This movie makes a mountain out of some very old ideas.Al Pacino? Overacting and painful to watch at times, he's still a reasonable Hollywood devil. Reeves, the pretty boy who can't act? He really can't! More proof. People have commented that this is his greatest film, or that here at least we see him at his best! Hmph. He's reasonable, but imagine a better actor overwhelmed with ambition success and losing his loving wife and his sanity all at once. Now that's a lot of material for an actor to make hay from.So what do we make of the plot, a crystallization of evil? Well, the devil is, of course, a bad fellow. He has infinite power it seems, but uses it judiciously. That makes no real sense, but you have to go with it. Supernatual effects will show up here in all kinds of bizarre and sensationalist places. If that's your thing, and you're a sexist man (there are lots of women who are purely eye candy), go for it. Sorry dudes, it's true. Swallow hard. Not my thing.Finally, the plot is over the top. (John Grisham wrote it, remember.) It's about excess and flashy twists. The Anti-Christ? Sure, go there, for kicks. Vanity? Come on, is that what this was finally all about? Didn't we know that in the first few minutes?Is this an unredeemed mess? Not quite, I suppose. The movie as a whole ends up being a solid supernatural lawyer film, and the script is straight forward narrative stuff âto the point that it seems banal, except you see the screen shifting its shape as you watch.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pacino: As good as ever,"I enjoyed this movie despite a somewhat weak plot and a weaker supporting cast. I think Keanu Reeves grew up a little with this performance, although, at times, he forgot the Southern accent lawyer Lomax was supposed to carry.Pacino was good in everything. However, he might have over-acted   (probably because nobody else would do it consistently well). I feel the best acting took place during the dialogue with Reeves at the end. All those lines about God were great -even though IÂ´m a Catholic believer- because they displayed in a very sincere manner the essence of humanism and the skepticism of many people in the world who feed their atheism off those exact premises.I loved it when Pacino replies with the contemporaneous ""whatever"". The disdain he shows at this moment for ReevesÂ´ own interpretation of whatÂ´s happening can only be called ""art in less than a sentence"".Finally, I agree with PacinoÂ´s character when he advises Lomax ""to stay in the trenches"", never exhibiting all his capabilities and knowledge without needing it so. I think thatÂ´s a very underrated piece of advise for many of us in this ""smarter-than-thou"" world. ""Learn the subway Kevin!"" Pacino yells. LetÂ´s learn it all of us. Nice philosophical ending for an entertaining film, but what is it with all those Rolling Stones songs at the end of creepy movies lately?",,Anonymous,Mystery

An Honest Review,"OK, full disclosure, I have a thing for Al Pacino. I'll watch just about anything he's in and...if he screams and yells a monologue in it, if he delivers a diatribe of rage....yeah I get flashbacks to him screaming: ""I'd take a flame thrower to this place"" and roll my eyes back like a shark in a feeding frenzy.Oh, yeah, almost forgot, Keanu is in this one too...but for a good slice of the film he doesn't play the most savory of characters and, really, honestly, he just seems too nice to play a lawyer......but despite that he does a pretty good job of exhibiting the ego that has to come with the law profession...just not the vile evilness. So, I can't totally fault him for miscast as I could for Dracula.Jeffery Jones is in there too and due to recent revelations he totally fits the sleazy lawyer role.But yeah, 1997, the 90s had a way with films that was only really beaten by the 70s and The Devil's Advocate is one of those films that could really only be made in those two decades. Stand alone horror not intended as a franchise piece and one with a twist that asks you to think a little.No way that would be made today and that is a shame.I could tout its glory, but really, honestly, the movie could have stank and I wouldn't care thanks to Pacino screaming ""I'm a fan of man!""

Deliciously stylish and effective thriller,"Keanu Reeves isn't really the man you look up when you want good acting or diverse characters(he did do excellent work in The Gift, mind you); however, here, he manages to hand in a fairly decent performance... and the better part of the main cast here are very impressive. Pacino is a given, as is, to some extent, Theron, but I was surprised(happily so) by both T. Nelson and Jones. The plot is interesting and involving, and the way it develops is great. The pacing is very good, I was hardly ever bored, despite it being a bit over usual feature film length in running time. The film is laced with style, and it works wonderfully to the film's advantage. The characters are well-written and credible. The film contains a select few grand parodying references to Rosemary's Baby and Scarface. Pacino is, quite literally, on fire. He's simply marvelous as The Dark Prince. The score is magnificent. The cinematography and editing are top-notch. The film is thoroughly entertaining, filled to the brink with suspense and, while somewhat moralizing near the end, highly satirical as far as religion goes. I recommend it to any fan of the actors, thrillers and/or the subject matter. Highly recommendable, and very watchable. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Good, but for VERY mature audiences only","I did not like this movie.  However, it does a very good job of making its point about temptation.  Whether or not that point could have been made without all of the violence and especially nudity is debatable.  My main complaint is that there was absolutely no mention of the heavy nudity in reviews or basically anywhere else.  Kids aren't supposed to make it in to R movies without parents.  Some R movies I could live with some kids seeing because some kids are mature enough to handle it. However, with this movie, I have never seen a kid under 17 (including myself) that was mature enough for this movie.  That's why I classify this movie as NC-17 and am surprised (although that rating would have been a death sentence for the movie) that the nudity isn't even mentioned anywhere.That aside, the story of this movie (if you can handle the 'distractions') is pretty powerful and I would recommend it to mature people.

True, Keanu Reeves does play the leading role with an accent akin to a highschool performance, but his script together with Charlize Theron's break-out role more than make up for this. Also, who can forget the great Al Pacino- who plays an even more sinister character than his usual Mob associated roles- Satan himself. His raspy voice and fiery temper fit perfectly with Connie Nielson (Empress from The Gladiator) as the sensual temptress from Hell. The twist at the end was completely unexpected, as the events leading up to it were very plausable and well pulled off.

"Has a Lot of Great Ideas, Maybe Too Many,","The Devil's Advocate is a good movie with a well developed plot and a very talented cast. The three stars, Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino and Charlize Theron are all spectacular in their role, shining seperately in different scenes and each overcoming very complicated arcs that they made look easy. The plot itself is immensely thrilling and will keep you at the edge of your seat from beginning to end in trying to figure out what exactly is going on.I did, however, find that the film was overly ambitious in the many themes and elements it was trying to explore. Once we get deep in to the plot, it starts to feel overstuffed, trying to do too many things at once and falling flat in many areas as a result, wheras it would have been far more appealing had it focused on less, giving certain themes more attention, and thus making them richer.The film is also far longer than it needs to be, this type of movie should not be any longer than two hours. I felt myself wanting it to end, and not because of a lack of intrigue or that I was bored, but because it was simply milking what it was trying to do for so long that it became increasingly less effective.Truly unique. While it is certainly flawed, we can look past this when watching The Devil's Advocate and appreciate what it does right, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good mystery.A lawyer based in Florida is given a massive opportunity to work for a firm in New York, but there's a catch.Best Performance: Al Pacino",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pure Greatness!,"I guess I am one of the very few people who find the movie much superior than most thrillers considered as cinematic masterpieces. Yes, I find The Devil's Advocate better than let's say LA Confidential.As a court room thrillers fan, I cannot hate or not like that movie. The story follows a young lawyer Kevin Lomax played by Keanu Reeves who turns out to be a great lawyer and gets sent to New York for his first real big case. He is about to get married and so Kevin could be the happiest man on earth. The man he gets sent to is John Milton played by Al Pacino. A man with style who appreciates Kevin's achievements by far and he admire his enthusiasm and of course, he sees a lighter future in Kevin. After all, a great lawyer could put anyone out of great situation. Milton is in fact his new boss. New Yor, beautiful wife, fame, prestige, success. Of course nothing could be perfect for one human being. Not in life, nor in movies. Strange things starts to happen with our main character, the people he knows become different. His life is about to become a nightmare and it turns out that Milton is some kind of a living on earth Lucifer.One of the greatest ""lawyer"" kind of movies, plots ever. The movie is much more of a deep drama with dark and unexpected moments, then a thriller with an optimistic, smiling and happy lawyer who saves the day for wrongfully accused innocent looking guy. The movie hides a great clichÃ© among its deeper meanings. Fame's fatality. Kevin's character is a provincial guy with innocent understanding for his life, with no imagination or great brain. In fact, he is nothing special, but he is a lawyer who wins cases and people love him. He is lucky, God has ""touched"" him and everything works fine until he commits a sin by celebrating his fame, becoming a new person with higher standards, different attitude to his friends and wife. He becomes a whole new person that God does not love anymore. Well, I think it might be kind of a metaphor. He has been in heave all his life, you know what I mean and when he commits the sin, he fells in hell without realizing it and John Milton is the devil. And because the most part of the movie takes place after he becomes the new person, that kinda symbolizes who the devil is playing with him and how he turns his life into a nightmare. That's the devil's job after all. For example the scene with the baby playing with insides. These are basically the things you realize if you look into the movie deeper. It's great, cause it's full of clichÃ©s about degradation and wrong life if I could put it in that way, covered with metaphors and symbolisms and the movie is fresh and original as a final result and in my case, I loved it.As for the acting. Bad actor and one of the greatest actors alive. Eccentric and fun combination that could challenge people watch the movie only for that particular reason. Well, Reeves gives all he got and I could easily say it's his best performance by far. He plays the same characters, but this time, his character is given life, his character is a normal human, his character is based on a book character. I could list many reasons why an actor I hate, a bad actor gives a good performance in a great movie. And as for Pacino - I was surprised he had taken the role so seriously. The final duologue scene is probably the best in the movie, mostly cause of his acting, his ability to keep the balance between overacting where he has to and be himself where he wants to, improvising. Exactly what a devil in human form, would be.10 out of 10 - almost no flaws.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Devil's Advocate blends courtroom drama with religious connotations.,"An interesting combination that evokes several themes. The problem is though, the two don't necessarily marinate well together constantly. A hot shot talented lawyer is unstoppable as he wins every case. A big cheese comes along and takes him under his wing which proves to be far more life altering than first anticipated. It's no spoiler, given the title and front cover, that this is about the power of evil. Vanity, power, lust, temptation...in fact, include all of the seven deadly sins as well. Depicting the idea that there is evil within everyone and that good does not necessarily always prevail. Our protagonist starts his new career with the best of intentions for him and his wife. He then starts to dabble into temptation and unknowingly evil creeps into his subconscious, tainting his view on love and life. Gradually becoming a marionette to a greater puppet master, which of course is perceived to be the Devil. I like the portrayal of how careers and relationships are built upon good, only for them to be maintained by evil. The narrative clearly shows this, the problem is the balance between the courtroom cases and the effects of the Devil's influence are skewed. They do not blend constantly. This becomes clear towards the end where the plot reveals a few twists. The religious connotations and subtext that follow are far too forced in a film that primarily focusses on law. Perhaps injecting the subtextual layers into the narrative more frequently would've given a better result and not such an underwhelming ending. Wasn't a huge fan of the final five minutes, hate it when films do that (you'll know what I mean if you've seen it). Surprisingly Keanu Reeves held his own against Al Pacino, and I thought Charlize Theron projected fragility really well in what is one of her earliest performances. It's a good drama, with many psychological concepts but unfortunately didn't explore the influence of evil to a greater extent.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very boring,"And very dull. This movie takes a criminal amount of time to get going and when it finally does it doesn't really go anywhere. Keanu plays a top lawyer called Kevin Lomax and we get a clichÃ©d plot about a rich man killing his family and a couple of ""TV Movie"" sub-plots.But what we're supposed to be concentrating on is Keanu's descent into a conscience-free life and how he is giving up his morals just so he can win cases. Pretty melodramatic. There is ZERO humor in this movie. All movies need humor no matter what the tone. If not I just end up laughing AT it.Devil's Advocate is NOT scary. A couple of scenes may be intense but it isn't scary in the slightest. The only reason for watching this is Al Pacino's outlandish and eccentric performance, but you have to wait 2 hours to get to that. Give this a miss. I give it 2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I not only saw this movie, but read every review. It was to my surprise that not one person keyed on the excellent supporting role of Ms, Lomax, mother to Kevin Lomax, played by Judith Ivey. Her performance blended so well into the story that it became transparent, yet was an integral part comprising the mosaic to this well shaped thriller.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Worth seeing for Pacino,"Pacino, Pacino, Pacino. This man is a brilliant actor and his performance in this film is nothing less than stellar.

Unlimited desire becomes devil,"Following his desire, Kevin works hard to win one case after another at courtroom no matter who his defendants are and what they do. Wining gives him more money, higher reputation and more power, and his desire keeps growing - devil appears.

Very good flick.,"Very well acted, casted and plotted film. Great storyline, although at the end it may seem slightly ""unfulfilled"" with absence of Religious knowledge, but albeit a very good movie. This movie is very creative, intelligent and intriguing, keeps you watching until the end. One of Keanu Reeves' roles which are not comic at all and shows his versatility as an actor. Al Pacino shows a wonderful role as his common charactery... Shouting, anger, intelligence and blatant disregard for conforming to proper standards, with slight comedic genius.All in all, A well made movie, definitely worth a watch, even for the religiously devoid.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Devil has many faces - the terrifying Pacino is one of them,"Well. Strange movie. It starts lightly, almost giving the impression that the director new nothing of the real life in a courthouse; it gets better by showing some friction between mother and daughter-in-law...and then it portrays the strange ways of celebrating victory of a couple. Then comes the devily proposal...  Now he movie gets frightning, although in some shallow way.But, as it turns out, after having seen it, when you look at it from a wide angle, this movie becomes quite ordinary. The plot does not surprise you, the intended surprises seemed  the work of an amateur writer, who thinks the best shocks come from those things that are supposed to surprise you (wow, the man is his father, wow, thatÂ´s his sister, wow, his wife did that, and he did that...). It happens that, nowadays, movie fans do see  a lot of movies, from many years, from many directors, and it takes a good plot and good directing to really surprise them.I foresaw some events quite a few minutes before I was shown them. Possibilly, lots of people saw it that way too. But anyway, this is a good thing to watch.The acting... Well, Keanu Reeves is good, Charlize Theron is excellent - quite a revelation she is. But the real bomb, the true interest of this movie lies with Al Pacino. This actor is a phenomenon. He can be a gangster, a blind man... and the devil. He is an astonishing actor, one that will endure forever in our memory - like Spencer Tracy, Bogart, Cagney, John Wayne, Douglas, Connery, De Niro, Morgan Freeman, OÂ´Toole. If I was given a choice between having a video-library of these actors and all the special effects and great soundtracks in the world...I would choose the stories personified by these actorÂ´s characters.Al Pacino alone holds this movie above the average - and they didnÂ´t even give him a great part. Between PacinoÂ´s acting, ReevesÂ´ performance and the revelation named Charlize Theron - and if you choose to consider a grade C+ plot...well, you get a good enough movie.Too bad it ends in such a poor way - as if someone (the director, the cast, the producer, some big boss in the studio) were trying to rush it to the finishing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The most accurate depiction of Satan in a movie to date.,"While this movie does depict graphic violence and nudity and is generally disturbing, it is important to note that this is the most accurate depiction of Satan I have ever seen.  After watching this movie you might feel the need to RUN to church or just generally feel a little unclean, but for anyone wondering about what Satan is really like, this is a must see. Pacino is his usual brilliant self, depicting John Milton (no, not the author, but very appropriate for those familiar with Milton's writings). Keanu Reeves actually performs very well in his role as Kevin Lomax and shows that even the most ambitious people have their limits. Finally, Charlize Theron delivers a break-out performance as Mary Ann Lomax, Keanu's wife.  She quickly thrust herself onto the scene as the sceptical wife. Overall, this is a very good movie, well made, well acted, and very well directed.  For those who have a stomach for strong violence/sex or for anyone who has any curiosity of who Satan is and how he acts this movie is a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Worth the cost of a DVD,"I recently added this film to my small DVD collection for:  the screenplay and the performances - almost all of them.  Reeves is a little weak, but maybe that serves the purpose in the film.  He's strong in the end.  The ending has, if you browse through some of the other comments, taken a beating as a letdown or cop out.  I thought the ending was perfect.  It demonstrated that Evil has great staying power.The Old Boy turns the passage of time into a rather elaborate hallucination when he loses in the end to Reeves's exercise of free will.  Well.  Like Scarlet O'Hara said, ""Tomorrow is another day.""  It demonstrates Evil's relentless pursuit of the soul.  There will always - always - be another temptation.  So the next time around, we can assume that his crisis of conscience will be twisted and turned against him.

"Good Plot, Solid Execution...Clunky And Awkward Climax","This is an updated review of the film. I wrote the original one over ten years ago.I've always found this film to be very entertaining. I like the overall premise, dialog, pacing, and execution. It's quite cohesive for the most part. The acting can be rather uneven. Pacino does his fair share of overacting, but he can pull it off with this material. But Reeves is hit or miss in some areas.The problem here however, WAS the climax. It was clunky, bloated, and had an inconsistent tone that didn't match what they were going for. It really felt like it derailed everything that they built up to. The outcome wasn't bad, it was how they delivered it. I understand that it's the film's chance to build the motive after 1.5 hours, but KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid. - There was much that could have been trimmed out and rewritten - Keep the tone that you had built up to by this point. The climax managed to be goofy but somehow overstuffed at the same time.The rest of the movie was well-executed, interesting, and chilling. Just what it should have been. Great psychological trauma and manipulation. I love a good supernatural horror film that has great haunts. Interesting enough, you watch it and realize that Kevin...is not really someone to support. Main character or not, it's pretty clear that his vanity gets in his way. And I thought they delivered that pretty well, here.The Devil's Advocate had a lot of potential, but it didn't follow through. Honestly though, there's a lot to like, here. They just fumbled it with the climax, and it came off as just too full of itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It shouldn't matter that toward the end the movie has gone preposterous as it has always maintained a coherence. But for me, the real thing about this movie is Connie Nielsen. She's the winner.

Oh, by the way, and I loved it how they had dissected the American myth of the successful lawyer (but it's much, much more that that). Anyway, back to my point: remember that great scene when Milton explains almost literally the mechanisms of corruption and self-degradation, while walking in the streets with his young ""pupil""? If it was only for that key for salvation in everyday life and the movie would have been a must see! Well, when I had left the cinema, I heard two guys commenting on it: ""Wow, the system is so perfect, you can't get away"". Exactly the opposite of my thought! And then I recalled the saying of the Revelation, which goes something like that: he who is just, let him be just, and he who is corrupt, let him be corrupt. In other words, people had made their choices, the time has come. Well, are we really living the last days of our ripe world as we knew it or what? Very intriguing.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I like this movie because very mysterious.,"I liked this movie for several reasons;1- Story of the movie:A wonderful and mysterious story that makes the viewer eagerly watch the movie until the end of the story and not notice the passage of time. The movie is like a puzzle where we have to put the pieces together to understand the movie and this is not possible by watching the movie once and to understand the movie you have to watch it several times. I discover this movie and every time I see it, it is new to me and I never get tired of it. The film has strong and wonderful dialogues and scenes that make everyone think. In this film, the devil defends himself, which we must give him this right. No court will issue a verdict without the defense of the accused, and in this film, we see his defense and We have to admit that we are fascinated by him.2- Actors of the movie:One of the most important factors of the beauty of the film are the actors of the film, who do not act but live. Powerful actors such as Al Pacino, Keanu Reeves, Charlize Theron make the movie more interesting and the audience enjoys watching their work in front of the camera. Al Pacino's magic game in every scene shows why he is the greatest actor in the history of Hollywood. It makes everyone think that the devil is inside him. He plays the role in a very believable and logical manner along with humorous and serious dialogues that target the brain of the audience. In this film, Al Pacino plays well with his whole body as the godfather, and this makes the role and the film last, but Keanu Reeves was able to play the role of a proud human being. To play the greedy, he knew very well what the film wanted from him and he performed it exactly.3- Agents behind the scenes:The behind-the-scenes agents such as the director, cameraman and others were able to manage the moments of the film well. The scene above the apartment and that waterfall above the building is enchanting, or the scene behind John Milton at the end of the sequence in his building was very attractive and amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great acting by Al Pacino but not much more,"As another review said, Al Pacino was born for this rÃ´le.

Keanu Reeves is at his best as Kevin Lomax and so is Charlize Theron as Kevin Lomax's troubled wife. The movie is long, but the two hours get by rather fast. The ending is...well, it's two endings in one.

Diabolical,"This movie begins with a talented criminal lawyer named ""Kevin Lomax"" (Keanu Reeves) defending an accused child molester in a Florida courtroom.

When the jury votes to acquit he is then invited to meet the man who owns the law firm who goes by the name of ""John Milton"" (Al Pacino). But just as Kevin Lomax is no ordinary lawyer, John Milton is no ordinary man--and he has a deal for Kevin that is extremely tempting. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought this was an exciting movie for the most part with good performances from Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, Charlize Theron (as ""Mary Ann Lomax"") and Connie Nielsen (""Christabella Andreoli""). However, there were some parts which could have used some improvement along with the ending which seemed a bit too convenient in my opinion.

Vanities of the bonfires: a riveting film,"Vanity fuels the clash between good and evil. The film is so superbly photographed, remarkably played and directed that you are easily sucked into the flammable issues and charged scenes, potential ""bush fires"", with your emotions taking control. Only after the film may you have the time to reflect. The young lawyer from Florida, Keenu Reeves, who is winning all his cases vainly thinks that he is in control of himself. His acceptance of a fabulously well paid legal job in New York where the world is so much brighter, richer, intriguing, challenging only fuels his vain belief in his legal superiority. The legal firm's boss, Al Pacino, mysteriously encourages Reeves to fly higher, to feel that he can be even stronger and go on winning. Lawyer Reeves beliefs, formed from his religious upbringing by his religious mother, are insidiously tested by Al Pacino. Is winning the only star to follow, what about losing? If God is for love and compassion, is the Devil's role, as advocated by Al Pacino, to inject vanity into intuition to power the business world to winning ever better results no matter whether the world thinks otherwise? A real dilemma for Americans, as its must-win role is corroding the international political world. The good Reeves is threatened by the need to make difficult choices. His falling for the temptations of mastering the situations opens the door to evil paths. His wife, victimized by devilish hallucinations and her doubts that love and compassion are strong enough to withstand the temptations showered on her husband by Al Pacino, increases the pressure on him. The hyper modern business interiors, the stunning shots of New York, the very beautiful women as diabolic temptations inject more fuel into the rising tensions. Serious questions begin to crackle and smolder. The powerful acting controls the potential fission. Reeves is drawn in to the bonfire, vainly believing that he can handle the conflicts and unexplained deaths that pummel him. But Al Pacino's role succumbs also to vanity! Al Pacino cannot either avoid the bonfire of evil ambitions. Brilliant last scenes justifiably disturb the mind. Masterfully convincing acting by Reeves, Charlize Theron his wife and Al Pacino with the beautiful photography make this film a must to see.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A hot mess,"This movie is about a very successful Florida lawyer who hasn't lost a case since he started, played by Keanu Reeves, when he gets the chance to go work for a big lawyer companyGoing into this movie, I expected something very different from what I got. It wasn't quite clear what the movie was going for. The scenes feel very rushed and most of them don't really serve a purpose. The first and the second part also felt very separate from each other. The first part felt more like a biopic, while the second part got glimpses of a psychological thriller. Only until the very (second to) last scene the movie revealed it's underlying message, but by then for me it was already ruined.The performance felt a bit choppy for me, especially Keanu Reeves got on my nerves with some serious overacting. He also had something really irritating about his voice. Also Charlize Theron's character was just plain stupid, she had no personality whatsoever and you don't really care for their relationship. (It even annoys you a bit at times) The one bright spot in this whole movie is the performance of Al Pacino though. Every minute he's on screen he demands all the attention, and while you get from the beginning that he's not really very reliable, you do however enjoy every scene he's in because it really looks like Pacino is just having a fun time. Pacino has some great monologue moments in this moments, and all the credit goes to him because he didn't really have so much to work with, but somehow he made it click.That's however the only really enjoyable part in the movie, because what's left is really just a hot mess. The editing feels very choppy and rushed, like already mention the dialogue is very dull and you don't really know where this movie is going or what it wants to be. It is blunt and too subtle at the same time. Sometime the movie wants to make something clear so bad that it just looks absolutely ridiculous while at other times you don't really get what the movie is trying to tell you. Having said that however, I do think if you see this movie twice, you Will get a bit more satisfaction over it if you do decide to concentrate on the underlying tone. It is pitiful however that you only can get grasp of the tone of the movie at the end of the movie. (The last monologue of Pacino is undoubtedly the thing that elevates this movie) I don't think anyone would really care to see it a second time to be honest, because you would have lost you attention for the movie long before the first watching even ends 5,5/10 verdict: A hot mess",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Devil's Advocate,"Director: Taylor Hackford
Starring: Al Pacino, Keanu Reeves, Charlize TheronThis is an amazing psychological thriller. The movie shows you the inside of a man. The devil and the good one. Every person and everything you see in this movie is a symbol. And means something more than you see. This is a very modern thriller and makes you feel like you are there and you are living in that moment. The movie is insanely realistic. But at the same time makes you question what you see. In my opinion the chemistry between Reeves and Theron adds a lot to it. They had a very alive relationship. Al Pacino, as always gives us another remarkable performance.

A brilliant devilish thriller,"Devil's Advocate is an exceptional film that blends various genres, combining elements of psychological thriller, supernatural horror, and legal drama to create a truly mesmerizing movie. With its amazing performances and thought-provoking exploration of morality, this film stands as a masterclass in storytelling.The film regards around Kevin Lomax, played flawlessly by Keanu Reeves, a young and truly ambitious lawyer who finds himself drawn into a world of seduction, corruption, and unimaginable temptation when he joins a prestigious law firm led by the enigmatic John Milton, portrayed with devilish charm by Al Pacino. The movie travels Lomax character's transformation from an idealistic attorney to a man grappling with his own moral compass. Pacino's performance is nothing short of amazing, infusing Milton with an irresistible charisma and sinister allure that dominates every scene he graces.The movie explores themes of ambition, desire, and the price one is willing to pay for success. It runs into the darkest corners of human nature, forcing us to challenge the nature of good and evil, and even the choices we would make when faced with temptation. The screenplay, penned by Jonathan Lemkin and Tony Gilroy, is embed with sharp dialogue and intriguing twists that keep us guessing while dwelling in a rich and atmospheric world that mirrors the moral ambiguity of the narrative. The cinematography is striking, utilizing shadows and dark hues to accentuate the film's sinister undertones. The production design impeccably captures the opulence and decadence of the legal world, providing a backdrop for the moral dilemmas.Its supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances by Charlize Theron as Kevin Lomax's conflicted wife, Mary Ann, and Judith Ivey as Kevin's insightful mother, Alice. Theron brings a raw vulnerability, portraying Mary Ann's descent into madness with heartbreaking authenticity.Devil's Advocate also benefits from an outstanding score, composed by James Newton Howard.But this movie's impact extends beyond its thrilling narrative and stellar performances. It serves as a life tale, prompting us to examine our own moral compasses and question the price of success and power. It challenges our preconceived notions of right and wrong.In every aspect, Devil's Advocate excels. From the performances to the thought-provoking exploration of morality, this movie is a triumph. If you seek this kind of experience, Devil's Advocate is a cinematic gem.For me, one of the best movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nice but not original; can you say 'Rosemary's Baby?',"This movie was an interesting movie to watch.  I thought the acting and the cinamatagrapy were super...but, this movie lacked originality.  This movie is a combination of 'The Firm', 'The Omen' and 'Rosemary's Baby' (and it borrows heavily from the 1968 classic 'Rosemary's Baby')--like the part when the Reeve's wife changes her look to please her husband, so does Rosemary, and the part where the wife goes crazy because no one believes what is going on with her, so does Rosemary, and the part where Reeves almost sells out to the devil's firm, so too does Rosemary's husband; except he sells out to a satanic cult.  Nevertheless, 'Devils Ad' is worth watching twice, esp. the part where the lady is changing dresses and she changes into something else!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Supernatural meets Law and Order,"Devil's Advocate stars Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino and is directed by Taylor Hackford. The film revolves around a hot-shot defense attorney who gets accepted into one of the most powerful law firms in New York. But his new job offering offering experiences that he would never dream of lies a deep dark sinister behind close curtains. This film is like if John Grisham's The Firm and Rosemary's Baby came together and had a child. What I enjoy about Devil's Advocate is that instead of making it your typical flavor-of-the-week courtroom drama, the team creates your typical courtroom drama, but adds an element of supernatural horror to the mix. The problem with Devil's Advocate is that it has a hard time whether it's a horror movie or a movie inspired by the works of John Grisham. The way I see it, the first half of the movie is your courtroom drama. Then the second half we start to see some horror thrown at us, and finally were thrown with the last remaining of horror that the film offers us. Also the middle half of the movie is also confused as it seems that the screenwriters were lost and confused on how to bring this movie full circle. Another thing i want to point out is that Devil's Advocate is filled with over the top performances by Keanu Reeves who tries to do a perfect southern accent, but fails and feels rushed as well. And Al Pacino, who delivers an over the top performance you could've swore that he wasn't acting and the director is just rolling because he's enjoying as well as we are. Its not Al Pacino's best, but it's certainly not his worst. So in the end i will say that Devil's Advocate is an entertaining film to watch, that I don't hate the movie, but it could've used a little work.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Interesting, but ultimately fails","Okay, let's make one thing clear from the start: I didn't like this movie.The Devil's Advocate is likely to pass the did-I-watch-this test. If you've seen hundreds and hundreds (maybe thousands) of movies, like I have, you'll probably know what the did-I-watch-this test is. There are movies out there you can run across a month or two later, and you don't even remember that you saw that one.This one you'll probably remember. Why? Because it's different. Given the zillions of movies out there, different is an increasing rarity.But ultimately, I just didn't find it entertaining.The reason it fails as entertainment is: It's just too fatalistic, too depressing. After I watched this movie, I should've gone to bed, as it was late at night. Instead, I started another movie just to change the mood.Yes, there are some well-done and interesting effects. Yes, the script shows a certain amount of skill. Yes, it has a couple of big names. But all of that drowns in the entire flavor, which is a film that, in the end, simply isn't fun.There are films that can get away with being no fun, because they have some other artistry, some other redeeming value. They're films that make us think, that cause us to experience some sort of insight or thought that makes them worth watching.That's not this movie. In the end, I give it 2 out of 10, and wish I had the time back that I wasted on it.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Unbelievable, Al at his best","Being a huge Al Pacino fan, it is hard for me to choose only one of his movies as being my all-time favorite. Scarface would have to be near the top of the list, the Godfather movies were good (not as great as most people think, but pretty good nonetheless), Heat was underrated,and Sea of Love was solid. But if I had to choose one, this movie is it. Pacino is awesome throughout the entire movie, and his two monologues directed at Keanu are as gripping as any others in movie history, no other actor could have pulled it off. He seemed born to play this role. I could go on all day about Pacino in this movie, but others deserve mention as well.I'm still trying to figure out if I like Keanu Reeves. I try as hard as I can to dislike him, because I really don't think he is a very good actor. However, he seems to choose his roles carefully, because he manages to find himself in terrific movies every once in awhile. He will forever be Ted searching for an excellent adventure in my mind, but Point Break was as entertaining as most action movies get, Speed (yes I know, it was completely ridiculous and stupid) was still pretty cool, and there's always Bill & Ted. But he has really outdone himself here. While overwhelmed by Pacino's performance, Keanu still quietly gives a pretty good performance as the lawyer who sells his soul for the big bucks and glory associated with a big New York law firm, at the head of which is Pacino. I won't give away any more of the story, because it is too good to hear it from me. But anybody who has not seen it, do yourself a favor and rent it. Even if you don't enjoy any other part of the movie, Pacino's monologues and every scene he's in, for that matter, make it well worth the money. Pacino's best, and one of the best of all time. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Great overall movie, except in the horror department.","A prime example of how a bigger budget doesn't necessarily means a scarier horrorfilm. As a matter of fact, it's very hard to be scared of the devil when he's played by Al Pacino. Although he's one of the greatest actors of all time, i just never stopped seeing him as Al Pacino, when i should have seen him as the devil. That's what you get when you cast a megastar in this kind of part. He smirks, smiles, an surely talks a lot. There are wisecracks, dialogues filled with philosophy and intelligence. There's nudity and beauty, and some degree of hard violence. But if this is THE devil, Satan himself, then he sure doesn't scare me.The scenes where the girlfriend, played by Charlize Theron, gradually goes out of her mind are the most effective in the movie, including the scene where she ends her own psychological suffering. But for the rest, it's a great movie, with fantastic acting performances (even by Keanu Reeves), great dialogue, good special effects, a great climax, and a damn good score. Too bad it's supposed to be a horrorfilm, because where it fails is the most important part, it's just not scary.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pacino shines again in this story of vanity vs. morality,"Kevin Lomax is a rising young star. He's a slick-talking, intelligent lawyer, and he's never lost a case. So he figures it's time to move up to the big city, join a big firm, and enjoy great success and make a lot of money. But the firm he joins is full of greed and malice, and his boss, John Milton, is an eccentric hotshot who is acting very strangely. He begins to become alienated from his wife, driven just by money and fame, and just when it seems like everything he cares about has gone to waste, he finds out the shocking true identity of his overzealous boss...'The Devil's Advocate' is a very entertaining story about fame and vanity and the evil places it can lead one to. Keano Reeves does a fine job portraying the young attorney. Charlize Theron is phenomenal as his pretty wife. But it is Al Pacino who (not surprisingly) steals the show, acting out the mysterious and strange boss.As the movie reaches its' climax, Reeves and Pacino confront each other in a scene that's gotta rank up there with one of the greatest in motion picture history. Pacino's diatribe about God is simply brilliant.My only criticism of this film is the overdone goriness of some of it's scenes and the unnecessary lewdness portrayed.

Devil's In the Details,"""The Devil's Advocate"" holds a strange place in my heart as it was, for reasons I can't quite remember now, the first DVD that I ever owned. As I cycle those DVD's out the door I watched the film again for the first time in years, whilst it's beginning to show its age, I still enjoyed the story.Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is a lawyer in Florida with an undefeated record as both prosecutor and defender. He's offered the chance to join a prestigious New York film and after impressing with Jury selection, he meets John Milton (Al Pacino) the firms owner. Milton's offers Lomax the opportunity to take high profile cases, which alienates the rest of the firm and keeps him away from his wife, Mary Ann (Charlize Theron). As her mental state deteriorates, she tries to convince Kevin that something is very wrong at the firm, but he doesn't listen, until it's too late.I do find that negative comments come easier to me, so I'm going to try and lead with the positives here as I did quite like the film still. It's a good story, based on a book, that slowly unravels Lomax's life - tempting him with surface success and undermining his real happiness. The performances are really good, with perhaps one exception which I'll come back too. The accusations of generally being over the top that can be levelled against Pacino work in his favour here, as he keeps things underwraps until a bombastic conclusion. There's real production value gleaned by filming on several New York skyscrapers, building sites and in Trumps classless apartment.The visual effects are starting to show their age, which is perhaps reasonable given that the film is over 25 years old. Keanu Reeves is mostly OK, but there are a couple of occasions, ""Listen to me like you've never listened to anything before in your life"" for example, where he's frankly awful. I will also say that it feels long, at 144 minutes it is long I know, but I do think you can feel the length a bit.Generally though, I think ""The Devils Advocate"" is an underappreciated film that perhaps means more to me than it's really worth, but I enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

You've gotta be kidding,"I recently rented The Devil's Advocate, remembering that it had berecommended by a family member who's taste I now have toquestion.  I've read several of the other comments posted hereand I simply can't believe the praise being lavished on thisremarkably  mediocre film.  Where to begin.  Well, let's start withKeanu Reeves trying on a Southern (?) drawl and succeeding onlyin proving he can be a lousy actor  in more than one dialect.  Thenyou've got Al Pacino chewing the scenery shamelessly.  I'mtempted to read the novel this movie was based on, if only to see ifthe reasonably interesting premise was handled with any moresubtlety in print.  Because the movie is like a 2.5 hour WesternUnion commercial, with every plot twist telegraphed an hour aheadof its arrival.  Was there really anyone who didn't recognize thatPacino was supposed to be Satan the moment they learned hischaracter was named John Milton?  Could the endless succession of demons and specters have been a clue? And all the while, Keanu and Charlize Theron just keep drawlin'and Al keeps shoutin' and it all leads up to what, exactly?  Theflying mallet to the head moral that a scuzzy lawyer that stops atnothing to win will eventually pay a price for his amorality?  Whowould have guessed?  Who would have cared?  But, hey, themusic was good.  But what was the deal with the voodoo guy andthe goat?  Awww, nevermind.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Kind of disturbing actually,"Al Pacino is charismatic as the Devil himself in this movie, in that fake plastered on charisma you get from salesmen sometimes, but with dark, deep dominating eyes. He comes of powerful, intelligent, extremely manipulative and slightly unhinged insane, you could actually believe he actually is the Devil. Keanu Reeves plays his role very well, being this talanted, charp and very cocky up and coming lawyer, that just can't put his own ego aside. And Charlize Theron perhaps has the hardest part and pulls it of without a sweat. I think it's actually that her peformens is so convincing, I actually became a bit emotionally disturbed by this movie, otherwise it wouldn't been nearly as effective.Some beautiful shots of Manhattan, New York. This mighty metropolitan of a city, fits very well for what the message of the story is telling. And that the lawfirm, the story takes place within, is on the top floor of a skyscraper, looking out over the entire concrete jungle, really potrais what it's all about in a subtle way: power over others.It's a story about morality; the battle within, doing what's good and right versus the allure of success, no matter the cost on everything else. ""Money, that's the easy part."" As Al Pacino character says in a scene between him and Keanu. Not the first movie with that kind of message, but still original in a way, usually Satan himself is not involved as a real character for example. The title of this picture, that it's both allegory and litteral, is actually a tiny bit genius. Pacino also has a great monolog in this film.This movie could be labeled a thriller or a drama but I think it's actually a horror movie. The story starts of a bit slow in the beginning. And becomes more and more creepy as it moves along. A creepy slow burn horror movie, which is refreshing today, when most horror movies is about jump scares. It picks up way more towards the last act. But I actually didn't like this movies big finale that much or the ending. There comes a twist that I didn't really care for that much or felt necessary either.Other then that, pretty good. Decent. It reminded me a lot of Rosemary's Baby actually. But Rosemary's Baby is better, but still I think this movie is very decent and it actually managed to disturb me, which I think was its meaning to do, so it succeed, an accomplishment for Taylor Hackford. Decent movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Vanity, the sin !","I update my watchlist in the IMDB based upon the suggestions . So this weekend I accidentally stumbled upon this movie "" The devil's advocate"". With the heavyweights like keanu reeves and al pacino I decided to have a go on it. It was a roller coaster ride .The first scene in the time of me too movements , I felt havent aged well and written lot loosely. The story of a lawyer and his ambition creating a havoc in his lovelife, this is a normal movie story right? But surprisingly this isn't a normal story. The story will take a crazy turn once the lawyer ""kavin lomax"" and the wife ""Mary ann"" reach new york. Once the story unfolds you ll have to remember the initial scenes to get an idea of whats going on actually.Al pacino is good as always as Milton, the boss of the law firm where kevin lomax works. He has got every shades of the performance and as he oozes his talent the character shines vividly.For the first 40-50 minutes you will not make sense of how long this is going to go, you feel like okay lets move the story forward but after you pass that phase this story will take dramatic fun, so please watch without spoilers.It is a lovely movie with the theme ""Vanity is the lovely sin!""",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

You Have to Sit Through This Movie Just for the Ending It's That Good,"OK, let me just get this out of the way Al Pacino is one of the most under-appreciated actors of all time. He has only been given one Oscar in his entire movie career and he has deserved at least three. Same with Robert Deniro, but he won two and he's not in this movie. If you don't get a Oscar nod for what he did in this movie I do not know what the Academy is looking for when it comes to Best Actor. Do you have to be in one of the best movies or most controversial movies to be considered for a Oscar. It's ignorant and moronic on the part of the Academy. Especially since 1997 was a very weak Oscar year. A nod is all I'm asking for, just a nod. He didn't deserve the award, but damned if he didn't earn a nomination in that final scene. Giving everything you could possibly think the devil could do to lure you into his world. Make you into what he wants and turn your world upside down. He even ups the performance of Keanu Reeves to the point where that accent isn't even bothering you anymore. Your actually feeling the turmoil and what exactly is riding on his decision and it's all Al Pacino. The Academy wanted Pacino to look but not to touch, well OK they let him touch, but very rarely a taste, OK a taste but never a swallow. And thats how it is. A great actor gives a great performance and devils in Hollywood just play a huge joke on him. I think Dustin Hoffman has been nominated enough don't you?

For those who haven't seen the movie yet, I don't want to say too much, because the power of the movie would fade. But even if you know how the movie ends, you still be overwhelmed; this is what happened to me.In conclusion I recommend this movie to everyone, see it till the end if you want to get the message of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""The Firm"" taken one step further","""The Devil's Advocate"" explores and expands upon themes introduced to moviegoers in ""The Firm"", but with a mythical overlay. (I realize both films are based on books, but the analogy still works.)""The Devil's Advocate"" doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good, as the harsh themes could have mired it down completely.The director didn't quite trust our ability to understand some of the point plots without bludgeoning us over the head with them, but sometimes that can be forgiven.Acting in The Devil's Advocate is uneven and at times, gloriously over the top. Keanu Reeves, I am coming to realize, is cursed with a face too placidly built to express emotions convincingly. The scene where he is crying out while holding his wife illustrates what I mean. While his anguished voice and actions are muted by the lack of plasticity in his face, his pain is evident. I think his best bit of acting comes from the scene where he has alternating bodies under his thrusting loins. In those moments his face is more expressive than I can ever recall seeing it, and he seems more ""real"" than he has since ""Bill and Ted"". (The only film I ever recall him looking really happy in.)Ms Theron, as usual, told volumes with each nuanced glance, and Al Pacino is delicious as the modern era devil, one of the last roles before he started phoning it in with recycled personas. (The Insider, Simone, The Recruit) Naming his character ""John Milton"" is splendid irony. I get a big kick out of the look on his face as he threatens to plunge a finger in the basin of consecrated water. The devil as mischievous school-boy, reminding us of why he ""fell"" in the first place.The nudity, while a bit too much for my tastes, was curiously more sensual than sexual, and the near ending brought to mind the ""Bobby in the shower scene"" from Dallas...If you believe in the devil, this film can be disturbing.

Could have been great,"This is a frustrating movie, in my opinion. You can tell that it has potential of being a truly great movie; the basic theme, several plot twists, the casting and the costumes and sets all point in direction of a ""classic"".But I think it falls short, and it does so because of a few flaws that needn't have been there. I've read praise of Al Pacino's performance in earlier comments, but I think it's one of the major problems. He's given completely free reins, and in fact must have been encouraged to go all out. And so he does, with obvious pleasure. The end result is overblown, overstated, crude, lacking in nuance. He laughs like the devil and smiles like the devil... over and over... adding nothing to the character after the initial impression. There is no growth in Milton's character, or in Pacino's handling of it.This is the second problem - the Milton part is badly written. It contains long, literary and completely artificial monologues on the state of the world, that doesn't work at all on the screen. No person, not even the devil, talks like that. You lose interest, because the basic direction of the monologue is clear from the beginning, even though it goes on for another 30 seconds.Putting these two problems together and I think that you have a bit of a turkey inside an otherwise very interesting movie.Of course, Pacino is great in the movie when he works with small gestures, and the Milton part is sometimes intriguing -- a fine example of the RIGHT combination of the two is in the subway scene with the two hispanic hoodlums. I wish there would have been more of that and less loud, maniac monologues. Oh, and that false teeth prosthetic looks really strange on Pacino... in some scenes he looks like a real doofus. Weird.Keanu Reeves was very good (as he sometimes is), as is Charlize Theron. The movie has lots of clever ideas and memorable scenes. It's also pretty unpleasant.

Charlize Theron is very useful as always and it is through her that the film become genuinely scary.However, the real greatness from the film comes in the form of the magnificent Al Pacino. Having tried to watch almost all of his films (i have a few still to - Serpico etc) i can honestly say that this is his best performance ever. The whole devil thing just suits him so well - think Scarface and Godfather 2 mixed. I think they must have done something with his face because he give the most sinister looks ever known.

Beautifully performed that's what made this movie something to remember and fell glad to recommend seeing.He ain't supposed to be the big attraction, but he can't help it, it just explodes out of him. Salute to you Al Pacino, although it's never surprising that we see a magical performance coming from a master like you, but you totally blew me off. I can barely swear that no other actor could possibly deliver what big Al managed to, not even half as good he performed not now, not before and its sure ain't happen in the future. Al Pacino really amazed me this time.

An interesting case of genre hybridity but Reeves' lead and some generally jumbled scenes cannot hold the film together too greatly.,"Who would've thought the merging of the horror genre with the legal thriller would actually threaten to half work? That's exactly the feeling that eerily dawns on you about half way to two thirds of the way through The Devil's Advocate, a film that uses whatever few scares and un-canniness it carries at the best of times to disorientate and make the viewer uneasy Â less is very much more in this film and it works well on an emotional level. The scenes I'm referring to of course are when a certain Mary Ann Lomax (Theron) catches a glimpse of what a couple of high price law firm employees actually are, and that is pure evil in the from of a stick thin but pretty none-the-less female masquerading. They are scenes that zone the viewer out of the legal thriller genre and into a different, unexpected realm; a realm of horror.But these scenes are few and far in-between and are moulded around a lead named Kevin Lomax, Mary Ann's husband, played by Keanu Reeves. The annoying bit about this is that Reeves cannot quite carry the film on his own and does not possess the necessary acting qualities required to drive the bizarre, hybrid beast that is The Devil's Advocate thus rendering it an ordinary and somewhat bland story about a possible apocalypse when it could've been an interesting and, dare I say, groundbreaking film that people might have still been talking about today for reasons other than the fact Pacino, Reeves and Theron are in it.But some of this is down to the telling of the story and a slice of the direction. There is no obvious structure to the film, which isn't a bad thing, but the repetition of the establishing of the new world Kevin inhabits when he arrives in the 'big city' from his rural, old fashioned dwellings drag on a bit and the film takes a while in getting to the meat that will make up the film, that being a murder trial whose suspect is supposedly innocent and guess what; Kevin is put on the job. The Devil's Advocate's priorities seem to be in the right places. The film is a fish out of water story at the be all and end all of it, but it establishes Kevin as a man with a slight religious persona, something that the film utilises when it comes to dealing with the evil that certain other characters possess later on. This makes for good 'jump' scenes or moments in which the character we map onto gets a good freight, as do we. Kevin's slight religious background acts as a catalyst for certain 'feelings' and sensations he gets later on and they work relatively well, cinematically.The film sees Kevin leave his Florida roots with his wife Mary-Ann for New York City. If ever there was a place in America to set a film about a newcomer or a 'fish out of water' arriving in new territory then it's New York. His new boss is John Milton, Al Pacino in a 'rant role', but it's all a faÃ§ade for greater things. Milton is an odd individual but Pacino plays him perfectly. He's egotistical and outgoing, exclaiming things at the top of his voice with the sort of confidence that suggests he's been everywhere and done everything and anything he says is probably dead right anyway.So in this male dominated world of lawyers and suit wearing business officials that inhabit courtrooms and offices, what of the women and Kevin's other half in particular? It's interesting to note that Mary-Ann exists to be a ditzy and somewhat stupid blonde woman who we begin disliking through annoyance but gradually come to feel sorry for as events play out. On the other hand, the mysterious female associates to Milton and his company exist to go shopping and get their breasts out. But this underestimates the film because underneath there is a fair amount of seduction and evil going on between the women. Women have never got a fair crack in either the legal thriller genre nor indeed the horror genre so for them to undergo (in Mary-Ann's case) the psychological horrors and changes they do is impressive in a certain sense.But again, acting pulls the film down. Charlize Theron sees fit to shriek a lot and act in a very odd manner as the psychological study sets in Â she is one fish not enjoying her time out of the water and it tells much later on. But then the shrieking and the eccentric behaviour when not a lot has really happened to drive her that way takes over. Was it the obsession in choosing a certain paint colour? Loneliness? Has all the shopping worn her out and forced her to hallucinate? It all sounds, and feels, a little messy. The bulk of the film is Pacino and Reeves swanning around business parties, interacting with pretty women in expensive suites. Kevin resists certain sins such as lust and greed as his journey goes on but has a few tiffs with his wife along the way. While the film isn't spectacular in any sense and the ending is disappointing, the film retains an interest and its hook of combining the two genres it does acts as a nice anchor throughout but the acting and general content of real note feels out of sorts rendering the film a pretty good exercise but nothing particularly memorable in the long run.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not a most-watch film,"I barely knew the plot of this movie when I watched it at home. I don't know if that affects my enjoyment of the film in a positive or a negative way. I didn't know this film was so... surreal.I have to start with the good things about the film. The tension of the movie increases little by little in a very good way. I really enjoyed how everything kept becoming worse in every scene, and it climaxed in a very intense scene with Al Pacino and Keanu.I also loved the ""dream scenes"" if you can call it that, or more appropriately hallucinations. Especially one of them, which portrayed the exact feelings of a character without having to say a word.The special effects are OK for the time in which it was made. And the production design is really good.I enjoyed Al Pacino's performance although I could kind of notice that he was not taking this role very seriously and had some fun with it. Keanu Reeves does a fine performance with what he is given, which isn't much, and that is the main problem of the film.I don't think the main characters and the secondary characters are really that interesting. I really didn't care a lot about the protagonist or his wife. I think the problem is that they show you how they react to certain stimuli but you don't understand why they reacted that way. The character ark is fine, but still, I have no reasons as to why the character changed.I think that is my main problem with the film. The characters, and if you don't have interesting characters, you don't have an interesting movie.Some other problems are that the story gets kind of over-the-top sometimes and not for the best. Also, I think some plot-lines could have been handled a little better.In conclusion, you don't have to watch this film.

"The Devil's Advocate: A Thrilling Clash of Morality, Ambition, and Temptation","The Devil's Advocate (1997), directed by Taylor Hackford, is a dark and compelling psychological thriller that masterfully blends legal drama with supernatural horror. Starring Keanu Reeves as an ambitious young lawyer, Kevin Lomax, and Al Pacino as the enigmatic and sinister John Milton, the film explores themes of morality, ambition, and the seductive power of evil.Keanu Reeves delivers a solid performance as a lawyer torn between his principles and his desire for success, while Al Pacino steals the show with his electrifying portrayal of Milton, whose charismatic yet chilling demeanor makes him a truly memorable antagonist. Charlize Theron also shines as Lomax's wife, whose descent into madness adds emotional depth to the story.The film's pacing is intense, with a well-crafted narrative that keeps viewers on edge. The cinematography captures the dark, ominous tone of the story, and the climactic confrontation between Reeves and Pacino is both gripping and thought-provoking.While the film occasionally leans into melodrama, its exploration of human flaws and moral dilemmas elevates it beyond a typical supernatural thriller. The blend of legal intrigue and devilish temptation makes it a unique and unforgettable cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

How to do genre with style. . .,"Somebody once said that after Shakespeare, every drama is a Faustian tale of sorts. Which makes you wonder how films like Devil's Advocate are so good, if it's just the same old stuff over again.But I guess it goes to show that you can still do any old story provided you do it with enthusiasm, class and a sense of humour. And as they say, movies are script, casting, and the rest in that order. This is a very good script - great lines, well paced and some good twists which you can work out but what the heck, it's a good ride anyway.Casting Keanu Reeves as the lawyer about to sell his soul - well, somebody was having a quiet chuckle somewhere, but Keanu gives it his best shot. Against Al Pacino who has been given a licence to go Completely Over the Top, well it must have been a daunting prospect, but Keanu pulls it off much better than you'd expect.Pacino puts the whole thing into perspective and keeps the viewer happy with a humdinger performance as a campy but very plausible and convincing Lucifer. Charlize Theron is wonderful as Mary Anne. Everybody puts in and there is an interesting ending which I liked more than some other reviewers.Pact-with-the-devil stories can be horrendous if they are taken too seriously, but Devil's Advocate just stays on the right side of pretentiousness. And irony of setting has never been better exemplified than with Donald Trump's apartment as a set location. The sin of hubris manifested. . .I just wish that the makers of End of Days had taken a few lessons from this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

He plays the character with such charisma and energy that you can't help but be captivated by him. His final speech in the movie is a real highlight, and the line ""Lose?! I don't lose, I win!"" by Keanu Reeves is one that I'll remember for a long time. The ending of the movie is also really powerful. It brings everything together in a way that's satisfying and thought-provoking. Without giving too much away, I think it's safe to say that the conclusion of the film leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. All in all, I would definitely recommend ""The Devil's Advocate"" to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers. It's a well-executed exploration of human nature and morality, and it's definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Polemic and sensational,"An excellent story line, brilliant performances and amazing sequences made this film a surprising success in 1997. The director Taylor Hackford transformed the Andrew Neiderman's novel into the most incredible story about human weakness.The film stars Keanu Reeves as the lawyer Kevin Lomax that receives a great offer by the unpredictable John Milton (Al Pacino) to work for his big company in New York. He and his wife Mary Ann (the young and talented Charlize Theron) leave Gainesville and see their lives transformed into the most terrible nightmare. The dialogues between Kevin and Milton are extraordinary, specially the last one when the Devil says that Kevin was responsible for every bad thing that happened to him. God gave us free will and he could have made other choices, but he was too ambitious to do so.Although the story line is terrific, the best thing about this film is Al Pacino. The star of `Scent of a woman'(Oscar for best male performance) is simply perfect as John Milton. His performance is so convincing that I have seen the movie more than five times just to admire his talent and that is why I recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Full of entertainment- does not disappoint.,"Keanu is a star, Pacino is so thorough, Theron gets under your skin. Solid acting across the board from every character with a notable role, wonderful set design with great scenery, and a strong dialogue throughout. The way this film continues to build and build upon itself to the climactic penthouse Pacino monologue is quite spectacular and it really delivers. I am so very impressed with this film for what it has to offer in meaning as well as entertainment value. Though one aspect in particular is a detractor to the authenticity and serious nature, it is undeniable that this film provides a unique opposition to what we all are taught to believe.Rated R for a reason- watch this film for a date night flick, an entertainment powerhouse, or an opposing perspective to traditional religious teachings in an anti-hero way.

Advocating for a better screenplay,"An idea is only as good as its execution.The problem here is that the already questionable narrative itself is so flawed and lacks any real sense of a concrete goal.Add to that an execution that consists of poor overacting, truly bizarre scenes and a very negative and unpleasant portrayal of humanity.The story seems to unfold only as the film progresses and therefore feels pointless and lost considering that the story should have been well thought out beforehand.The pitch for the producers might have been interesting at the time, but the idea was never well-developed.This lack of orientation of the story creates a underwhelming resolution as well as an abusively long movie length in general.Not well-done was the acting, too. Reeves overacting is laughable and Pacino's over-the-top acting can not be taken seriously.Also odd was the unnecessary amount of profanity and sexual content.There might be a good movie in there, also considering the ethical and thematically interesting aspects that could have been tackled, but it's mostly a disappointement.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Another classic but I won't see it again, being I'm Christian","UPN/Warner Bros./WB flagship classic and a true WB title, and I'm sure this aired on UPN, which was at the height of its popularity when this movie came out. But this was another great story, although somewhat underrated in the very vein of Keanu Reeves. Keanu Reeves stars as a lawyer, defending a criminal. Basically put, this sets a string of events in which disturbing things start to happen. Basically put this is the story of a man who sells his soul for fame. He hits it hard, gets the girls, gets a nice mansion in Manhattan (south-central Manhattan, just south of the Empire State Building to be exact), gets invited to the important events. It is a brutal movie though, and the Satanic imagery was too much for me. But it's a great movie nevertheless.Just as a smug show of arrogance, this movie agrees with me that UPN was closer to Warner Bros. Than The WB. It's a WWOR/UPN man who appears as a reporter in this movie. Bill Boggs, the creator of many WWOR shows as well as WWOR-turned-nationally-syndicated shows such as ""The Morton Downey Jr Show"" and ""Rising Tide"" makes an apperance.

This movie gets more complex and rewarding as it goes along!!!!!!A great portrayal by Al Pacino!!!!!!!,"Supernatural forces hover over the courtroom in this devilish drama adapted from the novel by Andrew Neiderman. Attorney Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) doesn't heed the Bible-based warnings of his mother (Judith Ivey), who views New York City as ""the dwelling place of demons."" Instead, he leaves Gainesville, Florida, with his wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) to put his legalistic skills to the test at a leading Manhattan law firm run by John Milton (Al Pacino). It all goes smoothly -- with Milton urging them to stay, putting Kevin on a $400-per-hour salary, and moving the couple into a luxurious apartment in his own building on Fifth Avenue -- where Mary Ann falls under the influence of neighbor Jackie (Tamara Tunie). After Kevin defends a weird animal sacrificer (Delroy Lindo, uncredited), he moves up to an important case with an apparent murderer, real- estate tycoon Alexander Cullen (Craig T. Nelson). Ignored by Kevin, the troubled Mary Ann has some disturbing experiences, verging on the occult, while Kevin, at work, becomes attracted to redhead Christabella (Connie Neilsen).

Watch this 30 years later,"When this movie was released, it was received fairly well. It played on important topics. It contained several star actors, actors that are still big stars 30 years later.But if you watch it now, it could result in an even better experience than in these days.Think about it; it is set just before the turn of the millennium. It plays on ancient themes. The way it's positioned in time is quite funny.So I would recommend watching it again, like I did. Be ready for some full frontal nudity. It's all artistic, I promise.When you do watch it, it's worth reflecting on the ancient themes and how they play out today.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A very fine thriller,"'The Devil's Advocate' is one of my favorite thrillers of the nineties. It is not as good as 'The Silence of the Lambs' or 'Seven' but it gives the same pleasure to watch it. What Anthony Hopkins and Kevin Spacey did to those two movies is what Al Pacino does to this. They make great villains and although they do horrible things you admire them in a way. They are the best thing in movies like this.(Minor spoilers.) Al Pacino is the Devil himself here and when someone tells him that the only thing worse than not having a father was having hers, he simply replies: ""I can relate. I can, believe me."" You just have to chuckle when you hear this.Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is a hotshot lawyer in Florida who never lost a case. He is approached by a firm from New York to come work for them. John Milton (Al Pacino) is the head of this firm. Kevin's wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) is thrilled with the thought of living in New York at first, but slowly things change. She has creepy visions and she knows things are not as they seem. Kevin's mother, a strong religious person, also feels that things are not good. Around here we learn who Milton really is.The movie has some nice surprises, some of them you might expect, but others are really surprising. What happens I will not reveal, but Pacino's speech near the end, which starts with the words ""let me tell you about God"" is great, funny and more than entertaining. The Devil is the perfect role for Pacino, with his charismatic appearance and his false laugh. Reeves is good enough but is almost nothing in comparison with Pacino, the gorgeous Theron does a great job and the very beautiful Connie Nielsen in a role that becomes more important near the movie's end is fine as well.To see this for Pacino is enough, but there is great other stuff here. Don't miss it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"This film is a stylish, atmospheric delight!","Like all of his movies, you have to expect Al Pacino, to be in full shouting glory.  This film is no exception as he yet again hits you head on with his passionate, high-octane screen presence.The Film begins slowly but builds up Kevin Lomax's character (Keanu Reeves) well, as you quickly learn that his passion to succeed and 'never lose attitude', may actually be his weakness. His wife Mary-Ann played by gorgeous as ever Charlize Theron, is extatically happy, as Kevin is promoted to join a big shot international firm.  They move from their humble home in the South, to begin a new life, in bright lights big city, New York.  Huge pay cheque, exclusive luxury apartment and a stunning gorgeous woman, paradise....or so it would seem!As Kevin begins to realise the strain of his workload, his boss John Milton (Pacino), shows signs that he not only calls the shots but is much more powerful than he's letting on.  Unfortunately Mary-Ann begins too crumble under the pressure of a new life and is distraught by seemingly deluded hallucinations.  Is it a figment of her imagination, or is what she sees, really the interceptions of Milton himself.The plot is deep and interesting, as the truth awaits Kevin...who is John Milton?  I don't want to give anymore away because it was a pleasure to discover the truth but it's worth waiting for, believe me!What I was most surprised about in this film was Keanu Reeves' believable performance.  Nothing has challenged him like this role and I can safely say that you will be impressed.  Not that Keanu hasn't been immensly successful already but he definately should choose more roles like this.Obviously, as Pacino cannot fail to give a awe inspiring performance to his audience, the film is launched into a web of suspense and spine twisting intrigue.  His portrayal of Milton is astonishing. No one else could have played him.  For every minute Pacino graces the screen with his powerful demeanor, he holds your attention and you want more.  He had to play this part with a sense of mystery because the whole film builds up to reveal who Milton really is.  Of course, Pacino pulls this off perfectly.All in all the cast is strong, with Pacino and Reeves proving that they work well together.  Theron is also very impressive and helps the film's sinister atmosphere.  For the film it's self, not one of Pacino's best but a stylish, highly entertaining must-see.  9 out 10!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I don't know what the rest of you are talking about...,"This is a beautiful film.  Even Keanu (sp), who can quite often lull into the Bill & Ted Acting Method, seemed to come through (particularly during the scene with his wife in the hospital).  I have to say that Pacino was fantastic; right up there with his performance in Heat or Scent of a Woman. The last 30 minutes of this movie grab you by the ear-lobe and punish you for not understanding what good filming and acting are all about.  Take another look at it.  Fine acting and fine writing.  How many of you would've chosen as he did?...I wonder :) That was the least believable part, I thought.  But the bottom line:  Own this Movie.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Very thrilling and interesting,"This movie was a very good movie. It was amazing seeing how disturbed Keanu's wife was becoming, and it all seemed to keep coming together.But I think that the greatest part of this movie was the acting.After watching this movie I noticed that Keanu Reeves is actually a good actor. I saw him in the Matrix and thought that he gave a horrible performance, but I now know that there is something else to Keanu's acting. Keanu Reeves does not show you he is acting. Instead he portrays reality, thus making his role more down to earth. I find this to be an even better kind of acting.Al Paccino is a great actor. The way he performs his role as Satan in this movie is very interesting, for when the movie is in it's beginnings he seems like a perfectly civil, smart, fun-loving person. But then you see what is happening, and how he represents TEMPTATION. He offers Keanu a perfect job. Keanu never loses a case. Al Paccino is surrounded by sex and sexy bodies. He does his role perfectly.Keanu's wife in this movie does her role well also. She portrays an innocent girl that has such a nice future, and then when Al Paccino starts screwing her up you see how horrible this crime is only because of the way she plays her character.This movie was a great movie. I saw it starting at 1:30 in the morning, so I was a little sleepy and started losing it towards the end, but I think that I was able to grasp it, even though as I am reflecting on it the end does seem a bit out of place... just see this movie while perfectly awake and you'll like it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Vanity truly is the most wondrous of sins,"Keanu Reeves plays Kevin Lomax, an up-and-comer lawyer working in some backwater Florida town. He has never lost a case and after a high profile case defending a supposed child molester he gets hired to a New York based law firm, led and founded by John Milton (Al Pacino), whose odd habits, requests and prerogatives soon begin to take their toll on Kevin and his wife, Mary Ann (Charlize Theron). It's almost like they're selling their souls to the devil.What this film has in spades is style. It's an old fashioned cautionary tale wrapped in 90s upper class razzle dazzle. It's the oldest tale ever told, that of good and evil, seen through the eyes of modern lawyer politics. It's a horror story that tries to pretend it's a court room drama.And throughout it all, our three main leads, Reeves, Pacino and Theron, are giving it their all. And it convinces. It more than convinces. It sells it like we're stranded in Sahara and they have an extra jug of water to spare.That being said, it's really Al Pacino that makes this narrative soar. Especially towards the end, where he completely looses it and delves into these deep monologues about the nature of divinity, free will as the source of evil, the inevitable fate of mankind and so much more. I could watch that final confrontation a thousand times and would never be bored.Fantastic film. I'm sure it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I inhaled it like it was oxygen.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Where are they now?,"Even a massive film fan like me can't see every movie as it is released at the cinema or on DVD and sometimes it is fun to watch a work years after its release and see what has happened to its stars in the intervening period. So almost two decades passed before I caught up with ""Devil's Advocate"" (1997), a film with plenty of sex and violence that is a savage critique of the American legal profession and a challenge to the Christian conception of the Almighty.Al Pacino plays the diabolical head of a sprawling corporate empire who gives a splendidly over-the-top performance. Of course, Pacino - one of the finest actors of his generation - was a star at the time and continues to shine in his 70s and any compilation of his greatest moments should include a clip from his diatribe at the end of ""Devil's Advocate"". Keanu Reeves is the advocate of the title, a hot-shot young lawyer who somehow never loses a case. This role came before Reeves hit the big time with ""The Matrix"" trilogy and, since then, his career has fluctuated but is currently on an up with his appearance as ""John Wick"".The real surprise is Charlize Theron who plays the advocate's wife. She was virtually unknown when appeared in this movie - one of her very first - but is now a high- profile celebrity with a central role in the blockbuster ""Max Max: Fury Road"". She might now regret her full-frontal nude scene in ""Devil's Advocate"" but she not the only woman on show here and the shot does have a dramatic purpose.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Horror and thriller at it's best,"I had watched this film when it was released in theatres all those years ago as a youngster. I watched it again today on Prime with the same edge of the seat feeling.Lumax and his wife being a cozy couple move to Manhattan from South (Florida). There is love between them but there is something more than this in Lumax's mind that is beyond the boundaries of relationship. The questions and moralities of sin, love and lust are blurred in his head. He is the winner, the unbeatable and the irrepressible..... well that is what Lumax thinks! How this unravels throughout the film in an enthralling fashion keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats (or the sofa).Keanu Reeves as Lumax is top notch. He has been underrated throughout his career but does the role to it's perfection. Charlize Theron as his wife has done brilliantly well. Considering she was so young at that time both in terms of age and career, the role is quite complex and she nails it. Al Pacino is class. The subtle change in his mannerisms quickly within scenes is a treat to watch.Production is excellent with just enough amount of CGI used to justification. The rest of the screenplay moves with the tight storyline so one doesn't need CGI all the time. Pace is constantly on the edge and one is totally hooked to each frame till the end.A thrilling ride to be enjoyed!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Film About the Choices We Make,"This was a film that I remember when it came out, but I didn't see it for some time afterwards. I did see it in high school with some friends, I believe after I saw Scarface where I fell in love with Al Pacino and his acting abilities. I know that I saw it again in college, but it really wasn't until this viewing when I watched it a critical eye can I fully appreciate it. The synopsis is an exceptionally adept Florida lawyer is offered a job at a high-end New York City law firm with a high-end boss, the biggest opportunity of his career to date.We start in a courtroom. Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is the defense attorney for Lloyd Gettys (Chris Bauer). He's a high school teacher who is accused of molestation by a student. The student's testimony is pretty damning and Kevin looks at his client while she is testifying. He knows that everything she is saying is true. When the witness is turned over to him, he needs a short recess. It is in the bathroom that he speaks with Larry (Neal Jones), a reporter, who asks him for a quote as he is about to lose his first case. Kevin comes back into the courtroom and puts reasonable doubt in the jury by calling into question the motives of the student. Gettys goes free.At a local bar, Kevin celebrates with his wife, Mary Ann (Charlize Theron). On his way to the bathroom Kevin is approached by Leamon Heath (Ruben Santiago-Hudson), who offers him a job with the law firm he works for in New York. He accepts and he tells his mother, Alice (Judity Ivey) before he goes. He doesn't want him to New York, calling it the new Babylon and we see that she doesn't care for Mary Ann either. The job is to pick a jury for a case up there. It ends up working out, even though the attorney who is in charge of the case disagrees.This gets Kevin a meeting with the head of the firm, John Milton (Pacino). It turns out to be a negotiation as Milton wants to start a criminal division. Kevin and Mary Ann are moved into the swanky apartment building that Heath, his wife and Milton all live in as well. When Kevin is introduced to the firm, Christabella Androli (Connie Nielsen) catches his eye. The first case that he is given involves Phillipe Moyez (Delroy Lindo). Kevin dives into this and starts to neglect his wife. Mary Ann falls into depression as she loses her husband over to his work. She also has doubts to if that is what he is burying himself into.When Alice comes to visit and catches a glimpse of Milton, she is uncomfortable and doesn't want to stay in New York. Milton catches on to this and goads her a bit. Kevin doesn't seem to notice though. It all takes a turn though when major client of the firm, Alexander Cullen (Craig T. Nelson) is accused of killing his wife, stepson and maid. Kevin is given the case much to the displeasure of Eddie Barzoon (Jeffrey Jones). This takes up even more of Kevin's time as his wife descends into madness and starts to think that those around her aren't as they seem.Now I wanted to recap as much of this film as I could without going too much into spoilers. Coming into this most recent viewing, I knew some of the reveals, but to be honest, there were some that I didn't remember either. This film actually ticks a lot of things that I've come to loving in films, especially the perversion of religion. I don't know if I had read 'Paradise Lost' or not at the time of my last viewing, but I love that nod for those that know what that epic poem is about.The title of this film is something that is really a great allegory and foreshadowing for the film. I personally tend to be the Devil's Advocate when I'm arguing with friends, because personally I like to ensure that both sides of a topic are explored to fully understand it. Kevin though is also technically doing the devil's work by getting those he is defending off with reasonable doubt. Kevin is a scumbag, but then again, he's doing what he's tasked with. This becomes a moral debate for defense attorneys, do you protect your client, even if you know they're guilty or do you do what you think is right? This again comes up when he's defending Cullen.What I also love about this film is exploring the seven deadly sins. It is interesting that earlier in the decade; we had Se7en, where the killer is using these for his grand plan. Here we are seeing Kevin and the other lawyers in the firm living out their fantasies as well as committing these. Kevin is a victim to vanity, which he wants to win and he wants the glory. He is also prideful, he experiences lust for Christabella as well as greed. Milton at times gives him the option to give up what he is doing, but Kevin exercises his free will to continue on what he's doing. I just really love this, tying it back in with my previous point of the use of religion.Now there is the issue with this film, which happened a lot in the decade, of whether this is a horror film. If you know me, I will try to claim as many as I can for my genre, which again, I do think this is horror. We have metaphorically and literally in the film the devil. We have those that are committing heinous crimes and getting away with them. On top of that, we have that lawyers could be doing the devil's work by allowing criminals to get away with it, which could be the devil's plan. Rick Baker did effects in this film to make demons be represented as well. We don't know if this is something that the people are hallucinating, but that also brings up the horror concept of the descent into madness.Which brings me to the pacing of the film, where I never really found myself bored, but the film is quite long. It runs two hours and twenty minutes if you didn't want to look up what it was. It would be hard to cut things from this film though, as we have to see Kevin's fall from grace in his pursuit of his career, equally seeing his wife descend into madness as she is corrupted as well. I will admit, I forgot how it ended, but there is a quick little thing at the end that I did like. It really did recover for me there.I want to move next to the acting of the film, which I think is good for the most part. I hate to do this, as he is such a good guy but I don't like Reeves in the starring role of the film. He does give off the arrogance necessary for the lawyer aspect. He doesn't give me the emotions that I need though. I can see in the end why he was chosen, but I just feel there could have been someone better in my humble opinion. Pacino is great though. I love the character he portrays and everything he does. He is great at disarming and then convincing them to commit the acts they do. Theron is also great and gorgeous in this film. We do see her nude, which wasn't bad either. Nielsen was solid in her role as well. I want to give shout-outs to Ivey, Nelson and the rest of the cast. They definitely rounded out the film for what was needed. It was crazy to see a young Monica Keena as well here. I had to look it up and confirm by checking out those scenes again.That moves me next to the effects of the film. I do think that some of it was CGI, but where that was used it was fine. It really is small effect and some of it being that faces distort. I think the look of the demons was good and seeing that Baker did them, I'm not surprised in the least bit. The film is also shot very well.Now with that said, I forgot how much I really like this film. Seeing it this time with a critical eye, this film does things I really enjoy in films. The perversion of religion is something that makes me enjoy films even more if I'm honest. I like how this is presented in seeing a character ruin themselves with the choices they make and the descent into madness of those around them. The acting really helps bring this to life, even though I don't feel that Reeves fits. The film is a bit long, but it is hard to find things to cut out though. It doesn't get boring and the ending works. The soundtrack of the film didn't really stand out to me, but it also never took me out of the movie so I have no issues there. Some might argue this isn't horror, but I can contend that it is. Overall I think this is a really good film and would recommend this for horror and non-horror fans alike with its message.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Gogol would have not done better,"In the classic Russian literature you find several writers always asking themselves about the dilemma between God and the Evil, one of them was Gogol, much more idealistic than Dostoyevski. This film reminded me Gogol, from time to time Dostoyevski's ""Brothers Karamazov"", and also JosÃ© Saramago's ""Jesus Christ Gospel"" because of its strong religious argument probably arguable according to each one'believes. It is true XX century belongs to evil, too many wars and disasters. The modernization and industrialization haven't prevented the problem instead the situation became tougher and troublesome all over. The vanity of the man goes beyond simple ambitious of moderate wealth, he/she always wants more and more, not taking into account that there are others having nothing, just surviving or living for a while. This film goes deep into these matters, and is worth to be seen by all, particularly in industrialized societies. Al Pacino was the real evil, but a reasonable one, his arguments unfortunately were not debated as I would like; Keanu Reeves played the role of an ambitious lawyer, who knows everything and wins all processes, he killed his family, his feelings and his life, while Charlize Theron was the victim of this disgrace. It is advisable to read the novel of Andrew Neiderman before seen the film.

There are so many admirable things in this movie, and the whole concept was very intriguing.

An Angel Heart for the new Millennium,"I was put off of seeing this movie it when it first came out because:- (a) I'm not (normally) a Reeves fan (b) I am a Pacino fan but for some reason I expected his performance to be ""low-key"" - perhaps a Michael Corleone great grandfather type figure - all restraint and quiet reflection. (c) I hate (most) courtroom drama moviesI saw the movie on video last night and was...... very pleasantly surprised. Reeves was pretty good - 100% believable in the role.  Every member of the supporting cast were fantastic and Pacino was excellent but in a very unconventional, unlikeable way.  His John Milton seemed, at turns, to (deliberately I think) parody his Godfather, Scarface and even Scent of a Woman characters.  One of my favourite movies of all time is Angel Heart. This movie is the only thing that has even come close to reaching the same sinister/inward-spiraling/reality-bluring atmosphere of that earlier movie. There was so much about TDA that was impressive.  Sure, the ending was (somewhat) predictable but the way in which it was resolved was extremely imaginative and thought provoking.  I was glad that the sfx were not allowed to ""take over"" the movie which is a common failing in these CGI-prevalent times.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes intelligent, chilling movies.  One last point: Shouldn't the Rolling Stones fadeout track have been ""Sympathy for the Devil""?",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Weird flick, you make my heart tick","This is really a weird film, trust me. I mean I've seen a couple of strange films but never have I seen such a strange one yet. That probably originated in me thinking that this would be a film about a lawyer in the style of The Firm, you know I thought it was about a young lawyer making the big hit in the city and all the problems that arise there. I had seen the commercials on TV a few years back and I was under the impression that it was about a lawyer who moves to the city and starts an affair there and gets in trouble later due to the adultery he committed. MAN I was wrong, never have I been so wrong in my life. But that Âbeing wrong' was also encouraged by the Video Store I rented it in. It said there right on the side that it was a thriller and not like a science fiction movie or something. I know this isn't genuine science fiction, but hell this ain't a genuine thriller either. I don't know what this was man, I don't know and that has never happened to me before.The question now is really was I disappointed, HELL no, it was a good film really. OK when Charlize Theron started freaking out I was like: ÂWhat is this man?' but then I started getting into it and I must really say the performances helped a lot too. Keanu Reeves was good. Charlize Theron and Connie Nielsen, they were good too (really). What about Pacino??? Well, Al Pacino, he was fu..ing great. He was like, damn I have never seen him so good, he was pure evil and that made you believe he was the character he portrayed. He was just the best one in the whole picture great performance, I would have liked to have seen some kind of nomination or award for that role.Although I know and feel it was a bit of a strange film, I liked it still, because it had all the elements that a good film needs, it had a good story, a good cast, good direction and of course enough excitement not to lose appeal, for it was like 144 minutes long. That's 2 hours and 22 minutes. The film was just built up in the best possible way. You really started thinking during the film and it all was kept really tasty, so it would not get too cheap and gory. Those last things were not needed too for the actors and the story were good and it was not some ÂUrban Legend 3: This is really the Final Cut people, plus it is the best one yet'.Of course with a film like this and the actors involved there are bound to be some excellent scenes and believe me there were some. My favourite two are the whole ending with the Reeves Â Pacino confrontation and of course the scene with the broken mirror (I don't want to spoil anything but that was the best scene of the sort I have ever seen).At last there is only one more thing I want to say to all of you, if you don't know what I mean with this being a strange film, let me put it like this, it reminded me a lot of Rosemary's Baby, but it was like million times better. Let's say it like this, this is the kind of movie I expected to see when I started watching Rosemary's Baby. Still don't know what I mean? Rent The Devil's Advocate then and do it fast.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Far-Fetched, But It Works","Keanu Reeves plays Kevin Lomax, a young Florida attorney who makes a name for himself by winning - all the time - even when defending some less than savoury characters, and even though he has to battle personal demons (no pun intended) as his conscience is continually wounded by his business. After one particularly noteworthy courtroom victory, he's approached by a prestigious New York law firm headed by - wait for it - old Satan himself, played superbly and hilariously by Al Pacino. Pacino alone makes it worth watching this movie. He shines as the Prince of Darkness. Although the movie isn't really intended as a comedy, it's a hilarious parody of the law profession as we note how easily the devil fits into this particular line of work.A very strong cast backs up Pacino and Reeves. Charlize Theron plays Mary Ann (Lomax's lonely wife,) who is excited at first about moving to New York, then learns to truly hate the place. Jeffrey Jones puts on an interesting performance as Eddie Barzoon, the managing director of the firm - interesting because he did a pretty good job and made a definite impression even though he played a character who I thought was very poorly developed. Tamara Tunie put on a wondrously sultry and sensual performance as Jackie Heath, the wife of one of Lomax's new law partners, who befriends Mary Ann.No doubt this is about as far-fetched as they come, but the ending - which I have to confess I didn't see coming - makes some of that understandable. It's entertaining throughout. I'd give it an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Reeves has one of his best roles as the naive lawyer, who doesn't know what he's getting into. Theron is also good as the increasing frighten wife. But of course, one of the most memorable things about ""The Devil's Rejects"" is Pacino's wild over the top performance. Which he's brilliant at being funny and creepy at the same time. This is fine entertainment for the adult audiences. This feature was over-showed by ""I'll Know What You Did Last Summer"", when it was released.

excellent,"Introduction: The Devil's Advocate is an excellent horror film about a young successful lawyer who has never lost a case. Even when he knows his client is guilty, he always manages to turn things around so that it seems he is innocent. That makes him a good lawyer, but a bad person. When Kevin is offered a job at the world's best known law firm, he moves with his wife to New York. There he proves his reputation as reckless lawyer, but his success has a price. From the moment he meets John Milton, the head of the law firm, strange things happen to him and his wife. Their life slowly changes into a living hell.Comment: this is, in my opinion a very controversial film. There will be some who will love it, and some who'll hate it. I belong to those who love it. Many people will find this hard to watch entirely, because of the amount of gore and nudity. Also, the movie is mean-spirited as a whole, some of the things people do in this film are simply very bad. However, viewers who understand that this is a movie about the devil, which means there will be some gory parts and sexuality, will love this movie. It is a very twisted and scary film, that not everyone will enjoy. But it's a thrilling and emotional roller coaster ride from beginning to end. I recommend it to horror fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hammy but enjoyable Pacino in camp thriller,'The Devil's Advocate' is a camp thriller that entertains despite going way over the top. Al Pacino plays the devil and gives a hammy scenery-chewing performance that will leave you in splits. He isn't the least bit scary as Satan but is very watchable. Keanu Reeves is alright. Charlize Theron impresses in a brief role as the tormented wife. The film has a moral to deliver about pride and does so in style. The camera work is sometimes annoying and the ending makes little sense. Still the whole thing is perfectly watchable. Note - there is a lot of profanity.Overall 7/10,,Anonymous,Mystery
Good though the story never pull together!,"Too old for Hamlet and too young for Lear--what's an ambitious actor to do? Play the Devil, of course. Jack Nicholson did it in The Witches of Eastwick; Robert De Niro did it in Angel Heart (as Louis Cyphre--get it?). In The Devil's Advocate Al Pacino takes his turn as the great Satan, and clearly relishes his chance to raise hell. He's a New York lawyer, of course, by the name of John Milton, who recruits a hotshot young Florida attorney (Keanu Reeves) to his firm and seduces him with tempting offers of power, sex, and money. Think of the story as a twist on John Grisham's The Firm, with the corporate evil made even more explicit. Reeves is wooden, and therefore doesn't seem to have much of a soul to lose, but he's really just our excuse to meet the devil. Pacino's the main attraction, gleefully showing off his--and the Antichrist's--chops at perpetrating menace and mayhem. The film was directed by Taylor Hackford (Against All Odds, Dolores Claiborne), who provides alternate-track commentary for the movie itself, plus a dozen deleted scenes. Also note: due to a settlement with artist Frederick Hart over the movie's use of a sculpture resembling his Ex Nihilo in Washington's National Cathedral, future releases of the film will be altered.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Judging the actors,"Well, I like this kind of movie. From first to last this thriller makes us asking questions. And that's why I love this movie from my first viewing back in 1999. till yesterday, when I watched it again on TV. All right I admit; I probably catch it once more during that period. But with movies like this you don't get bored. You only notice some new details, or you watch just how one man acts. 9 years ago I was watching Pacino, because of him I lend this movie from video and yesterday I watched this movie as whole, with all its main actors, including Reeves and Theron. I don't want to talk about the whole script and about biblical meaning. This comment is about actors and about actors only.Plot is about young lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), who comes to New York from Florida, so he can work in the most powerful law firm in the world. His mother Alice (Judith Ivey) disagree with his decision but all Kevin wants is to make money and try to live happy life with his wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron). Law firm is in the hands of powerful and mysterious John Milton (Al Pacino). Soon, Kevin is sinking in his new cases and pays less and less attention to his wife, who feels homesick and has all sorts of bizarre thoughts connected with devil.I just love to watch performances from actors in these sort of movies. Al Pacino is one of my favorite male actors (with Depp, Brando and Dean) and his performance is stunning as usual. He plays with his role maybe a little too much, but we can all forgive such genius. He will probably never disappoint any of his fan. Such a perfect choice for role of John Milton.Charlize Theron. What to say after another great role? Theron gives us best performance from all three star actors. She is so convincing and she plays perfectly her role right till the end. You just gotta love her. An Oscar worthy performance.Keanu Reeves is our young lawyer and he really looks like one but this is not his role. He can't pull this movie on another level. He is trying so hard to act in some scenes but he just can't. In court room he is very good and all the scenes in which there isn't Theron are also good. Actually in scenes with Pacino, Pacino is letting him to act, so we can view his talent. Pacino with his experience is trying to help Reeves and you can't say that Reeves is bad in any scene with Pacino. He is just ordinary. I would like to remind you about one movie that was made also in 1997. ""Donnie Brasco"". Pacino helps Depp too, but Depp outshines Pacino in some scenes which is not the case with Reeves. Reeves is good and cool actor, but he'll never be great. That's just my opinion. You can either like it or not. Like every other thing in life.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Masterpiece of a Script,"Very few times does Hollywood get it right when portraying characters that truly tell the nature of the human experience. The Devil's Advocate does so in spectacular fashion. Kevin Lomax, brilliantly played by Keanu Reeves, is a charismatic lawyer in the state of Florida whose undefeated career is propelled into the limelight when he wins one more seemingly unwinnable case. Invited to New York to help in a jury selection by a powerful firm headed by the equally charismatic John Milton, played by the ever excellent Al Pacino, Kevin's astuteness is rewarded when he is offered a job at the law firm. But he is soon to learn that all is not as it seems when he settles with his wife in the modern-day ""Babylon"" that it is New York. This movie is packed with A-listers: Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, Charlize Theron etc,--a separate, dedicated article is needed just to expound on the depth of their performances. The truly great thing though about the movie is the script. Because an actor is only as good as what he/she has to work with. And in The Devil's Advocate the actors had something that only comes around once in a lifetime. It is a complex examination of the concept of free-will and how sometimes as humans we forget that we ALWAYS have a choice, and that the choices we make shape our life and the lives of those around us. But sometimes in our pursuit of perfection we lose that moral anchor that delineates clearly for us what is good and what is bad. And we lose that anchor because there is a powerful force working hard for us to. Free Will? Conundrum, right? The ""Devil"" in the title, John Milton, accuses God of playing a sort of game with us by giving us free will and then admonishing us to not ""Touch This"" and ""Don't Touch That"", supposedly driving us crazy with rules He knows we can't keep. However rules does not remove choice, otherwise there will no be criminal justice system. The rules are there, and we chose whether to break it or not. FREE WILL. It's a blessing a curse. For how can we run when a more powerful force seduces our will one way or another? That's the dilemma of the human experience and the question this movie poses.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Tedious, annoying and toothless","A devil that is not one bit scary and has absolutely nothing to say except tedious tropes endlessly used in similar films. A monotone protagonist, with Reeves terribly miscast. A love story that is unpersuasive. Lazy writing, with the characters' motivations often being unclear or absurd, and some annoying dialogues that follow the dumbest cliches in screenwriting. The protagonist's relationship with his mother is obscure, remains undeveloped, and is just annoying. His marriage is even worse. His bizarre abandonment of the wife is never made to seem persuasive, just like his overall treatment of her. At the end of the day, we never learn what really drives the protagonist. Yes, he is ambitious, but beyond that, everything he does happens because the plot needs it to happen, and not because we genuinely understand what goes on in his head. As for the anticlimactic ending... I expected it. By then I expected absolutely nothing more from this tedious film. Pacino holds yet another long-winded speech, which is all he does in this movie. I just wanted the devil to shut up and actually do something scary. But he never does. This film is a series of court cases, with the lame trope of the devil destroying the protagonist's wife while no one believes her and thinks she is insane. If you want to see something similar, watch Rosemary's Baby instead. That film is actually creepy, unlike this lazy pile of tropes. Not once does this film become scary. Ever. And not once does it do something unexpected. I derived absolutely no pleasure from this film. It was a dumb story and a plot that goes through the motions without ever drawing the audience into the story.Avoid this film. And if you are into theology, trust me: this devil hasn't got a single thing to say you haven't heard before. The fact that Pacino delivers it as if it were some great revelation that will capture the audience makes it all the more stupid.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Haha, great movie","If just to see just how BAD Keanu Reeves can act compared to the genius of Pacino. The comparison is so bad, so overwhelming, that whenever the two are onscreen together, you feel so BAD for Keanu. the poor guy, even HE has no idea why he's such a big star. ""Whoa!"" indeed. The flick itself is pretty good, except for the lame-brained ending, which completely destroyed everything the movie built up to in the previous 2 hours. Nix the horrible ending, and end the film with the scene we all wanted to see (You KNOW what scene I'm talking about *wink wink*) and this movie would be incredible. As it stands, it's just good.P.S. I'm unable to decide rather Reeves is a worst actor than Theron, or if they're both equally bad, but whenever the two are onscreen I feel like someone just stole my wallet. They are so BORING and bland. Compared to the not-always-attractive Pacino, you have NO QUESTION as to why Theron and Reeves made it as actors -- and folks, I ain't talkin' about talent here.",,Anonymous,Mystery

made me want to become a lawyer,"This movie is basically about a lawyer working for Satan. How stereotypical, right? Lawyers in the service of the devil, how original...However, this movie is actually pretty decent considering. A far cry from more accurate, albeit still immensely fake, depictions of lawyers like Law & Order, The Devil's Advocate is the story of a man, played by Keanu Reeves, who goes from obscurity all the way to the top, with the help of Satan, of course. The acting is decent, with Al Pacino being the highlight (as always). Charlize Theron plays Reeves' wife. She does a pretty decent job and she's definitely attractive.This is definitely not your average John Grisham based movie. The focus is more on the characters and not the law itself. Do not expect a traditional legal thriller. In the same sense, however, do not expect a true horror movie either. This movie is a half-hearted attempt at both, without getting either one right. It reminds me of The Ninth Gate, in that respect. Not scary or really thrilling but still interesting.I think I liked this movie as much as I did because I identified with the main character, as I am interested in becoming a lawyer. For those who are not interested in law or are not lawyers, this movie may prove to be significantly less interesting and less enjoyable. All in all, a decent film. I give it a 8 out of 10. For others though, I expect the rating to be lower, more like a 5 or so.Also, I'd like to point out that the accent Keanu Reeves has is probably the worst southern accent I've ever heard, especially since he's supposed to be from Gainesville, FL, my place of birth, and few people in Gainesville actually have accents, let alone that one.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Devil ought to sue,"Many people really enjoyed this movie, but I have to admit (in rather flaky terms) that I'm the Devil's advocate regarding this.""The Devil's Advocate"" is OK. Actually, it was pretty campy. Some parts of it were so campy that they were sad. ""Advocate"" attempts to examine lofty material such as instinct versus ethics and free will, but it never reaches its goal. The material is discussed, but it's discussed so clumsily, so abruptly, and so flimsily, that the discussions seem more like an attempt to convince the viewer that this isn't really a slasher flick - that it's really a sophisticated film.  Well, it's really a poor amalgamation of thriller, slasher flick, and comedy-drama.As for Al Pacino's highly-praised performance, it's pretty neat - all 30 minutes of it. It's also neat as long as you consider that Al Pacino was really playing Al Pacino. The female performers were extremely annoying. Charlize Theron, who played Kevin Lomax's (Keanu Reeves) wife, doesn't do much besides scream, whine, and take her clothes off. Otherwise, there's a lot of lesbian-like activity between supporting characters who don't do much besides sneer and touch each other's breasts. Keanu Reeves' performance is very good, but his accent really gets in the way. It's difficult to take seriously someone whose accent is not only not real but sounds like a cross between ""In the Heat of the Night"" and ""Deliverance."" This is not Reeves' fault; it's the director's fault. Not every southerner, certainly not every Floridian, has a southern accent. Why does Kevin Lomax need one?I do give this movie credit for a great monologue (spoken by Al Pacino), interesting special effects (although not always the top of the line), and a surprise ending.If you're terribly bored one evening and there's nothing good on TV, this is a night's entertainment.

Do you job good and you just might earn a ticket to hell,"One quick look at the poster sets that chain of dominos off to the ""wish-to-watch"" button. Al Pacino luring with a charming smile, Keanu Reeves striking with a crispy-looking suit and Charlize Theron is as beautiful as always.Moving directly to the sale of Keanu's skills by means of a ruthless trial we see the motion towards a high throne entangled in the turbid mist of doubt that corrodes whatever righteous principles one can have. The attitude shown within Kevin Lomax deserves a high praise considering that the character undergoes the unhuman seduction by the inventor of this word himself. The part of Charlize Theron cannot be put aside; she spices this trial to the point of sweet tortures of consciousness that do the opposite of what she had intended. These mind and body games go deep beyond the simple fraud, they show the hidden nature of a person on a single example of a suburban lawyer.The other, magnificently breathtaking performance is standing out immediately and of course it is Al Pacino. Plainly saying this is just a role for which he was created. You look at the man and see that he could not only be a boss of a law firm but without any strain hold a faith of the world in his bare hands. The devilish subtlety that covers a sharp wit, aged appearance hiding the vigor of thousand men and the manner that cannot be rejected even by the holiest nun is a hallmark of Al Pacino.Besides the plot twists and stunning acting, we get ingenious editing and directing. I was blown away by the use of light, especially the fireplace scenes depicted that infernal atmosphere so inherent to the residents of hell. The mystic flair was scattered a bit by the fleeting visual effects: one of them was enchantingly impressive but the others were like mosquito bites - unpleasant but tolerable.The verdict is unanimous - the picture stands out and among all the suspense gives a valuable lesson in a way that astounds you.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Al Pacino's monologues about his edge of Reeve's in that people never see him coming is near flawless. His character is believable in its fullest.

Al Pacino does no less than a superb job portraying John Milton, a man of power, women and money living in a world with no guilt. A great moment in cinema when he makes his final speech to Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves). But his acting only the icing on the cake of a brilliant film. The script also deserves mention for portraying the devil not as a bloodthirsty monster but as a being of temptation and desire. While not really being a drama but not really being a thriller either, you truly feel for the characters but are put on the edge of your seat at the same time, the second half of this movie will hold you in constant suspense. The nudity and violence are a bit gratuitous but never for their own sake, everything you see is there for the movie, any less and it wouldn't have worked as well.Overall a fantastic film and a must see for all thriller fans and all drama fans.

The Devil's Advocate takes its time burning out.,"Not that he needed to but Taylor Hackford more than confirms he is no Roman Polanski in this slick modern day Gothic horror that in the course of its healthy running time (144 minutes) becomes one to endure. Poorly paced, over and under acted this slick looking bore grows more incredulous with each reel as the characters lose steam with Hackford desperately tries to inject some shock value ( a demented Charlize Theron going topless in a church being one of his grander flourishes) into this supernatural snorer.Florida counselor Kevin Lomax has all the tools to make him a superb defense lawyer. When he gets the call to go to work for a firm in the majors he jumps at it. Moving to the Big Apple he joins the firm of John Milton (Al Pacino) whose piercing intensity Lomax finds both motivating and intimidating. He begins to prove himself fast and is given some big assignments over senior staff. Career wise things are going great but at home wife Mary Ann (Theron) is starting to deconstruct and there is strong suspicion Milton has something to do with it.With the wooden Reaves in the lead Advocate is sore in need of one as he feigns confusion at the most obvious of ploys put forth by the evil Milton. For a guy that's supposed to be a sharp lawyer he spends an awful amount of the films running time oblivious to Hackford's heavy handed red flags. Pacino's sartorially attired Beelzebub is all wide eyed sadist and smugness with runway models replacing Gog and Magog as companions. Oozing unctuous charm and calm he toys with Lomax longer than a cat with a chipmunk and it's just about as entertaining.

Every success has its price!,"Every time I think of all the great things I am going to do to get my career going, be competitive, show the world, etc. I am reminded of this movie which very carefully shows us what could be the price of going for it a little bit too much.It is important to strive for success, the fast track, and to get to the top but we should always remember that the higher we get, the harder we are likely to fall.And the price to get there cannot be obtained, or rather shouldn't be obtained, by selling our souls!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Riiiiight.,"Okay, see, this movie, it's got Keanu Reeves playing a highly successful, very smart attorney working for some kind of firm.  If you can get past that (which is no easy task, as Keanu isn't the ::: cough ::: greatest actor), you'll realize it tries to play off as an intelligent thriller.  Make no mistake, it's not.  I wasn't exactly paying attention at the beginning, so there's a miniscule chance I missed something, but I doubt it, as there's really nothing to this movie.  Okay, yeah, you've got Keanu playing nancy-boy, and he does some work, goes a little south on his morale, and realizes his boss is Satan.  How many times have I had this realization? Yeah.  Pretty intriguing, no?  Perhaps if this had been better written, the sets had been a little better, not so overwhelming, maybe this would have worked.  Al Pacino played every character he's played since Michael Corleone, oftentimes yelling at spontaneous moments, and not always making sense.  Okay, yeah.  The fatal flaw in this film is that the quality of it seesaws on the ending.  For maybe a minute (and all of you know what a long minute it was, as it stretched on and on in a senseless slow motion portion) this movie was one of the coolest I've ever seen.  But then, the laziness of the writers broke through, and you're disappointed.  All the same, I'll say that if you turn it off at that moment, folks, you're looking at a grand film.  Time it right, and you've got a great movie.  You'll know when.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Exposing women to evil is an easy way of raising the audience's emotions,"A most pleasing surprise! Since I haven't heard very much about it, I assumed it to be just another thriller. I was wrong. I think it succeeds very much in creating an ever escalating anguish with the audience, the evil just get worse and worse. Of course, subjecting women (especially someone's love) to all kinds of evil is a rather easy way to create compassion for the victims and hatred against the villain - in this case the excellent Al Pacino as Milton aka Satan. However, it is done so with great care and thoroughness, to the extent that you cannot help but find yourself intrigued by what is happening and what will happen next. Of course, the many beautiful women of the movie are a strong factor of getting a man's attention...",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Lord of Underworld,"Primarily taken for a crisp horror show for New York lawyers of the 90's, this flick is too underrated. Probably because of the flirting of movie industry with high end dramas or ""lethal weapon"" type of action, so much so that people forget the supreme acting of some of the most excellent Hollywood actors of our time, in their prime.But lets delve into the world of biased lawership of the South and the fast paced world of New York legal arena, where we meet the top lawyers of a firm right out of John Grishams best. Al Pacino, does his best Scarfae and Godfathger into a mayhem of superb acting that just captivates your mind from minute to minute. The plot is beautiful and masterfully paced between handling cases in the middle of a metropolis clash of businessmen and dirty minded partners, while the young gun of Keanu Reeves arrives with his Charlize and just goes ballistic into the money made for big time law firms and calculating every ""fee"" as much as a devils own party would in the most complex environment to handle - the New York law firm cutthroat partnership of lawyers and evils living side by side. Keanu Reeves shines very well in roles where he is fighting for his life and trying to dis ensemble the twisted schemes of the more experienced lawyers at this firm, but cant quite make it in their level of evil. Unless, he has to deal with ""the devil"" himself and his sisters trying to control the world. Just as any high end law firm should if the money is right.The drama develops very well into the second half which turns into real mayhem and the end which gets even ""worse"". Charlize Theron is as beautiful as ever and Keanu us mother does her part to give it a side story of horror ambiance, which also gets it into the movie genre that Pacino prefers and shines on. Although just a tiny bit rough on the edges and utterly cynical at times, this movie is a wonderful piece of film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dynamic Performance,"I have seen this movie approximately 20 times, yes 20 times, and none of the luster has worn off.  Al Pacino is at his best with a convincing portrayal as the devil in disguise.  The balance of the cast, especially Charlize Theron, handled the supporting roles in classic fashion.  The ending of the movie had more twists and turns than the Indianapolis 500 Speedway. Pacino is masterful and his in-your-face analysis of power-hungry achievers makes you wonder if this is fiction or reality.  The special effects are incomparable. A must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly interesting,"Let's find out how devil and being an attorney are linked.Story: attorney ending up to work for the devil!!! It's interesting to see how the plot started and twisted. The characters are very well written. The conflict between a hard job and family, being ambitious and dedicated to your goals and personal life. Talented Al Pacino weaving a trap to Reeves in order to take a certain decision in combination to the concept of free will. Of course, Theron's role as the attorney's wife was fascinating.Acting: Wonderful Al Pacino, very good Theron, adequate Reeves.Recommended!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Awful film.,"This film is absolutely ridiculously. No wonder, Taylor Hackford was at the helm. The plot is hard to swallow, as much as is Keanu Reeves' acting. Good to see Charlize Theron was nominated - what as a supporting actress by the Saturn Awards? Is this a horror film, or a take on justice? Lawyers have to uphold the rights of their clients, to burden them with the results of their trials and send them to hell is a bit of a stretch. Milton, played to the hilt by Pacino who has to make use of some bad screenwriting, harks back to ""And Justice for All"" where we also see the same issues portrayed in a clearer manner, thanks to Norman Jewison. Funny that Craig T. Nelson was in that film as well, this time playing D. A.If this is an Exorcist, it is not a good one. The idea that Milton's character is responsible for the pitfalls of the 20th century is laughable.And if this is truly NYC, people were not smoking in cocktail lounges and soirÃ©es with Alonso D'Amato in 1997.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"How hard must one try to impress the new boss, Satan himself?","A young attorney(Keanu Reeves)with a flawless track record is hired by one of the world's most successful law firms. The organization is run by Satan on earth(Al Pacino). This movie contains elements of decadence, money worship, womanizing, the thrill of power and living without an ounce of guilt. Almost two and a half hours long seems like forever. Tension gets thick enough to club with a 2 by 4.Charlize Theron is beautiful as ever. And proves she can act too. Also featured are Craig T. Nelson, Debra Monk, Connie Nielsen and Jeffrey Jones.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"""For we wrestle not against flesh and blood...""","I had been aware of the basic premise behind this film for a long time and seen a clip here or there. Al Pacino plays the devil, etc., yada yada. Seeing everything in context and in its entirety was something else. The mastery of pacing, tone, the little glimpses you get along the way, knowing what's coming at the end of the journey (or at least thinking you do). This grabs you from the first scene and never lets go. And the way things evolve and develop makes this like the cinematic version of erotic asphyxiation (or so I'd like to think). Everything was on point, and ever so thematically relevant. The only real quibble I have is that Keanu Reeves wasn't quite up to the most dramatic scenes. Everything else was *chef's kiss*. And Al Pacino, aside from a couple recent films, delivered his last genuinely great mega-performance. Once he finally let loose in the finale, whoo boy! The visual effects and the score were also quite good, haunting even. And Charlize Theron and Connie Nielsen at peak hotness, have mercy! (Been watching a lot of Full House lately) To sum up, this was an amazing cinematic experience, even if it wasn't presenting something particularly deep or perceptive.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"incredible performances from Pacino and Reeves, compelling and disturbing and guiltily pleasing","It's shocking that Al Pacino almost passed on this role. When you watch it, it's like he was born to portray the devil but only in how it was written in this movie. Regardless of your religious beliefs, one can enjoy this movie as a piece of fiction as well as an ethical character study. Emotionally charged and visually disturbing, this is a flick that has me in awe of the performances, script, and even smiling with marvelous disbelief at Pacino's delivery. Possibly my favorite Keanu Reeves role, as big of a Matrix fan as I am. Charlize Theron also did spectacularly, and warrants the most emotional scene in the movie for me. The ending couldn't be more perfect, and I'm all applause.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Vanity, definitely my favorite sin","The Devil's Advocate stands at a peak that is hard to reach in terms of acting and script. Such a devilish film could only have been made this good without the horror elements. The Devil's Advocate is a gripping, thought-provoking thriller that blends legal drama with supernatural intrigue. Keanu Reeves delivers a strong performance as a young, ambitious attorney who is lured into the morally corrupt world of his charismatic boss, played by Al Pacino. Pacino shines in a mesmerizing, devilish role, adding layers of tension and intrigue. The film masterfully explores themes of temptation, power, and the price of ambition, with sharp direction and a twisting narrative that keeps viewers on edge until the final moments. It's a smart, stylish blend of drama and suspense that lingers long after the credits roll. The dialogues are very well described. I don't know if there is anyone who doesn't admire Al Pacino's acting after watching this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This Is Such A Silly Movie,"The Devil's Advocate is utter pants. I wouldn't waste my time explaining the plot but it has to be one of the silliest horror movies ever made. It is a sheer letdown typified by Pacino's over-the-top and overdone performance and Reeves annoying southern accent and a narrative so ridiculous it is laughable. Then again, Reeves has never been that good of an actor himself anyway, if his previous roles are anything to go by. Charlize Theron is type-casted as the blonde bombshell and victim of distress and whilst I have seen better performances from her in this film, she is nothing more than male eye candy and thus, what else? Rather that she turns up in one scene in the nude. Likewise, the ending is just laughable and terrible. This film is total rubbish.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

All Actors are great but Al Pacinos Performance knocks it out of the Park. This Film reflects today's Society, and no change in sight. Movie also aged well the small amount of cgi doesn't look to bad for a movie that is 25 years old. What else can I say, other then watch it if you still don't have.

The Devil as a firm executive!,"This film would have been much better without the introduction of the devil as a person and just concentrate in plain common human evil. Then the characters would've been more real and trustworthy and the film would've gain from it because then they would've had no specialization to be identified with. Like, Al Pacino has the role of the devil and acts like one as everyone is expecting, he is the devil and therefore he is evil, there is no surprise in that. But if he would've been a human being (an evil one), that would've been surprising and much more effective to the plot. And then the film would've jump up from horror to drama, a much better account from my point of view. It's a pity it was not like that, because otherwise the acting and directing was superb, but there is always the possibility of making a new film......",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The reason I can't give it 5 stars though is that I didn't quite find myself enjoying it THAT much, but still.Some things I liked about ""The Devil's Advocate"":It was unique. I have (personally) never seen a movie with this type of plot before, which made this quite an unique experience for me, and not a bad experience either.The acting. Like I said, Keanu Reeves was surprisingly good in this, and of course Al Pacino too, but what is that guy not good in?
