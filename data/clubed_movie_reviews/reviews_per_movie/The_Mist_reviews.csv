The Humanity of Horror,"If, two years ago, you told me that within a couple of years two excellent Stephen King film adaptations would be released, I would probably have laughed it off. Films like The Shining, Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, The Stand and 1408 are usually pretty far between (Note that I consider The Green Mile and Carrie to be the most over-rated King adaptations, so they do not appear here). I like most of the films that have been made from Stephen King novels, novellas, and short stories mainly because I like Stephen King, but I do not recommend many of them as truly good films.Frank Darabont's (writing and directing) The Mist adapts a horror novella of the same name. King's horror work has been the most difficult material to adapt, but this film is comparable to other genre stand-outs such as The Shining and 1408.A brief, dramatic thunderstorm is followed by a freak mist that descends on a small New England town. As the mist permeates the town, people congregate in the local supermarket and hardware store to stock up and gather supplies. David Drayton (Thomas Jane), his son (Nathan Gamble), and his neighbor (Andre Braugher) are among them. Tension builds as a steady stream of military vehicles pass through the mist headed south from a nearby base. But serious concern doesn't start until one of the locals runs to the supermarket with blood spatters on his clothing and talking of monsters in the mist.Indeed, there are horrors outside in the fog, but there are also horrors inside the market - as paranoia, irrationality and religion come into conflict with practical issues of survival.Unlike many horror films, The Mist examines fear and its effects realistically, looks at the horror created by forces beyond human control and the even more terrifying horror that fear creates through forces that are completely within our grasp - our own fears, our beliefs and our treatment of each other. It does so using a classic formula which is comparable to films like Night of the Living Dead and, more recently, Feast.The cinematography, editing and directing are all excellent. The acting is quite good - Marcia Gay Harden and William Sadler stood out for me - and the script is exactly where it needed to be for this adaptation.Highly recommended for King fans and horror fans. Recommended for Sci-Fi fans. Weakly recommended for average cinema-goers who are not generally interested in horror.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Wonderful, horrific, twisted and shocking","Pop quiz. Tell me, what do you consider to be the most successful Stephen King adaptation, made for film or television? ""Carrie""? ""The Dead Zone""? ""Salem's Lot""? ""Stand By Me""? No! Not ""Maximum Overdrive""!! (And if that is your choice, may God forgive you, because I won't.)All of the above, except ""Maximium Overdrive"" of course, are great pieces of work. But my choice as the benchmark Stephen King adaptation would probably be ""The Shawshank Redemption"", directed by Frank Darabont.Stephen King has been very good for Frank Darabont. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has become a modern classic and ""The Green Mile"" was nearly as good. I am glad to say that ""The Mist"" is nearly as good again.""The Mist"" is a great film, perfectly structured, but a film that requires patience. It is a film of the slow build and of a gradual getting to know the characters, their obsessions, their fears and prejudices. It was nice to see a King horror film where his great talent of touching on the reality of a small town, has been exploited. It makes it all the more horrific when all hell does break loose, because the people who are getting hurt are ones that you know.Thomas Jane is faintly wooden. Personally I would not have cast him, but all of the other performances are top notch. Marcia Gay Harden's possibly psychotic, fundamental Christian, Toby Jones' short, pudgy, perfectly ordinary hero, Andre Braugher's uptight, big city lawyer and William Sadler's scared, malleable blue collar worker. All excellent.""The Mist"" is not ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in one crucial way. Whereas ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was about hope and life, ""The Mist"" is about hopelessness and death. One thing that they have in common is an astonishing ending. The ending of ""The Mist"" is wonderful, horrific, twisted and shocking. Not anything that I saw coming.""The Mist"" is marvellous. Must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This King adaptation gets it right,"I was very impressed by this adaptation of Stephen King's 'The Mist'. I have been a fan of the story since it came out and have played the text game and have heard the 3-D audio version of it. This is a masterful suspense/monster movie that puts an ensemble cast into the untenable situation of being in a deteriorating situation they cannot escape from. We watch as alliances are formed, religious paranoia takes hold and, nicely, the movie takes the time to establish characters whom we come to care for before the true action begins. I dock it a couple of points because some of the monsters seemed a little too cgi, and the middle lags a bit, but the much talked about ending is indeed awesome and I was most impressed by the director's decision to keep the music soundtrack down and even eliminate it completely during many of the action sequences. So many movies nowadays crank the music up to 11 to make up for the fact that their suspense scenes do not work. This movie does. I was breathlessly on the edge of my seat for most of it, even though I was already familiar with the story. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
AN ATMOSPHERIC NIGHTMARE,"This is one of the most heart breaking and depressing horror movies I have ever witnessed ,I still have trouble stomaching the ending. The characters and acting were great and creatures were creepy. This is definitely not for the faint of heart.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Writing This Review....My Jaw Is Still On The Floor From The Ending.,"After a freak and powerful storm, Drayton, his son and their neighbour ride into town to grab some supplies from the local supermarket. Upon arriving at store, it seems almost everyone in town had the same plan. A man bleeding from the nose runs into the store screaming about something in the mist that attacked him and took his friend. The mist rolls in and everyone is trapped inside, scared of leaving because of the creatures the dwell within it.When I saw previews for The Mist, I wasn't too impressed. I thought it was going to be another run of the mill Hollywood horror film that wouldn't be scary, thrilling, gory, tense or have any characters that I could give a damn about. That was even with Darabont behind the camera. After finally seeing it, I sit here wrong on all counts. The Mist is just as thrilling and scary and tense as you want it to be, yet it falls short in many areas, mostly out of frustration on my part.Thomas Jane isn't the best actor around. When you fight fight sharks and John Travolta how far can you really go into a character. Here he gets the chance, being a father who must take care of his scared son, act as a leader in the store and ultimately survive the horror that awaits him outside. Now he does try here, but it comes off as some twilight zone B movie acting. Which is, what I can only assume, is what Darabont wanted. His screaming in the film's conclusion is hurtful, both in terms of acting and in sorrow for the character. His son is given nothing to do but cry and be scared, which you can guess is exactly what a little kid would be in this situation.The tension created is great, the mist rolls in and everyone is stuck inside. We don't know who or what these things are, but we know we are in for some scary things. Then we actually see them and that tension goes down a bit. In scenes in which the creatures interact with the humans, it comes off as fake and cheesy. By itself, it is quite neat, but still not truly horrifying. I felt like they missed a chance with some tension in the audio department. It starts off nice, with an alarm alerting the town of danger, but after that we get things that are few and far between. For instance, while we are in the mist, to build tension we could have heard the creatures crawling around. For people at home it would be great with surround sound. The only instance I remember them doing this was in the pharmacy.I like that we don't know for sure where these things came from, and the sci/fi element is a neat addition. If we were full blown told what these things were and where they came from it would ruin the ambiguity of the whole film. This film stands out for me because of the way it was shot, very surreal, hand held and in the moment. If everything were nicely panned and smooth flowing, it would feel to fake.I have two gripes, which is why the film is rated lower then what this review if praising it for. One, for those who've seen it know where I am going, is the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but you will either like it, or hate it. Which is ironic because I am on the fence with it. I applaud them for throwing a curve ball and showing us something that is so anti-Hollywood, but I felt cheated. You don't invest two plus hours into these characters and then pull off something like that. I called the ending....as a joke. I didn't expect it to be true. It's not really a twist, but what happens is shocking.Second, the characters. I have never hated so many characters in one film. The Jesus freak stands out as one of my most hated characters in cinema history, right up there with Franklin from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I know she was suppose to be hated, but I just couldn't stand her at all. While watching the film, I put myself in some of the characters shoes and I would have never let that woman done half the stuff she did. Also, how do 90% of the people in there fall victim to her babble? I could understand some people following her, but with her reputation and the amount of hate people had for her it was too unrealistic to see so many do her bidding. Whatever happened to people banding together to defeat evil, not turn on each other. Are we as humans so disgusting that when we are thrown into danger we kill one another. That isn't what America would have you believe, especially after the 9/11 attacks. I literally got up out of my seat and cheered at one scene, which finally shut her up.The Mist is a hard film to like all the way through, it pulls you in so many different directions that you feel uneasy about it as a whole. It is skillfully made and 2/3 of it is horror classic. Yet it doesn't fulfill what I wanted it to, which is a shame because I really liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
True Horror,"I'll start out by saying that I'm a Stephen King fan and thus I may have some bias. I've watched many Steven King movies but have never given one a rating this high. Most of his horror movies are in the 4-6 range with classics such as The Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and The Green Mile ranking 8-10 (although two of those aren't technically horror movies). In most modern horror (like the Saw series) there is a greater emphasis on gore than the horror of the human condition and this movie, kudos to the actors, help weave a tale that disgusts you inside and out without the pure reliance on blood spatter (although granted there is a fair amount of that).Thomas Jane (leading male and well known from The Punisher) has a brilliant and emotional portrayal of his character in a mind-blowing situation that we feel intimately associated with thanks to his acting and great directing. Laurie Holden (of X-Files and Silent Hill fame) has a more subdued performance but plays her role well and for any X-Files nut (such as myself) it's fun to see her in another movie. The cast is chock full of well known actors and some unknowns that really see and express the writer and directors vision. It pays off: They succeed in pulling you into a traumatic situation made worse with a mixture of religious zealotry, military conspiracy, and small-town ignorance that explodes in your face wondering if your humanity is worse off facing The Mist or the human condition.There is no spoiler here but I will say this about the ending: It's what makes the movie and makes it so much better than most of the crap put out there in horror land. Yes, yes, getting cut in half and having limbs ripped-off is horrible. However it is the decisions we have to make that concern those we love and respect that can really drive one mad. The ending makes you look at yourself and wonder, if given the same situation, what you would have to do with the information you have available. It makes you think hard about your humanity and your soul and about what is right or wrong in any given situation involving our mortality.I would suggest this movie to anyone that likes horror or science fiction and wants something a little more intense than, say, Army of Darkness (one of my personal favorites for totally different reasons). This movie deals with serious issues we hear about daily. The mist is just a piece of Science Fiction thrown in to bring out the best...and worst in us.Enjoy!!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Something wicked this way wafts,"When it comes to adapting written works of Stephen King to the big screen nobody has enjoyed greater success than Frank Darabont. In 1994 he parlayed King's The Shawshank Redemption into a score of Oscar nominations, and repeated the feat with 1999's The Green Mile. King has even gone so far as to anoint Darabont as the filmmaker he trusts most to faithfully render his work into movies. As such it should come as no surprise that his visioning of King's 1980 novella The Mist is about as faithful as a movie can be to the source material, but in this case that's not always a good thing.For those not familiar with King's story, the movie recounts the events resulting from the aftermath of a severe thunderstorm that hits a small Maine town, which finds itself enveloped shortly thereafter in a dense mist that brings with it a horde of mysterious and deadly creatures. Townsfolk gathered at a local supermarket to stock up on supplies to get them through what at first seems like little more than a prolonged power outage, find themselves barricaded within as the creature concealing fog rolls in. From there the story alternates between the shoppers trying to survive against the various carnivorous entities that have them under siege, and the interpersonal drama that takes hold as a religious zealot in their midst does her utmost to convert the survivors into her own version of Jonestown, and it's on this component of the story that the movie stumbles  though not fatally.If there was one facet of King's story that screamed out for re-work, it was the sub-plot involving the bible thumping Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) which rang hollow in the novella, and doesn't fare any better here. While it's understandable that in a story populated with archetypes there's a need for foils to provide narrative momentum, choosing a religious nut-case as the vehicle is about as unconvincing as having some white haired nutty professor pop up in a lab coat shouting ""it's alive"". Don't worry, that doesn't happen. Fortunately, both Darabont's screenplay, and King's story upon which it is based, have the good sense to forward the plot at a quick enough pace so as not to allow things to become bogged down in a stereotypically bogus anti-religious tirade which, at times, flirts with seriously derailing this movie.Eschewing leading actors and instead opting for character players, The Mist doesn't disappoint when it comes to acting and effects, both of which are of high caliber. Devotees of King's original story may find themselves taken aback by Darabont's decision to pen a decisive ending to the tale, rather than the open-ended conclusion chosen by King, however in an e-mail to the director after reviewing Darabont's ending, King gave it his unequivocal endorsement saying if he had thought it up at the time, he would have used it.It's rare to find a creature-feature that actually delivers when it comes to fear factor, however The Mist is a wonderful throwback to those movies that scared the jeepers out of us as kids, and had us sleeping with the lights on, and a chair propped up against the closet door.Frank Darabont can safely add yet another successful Stephen King adaptation to his list, even though it's safe to say there won't be any Oscar nominations headed his way over this. One can only wonder what their next collaboration will yield.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"One of the best horror films I've seen in a long, long time","On first impressions The Mist doesn't remotely seem like the kind of film anyone should be excited about. The Mist, what? A bit like The Fog, then. Stephen King's The Mist, oh, that makes it even worse. Directed by Frank Darabont, since when did he direct horror films? Okay, so he scripted Nightmare on Elm Street 3 and The Blob, not bad films, but not classics in any sense. Starring Thomas Jane, has anyone seen The Punisher. And, to cap it all, The Mist died a quick death at the US box office. It'll probably go straight to DVD in the UK.The only reason I bought and watched the film was on a recommendation from a friend. He pleaded: ""You have to see this film. You won't believe how good it is."" So I put his judgement to the test.And thank God. This is a great horror film. From the opening scene, Darabont sets a tone that's creepy, sinister and beautifully judged. The script is realistic, the character are believable and the direction... Darabont has almost reinvented himself. The Mist is dark, scary and even funny (intentionally). You care about the characters, the scary scenes are scary, and the whole film is carried off with an efficiency, a lack of pretension and a strong idea of what makes a good, if not great, horror film.And the ending... how dark can you get? I can understand why this didn't do well at the box office. But neither did Shawshank Redemption...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just watch it,"I never review movies, however, me and my friend just saw The Mist and it is by far our favorite horror movie. From the creatures to the atmosphere, this movie is spectacular.

It is very much a must see to anyone who enjoys sci-fi or horror.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watch this instead of the TV show if you haven't already!,"Okay, first of all, I think I would have appreciated this movie a lot more had I not watched the Netflix Original series, The Mist (2017) previously. But if I had watched this with fresh eyes, free from spoilers, I would have definitely been more engrossed, less likely to be frustrated by certain characters in this film. Nonetheless, it has all the elements of a class Stephen King ensemble: a crazy religious fanatic, unexplainable supernatural force in a small town, and a flawed yet somewhat likeable main character. I really want to describe how I feel about the ending, but I do not want to cloud anyone's judgment. It's best to watch this film not knowing much about it at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of my all time favorite horror films,"Frank Darabont returns to the Stephen King well once again and this one is my personal favorite. I have a soft spot for horror stories, I know The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are both much more subtle artistic masterpieces of modern cinema, I watch those films quite often and they tug at my heart strings each and every time. This film, however, is a fantastic character study with a subtly layered screenplay, powerful performances from it's ensemble of movie stars and ""hey it's that guy!"" character actors that also just so happens to include expertly directed gut wrenching sequences of horrorific monsters. It's a truly spooky film unlike most modern horror films. Darabont puts you right there in that supermarket, surrounded by panicked townsfolk and religious nutcases. Not only is the film scary, it's painfully tragic. I don't want to spoil the ending because it's so incredibly powerful so I'll say as little as I can but just don't expect every character that you've grown to love to make it out unscathed. This film has immense rewatchability unlike so many horror films that are meant to shock you momentarily with a jump scare then laugh it off with a quip. This is NOT that kind of film. Yes things get shocking but they're earned shocks and not just a series of the filmmakers shouting BOO!",,Anonymous,Horror
"Could be worse, but not much","Well, i saw this movie last weak in a sneak preview, and was really surprised it had such a good rating (especially because it seemed that everybody in the cinema hated this movie). At first, the idea behind the story isn't that bad, but in my opinion too much inspired by dawn of the dead and half-life. Some people are trapped in a supermarket and threatened by an unknown power from the outside. It could have been a really haunting movie about a group of people in an extreme situation, with some suspense added by the supernatural powers from the outside, and somehow it really tries to be this movie. But there are 2 big reasons, why this doesn't work:1.) Most of the characters act too stereotyped, and after some dialogs you think: ""Did he really say *this*"", and thereafter: ""Yes he had to, he's the classical hillbilly/snob/leader/whatever"". You're getting either annoyed by the stereotypes, or you have to laugh about them. So you can't take the movie seriously anymore, which destroys the whole atmosphere the setting could have constructed.2.) There's an religious fanatic, and you are hating her after she said two sentences. And the director let her do several monologues about several minutes, which are that annoying that they really keep you from enjoying the movie.So i gave this only 2 stars. It was technically well done, but i would strongly recommend to watch dawn of the dead instead of this one (the remake), because the situation is quite similar and the people act much more realistic.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great film with awesome depth of characters,"I won't go into details as I don't want to ruin this film for everyone, but I will highly recommend it! One warning: Do not watch this film expecting a cheesy/entertaining horror, or even a high-quality entertaining slasher as this film is -all- about the characters and how extreme circumstances can bring out the extreme sides of human nature.By the end of the film I was literally on the edge of my seat - cider forgotten - with my hand over my mouth.Masterfully written screenplay (from the original short story by Stephen King) and masterfully directed, anyone who is generally sceptical about adaptations of Stephen King ""horrors"" will be rewarded by watching this, Frank Darabont has done a typically marvelous job (see Shawshank and Green Mile) and well and truly delivered.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Classic Horror in a Post Modern age,"Let me take a breath... Never have I had such a visceral physical reaction to a film... ever. Not even with Elem Klimov's Come and See. In the last fifteen minutes I was nearly physically paralyzed, and then started shaking, realizing how numb my body was... and I am dead serious. Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's novella goes heads above a 50s/60s monster movie homage. This is grade ""A"" chilling, terrifying, unsettling and utterly hopeless cinema in line with the most cynical and depressing classics from the 70s. The Mist itself and the monsters it brings are just the appetizer here. As all good horror should be, this explores the ultimate enemy, ourselves. In short one of the most beautiful, thrilling and terrible times I've had at the movies.To elaborate, it isn't a pitch perfect film... Some of the CGI at the beginning is weak, and there are a few lines that can't escape the genre, but other than that this is a home run in every department - The performances (especially from Toby Jones and Marcia Gay Harden), the ingenious hand held camera, which is never used as a gimmick. The sound design, the lack of an underscore... This lends to the great atmosphere and tension Darabont builds. I'm sure you can guess by now this isn't schmaltzy, sentimental Darabont here; this is an angry, maniacal man that rears his head and shouts, ""Everything is lost!"" and then shoots you in the gut. Any fan of Stephen King, The Twilight Zone or Ray Bradbury, will greedily devour this with a great big grin on their face, then feel very sick but so damn happy and then throw up. Best film of the year yet.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Fog of Disappointment,"Stephen King's novella ""The Mist"" is a chilling tale of terror and human nature. The film adaptation, while promising on paper, ultimately falls short of its potential.The premise is intriguing: a small town is shrouded in an ominous mist, and as the fog thickens, so too does the terror. A group of survivors find themselves trapped in a supermarket, facing an onslaught of monstrous creatures. The early stages of the film build tension effectively, and the CGI, while not groundbreaking, is serviceable.However, the film's promise soon dissipates. The characters are painfully stereotypical, the plot is riddled with absurdities, and the film's portrayal of human behavior is often unrealistic. The characters' dialogue is often cringeworthy, and the plot contrivances are too convenient to be believable.The film's attempt at social commentary is heavy-handed. While the film does effectively illustrate the dangers of charismatic psychopaths and the power of fear, it does so in a way that feels forced and unsubtle. The characters' speeches often feel like they're delivering a sermon rather than engaging in natural conversation.The film does have its moments. The early scenes of chaos and terror are well-executed, and the cinematography is solid. However, these bright spots are overshadowed by the film's many flaws.The film's early stages offered a tantalising promise of a thought-provoking exploration of human resilience and despair. However, its conclusion fell short of this ambition.While I appreciate a film that doesn't shy away from ambiguity, the ending felt contrived and implausible. The sudden, unexplained shift in Drayton's character, coupled with the lack of resistance from his companions, undermined the narrative's credibility.Ultimately, ""The Mist"" falls short of its potential. While the premise is promising, the execution leaves much to be desired. The forgettable characters and contrived plot detract from the film's social commentary. A more authentic conclusion would have allowed the characters to gradually succumb to despair, creating a more resonant and bittersweet ending. Despite its shortcomings, the film's exploration of the perils of losing hope is commendable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"better than expected horror film, not for the under 12 crowd","sometimes you have to catch a film on a big screen, while it is still in movie theaters. ""The Mist"" is clearly in that category. I will be thinking about this scary, moving, smart, and original work for days. I would like to say nice job for the screenplay, and direction, to Frank Durabant. He obviously understands the genre, and how to keep an audience engaged for a few hours, in the dark. There really is not much more to say about ""The Mist."" The cast, lead by Thomas Jane and Marcia Gay Harden, is brilliant. Some of the camera shots are amazing. The look of the supernatural creatures is stunning. The sound design in this film is creepy, and beautiful. The production design, art direction, is great. Every aspect of film making comes together here.To summarize the story-in a small town in Main, VI, a man/David Drayton/and his son, join a big group of people hiding from supernatural creatures in a supermarket. These bug like creatures are brought to the town by a mist, which envelopes the town, and everyone there. I would describe ""The Mist"" as a cross between ""8 Legged Freaks,"" and ""War of the Worlds."" It is original, scary, dark, serious, smart, and moving.I have one large problem, though. The ending, which I will not discuss in detail with my comments, is in my opinion to realistic. We go to the movies to escape reality, not to visit reality. However, please do not wait for this film to appear at the DVD store. You might miss out on the chance to get real close to your date, when you get scared and you want him or her to protect you.In closing, I will be brief. Do not miss this film. Go. I am real happy I had the chance to see ""The Mist"" in a theater. My hope is that you all get that chance as well.",,Anonymous,Horror
Kind of like Tremors meets War of the Worlds.,"The Mist is a thrilling film about a town swept over by, well, mist... and the movie focuses on a supermarket that has roughly a hundred trapped local citizens, along with a few out-of-towners. Everyone is confused about what is going on, but a few people stick out as they try to pressure their ideas onto others. Some are petrified of the mist while others believe it's the work of God trying to warn them.This movie was extremely entertaining. It kept my attention thru the entire 2 hours. First, there's no ""dilly-dallying""; the movie starts off right with a storm. The mist slowly forms over the lake by the horizon once the storm settles. The local run to the supermarket for supplies, but soon upon arrival, the mist swarms to the store and traps them inside. Some try to escape early but are torn away like mice to mice traps. The mist evolves as the movie goes on to these vial creatures that take over everything outside. As days pass, the people become desperate and that's when they try new plans, only leading to more danger.Here are the strong points of this movie. You don't know what is in the mist for a good part of the movie, which lets your imagination take over. In my opinion, that is much scarier. Another thing is that the mood is set very well: police cars speeding across the supermarket, the bull horn, the rolling of the mist towards the supermarket; the director did a remarkable job. The last thing was the psychological warfare amongst the people at the market. A quote from the movie was a reply to someone who asked why drastic measures needed to be taken, and he said ""People are civilized, but when you take their possessions and put them into the dark, they will listen to anyone who says they have an answer"". This movie isn't just about the mist, it is a metaphor for how trouble or error will only be acknowledged when it occurs. We can be civilized today when everything is normal, but once something happens we are lost. We turn to whomever gives advice or a solution because we are so wrapped up in misery that we will try almost anything to get it back. The Mist is a perfect scenario for this occurrence.7 out of 10 from me, you don't want to miss this if you have the opportunity. Even reading the book if you could would be great.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great horror movie and a great deal more!,"Most modern horror movie are simply ((insert expletive here)) these days. They either end up as a PG13 (ooh, scary!) or they end up with the hero winking into the camera and riding off into the sunset.The Mist does none of this.

B-grade cinema called and want their movie back!,"CGI or no CGI. It felt like a mix of b-grade and even c-grade with a small dose of Hollywood. I am a movie buff. I watch a lot of movies. I watch many movies daily, and I like to think I have good taste when it comes to any movie of any genre whether it be a drama or a horror like this one.Now I'll get to the point. I try to keep an open mind even with all movies, even the blatantly bad ones or even the films I don't really personally like, as I can admit when they are well filmed or acted brilliantly regardless of my opinion on the actual plot, like No Country and There Will Be Blood for example. Those movies I hated but I can respect them for their brilliant acting and work of camera and hidden themes etc. The Mist on the other hand, well let's just say I'd have more respect for a 10 dollar hooker with a yeast infection. I can at least say I didn't waste my money on this rubbish movie. But that being said, now there's 2 hours of my life I want back.The acting is so unforgivably bad and a lot of their lines are so incredibly uncredible you can just never get attached to any character as everything everyone in this movie just felt contrived. I mean sure, you wouldn't come across a situation like this in real life, but I refuse to believe that's how people would act if a monster in the mist actually ever did appear in my town. How can citizens be so dumb? So putting the sub par acting aside, I'll forgive Thomas Jane just once for choosing a bad movie because I honestly believe it was mostly the scripts fault here and not so much the actors. I'm not even going to go into how bad the CGI is because I don't want to get attacked by people who will try to tell me you don't need good cgi to enjoy a movie. I am aware of this fact, but I still have to say that in today's world of technology how is it possible for a Hollywood blockbuster to have such incredibly lame CGI? Oh and the ending of this movie just made me want to punch my friend in the face for making me sit through the whole thing.What more is there to say really? Except to wonder over how the rating for this weak movie obtained a score over 7 on IMDb when it should be less than 5. I have a feeling it has to do with the fact Stephen King lent his name to this abomination and come on, we all know a Steven King fan is not a reputable source as a movie critic. So unfortunately there are an abundance of King fans out there and who will rate anything he has done highly just because they can.Comparing to the last monster movie I'd seen this year, Cloverfield was rubbish but even that had more cinematic qualities going for it than this waste of a motion picture. In the end I recommend seeing the Fog, 1980 John Carpenter classic. Now that is what a horror movie is supposed to do. Scare you, not make you laugh and cry for the wrong reasons. In The Mist I was laughing at the monster moments and crying during most of the dialog. It really was that bad and right up there with the Fog remake from 2005 only somehow less scary.B-grade movie enthusiasts however will probably think this is somehow the greatest movie they have ever seen in their whole lives.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Was pretty good until the ending,"Stephen King's work has been growing on me, I wasn't crazy about it before but after seeing and reading more of his books and the film/TV series adapted from them I do respect his style, he has a unique and I think unparallelled way of describing fear, and find his ideas intriguing. In all honesty, The Mist is not one of the best film adaptations. The book was very good, if not great, but the film was just decent. It looks great with great photography and effects, the story is intriguing and starts off very well, the acting especially from Marcia Gay Holden is good as is the direction, there is a strong atmosphere and the soundtrack and sound further adds to it. I was almost though willing to forgive the sometimes pedestrian pacing and clunky dialogue, until the ending let the film down completely. The ending is a slap in the face not only for fans of the book or King but also for those like me saw a film with so much promise, and its tone feels like a completely different movie. In conclusion, was pretty good, if only it weren't for that ending. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Do you have any hope at all in humanity?,"I haven't read any of Stephen King's books or stories, but I have learned two things from his movies. He possesses phenomenal insight into the human mind, and he is a freak. ""The Mist"" proves both points fully with a simple story: a mist engulfs a small New England town, and a few dozen of its denizens are isolated in a grocery store, forced to deal with enemies both outside and inside the store, both strange and familiar.The best and brilliant parts of ""The Mist"" are the explorations into the psyche of the various trapped townsfolk. If someone's character is truly exposed when under pressure, then the extreme circumstances of this movie strip souls down to their essences, with frightening results. There are heroes and villains, leaders and followers, stalwarts and cowards. In previous uses of King's source material, writer/director Frank Darabont burrowed into the heart of hope in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and delved into faith and the supernatural with ""The Green Mile"". Both movies placed normal people into extreme circumstances, and did so exceptionally well. In that general thematic regard, Mist is similar to those two excellent films. More specifically though, it varies greatly, stressing the negative aspects of humanity rather than positive traits. Along the way, plenty of complex issues arise, and they are most frequently addressed with a rough, dull blade that gashes boldly through the moral fiber of civilization. The results are rarely pretty, but always compelling.Lest you think this is a philosophical art house movie, let it be known that as a horror flick, independent of any deeper meaning, ""Mist"" consistently entertains, with a handful of superb knuckle-whitening scenes enhanced by an excellent cast. But a dark decision in the final act makes it impossible for even the most casual moviegoer to completely ignore the thick subtext of King and Darabont.What prevents ""The Mist"" from being a great movie is the frayed nature of that subtext. While the story is rife with interesting points, the commentary fails to coagulate into a comprehensible bigger picture. In a sense though, the fractured themes better befit such a moody picture, one that strikes its audience at many levels, leaving the mind spinning in a mist of its own.Bottom Line: 7 of 10 for a movie far smarter and deeper than the glut of recent horror releases.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another big success for Stephen King and Frank Darabont!,"Films based on the writing of Stephen King have a habit of not translating to the screen very well; although director Frank Darabont made what is often considered the best of the Stephen King films in The Shawshank Redemption - and now with The Mist he's directed what is surely one of the major contenders for the title of best horror film to be based on a Stephen King story! When I first heard the plot description, I was expecting the film to be a cross between John Carpenter's The Fog and modern horror disappointment Feast; and while it does have elements of both those movies, it is thankfully much better than both. The film starts with a violent storm that leaves the Drayton family home in tatters. David Drayton sets off to the local store along with his son and a neighbour; but the town is soon plummeted into trouble when it is surrounded by a malicious mist. It soon transpires that there are otherworldly creatures within the mist and the townsfolk in the local store find themselves battling against the creatures as well as themselves...The film takes on a real classic style horror feel and never tries to be exceedingly clever or overly gory and that is one of its main strengths. Frank Darabont puts his focus mainly on the tension between the characters and the atmosphere and this benefits the film as there's always enough to keep things interesting - and that is particularly impressive when you consider the thin plot and the fact that it's over two hours long. Thomas Jane takes the lead role and gives a great performance which is nicely pitched between family man and action hero. The rest of the ensemble perform well alongside the lead actor, with Marcia Gay Harden as a fanatical Christian and Toby Jones as the quiet shopkeeper stand out most. The special effects are used sparingly but are very well done and show some great imagination. The creatures that come out of the mist are varied and interesting. There is a lot of talk about the ending of this film and I have to say I'm not really surprised; you'll either love it or hate but personally I found it to be a refreshing end to a commercial modern horror film. Overall, The Mist is an excellent horror film and can be considered a must see for anyone who is a fan of the genre!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Plastic bugs, CGI tentacles, and a crowd of people with no common sense whatsoever.","I've only written a couple of reviews on IMDb over the past few years, but I can't let this movie slide. I feel an obligation to warn people who appreciate good horror films to not see this movie.First of all, most of the scenes would not have worked if the characters involved had had any common sense whatsoever. For instance, they constantly walk or stand still when they should be running. This happens over and over. I lost track of how many times I yelled, ""get out of there, you idiot!"" or ""why are you just standing there!?"" at the TV. I don't remember the last time a movie frustrated me so badly. I guarantee this movie will tick you off about every ten minutes throughout the long, aggravating 2 hours and 5 minutes.And what will tick you off the most is the ending. The last few minutes take a disturbing and shocking turn for the sole purpose of being shocking and disturbing, completely disregarding what any normal people with any common sense would actually do. It's nothing but shock value and it will frustrate you to no end. It pretty much destroys what little chance this movie had at being at least a B rated horror flick and instead turns it into a depressing, aggravating waste of time.I'm a Stephen King fan and I've read the original ""The Mist"". It's been a while, but I remember that it was creepy and that I liked it. However, the movie adaptation is a tremendous let down.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
There is something in the mist...,"This is actually one of the better Stephen King novella adaptations to make it to the screen. And for me it is because ""The Mist"" is so heavily influenced by the works of H.P. Lovecraft to the very core.What works out so well in ""The Mist"" is the build up of suspense that director Frank Darabont managed to establish and the slowly unveiling of what is going on and what is lurking in the mysterious mist that engulf the town.Granted I haven't read the book, so I have no idea how close Frank Darabont stayed to the original work. But whether or not he stayed true to the book or strayed from the it, it hardly matters, as this is an entertaining movie.Without going too much into details about the storyline, then ""The Mist"" is about a group of people getting trapped in a supermarket as a mist swallows up the town, and unseen horrors are lurking in the mist, killing anyone who ventures into the haze.The characters in the movie were quite good, well-detailed and carved out with personalities and differences. And it is the combination of this good character gallery and the talents portraying the characters that make for a memorable movie experience. Thomas Jane carried the movie quite well, but most impressive was Marcia Gay Harden in her role. Laurie Holden, Andre Braugher, Toby Jones, Jeffrey DeMunn and Frances Sternhagen also really added a lot to the movie.""The Mist"" is not the type of horror movie that will leave you scared senseless, nor is it one that will have you jumping out of the chair every so often. No, this is the type of horror movie that runs on suspense and build-up.The effects in the movie were quite good and added a good amount of believability to the movie. The creature designs were quite good and very realistic, well in the scenes that they appeared to be real. However, the tentacles that assaulted the supermarket, well they could have been re-touched, because they were quite poor compared to the rest of the CGI throughout the movie.All in all then ""The Mist"" is a good horror movie that has a good story, good characters, good action, good effects and a good hold on the audience. The ending to the movie, despite being corny, was a nice touch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Much better than I expected.,"I was completely surprised by how good this film was. Not only did the trailer they've been pushing for months seem corny, I was hesitant to watch more CGI monsters and crazy fundamentalist Christians...What I found instead was a tightly crafted nightmare about the human condition and society, rather than the (cheesy) CGI beasts. Not only that, but the reason for the ""mist"" that arrives is a daring attempt at Lovecraftian themes which mainstream films NEVER deal with seriously.I suppose it can be argued that because I went in with low expectations, I am more likely to give the film a higher rating than it ""deserves."" But after careful consideration I firmly believe this film worked hard for its ""7 star"" rating, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a crafty thriller with more under the surface than the standard Hollywood fare.Heck, any film that can take a boring Steven King story and make it 2+ hours of thrills is aces in my book!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the most disturbing endings ever.,"A chilling tale that starts out as a psychological horror thriller and ends on a philosophical tone. Frank Darabont adapts another Stephen King story and further proves his skill in translating the great master's visions to the screen. The premise may seem cliché to some but don't worry, this isn't one of those hacks that just make you go on counting how many people are still left. This film raises some questions that will make you think and it is often too realistic on a very political note. It is similar to Cloverfield in the way that nobody is really aware of what's happening. It's like you are also one with the people and trapped in the thick white fog. It is successful in delivering very unsettling scenes and sometimes it's not even because of the creatures in the mist. This probably has one of the most disturbing endings in film ever. Be warned, if you are touchy about religion issues, you may want to skip this. Overall, highly recommended.

A Very Dark and Claustrophobic Movie,"After a strong storm in the Maine area, the local artist Dave Drayton (Thomas Jane) drives from his house nearby the lake to the supermarket with his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) and his arrogant neighbor, the lawyer Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), to get supplies. Along their way, they see a heavy mist and later, military convoys, police and firefighter trucks, ambulances heading toward it. While in the supermarket, a frantic bleeding local arrives crying that there is something alive in the mist and the manager closes the entrance door while the place is encased by the mist. When David, another client and two employees go to the back of the store to start the generator, they open the back-door and the cashier Norm (Chris Owen) is hold and dragged by fierce tentacles. David and the two survivors succeed to close the loading door, and when they tell the people what happened, Brent does not trust on his words and believes it is a prank and the God-fearing woman Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) preaches the Apocalypse and that she is the vessel of Lord on Earth. Sooner the group discovers that they are under siege of blood thirsty creatures from another dimension that have reached our planet through a window open by a failed military research. Further, the crazy Mrs. Carmody has many followers and is becoming dangerous and dangerous in her speeches. Without alternative, a small group leaded by David decides to take the chance to escape from the supermarket and reach his car, hoping to get out of the mist.""The Mist"" is a very dark and claustrophobic movie, and I believe that together with ""Pet Sematary"", they are the darkest versions of Stephen King novels on the screen. I startled with the unexpected hopeless decision in the disturbing conclusion, unusual in American movies, specially considering that the people in David's truck have fought along the whole story to survive. The performance of Marcia Gay Harden is awesome in the role of an insane woman that believes is in contact with God. The special effects are also great, and I really recommend this movie for viewers that accept stories without happy end.

The Ending,"Frank Darabont directed this controversial and compelling film adaptation of the Stephen King story that stars Thomas Jane as David Drayton, who notices a strange mist hovering over a lake near his home. Later on in a grocery store, the mist has spread, and after an earthquake, it becomes obvious that something is alive in the mist, perhaps many things, that are also merciless and murderous, and the resultant fear of the isolated shoppers leads to a paranoid mania involving the religious Mrs. Carmody(played by Marcia Gay Harden) prompting those not under her spell to make a daring break for it, but tragedy awaits... A film made famous by that ending, which is just a punch in the gut. This film fully explores the idea of horror, and however you choose to interpret the meaning of the ending, it will not be easily forgotten. Superb F/X and acting, with a chilling music score and a real sense of awe in the monsters(especially near the end).A film to be experienced more than enjoyed...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It paints I believe very accurately the state of mind of humanity, at least in this side of the world and agree with the way the characters react when confronted with a chaotic, scary and uncertain situation, the way extremist religious people will react is not far from reality, in my opinion as portrayed in this movie. Wonderful sad and raw movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the novella but that doesn't matter,"First, to get a few of my gripes out the way. Firstly, I wish there could be more build up. In the book we get a lot more conversation between Drayton and his wife which makes him a more developed character. Also, we get one of my favourite scenes: the live electric wires. The importance this has to the later themes of danger and risk would have worked really well in a movie. Finally, an extended build-up would give us the time to really locate the movie. That would have made the conflict between locals and out-of-towners more concrete; something that was really glossed in the film. Secondly, I feel Norton was miscast. He just isn't dislikable. It's not like Darabont was concerned about the rating: Stephen King's dialogue really makes Norton dislikable; whereas in the film, he is one of the weakest characters. Finally, sometimes the film felt like it was moving from set-piece to set-piece. Some slower, more sinister scenes would have brought out the menace of the novella. However, with the exception of a few pointless scenes, such as the romance, this is a pretty darn good horror. When I first read the novella, my thought was that this would be really hard to pull off as a movie: how do you not make the monsters not become farcical by about half-way through? The obvious answer, and the answer Darabont takes, is to focus on the human conflict going on. Personally, I think there was still too much focus on the monsters sometimes, but hey, a director's gotta satisfy the immature 15 year olds on the market. This is a pretty scary ride, in a 'Stephen King movie' way (Carrie, Green Mile etc - looking at the scary side of the human psyche). The emotional intensity is carried through by great camera work.However, at the end of the day, most of the success of this movie is down to Stephen King's original vision. The new ending is as good as the old. But beyond that, Darabont hasn't really added anything.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Darabont and King reunited once again.,"""You don't have much faith in humanity, do you?""Frank Darabont's third adaptation of a Stephen King novel proves without a doubt that he is the best director at bringing the writer's words to film. The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile were both fantastic films, although not the typical horror novels you'd expect from King. The Mist however is much closer to the horror genre we'd expect from him, and Darabont manages to successfully adapt his work for the third time. Not that there haven't been other successful King adaptations from other director's such as Kubrick's direction in The Shining, Reiner in Misery and Stand By Me, and De Palma in Carrie, but most of the time the adaptations don't seem to work as well. But when it comes to Frank Darabont he has always managed to impress us with the way he brings those novels to the big screen. I honestly have no idea why I never got around to watching this film considering how much I loved Darabont's previous work, but I think much of it had to do with my confusion over the 2005 film The Fog. The name of that film was translated in Spanish as ""The Niebla"" which was the same name they gave The Mist so I thought I had seen this film before and hated it. When I finally realized these were two separate films I decided to watch it and what a pleasant experience it was. The Mist is a fantastic homage to 50 and 60's monster horror films, but at the same time Darabont seems to be reminding us that no matter how dangerous and ugly these things might be, the true enemy is our own humanity. No matter how much fun the ride was, the ending is what will really stick with you. You will love it and hate it at the same time.David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is an artist who is working on his latest Hollywood poster painting from his comfortable home in Maine. He is unexpectedly interrupted by a storm and quickly seeks refugee in the basement with his wife and five year-old son, Billy (Nathan Gamble). The next morning they see the damage the fallen trees have left on their home and along with his son and their neighbor Brent (Andre Braugher) they head to the market to buy supplies. There is a heavy mist that seems to be approaching and while they are on their way to the market several firetrucks and army vehicles seem to be heading towards the opposite direction. Once they arrive at the supermarket the mist has already caught up to them and a few minutes later an old man named Dan (Jeffrey DeMunn) runs in half scared to death claiming that there is something in the mist taking people. There are more than 50 people in the market who begin to panic and they decide to close the doors and wait inside for help. David decides to check the generator along with some of the men there including a store employee named Ollie (Toby Jones) and a client named Jim (William Sadler) but what they experience leaves them completely horrified. Some sort of gigantic creature's tentacles begin to slide under the loading dock door and the men immediately have to shut it. There is no doubt in their minds now that there is definitely something out of this world in the mist. According to Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), the town's religious fanatic, they are all experiencing God's wrath for their sinful nature. At first no one pays attention to her, but as the strange creatures begin to creep into the store, she begins to have more followers. David will not only have to look out for what is terrorizing them from the outside, but worry about the growing hate that Mrs. Carmody is sowing in everyone's hearts.In a way, The Mist is sort of The Walking Dead reunion since there are three actors from that series (Laurie Holden, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Melissa McBride) in this film. It comes as no surprise since Darabont is one of the producers and directors of that series as well and DeMunn has always worked with him in his other King adaptations. If you are a fan of that series, you will definitely want to check this film out because there could be a clue as to how that series might end. Darabont always has a surprise in store and he is deeply influenced by his good friend Stephen King so you know you can't expect a clichéd finale. As much as I enjoyed this film I did feel that the two hour length was a bit tiresome at some points. The film could've been cut a good 20 minutes and the experience could've been much better. The Marcia Gay Harden character also got on my nerves and I think they gave her too much screen time. The religious fanatic element was an important plot point but Darabont emphasized it a bit too much. The Mist is still a lot of fun and it delivers several suspenseful moments.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Devine retribution or just a stupid accident?  Also, beware of the final five minutes.","Let's discuss the ending of this movie. Without revealing the details of the ending, this movie's ending is, to put it politely, remarkable. Most of this movie is like a train going full speed ahead, destination unknown. The audience is going for a ride and things are happening really fast and everything is hectic. Then the train suddenly arrives at its destination, and there's nothing, complete zero. That's the way this movie ends. Why this movie's creative team chose to do this is for them to explain, but most good movies have memorable endings that fit logically into the overall story, but here, in the climactic final moments of the movie, the part of the movie that's supposed to make the entire movie worth watching, the story takes a sudden detour that is so contrived, so utterly and obviously inconsistent with the rest of the story and so inexplicably predictable that it causes one to reasonably ask: why? This movie violates the first and second laws of movie-making: 1. Never make a good movie with a bad ending. 2. A bad movie may have a good ending, but a good movie never has a bad ending.Now regarding the element of religion in the story, this is one of the movie's strong points. The story offers a strong and compelling portrayal of how religious teachings can be used to whip up hatred, fear and promote violence. Here religion is used as means of terrorizing people, sowing the seeds of discord and inflicting mental anguish. It's much easier now to understand how, for instance, during the Middle Ages, when seemingly inexplicable disasters occurred, like the plague that killed millions, people, suffering and groping for answers, could start looking around for someone to blame, using religion to justify the most horrendous acts. And this kind of stuff still goes on today.This is one of the better sci-fi movies, no question about it. Except for the ending, which is weak, the movie presents a powerful story that raises questions. Is the mist and what it contains an act of God? An act of man? Or a combination of both? Is it an experiment? An accident? Or what? But most compelling and entertaining was not the special effects or the unique story, but the performance of Marcia Gay Harden. Ms. Harden is the star of this movie. Her powerful and dominating performance transforms this movie into a cinematic masterpiece, a word which is not used lightly here. I expected another idiotic Hollywood scare 'em movie. It's tempting to reveal details of the story, but suffice it to say that after you watch this movie you'll never take insects for granted and whenever you see the fog, you may wonder: what's it hiding?Some other comments. Amazingly, unlike most Hollywood movies, especially of the sci-fi genre, this movie offers a story that actually has substance. What happens when people find themselves in extreme life-threatening situations that overtake them without any warning? This movie offers a stark portrayal of how religion can be used not as a source of comfort and support but as a tool of terror. When bad things happen to be people, is this divine retribution? Unbelievable as this may seem, this movie actually explores this subject, which for Hollywood movie is absolutely astounding. Were the deaths of millions of people let's say for instance in World War Two a man-made catastrophe or was it punishment inflicted on humanity by some higher power for past transgressions?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Great story, Well written","To be honest I am not a huge Steven King fan, i did not see this movie because it was written by King, but thought it would be an interesting story. I was proved right.Let me start by saying that the CGI in this movie were not the best, and at times looked mediocre, but that is not everything after all. The plot was brilliant in this movie, and the screen writing adaption of King's novel was also evidently well done. The character development was good which really kept you on the edge of the seat throughout the movie. I again must say that this is one of those movies that will stay in your mind long after the film has finished. The build up to the end is ever so brilliant and what actually happens and at end will leave you shocked and not knowing how to feel or think.Very well told story, and quite a well made movie.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great movie - you really need to watch this,"This is just an excellent movie. The acting is fantastic, the storyline is amazing. Also after living in Maine for many years...the believability of everything such as the stores and props, right on the money. Finally fun to see something totally blindside you instead of the same storyline over and over that we typically see. Be prepared though. It is one of those movies that is so intense it will stress you out - but it really is worth it.The entire movie - wow - that is all I am going to say. But if you watch this flick, you will be discussing it for a while.Kick back on the couch and prepare to be blown away.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Dread is the name of the game here,"A lot of people didn't seem to like this when it was released and it wasn't a big hit and perhaps one of the most horrific endings ever had something to do with that, but I think this is one of the best film versions of Stephen King's writings. It is truly frightening. Some of the characters are annoying, but that's the way they were written. Thomas Jane makes a excellent hero and I liked a few of the performances here. Not art, but an exciting, claustrophobic movie. But that ending is something not to behold.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Darabont- King strike gold yet again,"Frank Darabont has created a horror film that will send shivers down your spine. This is what great horror ought to be- a film riveting with allegory and yet containing a visceral sense of terror all throughout the run time. Darabont deserves the tag of being an underrated filmmaker with a penchant for Stephen King's works, and The Mist is one of the finest of his works. The story concerns a small town that gets engulfed in a strange mist of some kind. In the mist are strange creatures that bite. The town gets trapped inside a mall as the creatures wreak havoc. The horror is straightforward, and it is a credit to Darabont's talent that we are totally engrossed in what is happening to the characters trapped in their own city. Some scenes are awe inspiring and I won't say anything else. If you enjoy horror films, if you enjoy well made horror films with allegorical themes- you should not miss The Mist. This is great horror filmmaking. This is great cinema.",,Anonymous,Horror
Very good adaptation.,"I have just finished the short story so it was fresh in my mind when I watched this film tonight. I must say, I was not disappointed. The short story, if you have not read it, is very good. I have no patience for King's long winded work but his short story collections are brilliant. Check out 'Nightshift' to see what I mean.The adaptation of 'The Mist' to the big screen does alter things in several ways... but nothing is the worse for it. There is some exposition of the origins of the Mist in the film whereas there isn't anything spelled out in black and white in the book. This is fair enough, as people more often or not complain if they aren't given enough background in a film. I for one don't mind being left in the dark with certain elements of a story if the meat of it is really good. That's just me though.But.... what is this thing that we are talking about anyway? It's a horror/thriller and in that the film succeeds and then some. Frank Darabont has done his job and done it well. Him being a big fan of King's work has no doubt helped some as the crucial parts of the story (certain lines and imagery) are all included and he brings the story to the screen in a very skillful and loving way. Mrs. Carmody is presented as an attractive, middle-aged women here - not like the stained tooth crone she is in the story. But she's still freaky and you will be rooting for her demise. The much hyped ending is very good. Probably the best thing that the director brings to the table. The creatures are cool. The scene in the pharmacy had me thinking of the part in 'Aliens' where the marines first stumble into the nest. Great stuff. And bravo for the lack of a bombastic soundtrack - nothing ruins the mood more than an intrusive score. The occasional sub bass rumblings and minimalist low organ notes say more than any pompous score ever would.Check this film out - you won't be disappointed, especially if you dug 'Cloverfield'.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

One Of The Best Horror Films Ever Made. Frank Darabont and Stephen King at their best.,"The Mist is one of the best Horror films ever made that works as a Horror Film,Monster Movie,and Character drama. Terrifying,bleak,and filled with hopelessness,The Mist is a Horror classic and one of the best Stephen King adaptations with a stunning ending you will never forget.Based on Stephen King's novella,The Mist tells the story about people in a small Maine town who are trapped in a supermarket when a huge mist surrounds the market and town unleashing deadly creatures from the mist that attack and kill people. Now the people in the supermarket have to figure out how to survive the mist and creatures and stay alive.One of the many things I love about The Mist is that not only is it a monster movie,it's a great commentary on people and society when things fall apart. The film is filled with a sense of dread and darkness that you don't see in many Horror films these days because most Horror films that come out these days are glossy and pretty. The Mist is not glossy or pretty,it's an ugly nightmarish film that makes you feel like you're in the film and with the characters good or bad. Claustrophobia is always an important element in a Horror film and the claustrophobic setting inside the supermarket is put to great use in this film. When the people are the supermarket in the beginning of the film,you feel safe and secure,but when The Mist and creatures arrive,you feel the walls are closing in on the characters and that they're trapped. As a you're watching the movie,you feel like the characters are isolated from the world and that The Mist had taken over making the viewers feel like they're in a apocalypse of doom,death and darkness. Probably the most frightening thing about The Mist is that not only the creatures that come out of the mist but the humans inside the market. When the mist comes it not only becomes a great horror film or monster film,but a great character drama,focusing on how the characters react to the situation and how they deal with it and this is one of the things that sets The Mist apart from other modern Horror films. Instead of fighting the monsters and helping each other out,most of the people start to turn on each other and become divided into groups becoming monsters themselves attacking and killing each other when ever they can. The Mist and Frank Darabont gives us a terrifying study of human nature and that human beings will be responsible for their own self destruction and the way the human characters act in the film is haunting,disturbing and scary. I have a feeling the late,great Rod Serling would've loved The Mist because the film reminds me of The Twilight Zone especially classic Twilight Zone episodes The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street and The Shelter. At 126 minutes,The Mist moves at a fast and rapid fire pace and never slows down until the very end. The film's screenplay by Frank Darabount is great and stays true to Stephen King's novella with scenes and dialog that are from the book with a few differences and a little minor alterations. The ending of the film is one of the boldest, greatest,jaw dropping and shocking endings in movie history. How Frank Darabont convinced the movie's studio to o.k the ending is stunning to me and it's one the reasons The Mist is a classic. I won't tell you how it ends but I'll you this:the ending in this film is not for people who love happy and uplifting endings,the ending is dark,tragic and very unforgettable. Not since John Carpenter's The Thing and George Romero's Night of the Living Dead has a Horror film ending been so bleak and hopeless. No matter how many times I've watched The Mist the ending still gets to me.The cast does a great job in their roles. Thomas Jane is excellent as David Drayton the man who tries to take charge when things are falling apart. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant as religious zealot Mrs Carmody,not only one of the best villains in a Stephen King film or book,but in my opinion one of the best villains in film history. Harden's performance is absolutely bone chilling and disturbing and Oscar worthy. A brilliant performance. Laurie Holden does a great job as Amanda,a woman who helps out and sides with David. Andre Braughter is fantastic as Brent,a lawyer who is skeptical about the events and doesn't believe the things that are happening. Toby Jones is wonderful as Ollie a store clerk who becomes a man of Action. Darabont regulars William Sadler(Jim)and Jeffrey DeMunn(Dan)are great as always in their roles. Frances Sternhagen(Mrs Reppler),Nathan Gamble(Billy Drayton),Alexa Davalos(Sally),Chris Owen(Norm),Sam Witwer(Private Jessep),Robert Treveiler(Bud)and David Jensen(Myron) do fine jobs in their roles as well. If you're a fan of the TV show The Walking Dead you will see a few of the actors(Laurie Holden,Jeffery DeMunn,Melissa McBride) who are on the show.Frank Darabont's direction is fantastic bringing a gritty and dark tone to the film. In the other Stephen King films The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile Darabont's direction and lighting were bright,clean and straight forward,but in The Mist the direction and lighting are chaotic and dark and intense with Darabont using hand-held photography and a semi-documentary feel to the film almost feels like an independent movie. Great direction from Darabont.Mark Isham's score while not used much is effective fits with the film's dark tone. Dead Can Dance's song The Host Of Seraphim is haunting and eerie and blends wonderfully with the films tragic and sad ending. It's a song that will stay with you.In final word,The Mist is a Horror classic that will stay with you after watching it and if you love Horror,Frank Darabont,or Stephen King see this film. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really could have been better,"It tried to be close to the sorce material. It just didn't hit the mark. I wish that it was set in the 1970s like the sorce material (someone please do that in an adaptation of The Mist)? It just could have been so much better. I'm a snob when it comes to Stephen King screen adaptations. The cast was good. The actors overall were amazing with what they had in the subpar writing. They got me emotionally invested in some of the characters. The visual effects we're horrid cgi. Practical effects please. I get it though, the year that it came out CGI was everything. It is strange to me however that CGI quality varies so wildly at the turn of the century. There were certain additions to the source material that were completely unnecessary. But overall........ 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The most tragic horror movie you will ever see -,"This movie delivers a longer lasting terror than is expected from it after watching the trailers. Apart from the conventional graphical demons, the movie builds over a wonderful story with a well chosen cast. The original script is based on the novel by Stephen King, but has been modified by the director/writer Frank Darabont. A young artist David Drayton(Thomas Jane) and his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) are trapped in a supermarket with a group of other terrified people, when an alien/demon attack unleashes on the city. But the movie catches attention when this fear forces these people to turn against each other. This movie also delivers a comment on human nature, human relationships and their impact on the decisions they make. Even though the basic idea of a monster attack on city is clichéd, but the movie wraps it with some very creative writing, and thrilling story telling. I would rate the movie as a 'Good Watch'.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Flawed but still fascinating,"I was worried that The Mist would be a lackluster film for me since I was aware how it ended. Knowing where the movie would end up is the kind of thing that could easily sour an experience like this one. However, there were enough surprises along the way that I was still fully engaged by The Mist. I loved how this movie explored the many ways that people deal with a life-threatening situation. It was fascinating to see the different coping mechanisms that people employed to get through what was happening, and how the acceptable norms of society could break down in a matter of hours. Whether this is how things would really play out or not, it's an interesting theoretical look at a horrifying end of the world scenario. There's certainly more to this movie than you'd expect if you just read the general premise. I was fully engaged and aside from knowing how it would end, I didn't know what to expect along the way.All that being said, The Mist is full of flaws. First and foremost is the CGI. This is something I can live with because I was invested in the story, but the enemy would feel a bit more ominous if they didn't seem so artificial. I was also a bit bothered by the level of gore in the movie. This seemed excessive, but it all fit with the story, so this complaint is more a personal preference. I think the other thing that didn't work all that great for me was the fact that our protagonist had a son. It feels like this could have been handled better with his wife in that position, so he wasn't constantly abandoning his son with strangers simply because he needs to be the one in the heart of all the action to make the movie work. My only other complaint had to do with the times when people acted foolish or illogically for no good reason. Still, even with all these nitpicks, The Mist was an effective film that worked for me better than I expected.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I love it!,"The mist has covered the town, and this has caused the appearance of monstrous creatures. The movie presents the disintegration of society when essential services such as communication, government, and machines are absent.People begin to act based on their fears and disregard the rules of law and order. The result is an atmosphere of mob mentality. The first things that are lost in such situations are trust, simple reasoning, and fundamental human morality. Despite our belief that we are intellectually evolved and enlightened, we quickly return to our primal nature when fear, disorder, and panic take over. The film portrays the fact that in challenging situations, people can do worse things to each other than any creature that Stephen King could ever imagine.This movie is full of blood, gore, and horror. Some of the scenes are intense and had me gripping. One scene, in particular, can be devastating for many viewers. Overall, this movie is a must-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Point Of A Horror Film Is To HORRIFY You And This Delivers,"{No Spoilers}
Rating 9/10
Positive Points: Since everyone loves bringing up the ending all the time, I'll discuss that first. The ending is depressing and makes you challenge your morality and decision making. During the entire movie, you completely agree with the protagonist. He makes every rational move, given his situation. You always feel like you would do what he does, which ultimately comes to bite you in the ass in the ending. The acting is a perfect mix of 50's camp and modern realism. The film is basically what 50's horror was trying to be and it's executed perfectly. The film has a cool threat and the themes and morals are engaging, thought provoking, and challenging. The Christian lady is annoying as hell, but she's SUPPOSED to be annoying. You're supposed to hate her. I'm sick of people giving this movie bad reviews because it's making them feel the emotions it's trying to make them feel. The Christian lady is supposed to annoy you and the ending is supposed to depress you.
Negative Points: The effects aren't that good, even for the time, but they're serviceable for the story. The movie isn't about the effects however, it's more about the story so this is a minor complaint.
Final Verdict: Overall, an amazing and impactful film that isn't afraid to take risks and challenge its audience.

I've got plenty of Peas,"Greetings again from the darkness. With the greatness of ""Shawshank Redemption"" on his resume, writer/director Frank Darabont's name will forever be associated with film greatness. Hooking up again with a Stephen King (""The Green Mile"") story, Darabont takes aim at the monster/creature/sci-fi films of the 50's and 60's (think ""The Blob"" not ""The Fog""). While this one has significant human nature editorializing, the actual frights are few and far between because mostly what we see are some stupid looking bugs that can be killed with a mop handle.The hero is Thomas Jane (""The Punisher"") and a couple of his nemesis are played here by Andre Braugher (""Homicide"") and a scene-chewing Marcia Gay Harden as the religious fanatic, who seizes her moment on the mountain top. Also joining in the food store fun is Laurie Holden, who spends most of the film taking care of Jane's wimpy son, William Sadler as a total buffoon, and Alexa Davalos (very good in ""Feast of Love"") who demonstrates what the bugs are capable of.The two best performances are from Toby Jones (""Infamous"") as the sharp tongued, sharp-shooting grocery clerk and the great Frances Sternhagen, whose character could make a fine little film unto herself. Of course, this film is not about the acting ... it is about the frightening monsters in the mist. Exploring the fear of the unknown, the effects of trauma and stress and expediency at which the religious fanatics seize on weakness. And yes, this is 2007, so there is a story line that bashes the military. I believe a similar type story line exists in 83% of films released this year.While not the best work from King or Darabont, it is a satisfactory monster movie that pretends to look deeper, but is actually pretty shallow.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Oh, come on, people","This flick is BAD, really BAD. While it may break even in initial release (although, including marketing dollars, I doubt it), this film is nothing less than a major disappointment.First of all, Shreveport, Louisiana, does not look like Maine.

The opening scene on the lake is a film-killer - horrible location. Check out that BUSY highway bridge in the background.

An overlong film unreflective of the author's or director's talents,"""The Mist,"" is an adaption of a Stephen King story by a director now famed for these adaptations. Unlike, Shawshank or Green Mile, Mist is a supernatural horror film. One may expect that taking on a theme more typical to King would lead to a highly entertaining film. Unfortunately, the result is overlong and never escapes a ""b"" movie feel.Clocking in at two hours, Mist lavishes time on creating a moody and oppressive atmosphere of unknown horrors. Firmly situated in the creepy context are the typical cast of King stock characters. The film focuses on the interactions of these characters more so than on the monsters or ominous fog. The result is a drawn out and rather predictable exploration of how a highly caricatured ""humanity"" deals with an abnormal situation. The assumption seems to be that by giving developed exposition to stock characters, a sense of realism and an important message can be established. The problem is that stock characters are by definition shallow. By creating easily identifiable character types, the audience is relieved of the need to analyze character action. For example, the ignorant country bumpkin will always respond in a bigoted and violent way. Developing such a bumpkin does nothing to the expectation that said character will ultimately respond as expected. In fact, lavishing time on hollow stock types eventually highlights just how poorly developed these characters are. The effect is a film that is populated by annoying people doing highly predictable things.In fairness, the film does end with a twist. Unfortunately, some of the dramatic weight of the twist is removed because of the characters. Having been methodically ushered down the garden path, the final actions are somewhat inevitable, expected, and emotionally bland.As a whole, Mist is a technically accomplished movie. The editing, camera work, stylization and direction are all highly competent. The problems arise with the writing and the story itself. Both writing and story rely so heavily on stock characterization that the film comes off as a modern take on a 1950's horror ""b"" film. All attempts to create a more realistic sense of foreboding are overshadowed by shallow characters puttering about in predictable ways.On a personal note, this film strikes me as being a wonderful introduction to someone wholly ignorant of both horror film and/or Stephen King. The reliance on stock characters is well done, as long as one is not overly familiar with such character types. Unfortunately, finding such a specifically ignorant audience is a very tall order. Therefore, the mist will highly impress a scant few, and merely satiate the horror tastes of the masses. 5.7 of 10 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

I'm kind of a sucker for monster flicks, so I was really happy to see that there some very unique and truly disturbing creatures hiding within the mist. Like many Stephen King stories, the best part of watching the film is searching for King's interpretation of the world we live in. This really stands out in The Mist; King deals with religion and thoughts of a coming apocalypse. A lot of people don't like this part of the movie because they view it as ""Christian bashing."" Christians who think that need to calm down and realize that people are not stupid enough to believe that every Christian is like that. And if you are that stupid, well, now you know, and knowing is half the battle. Another thing people are bitching about is the ending. I'll try to say as little as I can about it, but it is amazing. People go to movies and they want what I like to call a ""Hollywood Happy Ending."" The Mist keeps the tone going throughout the entire film. So the ending is as dark and twisted as the rest of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best heart breaking ending in my opinion,"When I watched the movie, everything was fascinating and made me curious. But as the movie came to an end, things changed. I remember opening my mouth in surprise as the background sounds and credits appeared. I especially enjoyed the Lovecraftian storyline. It was captivating and kept me hooked from start to finish. The way the plot unfolded kept me engaged, and I found myself drawn into the mysterious world the movie created. The characters were intriguing, and the atmosphere was eerie yet exciting. Overall, it was a memorable experience, and I would definitely recommend it to others who enjoy thrilling stories.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
No way can people not like this movie!!!,"Now I've read a lot of reviews for this movie and I must say to all those who didn't give this movie a 10. You are WRONG!!!I can understand why some people feel it really separates itself from the original novella near the end but guys... c'mon! I was sitting on the edge of my seat and had to keep second guessing myself for a large amount of the film. Most of the characters are believable and the special effects add highly to the mood and setting.I would personally hand out a copy of this movie to each and every person in the world so that they wouldn't be missing out this masterpiece but, unfortunately, I'm kind of broke...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hazy, mysterious and with a distinct kick; The Mist holds up as a rather impressive 'last stand' film with a couple of things going for it.","I wanted to love The Mist, I really did and that feeling dawns on you about half way through when you realise it isn't perfect and there are a few niggles but if you're in the right frame of mind and you're going with it, it offers an adrenaline fuelled ride of the horror and of the dramatic. As it turns out, I liked The Mist more than I did love it but it's still the sort of film you can engage with on certain dramatic levels that that hit particularly high notes of both terror, suspense as well as out and out horror. Take the incidence in which it has been established venturing outside is a death-wish and yet certain characters are forced into going out into the mist because of prior events. It's as basic, basic as routine as you like 'don't go there  but they have to' scenario that we've all seen many times before and yet you sit there, watching it and loving every tension filled second of it.Don't let me make The Mist come across as a guilty pleasure, because it's anything but. In Frank Darabont, the film has an extremely competent filmmaker and one who began his C.V. of most accessible Stephen King adaptations with a character filled drama set in a prison before branching out into another character based drama set in a prison of sorts but incorporating elements of the supernatural. Now he has this: a film that prods the needle a little further into the direction of the supernatural and away from the character study a tad although we don't really mind all that much once everything gets going. The Mist is probably Darabont's weakest King adaptation of the three discussed but again, do not allow it to sound like a criticism.The film is the sort that the trailers would have spoil for you, indeed I can remember one of those ridiculously fast TV spots popping up prior to its release not so long ago and revealing a little too much; I can only imagine how much a trailer might have given away and consequently spoilt at the time. That said, the intrigue of the mist and what it is and why it's there act as a wonderful back-boiling element to a film gradually establishing characters to whatever degree it sees fit and uneasy relationships others may have had in the past. One such individual in the film is David Drayton (Jane) whose house is partially destroyed by a falling tree that came as a result of a thunderstorm. He finds himself and his son holed up in a convenience store with a bunch of other innocents as odd mist descends, soon gobbling up the store's car park and general area.The unique selling point of the film is in its ambiguity revolving around the mist. The film is everything from Night of the Living Dead to Deep Rising all the way through to the relatively recent Dog Soldiers in which individuals are trapped within a 'base' and must submit to the film adopting a last stand arc. The difference with The Mist is that rather than zombies or werewolves, the film tears up the piece of paper detailing all known/necessary 'beasties' to lay siege to the setting and gives us a series of wonderful creatures fresh from the mind of Stephen King. To tell anyone what actually comes out of the mist would be both a cruel spoiler but also nigh on impossible to describe which is an achievement in itself.The Mist actually beds into a nice recent cannon of films detailing everyday people encountering fantastical monsters, following on from Korean film The Host and Cloverfield. I suppose the difference between these and previous films such as Eight Legged Freaks or From Dusk Till Dawn lie in their approach to the post 9/11 situation. Very early on in the shop, the camera flicks and switches and moves in that bizarre, hand held fashion you get when you watch amateur footage shown on news networks that was shot on location soon after a known attack. The feeling you get is distress and panic at the fact you don't know what's going on and neither do the characters. The added kick is as routine as you like: don't show the threat unless absolutely necessary.The film does not branch off into a realm of politics but that's not to say it doesn't include a fair amount of what it feels is necessary. Early on, an elderly school teacher blames the American government of concentrating too much on building weapons rather than using the money to improve the educational system and the characters connected to the military are presented in a mysterious, ominous and shadowy light. What's additionally eerie is the getting across of a religious individual as the primary source for antagonism within the group, something that starts off as a relative annoyance toward them but escalates to something much larger in an impressive manner.The Mist is, above most other things, just a cracking good ride. It carries that B-movie feel and that sense of overacting at times but it works for the film when things get rather frightening once encounters with the creatures crop up. Darabont recognises his inspirations early on with several paintings of films-past of this ilk and manages to steer clear of any blatant, unwanted product placement despite the fact the film takes place practically throughout in a convenience store full of goods. The Mist is a frightening at times and dramatic at other times production that keeps you gripped in that way a truly enjoyable horror films can; it isn't up there with the greats such as The Shining and Halloween but it isn't far off.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another Darabont Gem,"Another Stephen King adaptation and done, once again, by Frank Darabont.I read the story a week before I saw it so it was fresh in my mind. It sticks closely to the book up until the end. Darabont is awesome, as always, when it comes to adapting King's works. He builds up the tension and suspense throughout the movie at a great pace. You're not given much background into the lives of the characters and the origins of the mist, which is explained towards the end quickly.All the actors do a very good job. I don't know why people are complaining about it. Out of all the actors though, Marcia Gay Harden easily steals the show with her character of the Bible thumping Mrs. Carmody. By the end of the movie, you will really HATE her and want to kill her yourself. Kudos to Harden.The monster effects aren't all that great but I didn't go see the movie for the monsters. Yes they look cheesy but it's alright by me. People are complaining that they showed the monsters too early. In my opinion it's perfect where they are and it matches up with the story.The ending was simply shocking. Not how the story ends but I liked the movie ending more. It's not ambiguous like the ending of the story. It's shocking and depressing yet as one reviewer said, it evokes a lot more emotion than the book ending. Don't go thinking that you'll get a happy mushy ending like most Hollywood endings. Stephen King said that he loves the movie ending and would have written that for the book if he had thought of it first and I agree with him. Some people will hate it and say it totally ruins the movie and doesn't line up with the character while others will love it. Either way it's a ending that'll stick with you long after you're done watching it.I'll be looking forward to the next Darabont/King movie.9/10",,Anonymous,Horror
An Insanely Underrated Horror Masterpiece. Rent It!!!!!!!!,"There are many possibilities why 'The Mist' tanked at the box office. Maybe people didn't want to see a horror film during the holidays. Maybe people didn't think Frank 'Green Mile' Darabont could pull off a horror flick. Maybe everyone just thought it was the sequel to the horrible Tom Welling flick 'The Fog'. Whatever the reason may be, I really hope this film gets the attention it deserves.The performances are top-notch, surprising for a horror flick. Standouts include Thomas Jane as the protagonist and Marcia Gay Harden as the crazy religious lady. I think Harden deserved an Oscar for that film because she's probably the most hated character in a film in the past year (yes, she's even more evil than Anton Chigurh and Daniel Plainwiew).The CGI wasn't bad. The tentacle scene reminded me of 'Deep Rising'but it was actually scary. That's the other thing about 'The Mist': when you start watching the film, you don't suspect the horrors that will ensue. At. All. And the most terrifying thing about the film is not the monsters but how the characters act when faced with certain doom.As for the controversial ending, I gotta say it was rough. It wasn't as off-putting as the final scenes of 'Funny Games' but it was unexpected. And the aftermath was even more unsettling.Overall, I did not expect to like this film as much as I did. If you want to rent a REALLY good horror film you can't do better than 'The Mist'.9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"the ending heartbreaking, everything else? ehh","Had pretty high expectations for this one when it first watched it, but it was just dissapointing. Except for the ending. The ending of this movie is truly heartbreaking and one of the most horrifying and depressing movie endings of its kind. Never imagined what the writer was thinking creating such a painful and sombering ending for the characters. But, the ending alone cannot justify the whole movie just being another cliché and very predictable movie. Characters are what builds a movie, and this is just upsettingly lacking. The bonds the between the? Lacking. The conflict? Lacking. This movie is a great one, if judging only and only by its ending. Sadly, that is not the case. Simply put it is a dissapointing and wasn't executed that greatly movie.Strongly suggest watching the movie's ending.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Mist is more cautionary than we acredit,"The Mist is a movie based on the book by Stephen King, which was inspired by H.P. Lovecraft and The Lord of the Flies. Perhaps even Dawn of the Dead. but whatever influenced it, it must be said it has equally inspired others as well, among them one of the most popular PC Games ""Half Life"".The Mist brings into focus a military experiment gone awry. Where portals, doorways, windows to other worlds are opened, and what lies beyond is unleashed upon mankind. But it is much more than that. It is a story of faith, and man's worst enemy: ourselves. It talks of the survival instinct but in so that it can lose a fight against our own lack of faith.So a buddy of mine came over today and made me watch the DVD of this today, even though I watched the movie when it first came out.Definitely upon second viewing I enjoyed this movie so much more.The pharmacy scene is incredible. The tentacles ripping chunks of the Sherminator felt visceral. The acidy spider webs were freaky, and it just all worked better for me.You start out at home, go to the grocery store, to the pharmacy and back to the grocery, then to the finale. This movie really was well-rounded with a lot of story. The actress who played the religious woman was awesome, especially in the scenes where she was talking to God or to the creature who spared her life, that was sweet.When the military man at the end is explaining what the military was up to, he basically spells out the plot to the game Half-Life, awesome game by the way.Bernie Wrightson (who designed the Impossibly Tall Creature) said his design was inspired by an illustration from a Lovecraft book that depicted a mass of tentacles atop a bunch of elephant legs.I think the message was that mankind will bring about it's own destruction. We know curiosity killed the cat, but we rarely think about what it does to us.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not to be 'MIST' as a DVD rental,"This was a good sci-fi flick that had some pretty decent startles to it. The plot development was good and the relationship evolution of the 'stranded' town folk was a typical example of the ""Lord of the Flies"" syndrome. Parts of it are a bit slow but these parts are punctuated by scary jolts. I was intrigued by the premise, as it came to light, particularly because of what I've been reading about 'String Theory' as well as 'Dark Matter' at Wikipedia. Some aspects of the film kind of reminded me of ""Eight Legged Freaks"". If you have a phobia about bugs you might want to pass on this one. The acting was passable and the ending had a nice twist to it. I don't know that it was worth the $8.50 I paid to see it in the theater, but I definitely RECOMMEND it as a DVD rental, or wait 'till it comes to the budget theater.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
horror as it should always have been,"In Frank Darabont's 'The Mist', we find ourselves locked inside of a grocery store with about 20 or 30 other people. And there's a catch...You can't leave, or else you will die.Stephen King's original story captured the minds and imaginations of hundreds of thousands of people, including mine, with the thought of monsters in a mist. You're being attacked by monsters, you know that. But what do these monsters look like? You can't see an inch in front of your face in the mist.Darabont, the masterful director behind such amazing films as 'The Shawshank Redemption', and 'The Green Mile' made a great film once more.It captures the claustrophobic feeling, the thought that once you run out of food, then what will happen? What if the plate-glass window in the front of the store breaks? What if these things get in? And just to put the cherry on top: watch out for the religious nut, Mrs. Carmody.The film has one downside: the music towards the end. To me, that's the only thing.Yes, it's true the ending is depressing, yes, it's hopeless. But if you think it's too hopeless, too depressing, then you've got to spend sometime on a place I like to call earth.In the words of Jim Morrison, ""No one here gets out alive."" Recommeded: The 2 disc DVD has a black and white version of the film, I prefer that.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Truly Amazing, A Real Classic Horror Flick...","I wonder, how does anyone start writing 'bout such a great flick. Where to begin? I mean, when I first saw the trailer I thought this movie was going to be another cheesy wannabe horror movie but Oh man, what was I wrong. I never thought nowadays, that I would be sitting at the cinema with a girl grabbing my hand so tight, and me myself doing the same thing to her hand. The scenes were so tense and exciting that I just wanted to leave the theater And stay there at the same time. Why did I want to leave? Well for the simple fact that during the whole movie, I thought I was one of the characters, afraid of what was coming next.The actors ALL did a great job, especially Marcia Gay Harden as the Christian psycho. How many times did I want to slap her to the face. Thomas Jane really got up a notch in his acting ability. He really played his part convincing and true. Just all the actors did a fine job...Now the ending, before I saw this movie, I read a few comments on this board and some people said they were disappointed by the ending. I wonder, what was wrong with it. I mean, was it wrong because the ending almost (in my case) made you cry? Like you really wanted to jump out of your body and run away like Forest? I truly believe that the ending was just PERFECT. The last minute was breathtaking.You rarely see a movie where you actually feel like your one of the main characters.So folks, really, believe me, when it comes to horror movies I'm rather criticizing than praising them. But The Mist is just a top notch quality movie. Don't miss it at the cinemas 'coz you'll regret it big time!Rate: ****/****",,Anonymous,Horror
a horror movie with  good character development,"This movie was above average, but I think the ending was too horrible/depressing. Apparently this wasn't the ending in the book, and I think I would have liked the book's ending better. No one wants to think about what David did in the end, especially, to his own son. I mean, couldn't they have at least waited several hours to see if help would come.Mrs. Carmody was a great character, especially towards the end after she has won over most of the supermarket. She turns into the evil one. I'm glad she got what she had coming when she started saying ""take the boy."" Other people in the store played their roles as well. They just weren't in the background. And with so many people, it was not confusing thanks to a good script.The blood and gore is more than you usually see in a Stephen King film. That's another plus for me.FINAL VERDICT: One of the better horror films I've seen in a while. Much better than some slasher flick like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes. Worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

All I know is the movie that was placed before me.I would recommend this movie to any and everyone I know, regardless of taste in movies.

One of the Best Creature Features of the 21st Century,"A movie with more than one nightmare occurring at the same time, The Mist demonstrates that humans are just as brutal as the monsters that stalk us. I have to admit that this movie was a challenge to watch, not because of copious amounts of gore (which it doesn't have), but because of the religious lady who made their situation so much worse than it already was. She slowly starts unraveling the band of survivors with her constant monologues about God and the rapture, and how blood must be spilled in order for them to survive. Her character was so over the top, that she has to be considered one of the most annoying and difficult characters in movie history.But that may just be the genius behind the movie, focusing on the many people turn to religion in times of crisis no matter how ludicrous it may seem and then pitting them against rational thinking characters. This type of social and religious commentary makes the movie work on multiple levels and helps the movie avoid becoming just another creature feature with a large body count and CGI overkill.The Mist mainly focuses on the characters trapped inside the store and their tale of survival, not from the monsters outside, but the people on the inside tearing them apart internally. But don't get me wrong, there are plenty of crazy monsters lurking in the mist and we get to see plenty of them throughout the movie, and they are terrifying! The abilities or traits that certain creatures possess are terrifying, all sorts of nightmares are out there just waiting for them.This was an interesting movie, entertaining, yes, but also challenging because the movie tries to have smart characters front and center, but they are held back by not so smart characters. And I of course need not to discuss the ending, it's already been written down in movie history as one of the most shocking endings ever. The Mist certainly is one of the better horror movies of the 21st century!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
gulk,"Oké, the movie is great, let me just say that. I love all the Stephen King movies and was awaiting this one. For the people who still need to see the film, there are no spoilers, but a glimpse of the ending. Finally I saw it. And the ending was shocking. Really. I don't mind a 'not so happy ending', but this is to much. Any normal filmwatching person will be shocked. And there is also something that bothers me. How come they risk everything throughout this film, but when it counts... And also, because of this ending I find the film less believable. On the other end, if it had the ending I thought it would be sappy or (in my worst case scenario: even more shocking, but I would find it more believable). I just finished watching it a few minutes ago, so tomorrow my opinion may be different, but now you got me in the full emotion of the film.

Book is good - film not bad,"If you read the book from Stephen King, you will be a bit surprised by the film. As in most cases, the movie sacrifices some elements of the written original and the ending is extended too. The book does not give any concrete ending for the story, only that they just keep on driving on and on. But: the films alternative ending compared to the original story shows such a drama! OK, we have seen scenes more dramatical, of course, but anyway! I always am sad, when I see, that there is another TV-version of a King story, because in most cases they are bad. Movies can also not always do their best, to reveal the depths of Kings mind, but in some cases they succeed.

Movie Review: The Mist,"About 30 minutes into the new horror film ""The Mist,"" you begin to wonder if writer/director Frank Darabont was ever hugged as a child.By the time the closing credits start to roll, you've substituted ""hugged"" for ""regularly placed into a burlap bag and beaten."" In a way, ""The Mist"" is something both extremely familiar and entirely different for Darabont, who made his directorial debut in 1994 with a little movie called ""The Shawshank Redemption."" By following up with the excellent ""The Green Mile"" in 1999, Darabont had established himself not only as a great screenwriter and director of hope-filled, dramatic period-prison films, but as one of very few people to ever faithfully adapt a story by Stephen King, let alone two, with great success.But although neither of these eloquently composed films is without its moments of sheer brutality, let's just say that there are certain things in ""The Mist"" that make The Sisters and ""Wild Bill"" Wharton look about as threatening as Mr. Rogers or Bob Ross.That's not to say Darabont's third King adaptation, this one a straight-up jarring horror film laced with multiple throwbacks to the cheesily tentacled B-level monster flicks of years past, lacks any great performances, artistic merit or social relevance. It's absolutely filled with them.But just as importantly, ""The Mist,"" along with this summer's ""1408""itself based on a King novellaproves that Hollywood horror is not only limited to ""torture porn"" or the remaking of genre classics. A little thought-provoking originality, along with some disturbing, realistic psychological and sociological terror, can cut an audience much deeper than simply relying on gruesome violence or scantily clad young teens in peril to do the job.""The Mist"" is as much about religious fanaticism and the hysteria-induced evil that humans are capable of harboring when frightened and without technology than the bloodthirsty contents of a widespread fog that rapidly approaches a small Maine town. After enduring a violent overnight thunderstorm, David Drayton (Thomas Jane, in a far, yet exceptional cry from his ""Punisher"" days), his young son (Nathan Gamble) and neighbor, Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), drive to the crowded town supermarket to stock up on food and supplies. Once there, a local man bursts screaming into the store, his clothes bloodied, claiming that something hidden in the impending mist has ""taken"" people.The townspeople quickly realize that the supermarket is suddenly engulfed entirely in whiteness, and the doors are immediately sealed. Over time, three opposing factions begin to form within the store: a group headed by paternally protective David and store supervisor Ollie (Toby Jones), attempting to find a safe way to escape; one led by the rationalist Norton who rejects the hoopla and wants to venture outside to search for help; and a steadily growing huddle influenced by the ramblings of a fanatic, Bible-quoting doomsayer (the freaky Marcia Gay Harden).Of course, Darabont wants us to question which is more dangerous: terrified humans with no answers blindly following a ridiculous solution that only complicates matters, or the otherworldly beasts that wait beyond the store's glass windows. The film is extremely effective in evoking a strong sense of claustrophobia, and a great deal of that can be attributed to Darabont's decision to hire the filming crew of TV's ""The Shield,"" specializing in grittiness and hand-held camera-work. His choice to keep the monsters mostly hidden until we least expect it is also instrumental in the film's effectiveness.""The Mist"" makes troubling events all the more devastating by drawing us into the lives of its characters and emphasizing their humanity, only to rip our hearts out during its subsequent brutal scenes. The much needed comic relief is valuable.Many audiences have been polarized by the film's ending, unexpected, ironic and unflinching. I thought it was brilliant, staying with you long after the lights come up and serving as a great capper to the boiling pot of suspense Darabont had established throughout the film.***.5 out of ****",,Anonymous,Horror
Taut suspense most of the way,"Giant insects and sundry other creatures, some of them entirely new species, pop up in an unnatural fog that settles over a small Maine town, and all hell breaks loose. A group of people are trapped in a grocery store when the fog overtakes the town, and some but not all of them do their best to survive. It doesn't work out too well for anybody. Lots of gory effects, some of it startling and vivid and some of it simply laughable. Pretty decent CGI on the majority of the creatures. The plot is a cousin to THE FOG, minus the pirates and hidden gold. A reasonable time killer with a downer of an ending, so beware. A stone-faced Tom Jane stars, and is surrounded by some familiar faces, including Jeff DeMunn and Marcia Gay Harden, who as a Bibe-spouting hag decides the fog represents the end of the world, and requires human sacrifice. As if the terrified folks in the store don't have enough to worry about.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"At last- a refreshing throwback to the good old American horrors of yesteryear. The Happening, bug off","Fish and Chips, Ant and Dec, Zig and Zagnot quite the intro' you were expecting, right? Well I certainly hope not. But some things, I'd think you'd agree, are just meant to go together. Add to that list Frank Darabont and Stephen King: the touching, pleasantly out of character page turners of the latter so remarkably reworked in the timeless, superseding film classics of the former. For his third King rework, though, writer/director Darabont's ditched the potent period prison play (see Shawshank Redemption, see Green Mile), opting to grapple with the author's forte: horror. But The Mist is far more permanent, profound and disconcerting than its banal B-movie look and title would suggest. Not only is it somewhat of a religious experience (keep an eye out for the iconography), but it's also a revelation.In retrospect, the film's form and plot line are as simple as they come: a cryptic mist, veiling a brood of oddball beasties, herds a colony of model Americans into a small-town grocery store. ""There's something in the mist!"" barks a bloody-nosed dweller as he stumbles through the store doors. ""Shut the doors,"" he cries. ""Shut the doors, my god!"" And so, it begins. The archetypal movie Americans vs. a pick and mix of quirky creatures hell bent on taking office.A cast of relative unknowns star, then, alongside a host of newcomers, non-professionals and unfamiliar faces in this terrifying adap' of King's original tale. The blend of chaos and camaraderie between the characters proving crucial to the tone and impact of the film as Darabont's hand-held, moving cameras bob and weave through the well orientated cast, rack focussing from one plane of depth to another as they bicker over who (or what's) to blame. Terrorists? Scientists? Nature? God? Who or whatever the culprit, survival would appear salient for our classic film players: the valiant leader (Tom Jane at the top of his game), the mental preacher (Marcia Gay Harden at the top of hers), the realist, the klutz, the blonde, the needy kid, the plucky gran', the non-believer, the unsung hero. They're all in there, and more.All told, The Mist is stylistically nostalgic. A sci-fi/horror hybrid with odd sprinkles of humour that recall the cult classics of Jack Arnold, George A. Romero and John Carpenter. Only better. Yes, better. Darabont's delve into untried territory is a massive achievement in horror movie making. The Shining? Not quite. Darabont may be a maestro of the screen adap' but he's no Stan' Kubrick. There's no disguising The Mist's potential as classic of the horror genre, though. This is a writer/director who's knack for tying an empathic rapport between character and audience pays up front both where and when it matters. Shawshank was a dream. The Mist is a nightmare. But in all the right ways: a murky, tantalizing terror-jolt with added substance. High-concept with a weighty sub-text and a damn low-budget. Darabont's more concerned with probing the humanity of horror than the gore and the guts and the winged, slithery, tentacled fiends hurling themselves at the glass panes. As far as CGI goes, you have and will see better (in fact it's laughable on occasion) but when a film's set-up is this well conceived, it's all right for the special effects to take a back seat. Example? The Birds. Example? Jaws. Another? Alien. Add to this list The Mist. A film rapt on how bloody timid and fragile we humans are in the face of fear. ""As a species we're fundamentally insane,"" utters the unsung hero. ""Put more than two of us in a room, we pick sides and start dreaming up ways to kill one another,"" I wouldn't go that far, mate. ""Why do you think we invented politics and religion?""Good point.In spite, then, of its old chestnut line up and rather rushed and ""hazy"" start, from the moment the smog rolls in - swallowing the entire township in one swift gulp - The Mist just gets better and better as it creeps and crawls towards an unruly final third that'll haunt, shock and astound, disturb and confound. And like all great movies, there're plenty of leftovers to chew over. This is a film with something to say whose final stance over matters will lure countless back for seconds, no question.Frank Darabont has sculpted ominous camera-work, a forbidding score, top performances, lurid tension and shock after shock into a modest macabre with a killer ending to rival that of anything I've ever seen on film. Horror film fans will be pushed to find a more riveting two-hours of pure entertainment than this: a cynical and paralyzing portrait of the humane and the inhumane that certainly isn't satisfying, but it grips like a vice all the same. In a word: mist-ifying.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
What Can I Say But,"The entire flick left a bad taste in my mouth. And this bad taste seemed very unnecessary. Even before the shock ending which has garnered much publicity and praise for its daring the movie wasn't working for me. First of all the character Thomas Jane portrays isn't very likable. Despite the fact that he's presented as a loving father and husband I just didn't buy into anything he did and could care less about him or anyone he cared about. The supporting characters didn't offer up anything and were either obstacles or mindless companions offering up little nuggets of useless plot driven advice whenever prompted by the screenplay. Perhaps the biggest issue I had with the film was the character development. When the crap went down, and it does pretty quickly, I found that all of the characters could be killed by the creatures and I wouldn't care in the slightest. In a film like this, bland unlikeable characters are a huge no no. There are some scenes which are moments of pure cinema and despite the lacking on the character development/likability end the film was very well made and the effects were intense and well done. Overall though I just can't see myself giving this anything but a half-hearted recommendation. Maybe I expected too much out of it, what with all the good word of mouth about it and it being Frank Darabont spearheading the whole thing. Whatever the reason great effects and atmosphere can only carry a movie so far without the human component to hold it all together. I give this a six out of ten for the effects and atmosphere though perhaps I'm being too generous.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome,"I just got done watching this, and I must say that I am impressed. King's story has actually been expanded on in a way that enhances it, instead of just ripping it to shreds for a few more bucks. The interplay between the characters was very well done, and it felt authentic. Some viewers have taken offense to the way a religious person was portrayed here, and her actions upon the rest of the group. Unlike some, I know that this was a MOVIE, not a smear campaign. One could call their ability to tell fact from fiction into question, but we'll let that go for now. As it stands, this was hugely entertaining, and a great cross-section of humanity in crisis. I actually like the ending, as it forces you to see the true face of Horror. (No, it's not the Giant Walker. It's human failure.) Definitely worth buying, but I would wait until the special set comes out, if there is one.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Overall, a nice horror package but has it's fair share of problems","The Mist is a rare film you'll probably get to see it 'clean' (with no spoilers or even much expectation at all). It's not a big film and is shot more like a TV movie than a Hollywood blockbuster. In a small American town, the residents become trapped in a supermarket by a thick mist - but soon realise that something is IN the mist. A siege ensues that becomes as much about the human soul as it does about the nasties outside.On the whole, I liked 'The Mist' and I think it was a decently acted piece, with a strong human element that's sorely lacking in today's horror movies. Tom Jane is very likable as the typical 'everyman' to which people gravitate towards to at times of crisis. Marcia Gay Harden is delightfully OTT as a Christian fanatic who gradually convinces the townsfolk that it's God's will that they be destroyed. As the situation worsens, so does the behaviour of the people and this becomes one of the more successful parts of the film. The sanctuary of the store, becomes just as dangerous as the mist itself.While it's a proper B-movie, which I love, the lack of a big budget makes some scenes less effective than they should be. The ropey CG is thankfully kept in the mist or the shadows for the most part, but when it's first revealed around the half hour mark, the impact is taken away by the fact that it's clearly not real. The creepiest moments are those where characters go into the mist and where the horror is unseen. The gore effects however, particularly during a gruesome foray into the drug store are impressive and help to counter the CG beasties' deficiencies.As I mentioned before, the acting is pretty good and help to sell the situation. However, there are some incredibly dumb mistakes that lead to disaster (and for a horror film, the fact that they stick out is bad). For instance, if you're holed up in a glass-fronted store, don't leave the electric lamps on display right next to the windows! Or if somethings trying to get under a metal gate... try closing the gate!!! It's a shame that a film which concentrates on the human condition, quite successfully, ends up stretching common sense like that.Now on to the now-famous ending... which I won't give away of course. What I will say is that it's both extremely downbeat AND unexpected. It's bleak, but in a way that you probably wouldn't see coming until it hits you. The idea is fantastic... but I'm not so sure about the execution. First, the music (largely absent until now) smothers the final scenes and changes the entire feel of the film from small intimate B-movie to overwrought epic. Then, the passage of time is so short in the final moments that the outcome loses its impact. Finally, Tom Jane (who has been very good in the film until this point) doesn't quite sell the drama in my opinion. I just don't think the ending manages to deliver the powerful sucker punch it intended - and only a tiny bit of editing would have changed that.But the good things about The Mist make you forgive the flaws unlike some films where they overshadow them. Either way, it's worth a look but rent it first, because this is looking like a case of love it/hate it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Wildly predictable, frighteningly cliché","The Mist's unique, interesting plot was overshadowed by mediocre B actors who portrayed over-the-top characters that engaged in completely implausible reactions to the situations they found themselves in.The main complaint of most horror films and why so many of them fall short of being anything worth talking about is people always end up thinking ""No one would ever do that"". You know, when people are screaming for the character to ""Run!"" while she instead stands there with a dumb look on her face? Yeah, this movie is pretty much like that the entire way through.Almost none of the characters attempt to act rationally. In fact, that seemed to be the overriding point of the film. It wasn't the main character trying to survive something evil -- it was the main character trying to survive the unrealistically stupid actors in his company.The film climaxes with a terribly bizarre, try-hard ending. You either love it or hate it. The people that love it want to praise it like it was some unexpected, shocking plot twist. Yes, it was unexpected. Unexpectedly dumb. Yes, it was shocking. Shockingly unrealistic. And, that sums up The Mist. Unexpectedly dumb, shockingly unrealistic.",,Anonymous,Horror
"""For all darkness in the world stems from darkness in the heart""","I really enjoyed this movie based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. It not only shows the horror of supernatural creatures, but also the horror that we, as humans, are capable of inflicting on each other.There are many themes that converge in the film, from otherworldly horror to religious paranoia. The movie isn't really that old, so the special effects hold up well.In the end the whole theme of the film is both apocalyptic and pessimist, it leaves by the end a sense of dread of what could have been, and how we can be as ugly as the monsters we fear.I haven't read the novel yet, so I can't say how faithful the movie is to its source, but I think any horror fan would like it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
No Turning Back,"I love how the film develops an environment that feels real, with characters with unique personalities that help the story unfold well.It all takes place in a supermarket, it seems simple, but it manages to convey the fear, desperation and mystery of what's out there. I really hated Carmody, but I loved Ollie.His ending certainly left me shocked, both for its rawness of making strong decisions, and above all that heartbreaking moment where regret prevails and manages to convey to the viewer.I would love to see an alternative ending, even if it's a consolation or just curiosity.One of the best endings I've seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
simply brilliant! undoubtedly one of my favorite horror/thriller movie!,"during the first half hour or so i thought this was gonna be a typical ""alien"" related movie, but as it progressed i found myself totally spell bound with it's awesome story line and great acting all around. the sounds and effects were excellent! definitely this was a great job in making a Stephen king novel to a movie.the story line was pretty fast, i was pretty tired the night i watched it but it never let me take even a yawn! the story was superb with great thrills and suspense, but the thing that intrigued me most was the story had some realistic touch.altogether i have to say this movie is worth watching,i had a great time watching it!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not for the weak minded,"My title can be said for the characters in this movie, as well as the audience. As the summary says, it's a movie about survival. This movie had its jumps, scares, and it wasn't predictable. Better sound (both music and effects) could have added more suspense. The actors are all familiar faces.I disliked three major things, the first being what I like to call a karma-plot, where they portray characters based on their upcoming fate. That's the best I can describe it without using examples that may insinuate on specifics of the movie. The second thing I disliked was laughing at the screen with simple suggestions. ""Why don't you just...?"" over and over again. The third thing was the self-shot drag-outs like in the movie Thin Red Line. The movie is based on the short story by Stephen King, and the short part is what gets dragged out. I would have liked to have seen more information in the storyline, as it mainly focused on the characters rather than the plot.",,Anonymous,Horror

Some of Stephen Kings scariest work,"First of all, I'll admit to being a fan of the work of Stephen King, like many others I have read, and enjoyed, a lot of his works. However, I had not read this particular story before watching this film. The setting is a small town in Maine where a powerful thunderstorm has just wreaked havoc and the townsfolk are just getting things back together.David Drayton, an artist who designs movie posters for a living, leaves his wife at home and heads to the local town store. He has his son, Billy with him, along with neighbour Brent Norton. As they set off they notice a mist coming down from the hills and across the lake. There are a lot of Army personnel on the road headed out of town; they are from the base situated in the hills. On arrival at the store they go about their shopping, David tries the payphone since he cannot get any service on his mobile but it's not working either. All of a sudden, as the mist envelops the store an old man with a bloody nose runs in and tells the people there not to go outside. There's something in the mist and it took his friend. One man makes a run for his car but we only hear his screams. They are now trapped in the store with, who knows what outside. Already people are divided, local 'crazy' woman, Mrs. Carmody begins quoting scripture and David's neighbour, Brent begins trying to get people to make a run for it. David gets some help from teacher, Amanda Dunfrey; she looks after Billy while he tries to figure a way out with a store clerk, and friend, Ollie Weeks. When a young man is killed by something unworldly as he's trying to go outside at the back of the store, people still will not believe it's dangerous out there. A group of them try to get out but fail to get very far. The divisions in the group get wider the longer it goes on and Mrs. Carmody's cries of holy retribution get more and more fanatical followers. I really don't want to say too much more for fear of giving too much away, but I will say that David, Billy, Amanda and a few others do make an attempt to get outside.It's a pretty well made film but some of the CGI wasn't top quality and did let it down slightly. It's quite a tense storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Decent performances from all of the main characters, Thomas Jane as David Drayton, Marcia Gay Harden was great as Mrs. Carmody, Laurie Holden as Amanda Dunfrey, Andre Braugher as Brent Norton and Toby Jones as Ollie Weeks.As with a lot of Stephen King stories, this is a very character driven piece and as such it works pretty well. The only thing I find with it is that the characters are sometimes portrayed as a little too much larger than life. For instance, Brent Norton is a lawyer and is adamant that there is nothing harmful outside. Even after the young man is killed he will not go into the back of the store to see the evidence. He's convinced the locals are trying to play a prank on him, even after some others go back there and tell him they're telling the truth. But I digress. Of course, because it's a horror film, the people have to do the most stupid things possible to put themselves in harms way. But I'll overlook all these cliché moments mainly because there is a really good ending. And no, I'm not going to give it away. Over all, it's a little cliché in places, but stick with it, the ending is pretty unexpected: recommended.My score: 7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A sadistic film I ever watched,"I don't really know why I watched this film after watching 'Cube'. This is a famous film as a disturbing ending film. So I got mentally ready to watch it but I wasn't. I wasn't considering other parts. That was my problem but I think Frank Darabont the director is sadist since he changed the ending worse.The ending was disturbing mentally but there were visually worse parts such as huge bugs, a girl got mosquito bite and so on. I don't really scream even if it's scary but this one. I couldn't stop screaming all the time and this was the second time since 'The Shining'. I could bear the gore scenes but not those creepy creatures.The story was built quite well and that point makes me bad because I was convinced enough and was in the story completely. I couldn't get out of that.This kind of films show us a minimised society and this film was also that type of film. The place of setting is a super market in a country side so there are many people and this film shows us minimised but a bigger society such as a religious woman, a lawyer from a city and an old couple.The main character makes a decision in a situation by situation, and the place he reaching is...

The Mist An Effective Horror Thriller With Some Flaws,"The Mist is an effective horror thriller with some flaws from director Frank Darabont whose admirable in making this movie but unanswered questions, the dialogue at times, and the ending is what weighed the movie down. However The Mist is still not that bad it just could have been better. Darabont the man behind films like The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption continues to show his skill with this one as a filmmaker despite it's flaws. Thomas Jane is good as the lead David Drayton a movie poster artist who finds himself trapped in a grocery store with his son and many others when a freak storm unleashes nightmarish creatures that have a taste for human flesh. Jane may not win any awards with his performance but he's still convincing as David. The same can go for Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs Carmody in a rare villain role. Harden's character definitely has more than a few screws loose and can be as scary as the monsters outside lurking in the mist because she's clearly losing her mind. Harden is impressive in the role and she eventually gets whats coming to her. The rest of the cast including Laurie Holden, Toby Jones, William Sadler, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Andre Braugher in a brief extended appearance are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The movie does have some suspense, anticipation, a little humor, and the various creatures that come in all shapes and sizes are terrifying. Most of them are never clearly visible because they're in the mist so you only get glimpses which was okay but a clearer view of what they looked like would've been a little better considering several of the blood thirsty monsters are only given mere cameo appearances. All of them are still do their part but they could've been given more screen time. There is some suspense build up and anticipation which doesn't quite pay off but it's not entirely a failure either. A lot of questions are left unanswered except for one brief explanation as to where the creatures came from and how they got here. It was because of some kind of military experiment to create a window into another dimension which unleashed this whole other world with nightmarish beasts onto ours or something like that. A better explanation as to what happened would've also helped the film a little because it's better than no resolution at all. Some loose ends storyline wise aren't tied up by the end, the pacing was slow at times, the dialogue wasn't the greatest occasionally either, and some of the characters made stupid decisions which seems to be a trend horror movies have these days. The sequences involving a creature being shown in the mist or eating someone in a gruesome way are well executed but there could've been more of them. The special effects were so-so because at times you can definitely tell it's CG. The ending wasn't the best and if they had changed it the movie at least to me would've been much better. Despite it's flaws The Mist is still for the most part a good horror thriller better then most that are out there. Overall The Mist has gruesome deaths, some suspense, anticipation, scary villains, a little humor, and solid performances by the cast who make this horror film worth watching at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enter The Mist,"Okay, I'm about to suggest something that is a complete oxymoron here, but what Frank Darabont delivers with ""The Mist"" is an intelligent horror movie adapted from a Stephen King novel. If anyone knows how to adapt the King, it's Darabont. The man always tells an awesome tale when he uses King's stories as his templates (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile) and this here, their fourth collaboration together, continues the love affair to the exemplary standard we have grown accustomed.Darabont is one of those master filmmakers who expertly crafts character and story to completely draw you in to the magic of cinematic atmosphere. What he accomplishes here is reminiscent of classic Hollywood horror, when it was more about the people reacting to the horror and less about the spectacle pf the horror itself. ""The Mist"" refuses to be your basic creature feature, or gory monster hack 'n' slash. It keeps its head throughout the mounting crisis' while remaining unpredictable (for the most part) and keeping things on the slow burn flame of tension. What's more is that the cast is exceptionally good. And I don't just mean simply in terms of a fine ensemble of quality support actors filling out the roles of the besieged townsfolk, I mean every performance is mannered and refined to the degree where you believe in them whole heartedly. There is not one bad egg amongst them. How very rare. Thomas Jane proves playing an everyman lead can be more than simply a thankless task as he keeps the balance of believability of a normal guy thrust into an extraordinary battle for survival. No out-of-the-blue shotgun heroics here. He simply reacts as many Fathers would under similar circumstances. Very controlled and very impressive. But the real plaudits must go to Marcia Gay Harden as the crazed religious zealot who rallies in the name of a most disturbing God for a sacrifice to prove they are worthy of entry into the pearly white gates of oblivion. She pretty much steals the show. Andre Braugher, with shorter screen time, also nabs a ""why isn't he in bigger roles"" award, demonstrating some brilliant thesping abilities during the early chaotic scramble to understand just what lies outside in the mist. But as I said, this is an ensemble piece and Jeffery DeMunn, Bill Sadler and Toby Jones are just as good.What struck me beyond the performances was the remarkable thought put into the situation that unfolds. This story is about human fear and weakness. It's about what happens when we're all alone, in the dark, with no hope of rescue and what effect that has on different types of people. The best scene in the film takes place as a conversation between some of the core group that reflects these themes about what people will resort to when they are afraid and desperate to be saved. The subtext is subtle but still dominant enough for the story to be considered allegorical of modern day America with The Mist symbolic for not just the unknown, but fear itself. The script splinters characters into separate, opposing camps, each vying for leadership and control. Again this sparks to life the idea that there are underlying messages and metaphors within ""The Mist"" that comment on contemporary American culture, ranging from religion to social class.Darabont's non-showy, almost laidback direction allows a fluid camera to drift quite elegantly through the scenes, slowly conjuring the foreboding without ramming it in anyone's face. The subtleties in the music score compliment the visuals, so no blaring orchestral emphasis every time something frightening is about to happen. It all blends efficiently to make this seem less like a horror and more like a character piece. The CGI is admittedly less impressive than the rest of it but thankfully the special effects are sparingly used. The set-pieces themselves occasionally stumble because of such a wide character canvas to cover but for the majority of the film it all pays-off the slow building tension nicely. Plus, lack of explicit gore makes for a welcome change from all these inane torture porn fests we keep on getting. Finally a horror movie the grandparents might enjoy too. Don't let that put you off it though.If you have read anything on ""The Mist"" then you may know that the ending has been widely criticised. The reason? I ain't telling, except to say it is quite possibly the bleakest Hollywood ending in years. Frank Darabont's anti-Shawshank resolution but with the same message: Never give up hope. This is an elegantly produced supernatural horror that is about people rather than monsters, reminiscent of ""The Birds"" and ""Night of the Living Dead."" ""The Mist"" is a remarkable entry into the modern Hollywood horror cannon. As in; it's actually a good movie. Sincerely recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly good,"Movies made from Stephen King source material have a history of being a mixed bag. I was glad to not realize this was SK material when my kids selected it. Let's be clear this has B movie written all over it from the actors to the special effects (especially the creatures). There was something about it that continued to draw the viewer in... probably the conflict between Marcia Gay Harden and Thomas Jane. The film becomes darker as it moves along with a few ""I didn't see that coming"" moments culminating with one of the most depressing endings I've ever watched.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stephen King's The Mist,"A movie is usually referred to by the Director's movie but this doesn't apply to Stephen King's works. When you watch an adaptation of Stephen King, you gotta give the credit to the right man.I agree with one of the viewers that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the best of King's adaptation and ""The Green Mile"" is definitely a good movie but we need to be fair about one thing. The Green Mile is so similar to a movie that was released in 1995 called ""Powder"" while ""The Green Mile"" was written in 1999. I enjoyed ""The Green Mile"" but not as much as everybody else did because I had already watched ""Powder"".Anyhow, back to The Mist. I have to make it clear that the creatures in the movie were not really that scary but the idea of the world ending this way is possible and scary. Just the idea of being prisoned in one place and not knowing what the h'll is going on out side and even if you go out and see that there is no evidence of life anymore, is so damn scary. I loved the movie and enjoyed it a lot as it had so many strong elements. I usually enjoy the horror movies that group bunch of people who don't know each others in one place where they try with their different characters to save their lives. I also like it how people split into believing what's going on and others being just skeptical about the whole idea.The character of the religious lady is just so smart and the ending of the movie though shocking and disturbing but beautiful and you wouldn't have liked it to be different even though.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Intense!,"This movie may be one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever brought on screen.

But even the craziest story can make a good movie if the actors are playing their roles convincing. And - hell yeah - they do. I went through so many emotions watching this movie, I really was exhausted afterward. Marcia Gay Harden is doing an incredible job, you just have to hate her. It's these emotions which pull you through the movie, and not one moment gets boring.The sometimes nervous camera shots and the good soundtrack add to this feelings so you really get dragged into the movie.The special effects aren't special, but thats not important because all the stuff that happens in the mist is just there to create the special situation inside the store.

Unbelievably bad,"It's hard to believe that this movie was directed by Frank Darabont of Shawshank Redemption. If I had been at this movie alone, I would've walked out 45 minutes in. Or an hour in. It didn't matter how much time I'd invested; I was willing to throw it away to save at least 15 minutes of my life.You know which way Stephen King movies go: They're masterfully atmospheric, or they're cheeseball productions that should go direct to video. The first scene of this movie gave me the appropriate sinking feeling: Oh, it's going to be one of THOSE...What's wrong here? Everything from editing and cinematography gaffes to poor storytelling. Characters explode into arguments for no reason; there is no build-up to give confrontations any legitimacy. But the biggest problem with the movie is the use of abject stupidity on the part of the characters to achieve ""tension"" or to drag out boring action so the timing of the scene ""works."" You've seen this kind of thing before: The main character sees and hears something pounding on a garage door, to the point where the door bulges inward several feet and threatens to give way. He returns to the others and reports that he ""heard something."" Like what? ""I don't know. A noise."" Of course, the others doubt him and scoff, but the guy never elaborates. Otherwise perfectly articulate, he just stammers and stutters and the ensuing argument consumes minute after minute of our precious time. YAAAAAWWN. The movie is rife with incidents like these, where people just stand mute and stare as someone else delivers the most boring and uncompelling oratory imaginable.Even more tiresome are the minimum of three endless sermons given by the religious zealot trapped in the store. What a played out and hackneyed storyline: First merely tolerated, she eventually whips people up into religious fervor and turns them against the heroes. What a surprise! Pathetic. This kind of thing was done far better on Twilight Zone 45 years ago, and sewn up in less than half an hour. Here we get to watch the drivel unspool for almost two hours, with no surprises.I could let bad special effects go, but bad cinematography needs to be called out. Zoom rears its ugly head as often as the creatures do in this movie, and the result is a effort that often looks like amateur hour. You don't need a treatise on why zoom sucks to notice that it creates a cheap, made-for-TV feel. In fact, made for TV in the '70s, because today's viewers expect higher production value. They don't get it here.So is there any redemption in this effort? There's one scene where the heroes venture out into a different physical area, and it's not bad. And I respect the end, which isn't what one might expect. But beyond that, there's little recommend here.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very good, but key problems","The movie itself was awesome! The creatures, the tension; it was great. But two things bothered me: one was the constant push of the religious woman. nothing against religion, but the way it took over the movie, it seemed to ruin it for me, turning it into one of those koolaid-cult type movies. the second point that bothered me, which isn't as big as the first, was that you never got to see the big creatures as clearly as the small ones. but thats just my opinion lol. i like to see the full extent of their imaginations within the movie. like that monster in the mist that kind of looked like a mantis, but you could only see it like a shadow. i would have loved to at least have seen it once fully.",,Anonymous,Horror
This still packs a horror punch.,"A group of shoppers are forced to take shelter inside a supermarket, as a thick mist descends, bringing all manner of terrifying and deadly creatures.I had all but forgotten about this film adaptation, having more recently seen the TV series. This has aged very well, and has definitely stood up to the test of time.A nightmarish scenario from the great mind of Stephen King, this film has some terrifying sequences, I can never walk into a Pharmacy, and not imagine people wrapped in spider's webs up on the ceiling.It starts off pretty dark, and just gets darker and darker as it progresses, to say the ending is bleak is an understatement.The acting is top notch, I can't pick one person out, the whole cast just nailed it.If you're familiar with the likes of The Stand and The Tommyknockers, you'll know instantly that it's Stephen King, he knows exactly how to deliver a nightmare or two.I think I want the magical voice of Lisa Gerrard at the end of days, it fits perfectly.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a horror!,"I liked this horror film. It was very interesting and innovative, with a lot of interesting twists and turns.Plot is interesting, it is not of course about mist but rather about the people and their acting in the stressful and unpredictable situations. It really well portrayed how some people can not handle these kinds of situations. Especially is interesting religious woman. When people have no escape they revert to religion. When they can not explain unexplainable they revert to religion. All the time there is someone who will try to escape that way, however the only escape she achieved was that a bullet came into her head.Acting is different from an actor to another actor. I will not single anyone out, because they succeeded to work well as a crowd.All in all if you like Stephen King, like I do, you should see this film.

The Frank Darabont Redemption?,"Not quite.Following a rather violent storm, an assortment of small-town Maine residents find themselves trapped in a grocery store as a mysterious mist envelopes not only their town, but possibly the rest of the world. It's established early on that if you go into the mist, you don't come back. Well, that's not entirely true, as your legs might make a return. It doesn't even take 48 hours before the local zealot converts two-thirds of the store's population into a blood-thirsty cult, which isn't really much of a feat when the competition -- the outside world -- is populated by gigantic bugs, tentacles, birds and other assorted creatures that the back of the DVD case labels as ""otherworldly.""Writer/Director Frank Darabont (""The Shawshank Redemption,"" ""The Green Mile"") makes his return to horror in ""The Mist,"" adapted from a story written by none-other than Stephen King. Following the undeserving flop of 2001's ""The Majestic,"" it's not surprising that ""The Mist"" has some key issues. Darabont seems almost unsure of himself making this movie, as the mood is never properly settled. The first half of the flick feels like a glorious and gruesome modern day B-movie. With its nasty special effects (not to mention, some hokey looking tentacles) and ugly creatures, it's a movie that is certain to haunt the dreams of any children that may catch a glimpse by mistake. The second half, though, attempts to make some sort of commentary on human nature, and gets lost in the monster madness. Truth be told, ""The Mist"" is much more effective when it plays it straight, almost like a ""Night Of The Living Dead"" with bugs.Thomas Jane plays the protagonist to Marcia Gay Harden's truly scary antagonist, as the townsfolk ultimately succumb to some blood-thirsty creepy-crawlies and some old-school, hardcore bible-thumping. While the second half of the flick is chilling in its own right, it never reaches its point. You think what you're watching it going to make a statement and then ""Bang!"" -- at the speed of a bullet -- its dropped. The ending is truly cruel and will leave you unsettled for some time after watching it, which, I suppose, means that ""The Mist"" did its job correctly. It's certainly not Darabont's best work, but hopefully he'll get his sea-legs again and come back with another true classic. Taken for what it is, though, it's a movie that is guaranteed to make you squirm in your seat a bit and make your blood run cold at other moments, as you shout at the screen to some of it's blatantly ignorant characters. Clichés may run rampant, but much enjoyment can be derived from the new aged creature-feature.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sci-Fi/Horror Done Right!,"From within the first few minutes I was hooked through to the end. It's been a while since there's been a really good sci-fi/horror combo - and here it is - from Stephen King, no less...A mysterious mist shows up in a remote town, lots of military vehicles are seen speeding past, and shoppers in the town's grocery store become trapped when they realize that venturing into the mist is perilous. As the situation unfolds, fear begins to overtake logic.One thing I also really liked was that I didn't feel cheated with a minimal ending - so this was a big plus for me. However, the one thing that took away from the movie was the prolonged stupidity of the characters in the face of danger. It wasn't really believable. But the movie was so good in other respects, I let this aspect slide a bit.In general, this is a great movie to watch.

Bland and boring,"After a vicious storm wreaks havoc in their small town in Maine, artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane) heads out to the town supermarket for some much-needed supplies with his young son, Billy (Nathan Gamble), and his neighbor, Norton (Andre Braugher), in tow. Their trip soon turns to terror when a menacing white mist settles in, leaving this group of locals and out-of-towners fighting for survival against an unknown, bloodthirsty enemy. When the local religious zealot (Marcia Gay Harden) begins to convince the group that the mist is punishment from God, Drayton and his cohorts realize that they may be trapped inside with an enemy just as dangerous as whatever is lurking outside. Tension runs high in this tale as the trapped group faces difficult moral decisions. Should they stay and wait out the terror, or make a break for it and risk suffering a terrible fate?The Mist is an incredibly bland film. There's that mysterious atmosphere and a little bit of tension because of the unknown but nothing really that excites you. The film also has this claustrophobic sensation, not because the action takes place in the same spot during the entire film but because the plot is always the same. There's all kinds of nasty cgi monsters, some little, some big, some with wings, some with tentacles and then there's the group of civilians who have to defend themselves and this goes on for more then an hour. Plus, the film isn't scary at all, more disgusting and nasty then anything else. At one point the film turns into a morality play but by then I was completely exhausted and fed up.The acting was solid and the film was well directed, but as I said, the script (which is inspired by a Stephen King novella) doesn't do anything for me. We've seen this kind of story hundreds of times, it's just not that effective anymore, at least for me.5/10",,Anonymous,Horror
"Like life, Like history","The mist is a fantastic story where you experience a sci-fi fantasy tale which is strangely, somehow familiar. The story is very powerful. This is the strongest aspect of the work for sure but not the only one. Directing is superb as well. Also, cinematography is very interesting but not as much as the two previous strong aspects. Like life and like history,When I saw it for the first time, I had a familiar feeling. Like this is a very familiar story which is strange for a sci-fi story. Later, after I watched it again I realized the mystery of the mist. It is the story about us, our history and our lives. At least I found significant similarities. The story is a stream of mostly but not totally painful challenging and frustrating events. The movie shows the hostility among people when it comes to survival and competition which destroys the opportunities for improvement in a little briefed and newly formed society, This is just like the history of our kind, wars, religious differences and competitions. However, the mist also shows the hope and the improvement that, nevertheless, survives either by chance or through reasoning. This is illustrating the efforts which makes life better just the same way. Finally, a bitter sweet ending is presented, again, just like life. It is a survival story for the whole mankind from their mistakes which is presented through the eyes of the victims.It is a very powerful work and a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unusual horror but great one,"Darabont-King cooperation has proven successful many times so far, and this is still the case. Horror presented from two perspectives, I liked it a lot. Although there are various monsters in the film that attack and kill people, there is not so much emphasis on them. True, there are a few such scenes that are bloody, but most of the film does not contain any creatures. The other side of the horror is shown through the relationships of people who suddenly found themselves in a difficult situation. Of course, the biggest impression is left by the very ending of the film, which is etched in my memory and which I will probably never forget.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Misty for a better ending.,"The Mist is about a bunch of people trapped inside a store because of a suspicion that something outside, in the form of a mysterious mist or fog, might be killing people. Well I like the weird and so I thought the idea was interesting. Didn't like the ending though. And I like kids BUT they can be very annoying and/or distracting in some movies. One of the most annoying child in a movie of recent times (I think) is the little girl in War of the Worlds with Tom Cruze with her constant chattering, nagging, bitching, and need for reassurance. Not only did Cruze have to contend with aliens, he also had his hands filled with this obnoxious brat AND her brother.Ahhh, good to get that off my chest.Now where was I? Most of the time kids do well in films but there's the occasional one where you wish they weren't there. In the mist the main character has a son whose absence, I thought, would have served this movie better. Why? Because he had to spend too much time reassuring him and being a ""daddy"" -I guess- when I wanted the story to move along and deal with what mattered: the mysterious mist and how the ""grown-ups"" were handling the situation. The kid was an unnecessary distraction that the movie could have done without. Another thing that annoyed me was that nutty religious woman. Made me wish I was there with a two by four (oh yeah, I'd put an early end to that nonsense).The mist was yet another good idea that could have used better execution. Still, it was interesting enough with good effects to warrant 6 stars from me. Without the kid and that nutty woman I would have given it one more. And without that unsatisfactory ending I would have given it yet another. All said and done, quite probable that you'll enjoy this more than I unless you share my aversion for distracting daddy time and ranting religious nuts. Love, Boloxxxi.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Brilliant but sad and depressing ending,"I watched this movie yrs ago around when the first episode of The Walking Dead premiered. The first two Seasons were run by Frank Darabont who was also the leading producer of this movie. Therefore you will see some familiar faces in both shows, e.g. Laurie Holden, Melissa McBride ans Jeffery DeMunn. Denise Huth and Greg Nicotero who co-produced The Walking Dead also were part of the crew team. Unlike other horror movies which dial in by presenting you a lot of tourturing scenes, sex, gore and violence elements. This movie gives you more details about how people we live with everyday deal with disasters and apocalypses, which is very similar to the plots that The Walking Dead, 28 Days/Weeks Later and The Last of Us have. Our characters are trapped in a supermarket when there is a mysterious mist engulfs the entire town, bringing along bloodthirsty creatures that devour anyone in their sights. The movie isn't really scary compared to other movies I have watched so far. But what makes it brilliant is that the true fact that it tries to deliver: how weak and volunerable people are when facing uncertainties. People are easily to be scared and they will do silly things when they are panic. They'd rather fight among themselves than figure out what real problems are. Like Frank Darabont says in the audio commentary: people are the real problems, the most scary part of our lives is that you don't know who you live with.The ending is very controversial, some people believe it's very shocking and devastating and some people believe that it fits the reality (people are easily to be frightened and they are easy to give up). Frank was asked by his friends to change the ending but he refused. I personally believe the ending we have is the best because it indeed reflects the fact that instead of trying to overcome, people are frightened by uncertainties so therefore they do silly things. The ending is perfect, not only it reflects the fact, but also the background music and the acting of Tomas Jane are so brilliant.This is a low-budgeted firm (similar to Season 2 of The Walking Dead), so a lot of scenes you see in the movie are actually made by the special effect team, e.g. The earthquake, the creatures, and the army in the end. Although it's a ""cheap"" film, it's not ""cheap"" in its plot and storyline.",,Anonymous,Horror
Very disappointing,"I was so very disappointed in the ending to this movie. The Mist has been one of my very favorite Stephen King stories for ages and I even have the audiotape which is excellent. The ending in the movie was totally contrary to the original story. Why would David give up hope at a time that didn't even seem to be completely hopeless yet after showing such bravery for the first 80% of the movie? Drivel!! And it was especially disappointing since the rest of the movie was so excellent. I think it shows how bleak our society has become since the original story was written. Heroes are needed but they must be heroes to the end, and not every story must have a definite end. What was wrong with the original ending?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
You will learn whether dead can dance,"This is one of the best motion pictures, based on a Stephen King book. In fact, I never understood why King's movies are so horrendously screen-written, but this is a refreshing exception.
Anyhow, this movie is about an unwanted alien invasion, but in real, it is about us, humans. This is a pure human drama put in a scifi settings, and we will learn a lot about how stupid human are. Oh yes, this movie is about the swamp monster of the human soul, with incredibly good acting, super scripts, and some brutal syfy vision. Tension, gore, and horror of the human soul.

Claustrophobic non horror type yet entertaining,"Beloved film by novelist Stephen King's adaptation. The Mist has certainly a wholesome and claustrophobic horror where it isn't exactly a horror film to the same degree but more so a mobster mystery film. Nothing is really scary but there are some jump scares only from the monsters (not major but minor to a degree). This is quite an ensemble film with a group of people trapped in a supermarket.We immediately could see who are the likeable characters, and who are the ones not to like. Mainly the religious woman which her intent was to make people dislike her due to her religious preaching.There wasn't exactly an explanation of how these monsters (the tentacle creatures near the beginning as well as the giant insect monsters) came about and where they came from. The explanation of the overall mist/ fog wasn't too clear either.Its ending was rather bizarre and ""gut wrenching"" but was certainly unpredictable. Overall, the film is certainly entertaining and although it isn't exactly scary or completely mysterious, there is a certain watchable factor where we want to see things unfold.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sometimes humans are scarier than blood-thirsty aliens,"""The Mist"" is a terrifying portrayal of how humans react to extreme pressure, especially the supernatural kind, while trapped in an enclosed space together. This is a fantastic film adaptation of the short horror novel by Stephen King, which parallels the book's events almost from beginning to end. It emulates the panic, paranoia, and ""sheep-like"" nature of humans under heavy duress, all while providing some gory creature thrills.It's effectively made, for the most part. With a relatively basic plot, the film is able to intensify scenes without the audience needing to worry about ""plot holes"" or missing anything in the story. Scenes can be quite intense, with no actor or actress delivering a sub-par performance.One could assume before viewing, that the film is mostly about the other-wordly threat outside of the market in which everybody is trapped. This is not true. The characters obviously never fully understand the entire nature of the horrors in the mist, and since humans tend to fear that which they do not understand, and react irrationally against that which they fear, violence and chaos develops within the group of characters and only magnifies the terror.Unfortunately, even for its time there is an abundance of CGI, mostly of a poor quality. The film would hold up a lot better, especially for future audiences, if they used more practical special effects, as the CGI can be rather distracting at times, taking the audience out of the moment.Overall, it's one of the best creature horrors made within the last few decades, and dives well into the human psyche to provide excellent tension during scenes of monsters, whether alien or human.As a side note for anyone who may be worried about any possible anti-theistic themes, the film is NOT anti-religious. Religion is a common theme in stories by Stephen King, especially manipulative religious zealots, and he uses it in his stories not to attack religion or religious folk in any way, but to create social tension.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Bunch of scary monsters show up and let me tell you something...the most of them are copy from the Half life game. Animation is perfect. Acting is also top notch. But the story progressed into something bizarre. The reactions of people are somewhat too irrational to say the least.

Its a Mist-ery,"Comparisons to John Carpenter's The Fog are inevitable when dealing with any spooky weather condition the difference is in the fact that this film was made in a world post 911. Because even though we know its monsters it is always hinted at that it could be in fact a terrorist attack, but its not I assure you, it's something much worse. The trouble with horror films is there are just so many of them and not a week goes by that your local cinema isn't showing a group of bikini clad teenagers in constant peril. The difference with The Mist is that it isn't beautiful collage graduates on a jaunt that are in trouble here its ordinary everyday folk like you and me. Its really young kids and old folks and dads and shop keepers all thrust together in very powerful and frightening situation and just like that fateful New York day they are going to have to work together to survive. Based on the writing of Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont 'The Mist' rolls in and with it quite nasty lovecraftian gribblies that by chance or not do look incredibly similar to those of another big hit film set in New York. The cast of relatively unknowns here do a great job of steering the films action and pace, the CGI is good and the ending will blow your mind. The Mist bases a great deal of its horror on suspense and the unknown like Blair Witch or The Orphanage before it and it is a throw back to the horror of the 1950 end of the world scenarios (so much so that the American DVD release contains a black and white version of the film).

There IS something in the mist... a great Adaptation,"I read about this movie release a while ago back in early 2007 and anticipated the UK cinema release. Now, either I missed it, was asleep or got taken to another planet, I don't ever recall seeing this released at the local multiplex. In fact I don't remember seeing it released anywhere at all. So, time passes by and a friend of mine lets me know that ""The Mist"" is available on Region 1 DVD. So, being a Darabont fan I jumped at the chance to buy it.Firstly I have to say that this is probably one of the better screenplay adaptations of a Stephen King story. The Characters are nicely developed and even though you are not party to the background of each one, you still feel like you know them. Perhaps because they resemble people you already know or have met. The strength of ""The mist"" comes from the way things are revealed. Bit by bit. You almost feel as if you are a third person, trapped with all of them in the convenience store. You want to know more about the mist and when you do you just end up salivating for the next morsel.Secondly Frank's interpretation of the short story is very well done. The camera-work is awesome, using a hand-held technique similar to 24. All in all this was a good 2 hours spent in-front of the TV.Like most of the comments on here I have to say that the ending left me with a horrid empty feeling. I felt there was no real closure to the story and part of me wanted to see what was going to happen next. Alas this will never be.Good movie.

Barely Adequate Sci-Fi Horror,"What you have here is an old-fashioned survival horror movie in which ordinary citizens are pitted against giant squishy things from who knows where. A spooky mist rolls into town on an otherwise pleasant afternoon, and from it emerge tentacled horrors, trapping about 20 Mainers and vacationing summer people in a small supermarket. From there, they struggle, and that's the plot in a nutshell.Because it's based rather faithfully on a Stephen King novella, at least as much emphasis is placed on interpersonal character dynamics as on the bug nasties from dimension 7. Unfortunately, however, none of it rings true. Everything about the film feels stagy and two-dimensional. This is probably the fault of director Frank Darabont, who never met a treacly character cliché he couldn't embrace fully. Meanwhile the invading beasties, while reasonably cool, aren't ever particularly frightening. Darabont is more concerned with mildly thrilling sci-fi action than with building suspense or delivering raw horror. Only in the film's final moments, when the true, Lovecraftian scale of the threat is finally revealed, do we really get a taste of anything genuinely dreadful.Overall, The Mist feels, more than anything else, like a better-than-average Sci-Fi channel production. You get the same blocky staging, unconvincing sets and obvious exposition. The same cardboard characters running through their cardboard histrionics. The same hokey digital monsters (though, admittedly, executed on a bigger budget than cable TV could ever manage). The only really interesting thing about the movie was the amount of time spent on a subplot involving a messianic crazy woman and her destabilizing effect on our intrepid little band of would-be survivors. This subplot, unfortunately, plays out in just as ham-fisted and obvious a manner as the rest of the film, so what might have been a neat little philosophical puzzle is flattened into a shrill, anti-Christian tirade.Despite it's many failings, The Mist's ending is its greatest sin. I'd have been perfectly happy if it had ended where King's story did, with our doomed heroes simply riding off into an unknown but unpromising future. Darabont, however, decided to wrap things up in a decidedly grim and Serling-esquire manner. I found the ""shocking"" conclusion insultingly overstated, out of character and borderline senseless.1/10, but there is one fantastic effects shot towards the end (you'll know it when you see it).",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A memorable, suspenseful horror with an distressing ending that stays and left me horrified - it affected my very being.","Acting: Well played by all, with no noticeably weak performers. Standout actors are the nut case fundamentalist 'Christian' woman, Toby Jones and the atheist man suddenly turned to God.Pacing: Pretty tight, with fade outs to black in between each of the scenes give it a reflective effect. The novella I've never read, but the script has it's few witty, laugh-out-loud lines amidst the horror. It delivers real, genuine jumps and scares and parts I was very squeamish in. This, in my opinion, is what in terms of horror, Cloverfield looks up to and admires, but can never be half as good as. That hyped up monster film only wishes it was this effective and more. A sort of Lord Of The Flies in a small town supermarket, as a makeshift fort against the terrors lurking outside and what happens as people seem to follow things and what one particular woman says that they normally wouldn't give time of day to. As said in the film, people can do abnormal things if you scare them enoughCinematography: Well, the special effects were very good. The weird large insects and mysterious tentacles did scare and unsettle me so they did they job effectively, where other means couldn't have been used. Gory deaths  one particular one happens more off screen are chilling. The Mist itself has a foreboding power to it that's is captured well on film  that uncertainty of what's a few feet in front of a person is well realised. It rakes up tension with expertise.Music: I think their were these apocalyptic type choir songs nearer the end that were very good and the score is probably my stand out this year, just in terms of how it really adds to the film and more.Overall: I was frozen in my screening seat with an expression of horror-struck unbelievably and I'm sure I looked very worried  I couldn't move for some moments. It is hard to explain but I couldn't cry cause it was if all my emotion was sucked out of me and I could only stare into space. It is simply the most depressing ending I've seen so far since Requiem For A Dream & When The Wind Blows  no, actually it's worse that both of those. Talk about feeling like all hope in the world is lost and left in despair. All good memories are gone for those moments walking home to catch my bus, and I felt empty. Both religion and science are questioned - I think it's more about obvious worries shown about fundamentalist cults and the dangers unhinged members can pose on the rest of a venerable society as well as the consequences of science experimenting and exploring into unknown realms. It's a powerful film, that leaves me with inner-moral questions and just delivers on the level of scares and horror. Good characterisation, plot and some brilliant turns from the actors really put a lasting effect in my mind. Even if this lacks the feel goodness Shawshank had, it's in ways more powerful. I've never felt so bad and bleak emotionally after seeing any film this year, so kudos to Darabont for staying with this thoroughly dark conclusion to another of his King's adaptations",,Anonymous,Horror
Not an ordinary monster movie... And with even cast,"Usually, I am not a big fan of Stephen King's works as they are too much focused on changes in people's minds - I tend to prefer fight with expressed evil. The Mist combines the two elements in a gifted manner: there are both evil creatures, and ordinary people whose minds are affected by tensions, uncertainty and ignorance. Moreover, Mrs. Carmody's character (splendidly performed by Marcia Gay Harden) demonstrates the consequences of any religious fanaticism combined with strong persuasion skills. Generally, the real horror here lies in the unpredictability of human mind and behavior.As for the cast, it is evenly strong, the absence of A-category actors makes all the supporting roles evenly watchable and important (Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden, Toby Jones, David Jensen, Nathan Gamble, above all). The leading character David Drayton (performed by Thomas Jane) seems less credible to me - painters / poster artists have usually no arrangement or commanding skills and do not become heroes in a short time.Nevertheless, it is a good horror movie.

Without having to rely on jumps and gore, The Mist creates a reminder of the tension that horror movies used to be so good at.While the characters are likable and the dialogue isn't heavy with undertones, the simple idea that the monsters outside, can become the monsters inside you, is one I can get on-board with.The main players, Thomas Jane and Laurie Holden are generous and do not try to steal the screen away from excellent supporting actors such as William Sadler, Jeffery DeMunn and Frances Sternhagen. Performances across the board were generally compelling to watch, at no point did I ever think; that guy was better in _______ film. The rawness of the film made it feel more like we were watching a snippet or real life. No matter how extraordinary the circumstances.Some die-hard fans of the novella, may be unhappy with some of the directors choices, but overall, I felt it was an excellent way of spending two hours.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ending sorta ruined it,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good stephen king adaptation, and a good film, but the ending of this film was unnecessarily tragic, as opposed to the original king ending which seems somewhat optimistic and hopeful. all in all a solid horror film with copious amounts of gore, bloodshed, and suspense. it's beyond me why directors tamper with king's stories (the ending to this film deviates from the original almost as much as kubrick's butchered ending to the shining), and while this revamped ending is still satisfactory, something should be said for keeping stephen king's original vision intact when translating his storytelling to the screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A bold and powerful horror film, a must for King fans!","Over the years Stephen King's shorter works (his short stories and novellas) haven't always made for the best big screen adaptations. Recently however King's works have been done some good justice (this year's 1408 being a fine addition) and now this stunning film version of King's novella The Mist, which may just be the best and brightest King-based film in many a day.Following a violent storm, several residence of a small Maine town head off to the local grocery market where they find themselves trapped by a massive cloud of mist. As fear and paranoid grow among the locals it soon becomes evident that monstrous creatures lurk outside, but that's not the only threat.The Mist is one fantastic tale of unknown terrors and human evil. Director-screen writer Frank Darabont does an excellent job of capturing the chilling effectiveness of the novella. Not only is the film pretty faithful to the original story, it also adds some effective elements of it's own, such as a jaw dropping conclusion to what was originally an open-ended story. The creature FX are gruesomely well done, the suspense and claustrophobia are quite intense, and Darabont's documentary-type camera work makes the film all the more realistic. There's also some great doses of sweat-inducing action to be had. Adding even more to the story are the well-drawn and heart felt characters, which make the film's bold climax all the more powerful.The cast is quite good. Thomas Jane is endearing as our unfortunate hero, Marcia Gay Harden is a chilling villain as the religious fanatic, and Laurie Holden is solid as a new-comer to town. Toby Jones, William Sadler, Frances Sternhagen, and young Nathan Gamble round out a great supporting cast.All around The Mist is a fine horror film. It isn't a schlocky, clichéd, or pretentious popcorn scare fest, but an intelligent and deadly serious journey that possesses far more than just gore and shock. It has genuine depth and that alone puts it above most modern genre movies.**** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I was afraid. More than that - I despaired. More than that - I regretted,"Well, this movie first scared the guts out of me, then topped it with despair and when I thought it won't get any further it gave me the worst - regret of things that might have been done and haven't been, or things that should not have been done but were nevertheless, done. I was glued to the screen all the same, almost wishing I had the will to scratch myself off and stop watching it, stop it right now, and go have some hot tea or maybe something hotter for my nerves. Especially at the time of night I was watching it. The very fact I'm writing this at the moment (and I got out of bed an turned on the PC to get to IMDb and get some more info on what this all was about) speaks of the effect it had on me.Despite and in spite, or maybe for the very reason I'm quite out of age horror movies are supposed to be scaring people, I admit I was. Quality make (even though I doubt I'll watch it another time - for the very reason the summary relates of, and I won't look for the book it was made after either. Or maybe I will, but not too soon. Nah, surely I will, first thing tomorrow :D).Stephen King at his best, and the movie matched it, screenplay, direction, actor work et al. - all in its place, no exaggerations, no heavy stress on computer graphics, and here and there catchy little details, like mark of a blooded hand just by the sign 'out' with an arrow on the glass door. Top notch!This movie is capable of getting inside one's head and doing things in there - 10 out of 10, from the man not in love with the genre very rarely stopping by the shelf with the label 'horror' on it at all",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Kind of Excellence You Should Expect,"Yet another King/Darabont collaboration. If you've seen the trailers, then you know the premise. A mist encompasses a small Maine town containing hordes of unknown, man-eating beasties. We follow a supermarket full of people as they try to deal with the situation. That's all the set-up you need.This is the best film in theatres that no one is talking about. After having been out for three weekends, it has yet to crack the top 5 in the US box office. Amateur and professional critics alike are undeservedly pegging this film as a monster movie. Yes, there are monsters in this movie, but this bill of fare is not simply cheap schlock. There is much more going on here than cheap scares and flesh-ripping gore, and from what I can tell, that seems to be the biggest complaint.""The monsters aren't scary enough,"" ""The special effects don't look good."" ""I didn't like the ending, it's depressing.""That's the difference between this film and the bubble-gum horror that audiences have been subject to and come to expect from the genre for far too long. This movie isn't about the gore, it doesn't need cheap scares and squirms to frighten the audience. This isn't Saw. It doesn't need hyper-realistic CGI monsters to be frightening. That isn't what is supposed to scare you. It's fluff.This movie is about the demons within mankind. Sure that sounds trite and at times it is, but that doesn't negate the fact that it's still a true and effective theme in literature and film. This movie is about what fear can do to the Average Joe when there is no one to enforce the rule of law. This movie is Lord of the Flies in a supermarket with a backdrop of Lovecraftian paranormality. That's why it's so effective. You could change the venue and the outside threat and this story would remain as poignant and powerful as ever. This is the kind of social commentary that is especially pervasive and effective in this genre of film and literature. This story ranks with Planet of the Apes and Fahrenheit 451 and I think it will be remembered with a similar fondness for a long time to come.Forget the imaginary monsters on the outside. Be scared of the very real monsters on the inside.This is the best new film I've seen in years. Go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Mist,"The Mist is based on a short story by Stephen King. Written and adapted by Frank Darabont.There is no prison in this movie. It does have people trapped inside a supermarket, which might as well be a prison.Set in a small coastal town. A strange mist traps people inside a supermarket. Especially when a man rushes in claiming that the mist is deadly.Inside the shroud of moving white cloud are monsters. The first one has large tentacles, as it grabs one poor supermarket worker.David Drayton (Thomas Jane) just wants to keep his young son safe and the lives of others. He is helped by supermarket employee Ollie Weeks (Toby Jones.)Others are more abrasive. Mrs Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) has been long recognised as a religious nutcase. Now she tells people this is the sign of the apocalypse.As the monsters multiply, even getting into the store. She soon acquires zealous converts, now looking for a sacrifice to appease the monsters or God.The film plays on usual King themes. Demagogues, weak bullies, selfless people. How society can quickly break down when faced with adversity. Just like Lord of the Flies.I mean his characterisation of the presidential wannabee played by Martin Sheen in The Dead Zone was ahead of its time.Darabont goes bleak for the ending and then pulls the rug. I wondered if he wanted something that matched conceptually the original Planet of the Apes.It is a divisive ending and I think Darabont could had made the movie shorter. Even as a horror film it is thoughtful enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Humanity Lost In The Mist,"Frank Darabont's surprisingly layered science fiction horror film 'The Mist' is one of the most impressive of its in recent times. Now I say surprising because most of the film adaptations that I have seen of King's novels haven't translated well on screen (with the exception of a few like 'Christine').Grabbing the viewer's attention from the very beginning, 'The Mist' starts off as a tribute to the many cult classic monster flicks. An unidentified object threatens a small town who keep themselves locked in a supermarket. As the object reveals itself, panic builds. Many of the characters are clichéd caricatures that one has so often witnessed in the cult classics. As the monster begins to show itself and the characters and as entertaining as the movie is, I thought it would be just another monster attacks the city flick. But just at that moment 'The Mist' plunges into new and deeper depths.I think one reason why this movie received so little recognition is because it gave the impression of being just another typical genre film. It's a shame that this wasn't given much of a chance because it raises some profound questions about humanity that one would rather ignore than confront. After the final scene, one is left with an unsettling feeling as it has one of the most depressing (but least predictable) endings (and I couldn't think of a better one as a happy ending would have been less impactive).The only flip side was theme of religion. The Marcia Gay Harden track is obviously crucial and raises issues that are parallel to today's world conflicts especially religious fanaticism. However, it also gives the impression that all religious people feel that way or a vulnerable to such manipulation. I wish there was some focus on at least one religious character who opposed Mrs. Carmody's ways. There is only one sentence with a biker where he delivers a line to Mrs. Carmody...and is then disposed of. What I'm saying is that I would have liked to see some conflict within the religious context and point out why being religious isn't a bad thing and that fanaticism is.I'll stop here as the issues the film raises are best discovered by the viewer. Now, on the technical side, 'The Mist' is exceptionally well made. While some argue that the special effects weren't anything amazing amazing, I couldn't disagree more. The film is a tribute and thus it isn't meant to look like another 'Avatar' but even otherwise, I thought it looked very good. The cinematography is remarkable and the minimal use of a background score is very effective. Darabont highly succeeds in creating an atmosphere of danger, fear, isolation and despair.All the actors perform superbly. Even those who were given roles that are clichés, play them well and succeed in evoking frustration. But of course, the ones that shine are Thomas Jane (as the dad in despair), Laurie Holden (this kind of cinema isn't anything new to her- cough cough - 'The X Files', 'Silent Hills' and now 'The Living Dead'), Marcia Gay Harden (see for yourself to know what I mean) and Toby Jones (the mediator).Don't be fooled by the trailer, the premise or poster. 'The Mist' is far more than what one would expect it to be. It won't bring a smile to your face after the hopeless final scene following the rolling closing credits, but you'll have had the experience of something much better than what this genre of films usually has to offer.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Great effects, so so acting","Many will like this movie for its special effects and shear scare factor. But acting by Thomas Jane was questionable. Good at points, in his more crucial scenes, where he has to really emote deep grief, he tries but ends up straining at the bit. In fact he tries so hard that it comes off too strained. Marcia Gay Harden does a convincing role as a crazy religious fanatic, so good that you will end up hating her character. The little boy and the majority of the other actors do a great job, but where the rubber meets the road, on Thomas Jane's broad shoulders, it melts and flops. He is convincing for the strong parts but his deeper emotional value is not there, and this is crucial for the impact of the movie; especially at the end. Although you will probably get shaking by the effects and the out of the box thinking of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
'THE MIST' REVIEW FROM deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com,"VISIT deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com FOR MORE REVIEWS It has taken eight months for 'The Mist' to descend onto British cinema screens since it debuted in America last November, and has already made it onto DVD stateside. So why have we been made to wait so long? Well it's fair to say that the US audience didn't really take to Frank Darabont's latest Stephen King adaptation, grossing only $25million, our friends across the pond struggling with it's downbeat ending. The final scene is, well, it's not the cheeriest...in fact it may be one of the most heartbreaking, depressing and downright bleakest endings to a film in recent years. But don't let that put you off, after all, this is a horror movie, you wouldn't expect it to leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside.Darabont's previous takes on King novels have included 'The Green Mile' and 'The Shawshank Redemption', not a bad track record. He saturated both of those pieces with an overriding sense of hope, 'The Mist' chews up that hope and spits back a cocktail of pessimism and despair. The film follows David Drayton (Thomas Jayne) and his young son Billy (Nathan Gamble) who are trapped in a local supermarket alongside members of their small-town community, when the titular mist surrounds the store. All matter of horrible creatures, great and small, begin to emerge from the mist in true B-movie style, the threat of the monsters becoming more real and more terrifying with each confrontation.Trapped, afraid and confused, the shoppers wander towards 'Lord of the Flies' territory as human nature's less favourable aspects come to the fore and we are forced to ask ourselves: Is the greater danger posed by the beasts outside, or the beasts within? Granted this is not the first time that this avenue has been explored, but when done as well as it is here, it rarely fails to raise many important issues and questions about the darker side of the human condition. This is personified by the deeply religious Mrs Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), her fundamentalist beliefs and crazed rants slowly but surely gain her supporters amongst the wayward flock of shoppers. At times you may question such a deranged character but Harden's portrayal is fantastically intense nonetheless.Such patent digs at organised religion however and exceptionally thinly-veiled digs at the Bush administration that are peppered throughout the script are shortcomings that needlessly divert attention away from a gripping horror story that otherwise rarely relents in pace and terror. There seems little need for such subtext and the lack of subtlety in it's deliverance at times grows thoroughly exasperating. Apart from that the film excels and you can barely believe that it was received so badly by the US public. Sorry America, but you got it badly wrong on this occasion. The final five minutes are worth the extra eight-month wait alone, let's hope that we can show it the appreciation that it deserves.Verdict: A fantastic example of mainstream horror on a smaller budget and the latest on the ever-growing list of successful Stephen King big-screen adaptations.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great concept,"Love the story concept, the really irritating thing, was how stupid the characters were, how unrealistic their reactions.That's what spoils the story, the moronic characters and their mornoic reactions, combined with how quickly they all turn into morons.Despite this, you can't stop watching, despite the ridiculous disbelief and general crazy reactions, of people trapped in a supermarket by 'the mist'.The ending is particularly stupid, people don't just give up..This is a watchable film, 6.5/10 but the irritation with the characters makes it very unsatisfying, with a lot of eye rolling.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing story; unforgettable ending!,"""The Mist"" is more about human psychology than about monsters or aliens. Some of the graphics did seem B-grade, but the plot simply keeps you hooked on.In many ways it is more interesting/disgusting (in an embarrassed) way to watch how even grown ups will react when put in real tight situations.The fact that most of the movie is done in a local grocery store with little or no background music only adds to the eerie and lifelike atmosphere.A part of the ending was guess-able, but the other wasn't and in many ways was indigestible.

Gut-wrenching horror--one of the best of recent years.,"BING-O! After sitting through some mediocre Stephen King adaptations this month, I wasn't expecting much from this. Well, holey dooley! ""The Mist"" is easily my favorite movie of the year, and maybe my favorite horror of the 00's. I cannot remember the last time I left a movie theater feeling so depressed, emotionally exhausted, and just plain drained (127 minutes long!) because I was so invested in the movie I was watching--and a horror movie to boot! ""The Mist"" is R-rated horror for grown-ups: no shaky came here, no annoying teen TV stars, no bad dialogue, and no obnoxious music. At the half hour point, I was turned off by some Sci-Fi channel caliber CGI and I wasn't sure I was going to like where the movie was headed. But it was only uphill from there. I wish that scene was shot differently, but the FX throughout the rest of the movie were impressive and really it's just a perfect horror apart from that. Thomas Jane is flippin' awesome as always, but Marcia Gay Harden is the real star here. She takes a role that anyone else would turn into an irritating caricature and she NAILS it. It's really one of the most brilliant genre performances I've seen in a long time. Too bad ""The Mist"" appears to be a bomb at the box office. It could have set a precedent for well-written and mature scary movies filling our multiplexes. Oh well. It'll be a cult classic in a few years time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
So depressing,Honestly the most depressing film I have ever seen,,Anonymous,Horror
"THE MIST (Frank Darabont, 2007) ***","Of the 108 Stephen King adaptations for film or TV, I am only familiar with a handful of them – 16 to be exact (counting also the film under review). Frank Darabont joins a list of remarkable past alumni (Brian De Palma, Stanley Kubrick, David Cronenberg, John Carpenter) with this well-crafted monster movie with pretensions. Actually, Darabont is no newcomer to Stephen King territory – having already based three of his four feature-length movies on his work! – but this is the first movie I’ve seen from the director and, perhaps significantly, the only one of the three which is horror-related.Frankly, I wasn’t even aware of the film at all before reviews of its DVD release started cropping up on the Internet. As far as I can recall, it has not yet been released theatrically over here but, perhaps the name Stephen King (because of rampant overexposure over the years) nowadays no longer enjoys the same crowd-pulling effect as it did during his heyday. Still, judging by that modest crowd of actors assembled for the film and its clearly intentional “realism” (read a flat, made-for-TV look and relatively restrained gore), the film-makers hardly endeavored to boost its box-office chances any. Besides, we have lately been literally invaded by monster/alien movies so that it isn’t hard for one (even as solid as this one is) to get lost in the shuffle.A small seaside American town wakes up one morning to find itself enveloped in a mysterious cloud of thick mist. Soon enough, it becomes abundantly evident that this houses a barrage of slimy, unnaturally-enlarged and very deadly creatures of the bugs variety. To this tried-and-tested formula, Darabont and King add other much-used elements (religious fanaticism, military incompetence, scientific experimentation, impending apolcalypse, etc.) but take them beyond their bleakest and most ironic possibilities. The last half-hour, in fact, is where the film gets all choked up in message-mongering – complete with an overwhelmingly melancholic score which seemed more appropriate accompaniment to a depiction of Christ’s Cruxifiction (or something heavy and solemn like that). Indeed, learning that Darabont has even “presented” his own original black-and-white vision (as opposed to version) of this film on DVD only adds smoke to the fiery theory that this was intended from the start to be much more than a mere monster movie. Despite good work all around and the best intentions, THE BIRDS (1963), it certainly ain’t...Anyhow, the festering tensions between the diverse factions trapped (for most of the film) inside a supermarket and the inherent suspense present in the group’s generally unsuccessful excursions on the “outside” are skillfully handled and, despite the anonymity of the actors involved, some of the townspeople are blessed with full-blooded characterizations, most prominently Marcia Gay Harden (as the unbalanced, ultra-religious spinster who, after being derided for the longest time, manages to whip the crowd into a veritable frenzy when things start to go very badly for the heroic few) and William Sadler (as a bigoted redneck who cracks up after having a close encounter with the bugs and witnessing the extensiveness of their devastation).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
You can't convince some people there's a fire even when their hair is burning. Denial is a powerful thing.,"Residents of a small Maine town become trapped in the local supermarket when an otherworldly mist brings deadly creatures in full attack mode. That's not the only problem, for two groups form inside the market, one in favour of escaping, the other for expiation!As is the norm, King adaptations vary in quality and divisive fan appraisals, so with ""The Mist"" on screen not exactly setting the box office alight, and it even getting delayed releases in Europe, one would think this is one of the lesser King adapted lights? Not so! In fact, it is now proving to have a longevity of worth in horror fan circles. So much so, that the great horror writer at the literary source gives it the full thumbs up whilst giving the ""changed"" ending his full pat on the back approval.Frank Darabont (director and adaptive writer) is of course the man who previously took King's more human interest stories and crafted much beloved movies out of them, so why was he in the chair to direct a film about alien creatures unleashing bloody dread on small town Americana? Well the answer is why ""The Mist"" is such a cunningly chilly delight. For this not only features monstrous creatures straight out of a Lovecraft/Barker nightmare, but also the monsters of the human kind, where the venality of the human condition is laid bare under duress - and it is frightening.The alien creatures themselves creep the flesh, ok the effects work sometimes sags under the scrutiny of ""HD"" viewings, but this is nightmarish stuff, none more so than with a quite brilliant and terrifying sequence of events in a pharmacy. Yet it's the human monsters within the supermarket that usurps our creature invaders, where religious fervour and man's propensity for survival comes crashing together for dynamic results - the cast utterly in tune with the material and delivering quality portrayals.Once the human battles within dissipates, and we come to the resolutions and reasonings of what has caused the creature invasion (hello subtext), we arrive at the much talked about finale. It actually deserves to be divisive, for we don't want yet another horror film finale that has people shrugging their respective shoulders and saying ""fair enough, but is that it?"". If you buy into the all round bleak tonalities that the pic has been serving throughout, then this ending hits all the right buttons. For sure, this is no easy cop out to send you home with a smile on your face, it's brutal, and crucially it's befitting the word of the genre it sits in - horror! 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Set in Maine, what a surprise","I haven't read the original novella by King. One of the few people who seems able to make the authors stuff work well on screen without dramatically altering it is Darabont, and for how much this is essentially a gross-out B-movie with monsters, he largely does do pretty well. Stephen is the literary equivalent to fast food; he even admits so, himself. Why he is so celebrated is an enigma I don't expect to find the answer to. Hey; this manages an isolation, ""we're trapped!"" kind of thing, and it does so without losing our attention. That deserves, nay, *demands*, props. There are a couple of good, fleshed out characters. It strives to show truths about humanity, though its chance at doing so gradually fades away in the face of the shrill tone of the sides in conflict. Not to mention the audience's exposure to an intolerable religious nut, who'll frustrate atheists and believers(well, Christian ones, at least) alike. The acting varies, particularly that of the kid, who goes back and forth between being natural and lacking credibility. Jane carries it nicely, and those that are given a lot to do usually live up to the challenge. This provides jump scares and a couple of exciting bits, and there is some decent tension here and there. The quality of the FX ranges, and the integration of CGI elements with live-action is hit and miss, too. Designs aren't bad, though obviously not everyone will consider these creatures to be intimidating(I didn't, to be honest). There is plenty of bloody, gory violence, a lot of disturbing content and infrequent strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of the writer. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The plot of the movie was very interesting, mysterious and kinda innovative. The storyline was very well-written, well-explained and easy to understand. The characters were interesting and well-developed, but only some of them were likeable. The filming location of the movie was only one, just a huge store. Also, the casting choices were great and their performances were excellent. I have to admit, it wasn't a scary movie and there weren't any jumpscares.

standard monster movie with a slightly elevated tone,"Essentially an unaccredited remake of John Carpenter's ""The Fog,"" ""The Mist"" is a 50's style B-monster-movie done with 21st Century special effects. It's the oldie about a group of random strangers trapped in an enclosed space - in this case, a local supermarket - while some unknown threat lurks in the world outside. But because it's based on a Stephen King novella, it comes with a veneer of deep-think philosophizing to make it seem better than it actually is.It all begins when a strange mist rolls into a small New England town, harboring within it a menace of an indescribable and deadly nature. Local artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is the requisite everyman character who becomes the agreed-upon leader who helps the people trapped in the store cope with the crisis.For the most part, this is standard-issue stuff, with each of the stock characters falling into his or her assigned role - be it the soon-to-be-proved-wrong skeptic, the soon-to-be-cut-down-to-size (in some cases, quite literally) big-mouth braggart, and the curled-up-in-a-fetal-position quivering jellyfish, among others. Heck, there's even an annoying scripture-spouting end-of-days religious fanatic (deliciously played by an over-the-top Marcia Gay Harden) who gets on everyone's last nerve, and who is really just the crazy ornithologist and her drunken detractor from the diner scene in ""The Birds"" rolled into one and then writ large.The first half of the movie is filled with people doing and saying some truly unlikely and stupid things, but the second half has a bit more bite to it as it explores the ways in which desperate people will turn on one another through fear and superstition, and, in so doing, become a greater threat to their own survival and safety than the thing outside. But its bleak, oh-so-predictable ""ironic"" ending makes us pine for the days when ""The Twilight Zone"" managed to do this sort of thing on a weekly basis with a whole lot less hyperventilation and fanfare.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I feel duped by the glowing reviews,"I was expecting something pretty awesome given the overall rating and some of the reviews (I recall one saying they were shocked it didn't win an Oscar or something?).Wow... either the filmmakers paid for the 9- and 10-star reviews, or I have watched a different film than they did.On the positive side, I am giving it an extra star for the acting (otherwise it deserves 1 star). I do feel that all the actors showed up for their roles. Even the kid who plays the main character's son definitely gave it his all.On the negative side... where do I start?So many dumb decisions, so many times when the characters acted in ways no one would ever act. Ugh, I honestly don't think people are that smart in general, but they aren't as dumb as portrayed in this movie!An example: scary insect-like creatures start flying toward a window when a lamp is held up near said window... so everyone lights more lamps and holds them up to the window and shrieks in horror as more insects come and plant themselves on the window. It takes them a ridiculous amount of time to figure out these creatures are drawn to the light -- um... the way insects ALWAYS are??? Yes, these are big scary insects, but they're *definitely* insects. Literally the FIRST thing you would do is shut off all the lights so get them to stop flying toward you.There are many scenes like that, and even scenes were I felt like a terrible person because, for example, someone is set ablaze and I'm laughing out loud, because it is carried out like a Keystone Cops scene.As others have said, the ending is just awful. I had peeked at a few spoiler bits so I had an idea what was going to happen but I was not prepared for ALL of what happened. Not only was it needless torture for the viewer, but the way it was carried out was the dumbest thing ever. Without giving spoilers, it's just the MOST unreasonable part of a pretty unreasonable movie. I'm less annoyed by what the characters do than by the fact that things happen at a speed they just wouldn't happen. It's clearly only done that way so the ending has maximum impact. I would rather they added 5 more minutes to the film to give it just a TINY bit of realism than that they did it the way they did.I don't have as much problem as some others do with the characterization of the fanatical religious woman -- I mean, we have Westboro Baptist in real life, folks. I do think it's unrealistic that she'd be able to win people over to her fanatical views so quickly, and certainly the saner characters should have helped the more impressionable ones see the light with some strong arguments (everyone seemed unable to adequately communicate throughout the movie -- another gripe, as I hate when people don't just SAY something to correct misunderstandings, etc.). They did say she was ""unstable"" so I would say if you think the film is trying to portray all Christians in that light, you're too sensitive and looking for reasons to be offended.I did mostly pay attention throughout the movie and didn't fast forward, which was probably because of the acting (it definitely wasn't the plot or screenplay). Thus, that extra star.Please don't pay attention to the glowing praise, though. This one is nowhere NEAR a masterpiece (like Shawshank, for example). Not even close.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Monsters, Inside And Out...","When Stephen King's short story (aka: novella) THE MIST first came out in the early 1980's, it seemed impossible for a decent movie version to ever be made. Due to King's creatures slithering, buzzing, and towering above like walking skyscrapers, the very idea of a film was absurd.Fast-forward 20 years or so, and enter Director Frank Darabont, who, using some CGI, was able to bring the story to life. Darabont makes great use of the titular mist, hiding the horrors just as they were in the book: A claw here, a tentacle there. Just enough to get the point across that humanity is in big trouble.There's one enormous monstrosity toward the end that's nothing short of astonishing!The interaction between the humans is also perfectly realized, with King's characters dividing along the lines they've drawn around themselves. Marcia Gay Harden is particularly well-realized as the fire-breathing zealot, Mrs. Carmody, who is bent on fitting the whole dire situation into her own limited biblical view.This is a tale of building terror and dread, with an unexpected ending. One of the best screen adaptations of any Stephen King book...",,Anonymous,Horror

Stephen King's strongest and most heartbreaking work,"This is without a doubt one of the best Stephen King adaptations. There were a few changes when adapting the book, including the ending, but it is quite faithful to the novel. It has a very good script, credible performances, good special effects, the creatures are undoubtedly the best thing about the film, the plot is brutal and quite strong. It is truly captivating and seeing how the trapped people fall to the brink of madness awakens the desire that only those who remain sane are the only ones who survive. The way the film ends is brutal, making this film the most heartbreaking thing that could come from King's novels. A highly recommended science fiction film that reflects King's vision very well. My rating for this movie is a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Poor ending, but overall gory and chilling","Stephen King's 1983 short story (more of a novella, really) is pretty well realized for the big screen by Frank Darabont (The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption), although the ending might leave viewers cold, not chilled. The effects are excellent, as Hollywood strangely (and wisely!) decided to ease off the overproduced special effects for a change, and the result is that when we do see the creatures, we're suitably terrified, especially since the camera never lingers long on any of them.The basic setup is that a storm of the century has shut down the power in a small New England town, and the next morning a thick mist is rolling across the town's large lake. Dave Drayton (Thomas Jane) gathers his eight-year-old son and, accompanied by his caustic neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), heads to the supermarket to load up on groceries. When they get there, they find that pretty much everyone else in town has the same idea. And it seems like just the usual bad-weather madness until a local citizen bursts into the store, blood on his chest, screaming about how creature from the mist took his friend, and dadgum it everyone better GET INSIDE CLOSE THE DOOR AAAH THEY'RE COMING, and sure enough, as the doors are closed, the mist comes rolling in, and people stay the heck where they are.But it soon becomes apparent that this is no ordinary mist, and that old man might have been on to something - something IS out there, but the mist is so thick no one can tell what it is. And that's where the story really gets under your skin. What manner of creature is outside the store's walls? Is it faster than a man trying to get to his car? Is it small, but vicious? Or is it gigantic? Is it even benign? (No, it's not.)In other, less-deft hands, a story like this would have been a typical monster movie, as our Intrepid Hero saves the world from sure destruction. But this isn't about man versus the monster, it's about man versus the unknown - and man versus man.Almost all of the action takes place inside the supermarket. There are level-headed (but scared) people, like Dave, Amanda Dumfries (Laurie Holden), Ollie (Toby Jones), and Irene (Frances Sternhagen), and then there are the so-scared-they're-irrational people, like Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) and Jim Grondin (William Sadler), and Norton. In a lesser movie, the theme would be that all of them must work together in order to survive, but that theme isn't given a chance here, as would be the case in real life. There's no rousing speech about how everyone's in this together; people become unhinged and unwilling to listen to reason at the drop of a hat, because the unknown of the mist is too much to bear.That's where Mrs. Carmody comes in. She's a Bible-thumping fanatic of the Old Testament, and she sees the mist and its denizens as a sign from the Almighty, and as the movie progresses she becomes more and more like a seer to the easily swayed - and sees herself as a righteous martyr who will someday sit beside God. In other words, a disaster like the mist gives a kook like Mrs. Carmody the perfect opportunity to save souls, whether they want to be or not, and her zeal gives the lesser-minded individuals something they can hold on to, rather than using their minds for practical survival.Dave acts as the de facto leader of the survivors, mostly because no one else steps forward, not even the three almost-on-leave soldiers trapped in the store. But not only must he find a way to get out of the store and past the creatures, but he has to deal with the escalating insanity of Mrs. Carmody, whose rantings attract a larger and larger congregation, ending in tragedy.The only real issue I have with the movie is the ending, which differs wildly from that in King's original printed story. You would think that a Hollywood ending would be more tangible, thus giving the viewer better closure. Well, we do get some closure, but the result is that you feel like you've been kicked in the stomach. The finale is so unsatisfying, you wonder what the heck the preceding two hours were supposed to be for.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Raises the bar for King adaptations,"One of King's most famous short stories is brought to the screen with all of its terror and humanity intact. Darabont, known for the dramas - Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile - has now raised the bar for adapting King's horror stories to the big screen.The Mist is about two kinds of terror - that of the supernatural and that of the human capacity for primal regression in the face of ultimate fear. A group of small town folks trapped in a local food-mart when the mist rolls in try to survive. The terror outside, in the mist, becomes only one of the problems they face as those trapped inside turn to ""leaders"" who believe differently about what is happening. The result is an obvious homage to ""Lord of the Flies"", but suits its purpose in the horrifying landscape King creates.Darabont handles the saturating sense of dread and despair with a deftness that has been embarrassingly absent in nearly all of the previous attempts to bring King's stories to film. What's absent in The Mist are the standard clichés, thin characters, and inexplicable human behavior that are prevalent in most horror films.The script is nearly indistinguishable from the source material save for very small details, some minor modern updates (cell phones), and an added ending (the short story lacked any real ending). It works on every level for both the fans of King and those who are new.10 out of 10. Way to go Frank!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great work by Darabond from a Stephen King novel,"The Mist is a masterpiece of horror filmmaking. Hauntingly atmospheric and yet full of action, deeply thematic and with logical characters you root for. The Mist by celebrated director Frank Darabond is a testimony that a well made horror film is as good as any. Thomas Jane plays an everyday man trapped in a small town's shopping mall as their entire world is engulfed in a white mist on normal morning. Adding to the woes is that the mist contain vicious other realm creatures- the stuff of your nightmares. This is a great film and you should watch this whether you like Horror or not.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Some Annoynaces Abound, But the Movie Packs a Punch","A group of people get trapped in a grocery store after a mysterious mist rolls down from the hills after a storm. Some get scared, some turn religious and others become heroes. What caused this mist and how can anyone survive it? You'll have to watch to find out.This film contained a lot of actors who are largely unknown or have a face you might recognize but not the name. In a film that has an ""ensemble cast"" this is probably the best way to make all characters equal. Thomas Jane (""Punisher"") is the lead, and others you might recognize appear such as William Sadler (""Shawshank Redemption"", ""Demon Knight"" and the Grim Reaper from ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey""). Overall, though, these are lesser-knowns.I will give you my honest reaction to this film: I wanted to walk out on it. I really did. It had fade-in and fade-out like a TV movie, it had a large group of people in an apocalyptic setting which is such a Stephen King cliché. And when the tentacle showed up, I saw some truly awful CGI work (although it got better with the bugs... at least a little). But after the walking out feeling faded (which I haven't felt since ""Herbie Fully Loaded"") I started to think it was okay...When it was okay, I thought the idea was good and the characters were alright. I mean, all the characters were so one-dimensional (""the oppressed minority"", ""the bumbling hick"", ""the hero"", ""the religious nut"") but it worked alright. The religious lady was so over-powering that I was unsure if she was a really good actress or overdoing it. I wouldn't have written / directed it to be such a strong character, but that's just me. Again I waited, and it got better.Of course, as always, the ending must remain a secret. But that's the reason I ended up giving it a decent rating, because all the bad things about the film seem to be forgotten once the very dramatic end comes around. I expected better from the man who brought us ""Shawshank"" and ""The Green Mile"" (I mean Darabont, not King) but it was still beautiful in its own way.There isn't much more to say about the film. It's suspenseful, it has some gore (no nudity). It's not really very scary, and there's not much reason to watch it twice. I mean, it's really good, but it's nothing that screams ""movie of the year"". It's a group of people trapped together to face certain death. If you've read King or seen his movies, this is old news to you. But I recommend it for one viewing. I guess if you want to watch it again, that's your choice... I don't plan to see it again unless I get tricked into it or get paid or there's free dinner involved.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sci-Fi Horror Leaning Into Anti-Religious Themes,"This glorified creature-feature has a number of memorable sequences and imagination-stirring monstrosities that lurk within the murky mist, but behind it all is a tired theme about how the mob mentality bends to the whims of dogmatic tyrants. The ending, which I won't spoil, revels in its atheistic pessimism before its big reveal, leaving you feeling sour and dour. Good for a one-time watch, but just as meaningless in the experience of watching it, its characters, its story, and its themes, as is the philosophy of nihilism which it takes so much from.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
why Frank Darabont..?? why did you do this to me??,This is a movie which creates an impression in your mind. Once your done watching you will have it in your mind for some time. It will take a deep thinking that you have watched a movie and you have to let go it. I have to accept to agree to the fact that Thomas Jane work is not enough for a character of this wavelength. A better actor would have taken this film to a complete new level. Frank Darabont has done well as always. This movie runs through with very emotions. if you haven't watched it just go and buy a DVD . Most of the actors have done well. Some very good side kick performances. The graphic is not up to the mark. I think Frank Darabont should work on his graphics team. Some creatures are not too fearful.People have been watching better graphics over the years. but graphics is not the reason to watch this movie.It's the drama and emotion's that are real assets for this movie. Finally its a movie worth watching cause of Frank Darabont work. not an epic movie but an epic try by an epic film maker.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
excellent horror film marred by misguided ending,"Stephen King hasn't had much luck at the movies. I think the main reason is that the movie people usually get distracted by the flashy scary stuff in his stories, and entirely miss the careful characterization that makes readers care about what happens.They didn't forget about it this time, though. I wouldn't call myself a Frank Darabont fan (director of two other King-based films – Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile). The first two times, he took solid stories and rendered them mushy and cliché-ridden (I realize I won't make a lot of friends around these parts with that statement). The Mist isn't perfect, but it doesn't suffer from those flaws. For most of its running time, it's an excellent horror movie – intense, and grounded by realistic performances and dialogue. (Plus some cool creatures.) But it does stumble at least twice. The first time occurs when a bunch of characters have a conversation the purpose of which is to tell the audience about the movie's subtext. Thanks, Frank. I mean, we are idiots, after all.But the biggest problem is the misguided ending (what follows discusses tone but doesn't spoil specific plot points). I don't care that Darabont deviated from the original story (I'm not a stickler for ""faithfulness""), but what he comes up with fails on multiple levels. The final moment of Twilight Zone-style heavy-handed irony is bad enough. But just before that, Darabont gives us a scenario that strains credibility so badly (the level of the characters' despair does not remotely justify their actions) that it becomes obvious it was contrived purely for shock value. Adding insult to injury, he seems to think he can pass off his cheap shock ending as something deep simply by slathering Dead Can Dance's portentous ""The Host of Seraphim"" all over the tail end of the soundtrack (it's a great tune, but out of place here). Instead, it only serves to expose the pretensions of someone who would try to infuse a giant-bug movie with unearned depth.So, this is a very good scary movie... if you tune out in time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"This is way better than the, horse shi*t critic revered; No country for old Men","If I could summarize this movie into two singular words it would be; ouch, and wow. I would first like to start off about talking about the ""ouch."" When I came out of the theater It felt like I just got punched in the stomach. Not a lot of movies can do that to me, but this one left me utterly stunned, and not it a bad way. The reason I felt so, was the ending. There has been a lot of flack for the ending, people complaining ""oh it wasn't like the original, what a travesty"" bull crap, but for me that couldn't be further from the truth. I think people are forgetting some other movies that had the same problems but are now considered classics. One is A Clockwork orange. A lot of people were upset that the movie didn't end the same way as the book but look at the attention it gets now. Just for people that go watch movies that were adapted from books and expect it to unfold just as they read it remember, its called adaptation for a reason, its the directors and screenwriters ideas that are formulated from the book. Meaning its not going to be exactly like the book. But i digress. The second emotion I felt after the movie was wow, wow because I cant believe how great a movie could get such bad reviews. To me(and I know people will scoff) but this was the movie of the year(at least of the ones I've seen). I saw a little movie last week, you might of heard of it, it was called No country for old men. Now that movie had awesome, terrific reviews. The only thing I felt when I came out of the theater was I want my 10 bucks back and are all the people who loved this movie blind. The only thing great about that movie was the cinematography. Dialog:complete crap it was just pulled from the book, pacing:I was more entertained with Pulp Fiction at that had some slow pacing, Characters: the only thing I kept thinking was, ""I could care less what happens to them"". I know that all reviews are not fair that critics are influenced by other critics and the studio or personal agendas, but if your going to be a critic call it for what it is, you should be impartial. I almost missed out on my personal pick for the movie of the year because I trusted the critics. Which is why I now will never listen to them again. So personal opinion if you want to see something that can make you feel real anger, real despair and emotion not, something force fed before you even enter the movie, go see, The Mist.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nutshell Review: The Mist,"With a title like The Mist, you probably won't be faulted if the first thing in your mind is that it's one of those run of the mill horror movies, like The Fog and The Haze (ok, so I made the last one up, it's actually a recently made short film competing in Berlin). And the trailers do suggest strange shenanigans happening inside a mist shrouded town, so in the hands of any mediocre storyteller, it's so easy to make them go Boo. Based on the novella by Stephen King, The Mist turned out to be unexpectedly excellent, with audiences whooping for joy both at the right and wrong places.Granted, sometimes Stephen King's materials do make uninteresting movies when adapted incorrectly and helmed dubiously, but Frank Darabont has proved himself with his previous King works like The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, both good movies in their own right, with excellent casting. Here, a cast of mostly unknowns carry the movie, and the direction doesn't rely on gimmicky tricks to frighten you, but in its measured, calm and at times standard by-the-book style, it brings heightened tension every step of the way.Thomas Jane, whose last movie I saw was The Punisher, stars as David Drayton, a comic artist whose house was smashed in one night by a tree during a bad storm. The next morning, he leaves his wife, and bringing his child and neighbour, they journey to the local supermarket to get supplies for home repairs, but not before realizing the army whizzing away at top speed. The pace picks up and within 10 minutes, the shoppers in the supermarket find themselves locked in as a mist descends upon them, with a frantic man running back to warn everyone that there's something within the mist.If we're talking about a cliché story, you'll probably get wave after wave of attacks on the shoppers inside the supermarket, as they barricade themselves in for a fight for survival. However, all that turn out to be secondary, as the story becomes clear that it's not about it being a horror movie, but a social mouthpiece about a couple of topics, all of which centres upon fear, and holding a mirror unto ourselves. We are afraid of the unknown, and chances are it will lead us to make irrational decisions, sometimes firing from the hip. The movie will constantly probe you into questioning how you would respond to the given situation, whether you'll break under pressure, or be able to maintain a sane mind in formulating survival plans.And in the unknown, there would bound to be a Bible-thumper. Truth be told, I thought that the character Mrs Carmody (sounds like ""comedy"", played by Marcia Gay Harden) will be one that the censors here might be touchy with, given how she was portrayed in extremely negative light. In times like these where there's a huge question mark hanging over you, there will be those who turn to religion for answers, and sometimes they may drift into the fanatical zone on the words of false prophets. Then I realize that this of course could be left as a warning against extremism, that it doesn't, most of the time, solve problems, but create them, and in the false name of god, makes it easier to do so too, in persuading others to join in the lost cause.Naturally, the preservation of self also takes centerstage, and does so very early, almost from the start - how we think of others having ulterior motives against ourselves, and just how much would we contribute for the greater good, or toward fellow friends and acquaintances. And this rams itself in with a key ironic scene, that sometimes, on positive karma, you may be rewarded for the good things you've done for others. There was a tinge of sadness, pity and sense of woe in the ending, and I enjoyed every minute of it, even though you may have guessed how it would turn out to be. As a friend put it, neither of us expected Frank Darabont/Stephen King to have the brass balls they had to pull it off, but it just had to be to evoke those emotions, making it all the more powerful, and wretched, at the same time.Despite it being devoid of a soundtrack until the final moments, I thought it was highly effective in not having one, letting ambient noise play a primary role. It allowed all our senses to be focused on how things were developing during the movie, without having music to emotionally manipulate our thought process and opinions. There are moments that you had to judge, without being biased by any particular soundtrack playing over the background. But fret not, interspersed nicely between scenes of questioning, are the scenes of the usual action-adventure that you'll come to enjoy, often times squealing together with the characters (and depending on the audience, them too) as the unfortunate faceless/characterless few start to succumb to the out of the world creatures.We've waited for a long time for The Mist to descend upon our shores, and now that it finally did (almost, at a GV Surprise Screening), it didn't disappoint a bit, but surpassed all expectations. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid fright movie,"Stephen King's The Mist is so much more than just an action-horror story. Trapped in a supermarket, surrounded by flying and slithering horrors of unknown origin, a community of people who should be working together for mutual survival instead splits into dangerous, internecine factions. Strong personalities assert themselves to achieve dominance whether they are right or not. Flat Earth denialists are willing to risk everything to prove to the group that nothing is actually wrong, when clearly something VERY wrong is going on. A local religious nutcase becomes a charismatic tyrant, exploiting fear to spread her twisted version of the Old Testament. Logic and social accountability go out the window to be replaced by selfishness and power-grabbing. It is human politics and religion in miniature, as well as a glimpse at how close supposedly civilized humanity is to descending into primitivism and savagery that makes Lord of the Flies look like a Victorian tea party. It is to Frank Darabont's credit that his adaptation left alone much of the structure of King's novel, while giving the exercise a nice other-worldly cinematic look. The film is shot in bled-out colors, giving the world within the Mist and the characters themselves a cheerless, hopeless appearance. The monsters themselves are suitably strange and ugly and lethal, and the ensemble cast, which ranges from highly effective (Marcia Gay Harden) to barely adequate (Thomas Jane), manages to successfully impart the appropriate air of menace and hopelessness the situation requires. It should be noted that, while the film follows the progression of the novel reasonably faithfully for most of its length, the revised ending may leave fans of the book irritated. The overall viewing experience is worthwhile, but I would recommend that fans of the book leave right when the novel itself ends. The tacked-on ending will have you frustrated.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A new genre in the making !,"A new genre in the making !, 7 April 2008 8/10 Author: (maximusnorton@gmail.com)The Mist , the title gives you the ""bwaaah ... naahhh , not for me "" first impression, but as more than once in life I have been shown - ""Not always do first impressions need to be all that great"" ! I thought to myself on first seeing the promo of this movie somewhere, ""God,is it going to be something along the lines of that Tom Welling (Smallville) fiasco, I was like couldn't they come up with something inventive , at least with the title ? 'The Fog' : 'The Mist' ! Old chocolate , new wrapper !"" But at the end of the promo when I saw the words : ' A Francis Darabont film ' , I was intrigued. Why would someone of his caliber want to direct a movie named ""The Mist"" ? It was only later that week, when I was at the airport, I managed to read an interview of his in the ""Empire"" and I realized that 'The Mist' like his previous creations (The Green Mile ,The Shawshank Redemption), was also based on one of Stephen King's works. This fact added to my curiosity and I was dead set on watching the movie as soon as possible.The movie to be honest is something new, at least in my case: The Director: Francis Darabont is a director, one of the few left, who is still fascinated by the idea of myths and fables with a dollop of mysticism. In this present day world of ""INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY"" or "" EPIC SCALE ANIMALS AND HUMANS ARE FRIENDS AND WE ALL KNOW MAGIC"" movies, here is a director who still wants to make movies based on simple but yet intricately woven tales. Tales that are held together by a sense of mysticism,of powers greater than us. His movies give us a peculiar feeling of mixed emotions, of dread and despair , joy and redemption. All his movies have that redeeming factor,in some way or the other , he manages to put it in there. In this movie, he has only surpassed his previous genius in all matters both technically and script wise. He even used the dynamic camera action used in Shield (The TV series) and also in Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"", to give us that feeling of intense dread of not knowing what is happening and what is about to happen. The zooming technique to heighten the portrayal of emotions and the constant swagger of the camera created an atmosphere of uncertainty, sucking the viewer right in.The Script: May it be Stephen King's novel or novella or whatever , but the tact with which Francis put it on screen is laudable. I was amazed with the way he put in complexities of problems pertaining to the past , the present and the future. (Race, War, The Old Testament , Scientists playing God etc.) The language used even, was extremely subtle but yet forceful, every character spoke in accordance to their backgrounds.The Cast: A well chosen group of actors whose on-screen chemistry was excellent, each one sunk into their roles, except maybe for the African American who played the neighbor/lawyer (The guy from the TV show THIEF), his histrionics were quite plain and lacked soul. ( But I guess thats what the world appreciates these days, otherwise why would they have given the Oscar to Daniel Day lewis ?) The Effects: Good,nothing too ""glitzy"". The tentacles were a bit lame though ! The Theme: Here is a one of a kind monster movie, one that creates a new genre, where it can be about monsters but also be pleasing to both sides of the viewing audience namely the intelligentsia and the gore lovers. This movie is an experience and you need to listen and analyze on your own what it means to you and what its trying to tell, its not just about a group of people stuck in a situation they have never seen before, its more about how they tend to handle it and how no matter who we are and where we are from, we will all, in the end, return to our primitive forms when faced with a situation, so intense and life threatening.Some will emerge as self proclaimed saviors, egocentrics who will use anything from religion to logic to rise above others. While others will quietly do what has to be done. But when faced with bigger choices, we all act the same - There is a scene where a mother asks for help and we get to see that basically, we are all just normal people, normal people who would like to be heroes and make a difference but only when it is convenient to them.The ending: It has the usual Darabont/M.Night twist ... But this one though obvious to some, does not happen in the usual ""recollect events happened thus far"" format, but actually in a more "" God! What have I done?"" sort of way.So, is this a monster movie - YES ! but it is also so much more...My vote: 8 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Under Her Charismatic Sway,"The Mist settles over a small town in Maine near an Army base and it becomes immediately apparent that this ain't no ordinary overcast. When creatures start emerging from it doing all kinds of things to mankind, a group take shelter in a supermarket.The creatures out there are bad enough, but what's really frightening in this adaption of a Stephen King story is the behavior of some in the market. I've often maintained that players take roles in these horror films because it allows them to overact outrageously, but they will never be criticized for it.Running away with this film is Marcia Gay Harden who when things are normal is dismissed as a crazy church lady. She starts preaching to the trapped people in the market and before long most in there are taking her seriously. The behavior of the people under her charismatic sway is more frightening than some of the special effects creatures out in the mist.Running close to Harden are Frances Sternhagen the no nonsense spinster school teacher and Thomas Jayne, the young father seeming to have leadership of the sane ones thrust upon him. He leads a group out from the market and then at the very end, not having all the facts at his disposal makes a terrible choice.Knowledge is power and fear of the unknown will lead humankind to behave abominably.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Mild scares, no satisfaction","This movie is a good example of the average movie based on a Stephen King book. The book is better. While I won't harp on about CGI and production values because they aren't essential to the quality of a movie and its impact, this movie could be much better on other fronts.The film makers tried to go in several different ways in this movie, and really none of them are all that successful. I won't give away any spoilers, but if you have seen the trailer, you know that the movie explores human survival instinct and their tendency to turn against each other, and this is realized through several events. The problem is, even if you have not seen any trailers, this is foreshadowed from the beginning, and it all happens in too short a time frame. It's just not convincing, thanks in no small part to the mediocre acting especially from the lead role and the crazy fanatic woman. It is commented on within the dialogue that the speed in which human will turn against each other is frightening, but the exploration of this concept is also a big fail.Apart from these various subplots, the movie does provide some good scenes of suspense, some nice jump from your seat shocks, and also nice creature design (the spiders are my favourite).What was disappointing is the ending, which I won't reveal due to spoilers, but it left me feeling cheated. Once again, I could see where they were trying to go with this kind of ending, but once again, it doesn't meld well with the kind of movie that this is, and my advice to filmmakers is that this sort of ending that is meant to be meaningful is much better left to less B-movie films, such as No Country for Old men, which was much better, and executed this kind of thing well.Over all, fairly good but mildly disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not all's well that ends well,"I thought I'd watch this movie after Jacksepticeye mentioned he liked it. Also IMDb gave it a 7,2, not to shabby. So let's get a beer and a snack and give this one a try, the trailer looked good!I liked the idea, like in some of my favorites as ""the Cube"", get very different people stuck together in a nasty situation and see what happens. Yay! love psycho horror stuff.But you know... I'm older now... so the stupid Christian bitch again? Is this an American thing? Must someone like this always be present in these films...boring.Then a lot of other stereotypical stuff happens, let me not spoil it for you, but you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat screaming at the characters for their stupidity, not for their safety.In the end the main character will even be so stupid, you won't believe it.An then it happens... the movie becomes good. In my opinion, most people seem to hate the end (has to do with reading the book I believe) , I love it. It's the only thing in the film that gives it meaning and perspective.So watch it!

"Too Long, Too Boring, Tired of Religious Stereotypes","This movie was too long, it was boring, the monsters were fake looking and silly, and the story never went anywhere. (Oh, and the acting was terrible too.) Apart from all this, what I hated most was the religious stereotype. Enough with the crazy Christian characters. How many times are we going to see that cliché in horror films? As much as Hollywood would like the viewers to believe deeply religious people are deeply disturbed, this just is not so. How about this . . . throw some loony lefties in your films for a change? If it weren't for the Christian bashing I would have given it a 3.

The explanation of the whole monsters' attack is also so very thin and so disillusioning that the 2 question rings like - Could the film makers invent some really more exciting explanation?

"Makes you think, great topic makes up for terrible acting","Steven king writes about some of the best stuff. The main topic of this movie isn't necessarily about the crazy out of world creatures, it's the message questioning humanity. One of Steven kings great features is writing about some if life's mysteries, basically saying is humanity stable? And some what of, is there other forms of lifes. The movie it's self loses some points in my book for the terrible acting in this movie, by many of the supporting actors.if they had a stronger actor as main character too would be great, his screams at the end were just subpar. The beginning of the movie had me questioning a lot of things, acting, if this movie is even considerable, and basically everything they were doing. After that the movie gets progressively better. But it's the thought of the movie that really makes it a good watch, not what was actually happening or the acting. It questions how we would handle these kind of situation, who will we turn to, what will we do. Some twists and turns in the movie improve it greatly, with a sad ending, but it includes a common Steven king topic, religion. Religion plays a strong role and a lot of the scenes in the movie follow religion. It was a good watch and the twists, and fairly frequent scene changes and frequent deaths of characters kept me from eventually noticing to many flaws, overall decent movie, great idea! My favorite part is really Ollie in the movie, he is great<3",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Twists,"Beginning was a little boring but 20 mins in I was hooked. I see lots of complaints about the religious part of it and I don't see how that's an issue. When people are looking death in the face and at times of despair they will magically turn religious hoping they will be saved. It's a normal thing, the fact that people think that is so far fetched is puzzling to me, when you think it's over it's not still 20 mins left then you think it's over again and it's still not still a couple of mins left and when it ends it twists a few times so you don't fully see it coming. I hate movies when I can tell the ending before the movie is close to ending but some parts surprised me. Besides the cgi looking a little out dated and it starting slow it's a really good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Mist,"A horror film in the truest sense of the word, The Mist's chills and thrills strike from as many different angles as the creatures that terrorise the protagonists.While it's the moments of human horror that are the most effective, what's going on outside the supermarket is terrifying indeed, with all the fantastical elements handled in a pleasingly real-world, logical way. Just as pleasing is the fact that - almost unheard of in the horror genre - no one makes any stupid decisions - when people venture out to certain death it's for a damn good reason.My one major criticism is that Marcia Gay Harden's religious nutcase is given considerably more screen time than she warrants and the purpose she serves the story is poorly developed (despite her screen time) and not entirely plausible.The brilliant, inspired ending must rank among the finest of recent years.",,Anonymous,Horror
Monsters Are Due,"A searing allegory about human nature, fearmongering, and religious fervor, The Mist packs a pretty strong punch in an unassuming package. Like a doped up version of the classic Twilight Zone episode - the Monsters are Due on Maple Street - maybe the real monsters are US!A mysterious fog envelops a small town trapping dozens of people in the local grocery store. ""There's something in the mist!"" a bloodied man yells as he rushes inside the store. They lock the doors and the paranoia and tension mounts and never releases afterwards. It feels like a cheesy 1950s sci-fi premise, and it shares some of those B-movie thrills.The possibly cheesy premise is served well by it's down-to-earth shooting style and unassuming (see almost none) musical score. The confines of the grocery store make for a good stage for all the human drama to play out. Old neighbor rivalries flare back up, disagreements about how to proceed rachet up the tension, and brief glimpses of the terrifying creatures waiting in the fog increase the terror.There's a few dialogue choices that feel a bit hackneyed and a few moments of conflict feel sort of needless and accelerated to accommodate the runtime. But in general the human drama works, and it feels like a fairly accurate and damning portrayal of humanity. Marcia Gay Harden in particular gives a great performance as the most loathsome b---- you can't wait to die.The CGI has not aged well. The fog effects and the creatures hidden in the fog still look nice. But when exposed to the bright interiors of the grocery store, the monsters look unconvincing and rubbery. The ending is slightly implausible and a little silly - but also is the films final gut punch. It might be the ending that really elevates the movie and puts that final bitter exclamation mark on it's damning allegory.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror allegory of a community of people in a disaster period,"When approaching ""The Mist"", keeping an open mind is possibly the best thing. It's based on a Stephen King novella, but it is no straight forward horror tale. The film is a moulding of fear and the decline in community bonding during a disaster. The story centres round a supermarket full of people in an idyllic lakeside town who are trapped in by a mysterious fog that has had people screaming of a mysterious entity killing fellow locals.Won't want to give the story away on ""The Mist"" of what it is or not, but that is really secondary to the main gist of it all. The film is really an allegory of civil decline in a period of distress, with parallels from events surrounding Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in the US. The mix in the supermarket include a fundamentalist Christian, a high-end lawyer, local blue collar workmen, army cadets and so on, whilst the main character is a father (Thomas Jane) who is desperate to survive with his son. The relations of the people together is what makes this a fascinating movie, and its the people who have as much to fear inside as to what there is outside.I have to be honest that I'm not into horror novels but Stephen King is gifted and it shows here. If there were some bigger names in the lead roles then I'm sure this would have been lauded higher than it has been. However, that is not to deny some good acting, with a outstanding performance by Marcia Gay Harden as the self-styled/appointed doom sayer Mrs Cormody.Definitely one to go for if you like an intelligent horror tale. Of late, there's been way too much torture porn in the horror film stakes crowding all else out, and this is a good redress for the whole ilk. A good viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Everything a Horror Movie should beand more,"Frank Darabont's THE MIST is perhaps the third best adaptation of a Stephen King novel/novella after THE GREEN MILE and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, and is quite likely the best adaptation of a predominantly horror-infused work from the 'Master of Horror'.From the intro, THE MIST grabs the viewer, and doesn't let go until the climactic ending sequence. Even the quiet, 'safe' moments are filled with a palpable and real tension that few of these modern horrors fail to provide.The acting is quite solid, as even the 'small-part' characters seem realistic and well-drawn. Thomas Jane does a more than adequate job of playing the strong and rational protagonist. Opposite him, Marcia Gay Harden is extremely effective as the Bible-quoting, holier-than-thou prophetess, foretelling the impending Apocalypse and unstoppable Doom. It is her character that invokes the biggest emotional response from audiencesafter the creatures, of course.THE MIST is not just a good horror movie; it is a fascinating study of fear, paranoia, hopelessness, religious fanaticism, and the human response. This is a compelling and thought-provoking film that will surprise many viewers. A special note must be made about the ending: while many viewers complain that it was in poor taste, or unnecessary, I wholeheartedly disagree. The atmosphere, music, and the very events of the ending propelled this film from good to great. It is also worth noting that Darabont deviated from King's ending, which turned out to be a welcome surprise from someone who sticks rather strongly to the source.The only thing preventing me from giving this film a perfect 4-star rating is the half-hearted 'explanation' of the events. Darabont, whose strength lies in creating atmosphere and mystery, would have done well to leave this up to the viewer to decide on and speculate upon. Nonetheless, a 3.5 star rating is a deserved one. The film also warrants a 9/10, and should appear in my Top 150 at 138. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Dark and Riveting Suspense Thriller with a Brutally Bleak Ending,"'The Mist' (2007) was directed by Frank Darabont and is based off a short story of the same name by Stephen King which can be found in the collection 'Skeleton Crew'.It's about a bunch of people who get trapped in a supermarket by a mist containing deadly creatures that rips anyone who goes outside to shreds. It's also about how the people in the supermarket are affected by this. Different people respond in different ways. People are distressed and becoming frequently more irrational as the film progresses. There's the main character, David Drayton, who's the calm and rational person who's trying to do the right thing. There's also a crazy religious woman reminiscent of the mother in 'Carrie'. She riles things up by trying to convince everyone that this is an act of a vengeful God. She becomes crazier as the movie progresses.The monsters look obviously computer generated, therefor not as convincing as I would've liked, however, they would've looked amazing if they'd looked realistic. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes. There's even a scene which plays on our common phobia of creepy-crawlies.'The Mist' is a tense and riveting suspense thriller with vivid characters and despite an impending sense of dread manages to be scattered with funny moments throughout.The biggest punch of all is in the ending, which is one of the most brutally bleak endings I've seen, partly because it's so unexpected and comes as a visceral shock to the viewer. If they had all been killed by the mist, it would've seemed almost happy in comparison. Though the ending made a huge impression on me, it left me with a bad taste and is not an ending one wishes to linger in the imagination.The soundtrack is great, adding to the film where needs be. At the end, it uses a song called 'The Host of Seraphim' by 'Dead Can Dance', which makes its tragic ending all the more haunting.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Mist, Haze, Fog...Watch out for Humans Better.","What to say about ""The Mist""? It pretty much overwhelmed me. Yes, for its truly oppressive finale and it's tension moments. With disaster movies like these the script is divided somewhat into: 1) Society is shown functioning 2) Abnormal events presented 3) Society analyzes the situation 4) Society panics 5) Chaos.Well, I repeat the word ""Society"" because of one thing. At one point, after the mysterious mist proclaims the entire city, some people are cornered into a supermarket. And there Frank Darabont plays an intense, insightful drawing of the human group, that it's powerfully engaging and smartly written. The voices of reason, common thinking and Christianity are promptly adjusted to the characters, and as tension and problems start accumulating so does the strain between the survivors. Fear not only the monsters, but the enemy within your lair...I didn't like of the film the painfully hostile image it gives to the Christian people. It's leader, or ""vessel"" in the movie is a crazy woman, fanatic that seduces the survivor gathering into her apocalyptic, biblical disoriented theories. Mass follows this leader that gives all final power to God without logical retribution, but pure devotion. The mass is powerful, and the few left on reasoning and cold logic. The mass convicted, tries to hunt the left ones and blame them for the disaster. Sounds familiar? Yes, Nazism. Maybe Im rushing. I am not Christian, but I entirely respect the religion and didn't want to be raised and convinced of a premature hate to the religion because of one annoying character and a good scripting.Stephen King wrote the book in which this movie is based. His knowledge on terror and human fear is so vast, and his control over those reading and viewing his books/films make the experience reliable. The ending, well, it's devastating. I liked the movie not only buying the intense tension, but for it's crude report on human mind, chaos and society's guidance.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Depressing Vision, Decent Film","I can't say that this was a bad movie but I can't say that I liked it either. I'm a Stephen King fan, and have been for many years. But the main message of this movie seems to be that humanity is too rotten to live. So stay far away if you want something fun to watch.The acting was pretty good overall, although I found the kid that played Thomas Jane's son to be kind of irritating. Marcia Gay Harden in particular did a very good job. So good that if I saw her in person anytime soon after watching the movie I'd probably slap her face.As far as creature effects go, they were a bit low rent. Not the worst I ever saw, but not the best either. Maybe they should have skipped the puppetry and used more cgi. Probably a budget issue, but also a case of somewhat lackluster creature design. Other special effects were the same. Not the worst but far from big budget best.Direction was okay. Frank Darabont is no Steven Spielberg but he gets the job done. Camera work was good to very good. Sound and music were both excellent. Editing was good. Writing was okay. I have a minor gripe with the extras. Would have been nice if they had used just one group for the entire film but there was kind of a revolving door amongst the non-speaking cast. The number of people in the store seems to fluctuate also.My main reason for not particularly liking it is the story itself. It's very dark and does not have the adrenaline rush of many horror films. In fact I wouldn't really call this a horror film at all. More of a psychodrama or even a disaster movie in my opinion.So the conclusion: If you want something light that will give you a rush I don't advise watching this movie. If you're a big Stephen King fan or you like this kind of movie then go ahead.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is a creature feature done to perfection. The creatures are really scary. It is scarier than most cartoon splatter slasher movies. This is what a horror movie should be.Like the other Darabont-King movies, this one is not just the simple genre movie. It is about the characters.

"A good watch, shame you can't hear it too","(59%) A very watchable horror set mostly around a single location that for the most part works well. The all too clear politics involving race, class, and in particular religion are fleshed out in a typical supermarket setting acting as the characters only line of defence, as well as a platform to host their opinion and influence those around them. My biggest issue here comes quite close to almost ruining the movie, that being the mumbling performances from a majority of the cast between the more dramatic sequences. I have perfect hearing, but I struggled to register the numerous quiet moments almost as if the script had something to hide, and those scenes (from what I could hear) were indeed mostly filler so I suspect a bit of corner cutting behind the scenes was going on, which is a shame. The ending is a bit overly drastic, but overall the movie is entertaining and enjoyable enough for a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It made me think and wonder what those people going through this mysterious traumatizing circumstances, and what I would and should do. One of the reason this movie turned out be better Stephen King movie is it was about us. It was not much about the mist nor the monster in it. It was about monster in us (human nature, mind, behavior, instinct, invulnerability, insecurity that turns us into the monster to herm and kill in order to survive in extremely traumatizing survival circumstances for best or worst) I think because of strong acting from each casts (especially from Marcia Gay Harden and Thomas Jane) brought up this movie to next level like something equivalent to Lord of Files has accomplished.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Decent, but well below Darabont's standards","Frank Darabont is a director that just really loves his characters, and because of that I figured Stephen King's ""The Mist"" would be right up his alley. The entire book is about a bunch of people who don't know each other being stuck in the same place for ages, which sorta resembled...hey wait a minute, that IS every Frank Darabont movie. However, ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"" centered around compelling protagonists and delightfully goofy side characters, while most people in this adaptation of ""The Mist"" are just boring. Take Marcia Gay Harden's religious fanatic for instance, how does such a bland, one-dimensional character get so much screen time? Thomas Jane isn't really much better though, and he's the freaking lead. It's not all bad however, story-wise ""The Mist"" definitely has its moments. It's pretty nice how the horror is gradually built up, and it also leads to a true killer of an ending. There's lots of interesting stuff happening, it just doesn't happen to interesting people.

How 'The Mist' Cleared my Mind - The First Review,"I've been putting off reviewing films for a while for several reasons. But this title, 'The Mist', has sparked something inside of me. This film is neither good, nor bad, and if I were looking at it from a normal perspective, then I would admit that it's a pretty average horror flick. But it's important to stay true to your values, and I've always said: ""If a film can make me feel something foreign, or even something normal, but to an extreme... then it must have some good, if not great, qualities."" The acting was not to a 'Good Will Hunting' standard, and the direction was in typical Darabont style, (not that there's anything wrong with that). But overall, the thing that I will remember most from this film, is the anger that it filled me with in certain parts. It scarred my mind and re-instilled previous internal complications I've had with some of the subject matter.I know this isn't a typical review and may not offer much in the way of choosing a movie for the night; but all I can say is that: this is not a fantastic movie, and it's far from one of my favourites, but it has left me a lot to think about, so go in with an open mind to a film that's easy to watch with a closed one, and consider the subtle - and not-so-subtle - points that Frank Darabont makes about society, religion, politics and general human nature.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

MOVIE REVIEW: Stephen King's The Mist,"I personally don't like the IMDb summary. It doesn't really speak about the movie that I just saw nor the story I have read and like a lot. So let me try to work up a summary that is worthy.My Summary: A day after a huge thunderstorm that puts a tree through the window of their lake house and topples the Draytons boathouse, a mysterious mist rolls in off of the lake. David Drayton and his son accompany their neighbor Mr. Norton into town to the local grocery store to get some supplies. They quickly find out that the mist is more than just fog. Becoming trapped inside the store along with many other town members and out of towners, they engage in a battle that will test their ability to reason, sanity, and faith as they come face to face with what evil really is.A string of many familiar faces, including Thomas Jane (The Punisher) as David Drayton, are among the amazing cast assembled for this film . The story is one about the nature of fear and what will happen when you take people out of their normal surroundings and pack them together in an intense, stressful, and terrifying situation.Frank Darabont, who directed The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, takes a different approach to this film. Instead of playing it safe with crane shots, steady cam work, and sweeping music like the previous two films, he instead decides to use a much more rough style involving hand held shots, old school special effects, and virtually no music. This in turn gives the viewer a much different experience. You feel as though you are trapped in the store with the players and that you can't escape either. When things start happening to the people, you feel for them, you can understand their pain because you are going through it also.I also must give Darabont credit for writing an ending to the story that originally didn't have an ending. It is a very good ending and one that Stephen King approves of. I do feel there were some things lacking from the film and I thought that it could have been better. However, I did enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Darabont treats Kings work with the respect .,"Based on a short story by Stephen King comes The Mist A mist envelops a small Maine town and dozens are trapped inside a supermarket knowing that in the mist are horrible creatures and being stranded soon takes its psychological toll If you like the sound of this you're in for a treat.The Shawshank Redemption director Frank Darabont and acclaimed writer/producer (The Green Mile) seems unsure at times whether to use the documentary styled film shooting or stick to a traditional style of movement, but that aside he is a master of creating apprehension and unease. Also Frank Darabont treats Kings work with the respect it deserves with high production values. Thankfully it's not another dire TV movie.The effects are good but suffer at times due to the over use of CGI, luckily the solid actors including Thomas Jane (Stander), Laurie Holden (Silent Hill) are there to compensate for this as the film is mainly character driven. Although melodramatic at times The Mist highlights the silliness of fanatical, cult religions as the trapped shoppers split into two camps: those who believe it is an act of a vengeful god and those don't.I love brave bleak endings. The Descent, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, The Elephant Man, The Thing, They Live, to name a few but Mists ending whilst not as preachy as the recent film The Happening is let down by a needless, emotionless ending, that extinguishes all that came before.The tag lines read 'Fear Changes Everything' and 'Stephen King's Legendary Tale of Terror', but The Mist while not a bad film falls short of becoming a 'Shining' classic.",,Anonymous,Horror
Could of been a contender,This feature could of been a classic but it suffers from some bad acting and incredulous plot turns. When will Stephen King allow a truly respected director to do justice to one of his scarier works? I would of loved to of seen what Spielberg could of done here. Too bad we're left with sub-par films.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just Unique!,"This is the from which I came to know about both Frank Darabont and Stephen King. And you know what you get when they are together on something. You get a masterpiece. The Mist is truly one masterpiece.This is not just a science fiction movie with creatures from another dimensions. This movie works in different levels of human psychology. The story is good but the ending was brilliant.The acting, directing and the special effects are just in a way you would expect. It had just the amount of suspense needed.If The Green Mile is the best from Stephen King then this is surely the second best.(I haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption yet.)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, but not up to expectations","The mist has been one of my all time favorite stories from Stephen King. I was really excited about seeing this movie. For the most part, I was not disappointed. While the ""things"" in the mist were more terrifying in my imagination, the film version also brought the creepiness and horror out.However, I do take issue with the ending. In my opinion, the short story ending FAR surpassed the film ending. I was left disappointed and a little disgusted. I think someone sold out to the ideas of Hollywood and what they thought would make money.With the amount of money and clout Stephen King carries, I would have thought he could have put his foot down and demanded the film follow the story completely.All in all, this was a good, not great film. It does give a good example of the earlier, and in my opinion better, writings of Stephen King.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly similar to the novel,"Im used to book-based movies ""pushing the limits"" set by the book, but this book did a great job of not adding or taking away too much. This was a very good adaptation of the novel and he characters were portrayed well. I do have a few complaints though. As opposed to the novel, you get very little background on the characters. A moviegoer who hasn't read the book would be confused by this lack of background. The action scenes are also a problem in my opinion. They are few in number and could be lengthened slightly to add a more dramatic effect to the movie. Aside from these personal complaints I think the movie was a very well done adaptation.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Frank Darabont's The Mist is terrifying, visceral cinematic tale based on the works by Stephen King","Stephen King has been held as the master of horror in the world of literacy. Love or hate him, there is no doubt that his works have left an impact on both writers and filmmakers everywhere. This horror novel 'The Mist' is the subject of this terrifying sci- fi/horror endeavor, and is operated by the hands of Frank Darabont who helmed the American classic 'Shawshank Redemption, another film based on King's works. Like Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' (which King was disappointed with) this film sees Darabont taking liberties from King's acclaimed source material and using it for appealing cinematic horror advantages. His solid direction more than works, it excels the film into a thought-provoking, frightening experience that will hold no bars on haunting viewers long after the end credits roll. Even those with a strong muscle against the spookiest cinematic pictures will find themselves curling into a fetal position. The story has not a married man descending into mental insanity and wielding an axe, it is something shockingly more terrifying. This film is set in Maine and follows David Drayton (played by Thomas Jane), a husband and father who takes his eight- year old son Billy (played by Nathan Gamble) and his neighbor Brent (played by Andre Braugher) on a trip to a local convenience store for supplies after a violent thunderstorm causes damage to their house. Soon, the trio along with the rest of the shoppers are alarmed by sirens that go off and the sight of a bloodied man running into the store shouting ""something in the mist!"". Within minutes, the entire town is swallowed by an enormous fog, trapping everyone inside. It is not long before the shoppers learn the sinister secrets of this mysterious phenomenon when a horde of otherworldly creatures break inside and begin preying on them.This is not quite as much of a monster flick as it is of a survival film. After all, the main focus surrounds a large group of confused individuals trapped together coping with confusion what on to do under terrifying situations. Nonetheless, Frank Darabont holds no restraints in showcasing the characters' terrifying fight for survival which ends in a series of bloodbaths as the grotesque- looking beasts preying on human flesh. So you do not want to grow emotionally attracted to any characters, because some of them may not last long. And if you bear a weak stomach to gory imagery, take caution because there will be some things you will likely wish to unsee. Furthermore, Darabont proves to be more than capable to maintaining an ominous atmosphere that leave audiences alternating between curling up in their seat and loading their heads and thoughts of what the characters are feeling and what they would do if they were in a similar situation. The visceral tension uproots not just from the blood-thirsty creatures terrorizing the store, but also between poor shoppers themselves. If that isn't enough, there is another antagonist beside the monsters on board, and that Marcia Gay Harden's character Mrs. Carmody, a religious extremist who perceives the unsettling event as the ""End of Days"". Harden packs a punch with her performance, electrifying her role with pure fortitude and heart-thumping humility. If the film deserves any Oscar nomination of any kind, it would most certainly for her in the supporting role. The scariest aspect of her character is that she is mentally unstable and is so buried into her spirituality she is willing to put others in grave danger to preserve her faith. Above all, the tension is powerful, the danger is harrowing, and the atmosphere is purely gut-wrenching as the story builds to a finale that leave many viewers shocked to the core.The Mist is a purely terrifying horror experience that rests in the front ranks of one of the scariest horror pictures Hollywood has delivered in recent memory. In an alternate of words, it marks not only an astounding effort by director Frank Darabont who embraces Stephen King's absorbing source material, but an inspiring cinematic endeavor that truly knows what scary is. If there is any caution to taken before sitting through this film, it is preparing yourself emotionally for the ending that can only be described in one word: Haunting.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
this movie is now in my top 5 of all time,"i really enjoyed this movie. just watched it for the second time since it was released. i can honestly say it is imo the best film adaption of a novella i have ever seen. the acting was just outstanding, and the horror, while tame by today's standards of goreporn. was genuine and suspenseful. i cant recommend this movie highly enough. everything just works. the ending and subplot of where the mist came from is even better then the original novella. a must watch for king fans. while the cgi does indeed not age well it is sparsely used and in fact to great effect in some instances. this is not an effects movie. it is a character movie and a what would you do kind of movie. i have seen a lot of crap made out of books to movies, and this is just above the cut. if your thinking of getting it in any form, do so. if you don't like it i will give you a dollar.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Primeval with the cast from the Walking Dead,"Of course I'm joking with that above statement! For those of you who don't know, Primeval is an incredibly bad TV show in the UK about dinosaurs that come out of worm hole thingies and a bumbling group of secret service people go out to dispatch of the beasts humanely. It's really bad, uses every cliché in the book and has most definitely run its course. The Mist surprised me, although I wouldn't call it one the greatest horror films of the decade, it's certainly one of the greatest creature features, but I could think of at least 20 horror films (I think) that are better than this one that came out between the years 2000 and 2010.The Mist is sort of like a very well-made B-movie, and I mean that in the nicest possible way. We all know what happens, a bunch of people get trapped in a supermarket as a dangerously thick mist engulfs the town. It would be stupid to leave anyway because you could'nt see where you're going, but it would be even more stupid to leave after Dale from the Walking Dead (beardless!) runs in screaming that there's something in the mist which took someone! Everyone's sceptical, but a few more people are not when they get a rather nasty surprise in the store room! Some people may completely disregard The Mist as being silly, but these people simply do not know how to have fun. Who can't say they weren't entertained when the supermarket was stormed with giant mutant fly things?Besides, The Mist offers so much more than a standard creature feature. It's a comment on humanity and the state of today's society. Immediately the supermarket is segregated into different groups of race, religion and hierarchy. It's the wonderful screenplay that's the real star of the show, giving a fascinating insight into how people could and probably would act in such a situation. It's almost reminiscent of George A Romero's Dawn of the Dead or/and Day of the Dead. There's some wonderful characters who you can either root for or wish for them to get eaten (*cough* *cough* Bible nut *cough*) it's the relationships between people which mean that there's rarely a dull moment in The Mist's two hour running time. Although, I did feel that it was perhaps over-long and some of the dialogue scenes could've been reduced or cut out completely.The directing is quite stylish and sometimes feels very candid, which gives the film a needed realistic edge. The CGI effects could annoy some people as they were a bit iffy at times (not as bad as Primeval!) but they're certainly not the worst effects I've seen, and they didn't distract from the film itself. Some of the beasties were quite nasty-looking and the huge ones, covered by the mist had a particularly eerie edge. I could'nt imagine (nor want to imagine) what I'd be like in that situation. I'd probably be in a corner shipping myself! There's quite a lot of beast action and it is wonderfully entertaining and refreshingly unpretentious.Now, the ending wasn't as mind-blowingly shocking as most people were making out. I'd say that the endings to say, 5150 Elm's Way and Eden Lake are in respects more shocking, nevertheless for an American horror film it certainly had balls! I did really like the ending, it was unrelentlessly nasty and painfully ironic and haunting, but I would've probably liked it even more if it was less hyped up. It'll certainly put the less-experienced American viewer out of their comfort zone!In the end The Mist is a hugely enjoyable creature feature with a hefty/heavy focus on people and characters. It's probably better than I imagined it to be and is much better than the disappointing Stephen King adaptation of 1408. Whilst it isn't up there with Carrie, The Shining and Misery, it can still sit in the ""very good"" category of Stephen King horror adaptations. I really enjoyed it and people who say they didn't probably secretly enjoyed it too! I would recommend that you see it, but I think that most people have seen it by now! Still, if you haven't it's worth seeking out, I found it very cheaply on Amazon, and I could see it as the type of film that would get better with repeated viewings!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Awful,"There is absolutely no aspect of this film that isn't bad, except for the premise, which is interesting enough to serve as the basis of a good screenplay. Unfortunately we didn't get a good screenplay. We got this pile of crap instead. Nothing i this film makes sense. Characters are all idiots who act in ways that no actual human would act, and they are just moronic stereotypes and cardboard cut-outs in this mind-bogglingly lazy and unimaginative script. In fact, the characters are outright unlikable and you want them to die. Instead of focusing on suspense and horror, the film spends the bulk of the time showing us insanity and stupidity of characters we can't stand, as they bicker in moronic ways that are telegraphed in advance from act one. To make things worse, the CGI is so cheap and obvious that it never looks credible or nearly as scary as it should. This screenwriter and this director completely failed to generate suspense and instead bored us to death with these pathetic excuses for characters and their insufferable and meaningless bickering. To call these characters idiots would be a huge understatement. And the film has a whole bunch of them. If you are a lazy and untalented film maker, stick to a few characters. Don't write a dozen of them when you can't even handle three.I was incredibly annoyed and bored by this film. Don't be fooled by positive reviews. This is incompetent drivel.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty realistic yet not so much,"The overall story the film depicted is intriguing yet at the conclusion it still left you with unanswered questions. Disclaimer, I DID NOT READ the book. Ignore the cliché decisions made from the characters and bad CGI and it's a decent film. I've had this in my watchlist for years and finally had the time to get around to it (mostly due to the fact I've run out of good movies to watch and not because I was personally interested in it). Go ahead and watch the movie if you're bored or need background noise. It's not BAD, it's just frustrating and quite unrealistic at times. A solid 6.5 is probably where my true score lies but since this is a classic I'm happy to rate it a 7 in favor of 6.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""The Mist"" should have been an instant classic, but it's just a solid monster movie","Easily one of the most intriguing short stories Stephen King has ever brought to paper, ""The Mist"" was one of the most anticipated King-adaptations in a long time. Longtime fan and friend Frank Darabont was the one who finally got his hands on the project. He had already adapted two King-stories (""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"") to much critical acclaim (justified or not), so fans were pretty hyped up about him working on this beloved material. In hindsight another director might have been a better choice for this movie that is more horror related than ""Shawshank"" or ""Mile"", but we'll get to that later.Some people have argued that the ""less-is-more""-approach would have been better for this kind of movie, because the less you see of the monsters, the more your imagination can run wild, and the scarier the movie will be. I'm glad that Darabont didn't go for that approach, because that's not what this story is about. Fans of King's ""The Mist"" wanted to see the monsters in all their creepy glory and Darabont really tried to give us that.The problem is that the CGI is nowhere near as good as it should have been and the movie absolutely depends on convincing special effects. It's not like it couldn't have been done better. ""The Thing"" still looks absolutely stunning and that movie is over 20 years old, so why couldn't ""The Mist"" be as convincing? Thankfully, the monsters do look better once they are surrounded by fog, but the first horrific exposure of giant tentacles is just laughable and even the fog coming over the little town looks cheesy. This flaw really drags the movie down to a point where you can either dismiss it as a failure immediately or decide that some moments are still pretty cool. Either way, the special effects should have been worked on. This way they look half-finished and frustratingly cheap.The effects are not the only thing that seems cheap. The dialog is also pretty painful to watch at times. The tension in ""The Mist"" arises only partly from the monsters on the outside of that grocery store. The conflicts within the group inside the grocery store are equally important, so it's almost as hurtful that the interaction between the characters seems wooden and clichéd. Although the lines in the script were adopted almost word for word from the original short story, they don't work in the movie. What seems believable on paper doesn't necessarily translate that way to the screen. Darabont may have thought it was the safest bet to include as much as possible from the original short story (an unnecessary sex scene aside), but in this case some adjustments would have been a good thing.That said, the movie does get a lot better after the first 45 minutes or so. Somehow the longer we stay with that group and the more we watch insanity arise on the outside, the more we get sucked into the story. The characters get more realistic and the creatures are positively creepy. It's a good thing Darabont included all the terrifying stuff from the short story and he did most of it justice.The much talked about ending isn't all that important to be honest. The story just goes on for a bit longer and ties up some loose ends. Sure, it may not be completely plausible, but it's a better way to end the movie than just going to the credits in the middle of events. The new ending doesn't really fit the mood of the rest of the movie and seems a bit tacked on, but at least it comes as a surprise.Frank Darabont could have screwed up this great story a lot worse (just thinking of what they did to Bradbury's ""A Sound Of Thunder"" makes me shiver). A bit more style and finesse, a better chosen cast and, most of all, perfected CGI would have been enough to turn ""The Mist"" into the unforgettable classic that it should have been. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way. Like the other Stephen King adaptation of 2007 (""1408""), ""The Mist"" can't compete with the short story it is based on, but it's still quite entertaining to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A daily comment from Midget Emma: The Mist (2007),"It was good but it could have been so much better. There could have been much more action but instead we got religious and biblical speeches from the most annoying character in movie history.Frank Darabont returns to what he does best....Stephen King movies. It said directed by Frank Darabont and based on the novel by Stephen King. That was all i needed to hear to know i was going to see this movie. This was not up to par with his previous movies, The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption.I recommend it if you like Stephen King or Frank Drabont's work but don't expect it to be better then his previous work.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surreal and nerve-wracking. A horror movie that really works,"This film passed me by until recently when i caught it on DVD. From the opening frame however, i found myself locked into it and remained so throughout. When the first creature appeared however, I nearly rolled my eyes in despair as it seemed a bit too obviously CGI, but it quickly got better very quickly and the rest of the creatures were extremely effective and really quite terrifying. Many people on here have commented upon the ending and i have to say that it caught me by surprise and was very shocking and upsetting. I do however feel it was a bit rushed but can appreciate the dilemma the director was under as if he had dragged it out it would have lost a lot of its impact, so it was a rather brave move on his behalf. My main gripe is in thomas janes wooden performance. He kinda gets away with it throughout the film but the ending needed more passion and anquish and he didn't doesn't produce it. The ending therefore is both flawed and very effective. It certainly stays with you after the film has ended though thats for sure.What i loved about this film was the ultra-surreal and dark atmosphere it captures. The grainy looking cinemaphotography and hand-held camera work has much to do with this and a fine job was done by those guys. The sense of hopelessness is palpable and the image of the gigantic creature walking across the landscape, in combination with the stunning musical soundtrack, has surely got to be the most Gothic moment ever created in a film. A real 'end-of-the-world' scenario which is extremely gripping and moving. All in all then, apart from a few gripes, this is a really interesting piece of work and highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of my favorite horror flicks of the 2000s.,"""Well...we got four. Four bullets.""The Mist is probably my favorite Stephen King adaptation. When military experimentation opens a door to another dimension, a small town in the northeast U.S. is swiftly and completely blanketed by a thick fog. A fog inhabited by terrifying creatures that may mean the end of everything. A group of people trapped inside a supermarket must then try to survive dangers both external and internal.Since this is based on a King story, you know that there's going to be more to it than just monsters killing humans. Conflict between the people in the store is just as much of a threat as the horrors of the mist, and outsiders versus the town natives and misguided fanaticism brought about by fear are two of the major themes of the plot. It's nice when a horror movie is interesting beyond the usual shocks and gore, and that's one of the strong points of The Mist.I thought the creature designs were good, if not amazing. They looked suitably frightening for the most part, and the actors did a good job of reacting to the beasts, which is always important with CG creatures. Another strong (and very King-esquire) point was the ending, which was absolutely fantastic. I think this would be worth seeing for the ending, alone.The Mist gets a full recommendation from me. It's horrifying (if you have a aversion to spiders like me, you will be permanently scarred), and has that trademark Steven King vibe that elevates it beyond typical horror. It's been a few years since the first time I've seen it, but it still was just as entertaining the second time around. That's about the best compliment that a horror movie can get.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hear me out on this one,"Okay, this is one of those movies where you read the description and you watch it out of morbid curiosity (and because it's Stephen King). King really has a talent for creating iconic plots, but I feel that the plot is really driving the movie, as opposed to the characters. Don't get me wrong, there is a diverse set of personalities, and we definitely see some internal struggle within the main cast, but such a situation and plot such as this would really have done well with more emphasis on the individual reactions (though it does a great job of displaying mob mentality.) If you watch this movie, you will definitely be entertained, and I can appreciate the irony in the ending, but it is nowhere near a favorite of mine.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Did not live up to my expectations, but still a good enough movie.","I guess I expected perfection from the guy who brought us ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"", and this movie was by no means perfect. However, it was a very entertaining horror movie with good characters, and even a few scares.After several strange accidents, a mist begins coming in from the mountains. All the residents of the town go to the local grocery store to get their supplies as the mist, and military roll through this little town. The mist eventually gets to this grocery store, and after a death, people realize that this mist has creatures in it. A large, eclectic group of people waits in the store while the mist waits for them. It sounds pretty stupid but it's actually very good. The direction was fantastic, and even though this wasn't mile a minute scares, it was still very tense throughout, while still managing to have a great sense of humor. The characters were exactly what you'd expect from a Frank Darabount adaptation of Stephen King's work; there was a wide range of characters, each (of the main) well developed and with their own unique personality. My huge gripe with the film in the end, was the end, which I did not like (and won't give away). But overall, the idea of making an entire horror movie in one place was scary enough and gave the audience an intimate feel with the settings, and this was a success, but not a huge standout film.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 122 mins.

Extremely well made horror gut wrencher does it's job too well,"This movie is gripping. It is engaging and the characters are compelling and identifiable. It covers heavy themes.And it's too much.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. It's so well made and yet so not worth it. Even if you are a seasoned horror viewer, I would issue a strong warning against watching, it just takes you heart and rips it apart.I know that very warning is what will probably get most people to watch it (it certainly was for me) people may be too curious. I saw this movie because I heard the ending is absolutely shocking and it was made by Frank Darabont, the man behind the Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile. He does a great job hear as despite the disturbing content the film is suspenseful and immersive and is hard to stop watching because you just want to know what is going to happen next.If you really think you can stomach it then check this well made movie out.

"Enjoyably daft film, elevated by a great ending.","Missed this in the theatres, but must say that this probably is the perfect film to watch at home.A great pulpy story from Stephen King, whereby his usual fleshed out, human characters are stuck in an extraordinary situation.

But you will be surprised.......Some nice camera-work (Emphasising the real with some documentary like flourishes) and acting from Thomas Jane, Andre Braugher, and Marcia Gay Harden (Doing the most with the ""Horror film"" character she's given) keep you watching even though some dialogue and situations are cheesy.But all the minus' are outweighed by a corker of an ending, unexpected and in keeping with a real horror film. It made me laugh out loud (Im a sick man) and is one of those films that some kid will watch on late night TV in 10 years time and freak them out!

Terrific popcorn movie,"I read some reviews of this movie from 'serious' reviewers. The tendency was towards shallowness of plot and lack of credibility or explanation. I can't believe this. Decades on end I see Hollywood movies that are about having the right ingredients to earn money and suddenly they pick on this. But I saw why .. the director had a reputation from 'the green mile' and 'shawshank' so disappointment was around the corner. Consuming this movie for what it is, a unpretentious popcorn movie in which exaggerated human behavior under stress / shallow psychology is used as an extra entertainment factor I totally enjoyed myself. The only let-down for me was the sad ending which suggests some kind of pretentiousness after all, like it's some kind of tragedy/drama or something.

An Emotionally Draining Movie; One of the Better Adaptations,"Stephen King's ""The Mist"" is probably one of the better adaptations in the last decade. It has great actors, a great storyline (almost exactly like the original story), a great script, and great views on life.David Drayton and his son go to the grocery store after a horrible storm knocks out their boathouse and part of their house. While in the store, a mist engulfs everything and a man warns everyone that there's something in the mist. That's when everything spirals downhill for the characters.Thomas Jane delivers an amazing performance as a leader, a hero, and a caring, protective father. He shows both strong sides and weak sides to his character.Nathan Gamble, who plays the son, gives us a true, believable performance of a child experiencing the horrifying scenes being shown to him. Even though he is young, he is a very respected actor in my book. Dakota Fanning could use some lessons from him.Marcia Gay Harden, as Mrs. Carmody, might remind some of Jack from ""Lord of the Flies"". She uses her character to show that religion might not always be the right way to turn in difficult situations (no offense).The script was great (with a few exceptions in the beginning of the movie with some bad dialog). The ending, though different from Stephen King's, was almost traumatizing to watch; however, it's also one of the more reasonable/probable endings.The CGI is kind of bad unfortunately. At the beginning, it is laughable, but by the end you don't notice it as much.All in all, ""The Mist"" is an amazing movie that will make you think deeper while being mind-blowingly scary. ***** out of *****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A refreshing blast.,"Stephen King can be downright scary but with a social sensibilityCarrie and 1408 come immediately to mind. So The Mist is a refreshing blast of King at his best, mixing horror with commentary on absurd, complex, and doomed humanity. The film depicts in Maine a fog rolling in with creatures that eat humans alive and generally cause panic and mayhem of the War of the Worlds and Body Snatchers type.Artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane in good Dennis-Quaid form) is the designated hero for the people trapped in a grocery store while various mist monsters terrorize them. But the over-sized squid and spiders are only director Frank Darabont's visual way of exploring the ambivalence of humans in extreme circumstances.Although he film wrestles with too many major challenges to humans in extremis, thanks goodness it tries and sometimes succeeds with solid results. For instance, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) pulls a Jim Jones with apocalyptic warning tactics that mobilize most of the people in the market against the small band of good guys. Her rant is mostly about conversing with God, who tells her that they are being punished for their heathen natures, much as Pat Robertson blamed the unwashed for 9/11. The question for the good guys is whether or not to eliminate her, an act antithetical to goodness except in extreme survival mode. The larger issue is the influence of the real right and neocons like Dick Cheney, who have made a life of scaring the bejesus out of the common folk.King provides other contemporary socio/political topics such as the ambivalent role of the military, at once responsible for the mutants and at another time savior for the suffering people. Throw in the mix the horrors of euthanasia and class conflict, and you have way too much to deal with in a short horror flick. To its credit, the film uses only minimal CGI to create a 50's kind of intellectual horror, where the people inside the grocery store become more like the monsters without as their primal instinct to survive kicks in.I'm going to Maine next week; I think I'll just sit out the usual fog during unusually balmy fall days. Hey, maybe this overripe allegory is also about global warming!",,Anonymous,Horror
Real Review,"It was a friend of mine who convinced me to go watch this film. Before i went to watch this movie, like any other movie i usually plan to watch i checked its ratings on IMDb and saw the 7.5 it was given and thought it cant be bad. the opening scenes of the movie get straight to the point and into the title of the movie. It didn't exactly have me in suspense but had me a little curious to actually what will happen next. As the movie developed i wasn't all that impressed. the kid in the movie couldn't act and he was trying too hard to act like he was scared and needed his father. when the bugs appear i was let down by the poor graphics and it didn't seem all that convincing either. i liked the way there became divisions within the group of people in the supermarket but the whole religious thing was taken over the top. in reality more people would favour the rational person than the religious fanatic. the religious lady did well in the beginning with her preaching the fulfilled prophecies but then when the whole 'sacrificing people' theme come along it started to become ridiculous for me to believe that would happen. up until the end of the movie it was watchable, nothing special but just watchable. HOWEVER the ending absolutely blows away the audience. it was the only real punch that this movie delivers. its been a long time since I've seen such a good and different ending to a movie, simply because u don't expect that to happen. I ususally don't watch horrors but i would advise people to watch this movie simply for the ending. the rest of the movie wont carry ur suspense and neither will it create a suspense, it will however have you curious but the ending will have u shocked. all questions are answers in this movie but i gave it a seven simply because the ending carried it from a 5/10 to a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Absolutely AMAZING , this is no gore flick!","Okay I lied, there is some gore!! But King and Darabond bring the thrills of the unknown and a psychologically enthralling roller coaster ride, to movie theaters near you! Rivaling the intensity of The Shining and with the creeps of 28 Days Later, I am noting this movie as one of my favorites! Incredible cinematography and sociological undertones.The characters develop with entertaining intensity and the plot thickens, the doom sets in, you feel their desperation and fear. A villain is effectively made, yet it as obvious, as you might suspect! The end of the movie isn't for Disney fans, yet a lot of moral lessons can be learned from analyzing the characters interactions. Facing adversity is a daunting task, and this movie not only inspires but renews my faith in modern Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A coarse cautionary tale of delirium,"The movie is very upfront in what it is trying to portray, but the unnatural escalation really makes it feel like a dire B-movie that doesn't care about pace and wants no one to act rational because the fear must be all-consuming and they have only a few scenes to show it with, even if the concept itself is very engrossing at the end of the day. It's really challenging to relate to or see anything but dorkiness in the present circumstances when, on day three, they are sacrificing children because there are CGI bugs outside. I'm not saying that people can't be brought to such extremes, but the movie doesn't showcase it. This isn't Lord of the Flies. They have plenty of food, and bigger bugs seemingly do not give a damn about them. Their one attack is fought off with mops and rakes. Where does the desperation to pick up torches and stab the infidels come from?All that said, as a moral lesson about not giving up hope, it sure is up there. The infamous ending is a gut punch of tremendous proportions and will stay with you despite numerous movie flaws in character writing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Astounding.,"When King hits a home run, he knocks that ball outta da PARK! And that's what he's done with The Mist. Frank Darabont really knows his stuff, and after this work, I can't help but wonder if George Luca$ and Spielberg are regretting their earlier decisions regarding Darabont's script for IJ4? But, that not withstanding, this is one compelling piece of film.It teaches many lessons, should the movie-goer care to hear; lessons like: Don't cling to dogmatic prattlings out of desperation, Don't allow your government to conduct experiments that we, the people, are not aware of (it's OUR MONEY!), Don't go through life believing that friends are failed enemies, and Don't give up without a fight...we will endure if only we demonstrate positive resolve. This film demonstrates just what happens when we possess a firm dose of negative resolve. EEE GADS!All in all? This was dark, and wonderful. It runs a bit like Storm of the Century and Maximum Overdrive in the scenario, but does NOT end like either. This ending is fantastic. It shows us what Stephen King adaptations SHOULD be...and CAN be, with the right director and dramaturgist. This is suitable for Friday/Saturday night viewing, but NOT for the kiddies! OY Vey!It rates an easy 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Basically an okay horror flick,"Well, the last ten comments are all over the map. I come down in the middle. I did read the Stephen King novella, which is the source material for this film, many years ago. It was gripping, like all of his work, whether you are into the horror genre or not. The biggest difference, aside from the ending, is that in the King work, the characters never see whatever is in the mist, only the results. The mist is otherworldly thick and opaque, more than just thick fog. And they never get the slightest clue as to where it came from. As far as this film, there were some excellent acting performances by Andre Braugher and Laurie Holden. Also by Marcia Gay Harden in a role that Ebert called ""unplayable"". The film could have benefited a lot with a better actor than Thomas Jane playing the lead. It is basically an okay horror flick, but, as usual, not nearly as good as the King story it is based on, which I realize is not always a fair criticism comparing separate media. The ending is quite powerful.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Loved this movie,"Put this on late at night after being at work all day thinking it would help me go to sleep, well it did not!!! the more the movie went on the more i got into it, and within 15 mins i was hooked.The movie is slightly cooky in some places and some characters are a bit strange, but overall this sweet film, i wont say to much but the last 20mins had me bad, the feeling and atmosphere that was created was just perfect, this movie had me thinking about it all day today and thats made me write this piece. Strange how you can watch loads of movies but only a handful you ever see touch you in certain ways. Movies like The Deliverence or Cuckoos Nest!! yes im saying that this movie had that much of an effect on me crazy eh.Any hoo best watch it yourself and make your own mind up.If you like the ending of Fulci's The Beyond you will love this.Keep it real people and don't go changing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Extremely Disturbing yet Well Made,"Before reading this review and if you're even considering seeing this movie I'm going to say this straight away; if you get queasy or are easily scarred during movies, read no further, this movie is not for you. But if you're still thinking it looks interesting, I'll tell you the plot, and then maybe you'll reconsider.This film is based on a novella by horror mastermind Stephen King, and follows a group of people who get stuck in a supermarket after a large mist covers the entire town. At first they think it's just a harmless bit of fog but they soon find out they're dead wrong. In the mist lives creatures, horrible monsters from another dimension who one by one take someone every night and kill them. But one guy played with gritty realism by newcomer Thomas Jane is determined to get out and when he does he stumbles upon unspeakable horrors.Still find it appealing? I thought not. Director Frank Darabont who made King's other books ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"" into masterpieces has created a grotesque, disturbing film about the things humans will resort to when confronted with fear. Kind of like ""Lord of the Flies"" complete with a sacrifice, which is definitely the most disturbing part in the film. And I'm not saying that this movie is badly done, no, this movie is extremely well made, and a truly horrific movie but its not because of the giant mutant bugs, but because of the characters.In this movie is a character that, without a doubt, will become the most hated villain of the year; it's a religious lady played by Marcia Gay Harden. Though it bothered me that the villain was religious she isn't religious in a Christian sense, she's a demonic extremist who believes the only way to appease the creatures is to kill the non-believers and offer them as a sacrifice. It is truly sick and twisted.So I don't recommend this film to anyone unless you're a gore-loving fanatic. And it doesn't even end happy, the end sequence is shocking and depressing and will make you leave the theater feeling in the dumps and like you've been pounded repeatedly with a sledge hammer.For entertainment value I give it 2 out of 10. But for being well made, engrossing, and truly scary I give it 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Stephen King all the way, not too original though","I really like Stephen King films, even if they're just in his storyteller's style without the story actually been his (movies like Creepy Crawlers). Townsfolk, real communities, people you can care about are usually given some room for characterizations before bad things start to happen and this one is no different.This is not the most original horror movie ever (Dawn of the Dead and The Fog come to mind among a slew of monster movies) and it's certainly not the best as some claim. The only monster we have never seen before is in the ending and it doesn't get much action. Yup, it's about monsters. And the real monsters are the humans when they're desperate and scared.It's a good, enjoyable film though with good acting. Never a dull moment and you really keep wondering...what's next. The hysteric ranting about the apocalypse does fit in well because at first it seems like they're struck with one biblical plague after another.An OK film that's worth a view if you like Stephen King films. Some mentioned Ctulhu and the story definitely seems inspired by H.P. Lovecraft at some point (won't spoil it). I would definitely love to see film adaptations of that writer. It seems King has had his share now, time to move on to a long-overlooked author.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Comically bad,"I've watched this movie for the first time in 2023 and I have to say, it did NOT age well, or maybe it was bad to begin with.Everything here is B-movie level at best - script, acting, camera work, characters, special ""effects"", the attempted tragic ending, dialogue, oh my God. If you watch it as a parody then it sort of works? I've no idea where the high ratings are coming from, there is nothing of value here.I need to fill 150 more characters, but I'm not sure what to write. I'm trying to think of a redeeming quality, but when a kid looks at mist and asks ""What's that, daddy?"", and daddy says ""Mist"", and the ""antagonist"" is a genuinely terribly rendered tentacle, and it's all a metaphor for society and religious nuts or something...Oh hey character limit met.

one of the best horror movies ever,"I liked this film a lot. It built up the suspense really well. Al of the creatures in the mist are creepy as hell. All of the scenes with these creatures are really disturbing and kept me on the edge of my seat for sure. really scary stuff. I read the novella a few years back and really liked it a lot. I was really happy to see that one of Stephen kings horror novels has transitioned well to the big screen. I really really really hope that Frank will continue to direct King's stuff. He really does it justice. With that said, i thought the ending was very good, for all you wussies out there who felt like it was sacrilegious or some BS like that. I think King's ending was good, leaving things ambiguous, but i also liked this ending too. I'm glad to see that some really good horror movies are coming out recently. I feel like this one worked perfectly in building up the horror, and it really draws you into the characters, which is essential to a horror movie if you really want to build suspense. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good horror movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Mediocre Film Based On A Fantastic Novella,"There has been  and probably will be for some time  speculation about the end of this film and how it strayed from Stephen King's novella by the same name: The Mist. There's good and bad in equal measure, depending upon your stance on Hollywood Horror versus the literary kind. But let's back-up and look at the beginning before we rush to the end...Equal parts supernatural thriller and science fiction yarn, the novella (published in 1985 in a short story collection entitled Skeleton Crew) was, well, phenomenal. It is the type of story most horror fans associate Stephen King with. Compartmentalized. Freakishly different. Plays on morality. Just flat-out good writing. King did well back in the 70s and 80s, but he has floundered as a writer in recent years with his horribly bad From A Buick 8 and the equally putrid Dreamcatcher (which was made into a very unfortunate film starring Morgan Freeman). What exactly happened to Mr. King, I'm not sure. He hadn't had his brush with death (yet) and his earlier work sent the proverbial chills up my spine (most notably the excellent The Shining and It). Regardless of past or more present works, Mr. King did get lucky with THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION in that he got Frank Darabont to write the screenplay and direct. The Shawshank Redemption has been labeled one of the top 100 films of all times by nearly every film critic in the world, and it is one of my top ten favorites. The transfer from book to film went exceptionally well, and this was in no small part thanks to Darabont's work. Darabont did similarly nice work on THE GREEN MILE, but it didn't quite reach the heights that Shawshank did. But when I saw that Darbont was attached to this film, I leapt at the chance to watch it.Needless to say (because of my cool acceptance rating), I found The Mist to be entertaining but sadly lacking in several areas. But let's start with the good...The creature effects. The combined work using CGI and stop animation was excellent. KNB EFX Group as the Special Effects crew and CafeFX doing the Visual Effects showed us some eerily nice work. The ominous cloud of mist was perfect enough to shroud any early identification of the creatures within it and the actors reacted to the mist just as you would expect.Marcia Gay Harden (INTO THE WILD) stars as Mrs. Carmody, the bible-thumping, old-testament wielding, blood-seeking, Christian hypocrite that we all enjoyed in the novella. I hated her in the novella and I hated her here, meaning that Gay Harden pulled off a very good performance.Any further positives however (save one), get blurred by the ridiculous nature of the scripted characters. Too many times we get the 'shock' effect simply for shock effect, rather than sticking with the compartmentalization of the situation (i.e., people of differing backgrounds at each others' throats in a supermarket during a crisis situation). Characters act as if they are surprised to see death and destruction after it has already been shown to them just a few hours before. People leap for weapons when a creature is nearby ready to skewer them. Main actor Thomas Jane who plays David Drayton could have been played by just about anyone, meaning that I didn't find his portrayal of this character memorable (whereas Gay Harden nailed her role) And the list goes on...Getting back to the ending  and my final positive note  I have to say that it was hampered somewhat by my enjoyment of the written word versus this visual medium. In the novella, Mr. King leaves the ending fairly ambiguous. Which I liked. I liked a lot. And here, in the film, that gets changed to a much more somber ending. Although I liked the fact that Darabont didn't sugarcoat the final act, I do think he could have kept King's original ending and added a few more fans to his legions. But let's make it perfectly clear that this ending is absolutely in-line with the true horror genre, which is why it got a semi-positive rating from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"superior to its predecessor, for viewers with a tragic sense of reality","maybe i should give it 7-8 stars only(since it is a horror movie after all even if a great one at that chapter) but i will go for 9( is just hard to me to give 10 to any horror movie), most stars accorded to the excellent production and subject matter.the acting is great too but could go unnoticed simply because you WILL get involved in the story quiet early on.to me, this movie stands out not because of its gore and ending( i am sure that will be a great incentive as well) but to its views applied on today sense of belonging, as an individual, to the social landscape. basically how would thing be (or get) IF disaster struck regardless of what or WHOM might trigger that. it has an excellent take on religion as something that human souls is very prone in misunderstanding it, based on inner-psychology, ego needs and the need for justification(S).this one might actually ""offend"" religious based groups at some level even if for a liberal mind that would not be the case at all. however this thought in itself is well explained by the actions taken by certain characters. to be blunt, at a logical level, you might either love it or hate it. i like the fact is not politically correct even a bit, it is very mind engaging, and does take a stand . the end irony (if i can call it that without spoiling it) can actually be taken both ways, but i have a feeling that will only justify ANY viewers, already made up mind, about what is going on...one thing that makes all this possible is the ""natural"" way it is lay ed out. while ""cloverfield"" tries to be too innovative( to its detriment) this one blends well old horror school with the new edge one+ does a great service to the work of Stephen King as a whole. the feature even involves a few tragic jokes( like the one referring to Mr.Fidel Castro, very sarcastic funny) that do not cause ""comic relief"" but actually enhances the reality of the situation.another thing that stands out as well is how FEAR is a natural ingredient for disaster, on top of disaster sort of speak. it is a common theme used in horror movies and books as well, but in this case it actually works since it is blend in with a normality doze of real life situations. and quiet interesting, even if you have read the book or seen the previous make, i cal almost assure you that this is not predictable and that even if you include the ""twist"" thought as ""if this way is too obvious , then it must be the opposite one"".i am sure that most of adults will like this one!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
At Least It's Not A Remake,"""The Mist"" is an enjoyable horror movie based on a story written by Stephen King. The basic premise of the plot centers on a time dimension hole that the US Army has opened up in an effort to gain access to alternate universal time dimensions. Our core characters are stranded in a rural grocery store when the Army's experiment goes awry.I was personally impressed with the production values of this film. I know a lot of people have complained about the CGI and the twist ending, but I was totally fine with both. I just don't know what audiences want from horror movie anymore. Sometimes I think movie goers are happier with slap dash horror remakes being shoved down their throats. I mean these people crying about CGI and a twist ending, get a life.Listen, the film was well made, that's it. It's not a great film by any means, but I got the feeling that both the corporate and artistic ends of this production really cared about making a quality horror film they could stand behind. True, there could have been more gore, more scares, and better monsters; but I'll take ""The Mist"" over any recent horror remake in a heart-beat.I really can't think of any substantial faults with this production. If you like Stephen King horror film adaptations, you will love this one. I like even the worst films based on King's work, but ""The Mist"" is far from the worst. In fact, it very well may be in the top five, but it will never beat Kubrick's ""Shining"". If you haven't seen this movie, ignore the negative reviews and go and watch it. If you've seen this movie and don't like it, go watch the remake of ""The Hitcher"".",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Don't go out there! There's something in the mist!""","Even after all these years, Stephen King's material continues to be an ever-flowing source of terrific horror entertainment. Based on his novella, The Mist is one freaky, thrilling, and terrifying experience that pits a handful of people (and by extension, the audience) against a plethora of some of the scariest and most unnatural monsters imaginable. The film really hammers the fear into the audience, as characters suffer some rather frightening encounters and horrific deaths. It gets even more unnerving as characters bicker and fight amongst themselves. There are some cases where you might get wound up by the characters' infighting, but it'll be the film's ending which will prove to be the most polarizing aspect. While the novella just ended inconclusively, the film pulls out one heck of an ironic twist in the last moments; it is a cold, brutal, hard-hitting finale that you'll either love or hate (and it'll either make or break the film for you).The story is pretty simple, and not much different than something like Dawn of the Dead; it just swaps out zombies with Lovecraftian monsters. What really makes it work is, first of all, the characters, who are all adequately developed and full of emotional intensity. You get a good feeling for who these people are and how intense their struggle for survival really is. In light of such adversity, the film also does an excellent job of underscoring the themes of civil order as it breaks down. The film ultimately becomes a microcosm depicting the end of the world, not overrun by hellish monsters necessarily, but overrun by a primal cult of irrational and fearful human beings. Between the scary monsters and the crazed humans, I couldn't tell you which one is scarier.The film has quality photography and editing. Acting is pretty swell, and the writing matches up pretty well with the original story. This production makes the best use of its sets, props, and costumes. Some of the special effects don't hold up very well, but are imaginatively rendered. Music is pretty decent.With its surprise ending, you'll either love or hate this film. I for one love it, and consider it one of the best Stephen King adaptations to date.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"neat story with some great moments but mediocre CGI, excessive preachiness, and terrible pacing nearly ruin the experience","This movie really only had three big flaws: Marcia Gay Harden, bad CGI, and pacing. By Marcia I don't mean the actress herself - she's great - but her character is immensely annoying, which I know was intended, but her monologues stretch gratuitously and seem innumerable. By bad CGI I mean, it isn't SyFy Channel bad but you'd have hoped for better. Pacing wise, we go an entire hour without seeing much except a few tentacles. Fortunately though, except for Marcia's character, everyone supplies enough tension, chemistry, and entertaining interactions to carry you through, on top of, of course, the suspense of the unknown. Thomas Jane gets most of my praise here, superb throughout, and so were most; but good golly the movie drags and drags in places, especially toward the end. To my understanding it was very faithful to the original novella, except the ending; which is one of my favorite bits about the flick. A low 7 for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Above Average Horror Fare,"Stephen king now bestrides the horror genre as a colossus and this cinematic interpretation of his novel is a fine one. Although all the thematic devices are obviously there, the screenplay by Frank Darabont provides a pleasing intelligence adding a further credit to his prior successes with the Green Mile and the Shawshank Redemption.The formula is well concocted. The unexplained mist that descends on a backwater town comes with the same menace as John Carpenters ""The Fog"". A supermarket provides both a refuge, and a prison for those engulfed, echoing Carpenters ""Assault on Precinct 13"", whilst the crazed antics of the assailants and their victims are reminiscent of Romero's work.Thomas Jane is a convincing lead as hero David Drayton with Laurie Holden offering the glamour and a mother figure for Drayton's young son who is also trapped.The stand out performance however is by supporting actress by Marcia Harden as Mrs Carmody playing a fundamentalist Christian convinced that Armageddon is upon them and whipping up a ""Witches of Salem"" hysteria.The CGI is largely convincing, the suspense well created, and the gore sufficient for aficionados of the genre whilst not being used as an easy substitute for dramatic tension.The only let down is the ending. just before it I reflected that a certain ending wold be both childishly amusing, and preposterous - and then it happened!Nonetheless the previous 125 minutes more than compensate for this.

So bad I had to tell you about it,"I read a lot of reviews before going to see this movie, good and bad and I took them at face value. Now I am convinced the good reviews are nearly all fake. I feel cheated, so here is a real review.I really like Stephen King and I was looking forward to an unusual story with a couple twists and turns. It's unusual for sure, but the plot wears thin very quickly, as we quickly learn there isn't one, other than that the cast are trapped in a supermarket surrounded by a bizarre mist and outside there are creepy crawlies who kill people mercilessly if they come outside.The point of story (I think) is to show how mob mentality develops and how a scared crowd will follow anybody who can explain something terrifying they don't understand. In actual fact the characters are just way too over the top to suspend disbelief. The silly arguments just add to the tedium, and on occasion they are so contrived they provoke laughter.The tempo is slow and there were plenty of yawns from the audience. For those who stick it out, there is a twist at the end, and it's never been done before (with good reason), but frankly, it doesn't do the story any favours. The ending is just too bad to describe.

For those that are unaware, Darabont wrote and directed the Stephen King adaptations The Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile and now he brings to us The Mist, which is ironically a return to roots for Frank Darabont who started out writing on 80s horror B Movies. The Mist is a film about a group of townsfolk whose town becomes engulfed by a terrifying cloud that traps them inside a glass-fronted convenience store. The cloud contains strange creatures and various monsters that could quite easily kill the humans, should the mist make its way into the building.As the characters converse inside the building they are forced to get along as best they can, shades of Lord of the Flies springs to mind and, characterized by their behavior, they begin to take sides and split into factions. Superbly written and wonderfully acted, all the characters portray a sense of realism that is rarely captured when trying to represent such hostile environments. Furthermore, being that we live in an age when reality TV and manufactured environments are created to imprison volunteers for the amusement of others, a film like The Mist has more bearing on our conscious than perhaps the makers envisaged. This connotation with contemporary sources of entertainment provides the audience with the ability to register and humanize with the townsfolk much more easily allowing for their dilemmas and disagreements to have an increased impact, which in turn intensifies the horrific nature of their circumstances.The best performance of the film is by Marcia Gay Harden, who plays Mrs. Carmody, a religious nut that achieves a leadership through her constant preaching. The manner in which she plays Mrs. Carmody leads me to believe that she is a much underrated actress as during this film I truly despised her. The anti-religious notions that are ever present throughout the film are tainted with malevolent undertones and fanatical ideologies that brilliantly portray a level of fear rarely touched upon in contemporary horror. The Mist tells of religion as being fundamental to some peoples grasp of hope and that with it even the most apparently sane individuals will result in ""lynching"" others to achieve savior. It is an austere representation of religion that serves as a reminder to us all of its capabilities. The fact that the religion being pilloried in The Mist is Christianity has been dwelled upon too much by some critics, this choice of religion is merely fitting given the films location and setting, any other choice would have been inappropriate.The Mist is a fine cult horror, so much so that it does not deserve to be viewed in a cinema. It is a film that would play out much better watched at home on your own TV. It is an intellectual film that will no doubt cause debate to ensue following the final reels. Ultimately, and as with previous Darabont ventures, the film is about hope. Its narrative is strongly embedded in the characters belief that there may be way out of their predicament and that their fate is not yet sealed. This is beautifully illustrated at one point in the film when one of the groups, which have emerged from the townsfolk, must make the decision of either staying with the brainwashed, or venturing into the outside mist; it is a choice of facing one of two fears  fellow humans or the unknown. Their fate sealed if they stay, but perhaps not if they leave.The film is pessimistic in its outlook and serves as wonderful reminder of the importance of hope to us all. The ending has gained a lot of criticism, but I believe it to be by far one of the best endings to a film I have seen in a long time. After it had finished the despair and anguish I felt was in direct correlation with the characters and the story, thus the film had achieved its goal. I whole heartedly admire a director that has the courage to go against a studios wishes and audience expectations and provide an ending that is a bleak and daunting as the 120 minutes that have preceded it. Frank Darabont has stuck with the continuity of the narrative themes and left us with perhaps the starkest metaphor for hope ever to grace contemporary cinema.Finally, The Mist is a contemporary B Movie, which is no surprise given Darabonts history in the area but also it is a wonderful social commentary that so happens to take its shape in a horror film, that also happens to be a Stephen King adaption. After seeing The Mist, Darabont has gone up a notch in my estimations as a director and writer. I thoroughly recommend The Mist to anyone that likes to leave a film feeling depressed, but immensely satisfied.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""It appears we may have a problem of some magnitude.""","FILM: 7.0
Rewatching The Mist, I find myself drawn once again into the strange and eerie world of Stephen King's imagination. Frank Darabont and Stephen King often make a fantastic duo, but while this collaboration isn't their strongest, it's still a thrilling addition to King's movie adaptations.I notice that Darabont leans heavily into an old-school monster movie vibe. The atmosphere of the film reminds me of those classic black-and-white horror movies. Although the version I watched is in colour, the black-and-white version that's also available is an equally fantastic experience. The setting, a small-town supermarket surrounded by an impenetrable mist, provides the perfect backdrop for the chaos that ensues.One of the film's strengths is its focus on the horrors that arise from within humanity itself, rather than just the creatures lurking outside. Darabont explores how fear and paranoia can transform ordinary people into something monstrous. This element of the film really resonates with me, adding depth to the narrative and making the stakes feel even higher.I can't deny that the film is packed with suspense and atmosphere. Every creak, groan, and shadowy figure in the mist keeps me guessing about what's going to happen next. It's a film that knows how to build tension effectively, and I find myself genuinely invested in the characters' plight.The ending of The Mist is both harrowing and heartbreaking, leaving me with a mix of emotions. Thomas Jane's performance as the lead character is generally solid, but I can't help but notice that some of his acting choices lead to unintentional humour in the final intense scene. Despite this, the film's conclusion still packs a punch and stays with me long after the credits roll.Overall, The Mist is a chilling and thought-provoking horror film. While it might not be the best Darabont-King collaboration, it is still an enjoyable rewatch that offers a unique take on the genre.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.0

Fear Changes Everything,"After a violent storm attacks a town in Maine, an approaching cloud of mist appears the next morning. As the mist quickly envelops the area, a group of people get trapped in a local grocery store-among them, artist David Drayton and his five-year-old son. The people soon discover that within the mist lives numerous species of horrific, unworldly creatures that entered through an inter-dimensional rift, which may or may not have been caused by a nearby military base. As the world around them manifests into a literal hell-on-earth, the horrified citizens try desperately to survive this apocalyptic disaster.""The Mist"" is one of those movies people won't ever want to watch a second time. No, it's not the reason that the movie is bad. It's the fact that this film may take a toll on you. It did to me. I'm pretty sure I'm so emotionally drained from this movie, that I wish I would've never seen this film. ""1408,"" another Stephen King adaptation does the same thing, but not in the same level as this film.With that as a huge warning before seeing the film, I liked the film a lot. You might've heard things before seeing the movie, like the horrible ending people are keep talking about. Well, the ending could be the most worst thing to have ever happened on screen or the most realistic. I choose realistic. Most would pick the other and I really don't blame them.One can see a similarity between this film and ""Lord of the Flies."" In fact, I think Stephen King wrote ""The Mist"" inspired by ""Lord of the Flies."" It wouldn't surprise me. Horror movies these days don't include scenes that happen in ""The Mist."" The characters in here are all great, each played well by each cast member. The movie focuses away on the ""things"" outside the mist and focuses more on the ""breaking apart"" of a once civilized population, just like ""Lord of the Flies.""The violence and gore are still there. There are enough to make a horror fan happy. The special effects are great, in my opinion. Frank Darabont, once again, does not disappoint with a brilliant film. I found the cinematography strange and unique. You'll see why once you see the film. But to anyone who wants to see this film, I am warning you that it's a dark piece of film which portrays everything, in my opinion, realistically, and will emotionally drain you to death.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Instant Classic! Pleasant surprise! Darabont & King rule!,"I went to see this movie on a day when I just wanted to go out. I didn't expect much. I was pleasantly surprised. This is a fantastic horror movie. It has everything a fan could want in it: great visual effects, creepy mood, scares, suspense, dramatic tension, & a few delightful surprises & twists. I genuinely got caught up in the mood and was scared! One word of advice, to get the full effect, you'll want to see it on a BIG SCREEN -- either, in the theater or on a High Definition Big Screen TV. That way, the atmosphere will surround you and you'll enjoy the full effect of the horror; the same goes for SOUND. This is one of those pictures when surround sound really makes a difference, adding to the feeling of claustrophobia and being ""surrounded"" by a dangerous evil. It is directed flawlessly. The director, Frank Darabont, works well with Mr. King and elevates the story to top quality in every respect. Darabont, as a filmmaker, has a way of visualizing things which is equal to King's power as a writer. Their 3 projects together so far (Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and The Mist) testify to this. I found it as enjoyable as I did ""The Green Mile,"" their last collaboration. The DVD is #1 on my Wish List. This movie does not disappoint. I consider it an instant classic & must see. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""This"" is a real horror movie","You know these high-budget lots of effected and scary sounded horror movies? These are like somebody hides behind the door and says ""BOO!"" when you showed up or somebody wears a scary Halloween costume with a scary makeup. No, that's not it.This is a real horror movie adapted from the book of a horror genius Stephen King with all respect. This movie respects the influence Stephen King wanted to make, and until the end, it scares the hell out with only its story and realistic shots even if you see it in the morning.Next, it welcomes you with gripping scene flows, and an astonishing ending, which makes a lot of sense.The needs, feelings, egoism and psychology of humanity shows itself in every way, and even in this hard situation, thoughts of men separate one from other. Denying, religious, brave thoughts show themselves with all of their mistakes, and none of these thoughts are perfect or strictly mistake.The decisions are not the one, which saves people's lives. It's coincidence and luck as in the real world.This is a wonderful, realistic and very well adapted movie, which will not make you regret for any other ordinary horror movie, you will not forget it.10/10 -> Excellent!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
'Mist' fogged with revelation.,"The Mist/2007/***Main Stars: David Drayton: Thomas Jane Mrs. Carmody: Marcia Gay Harden Amanda Dumfries: Laurie HoldenThis is from the mind of Stephen King, not Frank Darabont. Although Darabont adapted this into his own film, this is based on a novella by Stephen King. So, if you think this film is a typical stupid horror film seen dozens of times a year, think again. The true horror is not in the monster, the bug, or the animal; it is in the people. Yes It is true this film has monsters with tentacles, weird looking heads, strange eyes, a bunch of legs, deformed bodies basically gross-out pieces of crap. That is typical in every stupid gimmicky cheap horror flick. This has all those things plus grotesque scenes with the people. But it also has something deeper. The people themselves: what they think and how they act.It took me a while to whip up a star rating, but I finally gave it three stars for not only its effort in directing, performances, etc. but the chilling truth of it all. Not the bugs. But the people and how circumstances like these are taken. This is a truly chilling film in ways.Just what is the premise? Actually, it is very simple. A strange collaboration of mist reverberates throughout a town. Within the mist are creatures. That could have been worded better but oh well. These creatures in the mist basically have no purpose of even living. Practically all they do is kill what they HEAR. If they hear the humans they kill. Easy, right? So how is it possible to make a feature-length film with that lame premise? Well, concentrating on the charactersThe main character David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is the one this movie circles around. Drayton is an artist. He creates movie posters for a studio, is a married man and has a kid. Unfortunately, the mist comes after a violent storm, and after a while he, his kid, and all the other characters we will soon know are trapped in a convenience store. We soon get used to the store as being the home for the characters. So that's settled. However, this convenience store isn't as convenient as it seems. Unfortunate events happen, people get killed. It's realistic but it's also not. It's confusing sometimes when you think about it. Stephen King messes with your mind. Even though he had nothing to do with the production of this film besides being the guy that Darabont snatched the idea from, I just can't help but feel that he is all over this. It's disturbing in a way and so is the film. So deep but yet not hard to comprehend, probably not hard to create either. Although he messes with your mind and emotions or tries to anyway, his stories aren't extremely complicated. They are actually kind of juvenile. But it's what he puts inside that is truly deep.The character we seem to hate as soon as we see is the crazy bible thumper Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden). She is insane, truly. She continues throughout the film to smash the bible and its words in the peoples' faces. It causes people to get stressed out. She thinks this is all how God wanted it to happen. She is bible crazy, overly dramatic about every event and expects it to happen the way the bible words it in Revelations. Harden is brilliant here as Carmody. She played her part so well I actually thought she was really insane. Very convincing. Or if someone just walked on the set he or she would probably think she was truly out of her mind. Actually, all the parts were played very well. Not one bad actor/actress present. Even Drayton's kid played his part to perfection.Someone we begin to like is Amanda Dumfries (Laurie Holden), who begins to develop a friendship with David and take care of his kid. The actress is great and played her role so well. The entire film is convincing, wonderfully acted, well done!But I can't give it any more than three stars. Something tells me we have all seen this before. It reminds me a lot of John Carpenter's The Fog but that was a two star at most film. This is better but still not excellent. Something continues to tell me that this has been brought about before, the beginning, the middle and even the ending, which was very good by the way. Some people disagree and thought it was too much to handle. Come on people, it's a film.Perhaps this has been made before. Not just The Fog, or this storyline or even the people. Maybe the whole thing has been talked about before. Maybe it truly has been written (implied) in the pages of the bible and preached by bible enthusiasts throughout the world.Movie directed by Frank Darabont.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I love it! Best Stephen King movie ever!,"I will start by how I found out of this movie. I talked to a friend at school who bought this movie cheap on a gas station. He said it was okay, but he really hated the ending. I just couldn't believe that an ending of a movie could be that a annoying. He nearly screamed till he turned red because of the ending. I will not spoil it, but the ending is just amazing. It makes this movie truly brilliant because it's no mainstream movie. Some people will say the ending sucks, but it doesn't. I can't believe why this movie has such a low rating. It should have been on the top list of IMDb.com.The movie starts out quite good and I think the monsters of the movie was not very good CGI, but they looked awesome like tentacles and big ugly flies and spiders, quite inventive monsters. There were some gore effects I loved and the actors were good too.

How could you sum up what happened in the US during the past 7 years any better ? A nice movie so far, but now the parts that are not that good... Maybe it's a bit conservative, but i don't believe a good horror movie's made of fancy animations (and by the way, in this movie they SUCK) or big and evil monsters. It's supsence, suspense that makes a good horror movie. And suspense is the exact thing this movie hasn't got. Several bloody slaughter scenes, some anxious shock moments.. don't get me wrong, i like splatter movies, but this ain't one... the one thing that doesn't make me give this movie a 5 or worse, is the ending... boy, what an ending! don't wanna spoiler it, but i'd say the movie is worth watching because of the ending alone..",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing - a message of hope,"Simply amazing. I too watch dozens of films a month. Every once in a while I come across a truly amazing gem. This was one of those gems.This wasn't a film about horror. The horror veil is there merely as a medium for King's work, as other posters have iterated. It was a message, a glimpse as it were, of our own society in one of its darkest moments. The entire broad spectrum of humanity played out in this one single film. Bravo! to the director, screenwriter and all the other people involved for a brilliant adaptation of a story I must read one day.Day to day life is nothing more than one ""challenge"" after the other. How we deal with these challenges, is what define us as human beings. What keeps us going, from challenge to challenge, is hope. Steven King's message to us was a simple one - never lose it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not too darned bad ...,"Adaptations of books are almost never up to the same quality as the source material, which is why this movie pleasantly surprised me.Horror or shock movies seem to work best before the big *reveal*. Once the creature, or alien or whatever is shown on screen, there is an unavoidable disappointment, because what the human imagination creates is almost always more terrifying that what appears on screen. Jaws being a prime example. Scary as heck when all you see is someone being pulled under water; not so scary when you're watching a mechanical shark munch on a boat.This story, by its very nature, rarely encounters this. Mist hides rather than reveals, which gives the movie makers ample opportunities for things to jump out and grab someone, just to vanish again. It works best when sticking to this formula.There is also an interesting psychological component to the story, taken straight from the novella. Everyone is under intense strain and everyone reacts to it in different ways, with most people grasping what little control they still have. Marcia Gay Harden portrays a bible thumping lunatic (one of Stephen King's favorite caricatures) who convinces a number of others that this is the end of days and that they need to make right with God. Another group is positive that there are no creatures in the mist and that the others are scaring themselves into delusion. This exploration helps move the movie beyond the standard kill/die/survive themes of most modern horror.The movie is not perfect. The momentum does flag a bit in the middle and the when the makers do show the monsters, they reek of CGI. And then the much talked about ending. I should mention that I was very fond of the non-ending that King penned, so I may be a bit biased, but the movie seemed to try too hard for a ""you'll never see this coming!"" Unfortunately I did.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Since then how many innocent lives have been sacrificed to appease the Moloch our leaders have made us believe in? how much have we surrendered of our freedom and our rights into the hands of others we thought might give us some solace and guidance in dark times? and how terribly we have been deceived! The Mist has not been lifted yet, and it does not hover over only one country, over America only, it enshrouds us all and it bids us enter it and see for ourselves and take our chances rather than believing in the messiah next door.

Highly recommended,"I confess that I am not the biggest fan of Stephen King, but I have read a number of his books, which for the most part I find entertaining and fun, but usually not all that thought provoking.Most of the time, that is. I was, however, quite impressed with the film adaptations of Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption, and I did not realize that the same director, Frank Darabont was responsible for this film as well. Apparently Mr. Darabont and Mr. King bring out the best in one another. This film is advertised as a horror film, and it does work very well as a horror film, on a level similar to The Birds or The Thing (there is a poster from the latter film in the first scene of Mist that serves as a kind of homage, if you are familiar with the John Carpenter poster from the remake, and I'm certain we were meant to notice it). Having had a couple of hours to digest The Mist, I have to say I was much more impressed with the film as a kind of allegory, or statement about humanity. It serves as an excellent example of how we treat each other, secretly or even openly respond to opinions of others, and the animosities that we often hide from each other just below the surface.Just as in the films The Birds and The Thing, a cross-section of people with various backgrounds, in this case, blacks, whites, teachers, artists, religious fanatics, working class Joes, etc, are trapped together, isolated from the rest of the world. They need to trust each other and work with each other to survive. Because of their lack of trust and unwillingness to work together, however, this may prove impossible. I think it is an excellent statement about the times in which we live and I believe as time goes on, this film will be seen as a classic. Check it out, by all means and see what you think. If you have an open mind, it should give you a great deal to think about.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

In Conclusion,"I've come to the conclusion that many of the reviews at imdb are written by incels, British teens, and those who think Stephen King writes great literature. How else does one explain those who praise and celebrate mediocrity so consistently? The Mist isn't a terrible movie, but it isn't great either. It's always nice to see Thomas Jane shirtless (however briefly) and I was especially thrilled when the religious nutjob finally got hers, but the too disturbing ending is what one remembers most. The surviving characters deserved better. There are surprise endings and then there are endings that turn one off to a film. Also, since King often steals his ideas from other stories, it's obvious that he stole the idea for The Mist from John Carpenter's The Fog. I prefer vengeful ghost-pirates to giant mutant bugs created, of course, by the military.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A visceral, nerve-rattling apocalypse.","I read the Stephen King novella some 25 years ago and it was already gripping back then in its effective, ""Dawn of the dead""-like simplicity (a large group of people gets trapped inside a supermarket as a mysterious mist surrounds them with unspeakable terrors lurking inside it). But to actually expand, extend and IMPROVE it, was beyond my wildest expectations, as Darabont turns this horror-fantasy tale into a visceral, nerve-rattling apocalypse. The supernatural monsters are quite impressively scary (if a bit too CGI-graphic...), but they almost pale in comparison to its human counterparts as the panic mounts with a religious loony in the crowd. There is a truly terrifying human sacrifice scene which will haunt me for a long time... Knowing it was written in the 80's also answers some modern obvious plot questions (umm - anyone got a cell phone?).A bit long, but thumbs up for really going for the throat and daring to be merciless with its characters to the very end!

The Mist is an excellent film that speculates on human nature during a supernatural crisis,"As a plume of mysterious Mist from a lake approaches a small town several dozen people find themselves trapped in a grocery store. The last man to enter the store has blood streaming from his nose and claims hysterically that there is ""something in the Mist"". What I liked most about this movie was watching how different people react to a crisis that has no logical explanation. On one hand, you have a group of people who think rationally and refuse to believe something supernatural is occurring even when faced with evidence. On the other hand, you have a fearful group, led by a religious fanatic, who will now believe anything that is preached to them (which I think reflects truthfully on how people, in the real world, can be controlled if enough fear is instilled in them). Watching these groups argue, scream, and fight (sometimes quite violently) with each other is very interesting because it speculates on how people would behave in a frightening and inexplicable situation with no outside communication. This movie reminded me a little of the novel ""Lord of the Flies"" because it portrays how human behavior degenerates when isolated from society. As for the ending, it could be described as shocking, sad, or just plain stupid (possibly laughable). But I, for one, liked it. Mainly because I thought it was atypical and unpredictable.

"Decent horror flick, for King's fans and more.","It is surprisingly gory. Even the CGI don't diminish that factor. I was expecting something more psychological than horror, and was surprised it was both.

The build up is neatly paced, there aren't too much talk or parts where writers are too obvious, about their intentions. I say it's straight to the point, in all the genre the movie touches upon. But it's not one I prefer either. I had a good time watching it, and getting into the story. Even though I already knew how the movie ended, it still caught me off guard to see how it played out.

And definitely strikes the right kinds of fear in the audience, and draws interest to how this diverse group of people, will deal with this unexplained and unknown danger. You can tell that every cast member has put their best skills into this. Starting with Thomas Jane in the role of a fearful father, trying to protect his only son, and Marcia Harden, trying to, do what she does.There are two things which have (in my opinion) made this movie far less interesting to watch, and not exploit this awesome idea to its fullest potential. The first thing being cinematography, which i think is to blame for every line that seems like a cliché, and every shot that feels like composition 101. And I'm not even talking about graphics. which is ""a pinch over acceptable"", and truly suits a B movie. The second thing is the ""science vs religion"" thing, which this movie gradually develops into. It's a big distraction from the real problem and draws the focus towards what's inside, as opposed to the actual problem of what's outside. I've re-watched this movie many times, and every time i tried my best to forget about its flaws. This is a good movie with an ingenious idea asking for a better remake.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best twist ending of all time.,"Headline says it all. The only movie I've seen in theaters where people cheered and gasped out loud from everything that happened. This movie is my favorite movie of all time. The seclusion, the atmosphere, the love and hate you have got the characters. Phenomenal in every way.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good Movie, Stupid Ending","This has got to be one of the worst endings I have seen in my WHOLE LIFE!!! It makes the movie a waste to watch and it's depressing and also disturbing! The movie was good in general but the ending ruined it!!! Stephen King is an excellent writer and a genius story teller, but this movie doesn't make him look good. The movie is very gory and disturbing at times. A ton of profanity!!! Watch out parents!!!!! The horror factor out of 10 is about a.... 7. It really isn't scary but very scary images!!! But still, it is a great movie other the the ending. I just want to warn all you readers that the ending almost ruins the whole movie! In conclusion, great movie, horrible ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
So Close,"Now, I know this review will be lost in the extraordinarily large number already given, however, I want to warn you before you read into this. This film is good but you don't want to watch it just before you go to bed. You will likely be kept awake for a while thinking on human stupidity, and maybe the movie as well.***From this point on there WILL be spoilers. This is a review, not an opinion, (Though I think that slipped a little.)***'The Mist' is a good film, yet like many before it's fatal flaws dig into me as a viewer. Primarily the characters. When I watch a movie I want to be drawn into it's world. ""I want believe."" When elements like such as wooden characters and stubborn script writing pull me out of the rabbit hole, I don't tend to be all that happy with it. But, for any critique I can place on it, I would prefer to say the good things first.The first half hour was near perfect. A small neighbour-based dilemma and some terrific tension building. I enjoy a leadership powerfully in a survival situation, which is what this film is entirely based around for and hour and 55 minutes. Yes, that leaves the last 5 in a two hour horror story.When it gets into it's defense phase of the story, it was awesome. The CGI was actually pretty good, not I would expect any less. Violent death ensues throughout the film as one would expect. It even did something few movies do that others may only hint at. It offers some answers and keeps then moderately vague. The sci-fi element was great. The social commentary was, I believe, pretty accurate. You may believe what you will but I feel that in an unknown crisis people will do what they did and start to get primitive and sacrificial.That, I'm afraid, is where the realistic approach to an unrealistic situation ends. In this film there are two major downfalls: character reactions and the ending, which is also an unrealistic reaction to a situation. In every situation the characters are tossed head first into, they do two things. The first, they scream. OK. Alright. Horror movie. Screaming? Covered. The second being that they don't run from creatures far superior to mop handles. A dude loses a chunk of leg and dies. Another gets face melted and eaten. Fine, but why did this happen? Because they tried to use 12 bullets, an absurdly blunt fire axe and sticks to fight when there was clearly no point. Why didn't they run? Oh, right, it's just a movie.When someone like me sees a flaw and the only real explanation is, ""it's just a movie,"" then something somewhere has gone terribly wrong. Probably the script. Yeah, it's the script. So this guy, this group of seemingly level headed morons are allowed to gawk at a dude with alien bugs in him, (thanks, 'Alien', we owe you one) but there is no excuse to getting two people killed for a dumb engagement. Run! No one will blame you.When the religious madwoman manages to conjure up a following of everyone but eight supposedly smart people and a kid until they sacrifice an innocent guy and demand they kill the kid, and the ""whore"", and then all of the 'willful' people, the eight leave. They hop in a car, losing four more. They drive away to some LOTR style epic/dramatic music. Everything's all cool. They even see a creature like the ones Godzilla had to fight in 2014... Huh. Then they run out of juice. Lo and behold, four bullets are left in the gun.The last four (plus one child) decide instantly to kill themselves. Huh. I thought these were the willful, stand up to the religious guys. There was no, ""Oh, should we fight, go it on foot, or should we, the smart ones, just give it all up and kill ourselves, cause that's the smart thing to do that goes against the whole law of nature. You know, that one about survival of the fittest even though we are the fittest of them all?"" No, just, ""Gun? Coo. Let's all die. Rather than lining a pair of heads so the main character whose name we've all forgotten can also die before the tanks come around and the mist magically vanishes."" That's their first thought. Just give up. Fine, try for an ending like 'The Thing' in the dumbest way possible. Sure, they couldn't get away that made sense. This was JUST ******* DUMB. I can't begin to describe how much that ending made me hate the rest of movie.But I digress. This is what I think the conclusion is meant to sound like: This is a good movie will science fiction elements, well made CGI and some genuine horror for some people. However, it's predictable,painful to watch at times and suffers from dull characters who barely seem to know right from, judging by the way no one seems to know where the exits are to run. While some may benefit from their endeavour to watch this film, others among you will despise it. I give it an 'A' for effort, 'B' for CGI, 'C' for the poor acting of some of the extras and even some of the secondary cast and a solid 'D' for displaying backwards human reactions to clearly hopeless fights. Defending the store was fine when there was no where to run, but otherwise poor effort. They really didn't care about and organised defense, did they? Oh well, religious nuts will be religious nuts when they aren't gagged to prevent idiocy and blind faith in what seem to be empty human shaped shells waiting to be filled with bible references. And a 'B-' for social commentary.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just normal panic movie,"These days I have watched films from Stephan King and since now I almost enjoyed it. However this movie is like nothing special one. I feel like this is panic movie with monsters from point of horror movie. Maybe it contains also some topic like religion and science. This super nature phenomena was occurred by scientific incidence and people regard it as the religional thing. It seems interesting, but if so, I wish there would be more details about that. This movie has too much elements in just 2 hours and maybe I could not understand them at once.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"In short, potent viewing.","I really got a kick out of this one! Based on a novel by Stephen King, and filtered through the lens of the director of the Walking Dead, this feature sticks the spotlight on a group of townsfolk holed-up in a supermarket to avoid the extradimensional invaders outside. Despite the b-movie premise, this film is elevated by some memorable, enthusiastic performances (check out Marcia Gay Harden as Bible-thumping Mrs Carmody), and an excellent psychological edge which sets the townsfolk against each other. Indeed, the herd mentality and fanaticism of the townsfolk poses just as existential a threat to our protagonists as the creatures intent on eviscerating them (so much so, I hoped the invaders made chili con carne out of most of them).Oh, yes...after two tense hours, the movie has a conclusion that kicks you in the teeth---twice!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Only for the guy who compared it to Shawshank Redemption,"I just read some IMDb reviewer saying this movie didn't go well on theaters because of it's dark ending...just like Shawshank Redemption. Well, I must say it doesn't make any justice, to say the least, to compare Shawshank Redemption to THIS movie.This movie, is nothing but just the average thriller from today. It has it all: plain stereotypes, some very superficial ""existencial"" dialogs, CGI monsters that can't scare a 5yo girl these days and some annoying plot holes. It's far from ""some of the best"" speech.And what does it have of any good? Well, the lead actors and actresses are very good. It's decently directed and nicely shot. It's twisted, dark ending it's surely a plus, certainly the most interesting part of the movie.So, that's it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Mist"" the Point","I had a 5-hour layover in Hartford recently, during which time I purchased Cheddar Chex-Mix, Grape flavored Dasani water, and a paperback of Stephen King's ""The Mist,"" which I enjoyed thoroughly, as I do with most King books. He paces his action well enough that the jolts of excitement and terror come at just the right moments in increasing ferocity until he reaches a mind-blowing climax and a fitting conclusion.So, naturally I was eager to see Frank Darabont's adaptation, having seen nothing but good things from this talented screenwriter/director. And yet, I come back from the theater disappointed, something I was praying not to be in the times between the action sequences. I did like the movie and audiences will too, but my opinion of it sank like a rock during the last five minutes; the ending was completely botched.But onto the good: After a storm for the record books, in which trees fell on and through houses, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his son take a trip to the supermarket to pick up supplies, bringing his not-so-neighborly neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher) along and noting the unusual mist forming over the lake, coming ever closer...And then, as promised, we get the monsters. They come in droves, of all shapes and sizes, inspired by the creepy-crawlies that haunt children's dreams and their parents' pantries. Though sometimes the CGI seems out of place, most of the time it works quite well, and sometimes what we do not see is much scarier, as the mist only allows about five feet of visibility. It is a most impressive mist, flowing just unnaturally enough to make one uneasy about breathing, touching, or even looking at it.Even more impressive than that, however, are the performances. All of the characters seem genuine in their motivations as they go from confused to scared, panicked to fanatic. Norton's denial of the entire situation seems a little contrived, but I'll forget that in a heartbeat when I see the religious insanity of Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), which translates so well from the book that what sympathy I felt for David and his posse I felt double in hatred for her.So, good performances, great story, nice special effects, terrible ending. I would not dream of ruining either this film or the book for anyone, although those who have read the book will find a reference to the ending in the first paragraph of this review, but I will say this: King concludes his novella with a self-described ""Hitchcock Ending,"" one fitting enough to satisfy an audience but still open to interpretation, aka ""The Birds."" Now, however, Darabont feels the need to tie everything together, and with the sacrifice of that conclusion, the movie is left without a point. Looking back, though, the movie works as a whole, but I wish that I had walked out about five minutes earlier.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Actually pretty decent for its age,Mr King the horror legend has done it again. Let me start of with the mist is an absolute masterpiece it really explains the human instincts once it has lost its way. We resort back to our primal instincts and it portrays it in this movie very well. The cgi is subpar and average but i have to remember it is early 2000s and there for I can't judge to harshly seeing its 2024. The storyline and shocking but awesome ending leaves you wanting more.. wanting it to go a little longer. Find out what's really in the mist. There's so much mystery to this movie. Overall it was fantastic and one to definitely watch if you haven't seen it already.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
